These two prayers are found in the book of Ephesians, a deep, high, and profound book. This profound book covers mainly one matter-the church. The church is the deepest matter in the Bible. It is not something superficial, shallow, or easy to realize. Today the term the church has been used in a wrong way. When people refer to the church, what do they mean? To many the church is something common. Some may even consider that the church is a material building, but according to the Bible, the church is the deepest matter. We have to be in the deepest part of our being, our spirit, to know the church. All of us, especially the young brothers and sisters, have to know something that is not merely for our enjoyment, our salvation, or our building up. We have to know the church, the deepest matter in the Bible. Because the church is so deep, the apostle prayed for us to know this matter. We need the apostle&#8217;s prayer to see the church.<h2 class=head2>The Need for Both Revelation and Experience</h2><p>We need to consider what Paul covered in these two prayers. In the first prayer, he prayed for a spirit of wisdom and revelation that we could see the church (Eph. 1:17-23). This prayer is for a spirit that can see, a spirit of revelation, and even a revealing spirit. We need such a spirit to see the church. Many may have a common or superficial understanding concerning the church, but it is not a simple or superficial matter. We should not consider that we understand the matter of the church thoroughly. The church is the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4), and we need a revelation to see it.<p>In Paul&#8217;s second prayer (3:16-21), he prayed for the strengthening of our inner man. This is related to our experience. His first prayer is for the seeing, the enlightening, the revealing, and the other is for strengthening. First, we need the revelation that we may see the things concerning this mystery. Then after seeing, we need to get into, to experience, what we have seen. In other words, the first prayer is a prayer for revelation, and the second is a prayer for experience. In the book of Ephesians, both the revelation and the experience are for the church.<h2 class=head1>A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION</h2><h2 class=head2>The Human Spirit</h2><p>In the first prayer, Paul prays, &#8220;That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom&#8221; (1:17). This does not mean that God would give you the Holy Spirit. The word spirit in this verse is not capitalized, indicating that this is the human spirit. To see the mystery of Christ (3:4), the church, requires more than just having a smart mind. A smart mind may be good for the university, but the mind alone can never realize the mystery of the church. To see the church, we need our human spirit.<p>God did not create us in a simple way. According to 1 Thessalonians 5:23, man is of three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body. Our human body is very complex. Medical doctors spend many years studying medicine, yet they still do not understand the human body thoroughly. The psychological part of our being is called the soul, composed of the mind (Psa. 13:2; 139:14; Lam. 3:20), the emotion (S. S. 1:7; 2 Sam. 5:8; Isa. 61:10; 1 Sam. 30:6), and the will (Job 7:15; 6:7; 1 Chron. 22:19). These three organs are wonderful, but they can also be the cause of much trouble. Sometimes we cannot sleep well because we have such an active mind. If we could control our mind, we would sleep well. Our emotion can also be troublesome. If we were not so emotional, we would not be so concerned with how people treat us. Whether they would highly appraise us or scorn us, we would not be moved. Because we have such a troublesome emotion, sometimes we are so bothered that we cannot go to sleep. Our stubborn will is also the source of many problems. Not only do we have a body with so many parts and a soul with so many organs, we have another part of our being, a deeper part, our spirit. The wisest man is the man who lives in his spirit.<h2 class=head2>Retreating to Our Spirit</h2><p>If I am a person living in the emotion, I will be so easily affected by what others say about me. If you say something good about me, I will be happy. If you say something bad about me, I will be offended. If I live in the emotion, I am just a superficial person. Being in my spirit, however, insulates my emotion. When I am in my spirit, nothing can disturb me. Regardless of how much you praise me or rebuke me, I am not touched because I retreat to my spirit and stay in my spirit. Sometimes we may not sleep well because we stay in our mind, thinking and reasoning. We worry so much because we are used to staying in our mind. We all have to exercise to retreat to our spirit. If we retreat to our spirit, we will be at peace (Rom. 8:6), and we will get the best sleep.<p>Furthermore, if we are not in the spirit, we cannot be clear about anything in our daily life. Many times, if we are not in the spirit, we are not fair or honest. Suppose a husband and wife begin to argue. The more they fight, the more they have something to fight about. Today there are so many divorces just because of this kind of endless fighting, but we Christians have a place to which we can retreat. While you are fighting with your spouse, you have to remember that you are a dear saint and that you have a regenerated spirit. Retreat to that spirit. Stop fighting, stop using your mouth. Retreat to your spirit, and stay in your spirit. If you practice this, you will be honest and fair. You will be clear; you will realize that you are wrong, not your spouse. The only place that we can see things clearly is in our spirit.<p>Suppose I hear something that is not so good. If I am in my mind or in my emotion, I cannot discern the matter clearly, fairly, or rightly. I may even immediately try to speak of this negative matter to another brother. If the brother listening to me has learned some lessons, he will not say a word to me from his mind, but remain in his spirit. I may try to stir up his interest in this matter, but his staying in his spirit will stop my talking. Sometimes this will even help me to retreat to my spirit. Then in my spirit, I may have the deep sensation that I am wrong. The only place where we can see things clearly, fairly, honestly, faithfully, and accurately is in our spirit. If we are going to know any matter, if we are going to know ourselves, or if we are going to know the real situation of our family life, we have to be in our spirit (1 Cor. 2:11a).<p>In order to know the church or see something of the church, we must be in the spirit. We can never see the church, the mystery of Christ, merely by using our small mind to consider and try to understand it. The more we do this, the more we will be confused. We should not trust in our mind, but we have to cooperate with God by retreating to our spirit. Many of us may have seen something of the church, but we have to see more in order to stay in the church. We should pray: &#8220;Lord, save me. Deliver me from my mind, emotion, and will. Help me to stay in my spirit.&#8221; Some may not have seen the church. If you have not seen the church, do not argue with others about this matter or try to understand it on your own. Simply turn to your spirit. You must realize that the deepest part of your being is your human spirit. Your spirit is the very spot where God can reveal things to you. If you turn to your spirit and remain there, the church can be revealed to you.<h2 class=head1>HAVING THE EYES OF OUR HEART ENLIGHTENED</h2><p>We need a spirit of wisdom and revelation that the eyes of our heart may be enlightened (Eph. 1:18). These are not our physical eyes, but our inner eyes, the eyes of our heart. Because we have a spirit, our inner eyes can be enlightened. Then we can not only understand, but also see. We must realize that seeing is much better than understanding. Through all the years I have learned not to trust in my knowing or my understanding. Regardless of how much you tell me about the city of London, I do not trust in that. Eventually, I have to go and look at the city of London. When I go there, what I see will be different from what I understood. What we understand will never be as much as what we can see. It is not enough for us to understand the things concerning the church; we must see the church.<p>Paul prays for us to have a spirit of wisdom and revelation that our inner eyes may be enlightened to see three things: the hope of God&#8217;s calling (v. 18), the glory of God&#8217;s inheritance (v. 18), and the surpassing greatness of His power (v. 19). These three profound things are far beyond our human concept.<h2 class=head2>To See the Hope of God&#8217;s Calling</h2><p>We all have been called by God, but what is the hope of God&#8217;s calling? Some may say that our hope is to go to heaven. But if you read the Bible, you will realize that God desires to come to earth. The heavens may be so precious to you, but the earth is more precious to God. In Matthew 6:10, the Lord Jesus prayed that God&#8217;s will would be done on earth as it is in heaven. To God the earth is more important than the heavens. We Christians are always thinking that this earth is hopeless and that we are going to another place. But the Lord prayed that God&#8217;s kingdom would come to earth and that His will would be done on earth as it is in the heavens. Even the New Jerusalem one day will come &#8220;down out of heaven&#8221; (Rev. 21:2). To God, the earth is much more precious than the heavens. Heaven is not the hope of our calling. God has not called us to die and go to heaven. In Psalm 8:1, the psalmist declares, &#8220;O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!&#8221; Our hope is related to our living on this earth.<p>This concept of always expecting to go to heaven is from the superstition of Catholicism. Catholicism is a mixture of the truth in the Bible and paganism. In Buddhism there is the teaching that after you die you will go to a good place as a reward, and this kind of thought has been adopted by Catholicism. Many Christians have been indoctrinated with this pagan superstition. Some may be bothered by this word and ask, &#8220;After we have been saved, where will we go when we die?&#8221; The Bible reveals that Hades, like Sheol in the Old Testament (Gen. 37:35; Psa. 6:5), is the place where the souls and spirits of the dead are kept (Luke 16:22-23; Acts 2:27). However, Hades is divided into two sections: the pleasant section, paradise, where all the saved saints are, awaiting the resurrection (Luke 16:22-23, 25-26), and where the Lord Jesus went with the saved thief after they died on the cross (Luke 23:43; Acts 2:24, 27, 31; Eph. 4:9; Matt. 12:40); and the section of torment, where all the perished sinners are (Luke 16:23,28). As saved ones, we can be at peace. There is a proper place for us, but this is not the hope of our calling.<p>The hope of God&#8217;s calling is &#8220;Christ in you, the hope of glory&#8221; (Col. 1:27). Christ realized by us, experienced by us, and gained by us to the fullest extent is the hope of our calling. God called us, justified us, and He will glorify us, conforming us to the image of His Son (Rom. 8:29-30). One day we will all be absolutely the same as Christ (1 John 3:2). Our hope is not just Christ as our Redeemer or as our life, but Christ as our ultimate manifestation and consummation, as our glory. We are waiting to be fully conformed to the very image of Christ. This is the ultimate consummation of the enjoyment of Christ, and this is the hope of God&#8217;s calling.<h2 class=head2>To See the Glory of God&#8217;s Inheritance in the Saints</h2><p>The second matter Paul prays for us to see is the glory of God&#8217;s inheritance in the saints (Eph. 1:18). We are always concerned about our own inheritance, but God wants us to care for His inheritance. God&#8217;s inheritance in the saints is Christ. The Christ that has been wrought into each one of us is God&#8217;s inheritance. Christ is everything. To us, Christ is our hope, and to God, Christ is His inheritance. There is nothing within us that is worth being God&#8217;s inheritance. Only the very Christ who has been wrought into us can be God&#8217;s inheritance. We need to ask how much of Christ has been wrought into us. There may not be much in us that is good for God to inherit because very little of Christ has been wrought into us. This is why we need to be transformed, to have a metabolic change (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18), and to be conformed to the image of Christ. We all need more of Christ wrought into our being. The glory of God&#8217;s inheritance in the saints is the Christ of glory within us. When we are all transformed and transfigured, conformed to Christ to the uttermost, God will be happy. All the dear saints will be His inheritance, and this inheritance will be Christ Himself wrought into all His believers in full.<h2 class=head2>To See the Surpassing Greatness of God&#8217;s Power</h2><p>The third item that Paul prayed for us to see is &#8220;the surpassing greatness of His power&#8221; (Eph. 1:19). This is the power which God has wrought into Christ to do four things: 1) to raise Him from among the dead (v. 20); 2) to seat Him at the right hand of God (v. 20); 3) to subject all things under His feet (v. 22); and 4) to make this Christ the Head over all things to the church (v. 22). We all have to see the surpassing greatness of this power which God wrought into Christ. This is the power that overcame death, the grave, and Hades in raising Jesus from among the dead, that seated Christ at God&#8217;s right hand in the heavenlies far above all, that subjected all things under His feet, and that gave Him to be Head over all things to the church. This great power is toward us who believe. We need to know this power because the result, the issue, the coming forth, of this power is the church.<p>It is not merely because we have been saved and meet together that we are the church. We cannot say that this is wrong, but it is a very superficial understanding. We need to see that the normal, genuine, proper, and real church comes out of this great power. If you have the power that raised Christ, that seated Him at God&#8217;s right hand, far above all, that subjected all things under His feet, and that gave Him the universal headship, you have the church. This church is the Body of Christ, &#8220;the fullness of the One who fills all in all&#8221; (v. 23). Christ, who is the infinite, unlimited God, is so great that He fills all things in all things. Such a great Christ needs the church to be His fullness for His complete expression. This church comes into being, not from teaching, not from gifts, not from forms, not from rituals, and not from organization, but from the power of the resurrected, ascended, and enthroned Christ, who is now the Head over all things to the church. Ephesians 1:22 does not say that Christ has been made Head over all things for the church, but to the church. Whatever He is, whatever He has attained and obtained, is to the church. &#8220;To the church&#8221; implies a kind of transmission. Whatever Christ, the Head, attained and obtained is transmitted to the church, His Body. In this transmission the church shares with Christ all His attainments: the resurrection from among the dead, being seated in His transcendency, the subjection of all things under His feet, and the headship over all things. Such a church is Christ&#8217;s Body, His fullness.<p>We all must realize that nothing of our natural life, nature, or makeup, nothing of our natural being, is a part of the church. Only the very portion of Christ that has been wrought into us is a part of the church. Today Christ is in the heavens, yet He is also here on earth. He is like electricity. At the same time, electricity is in a house at one end and far away in a generator at the other end. All the light and the functions of the appliances in the house come out of this electricity. Today, Christ is the heavenly electricity. He is in the heavens, yet He is also within us as the source for us to have the church life. As the heavenly electricity, Christ is being transmitted to the church. We have to realize that everything God has done for us, with us, and in us is for the church. Regardless of how many years you have been saved, how much you love the Lord, how spiritual you are, or how much growth in life you have, as long as you are not for the church, there is something wrong. God&#8217;s intention is not merely to save us, nor is it merely that we be spiritual or love Him. God&#8217;s intention is to work the resurrected, ascended, and enthroned Christ, who is the Head over all things, into us to make us a part of the church. We all need to see the church in this way.<p>In our meetings we need to call on the name of the Lord. To call on the name of the Lord is to receive Him, to breathe Him in as the Spirit (Lam. 3:55-56; John 20:22). This will cause more of Christ to be wrought into us, yet the issue must be for the church. We all must realize that our calling on the name of the Lord, our eating, drinking, and breathing of the Lord, must be for the church. We have to be for the church and in the church. If you are not in a genuine local church, standing on the unique ground of the oneness of the Body of Christ, you cannot be fully satisfied; you cannot have the deep feeling that you are home. Without being in such a local church and living the local church life, you will feel unsettled, as a homeless wanderer. In the church we are home because the church is our destiny and also our destination (Eph. 2:19). This is because the church is also God&#8217;s destiny, even God&#8217;s destination.<p>We all need a spirit of wisdom and revelation that we may see these three matters: 1) the hope of God&#8217;s calling, which is Christ; 2) the glory of God&#8217;s inheritance in the saints, which is also Christ; and 3) the surpassing greatness of the power that produces the church, the power that raised up Christ, that seated Him in the heavenlies, that put all things under His feet, and that gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:17-23</h1><h2 class=head1>THE HUMAN SPIRIT</h2><h2 class=head2>The Unique Organ to Receive and Contact God</h2><p>In Ephesians 1, the main thing the Apostle Paul prayed for is for us to be given a spirit of wisdom and revelation. This spirit is not the Holy Spirit but our human spirit. For centuries, Christianity has missed the mark of God&#8217;s economy (1 Tim. 1:4-6) simply because they have neglected this basic matter-the human spirit. Some may speak often of the Holy Spirit, yet they do so in an objective way as if the Spirit were something far away from us. The Apostle Paul knew that the problem is not with the Holy Spirit but with the neglect of the human spirit. Today many neglect their spirit, and some do not even realize that they have a human spirit.<p>Let me illustrate in this way. Suppose you know all about ice cream, yet you do not realize that you have a mouth. There is no problem with the ice cream. The problem is that you do not realize you have a mouth with which you can receive and enjoy the ice cream. This may seem like a childish illustration, but this is the situation in Christianity today. They may talk a lot about the Holy Spirit, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and the gifts of the Holy Spirit, but they do not realize the organ with which we must contact and receive the Holy Spirit. If we are going to receive the air, we need to use our lungs. If we are going to listen to something, we have to use our ears. We must use the right organ. God purposely created only one organ to receive and contact Him-our spirit (John 4:24; Rom. 1:9).<h2 class=head2>Exercising Our Spirit to See the Church</h2><p>We may know about our spirit, but we may still not be so clear that we need to exercise our spirit. We may exercise our mentality too much and neglect our spirit. When some hear the young people shouting and calling on the name of the Lord, they may be bothered. They may think, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like this kind of church.&#8221; Eventually, they will be kept away from the meetings by their reasoning mind. We must realize, however, that the church is a matter in our spirit, not in our mind. Only by exercising our spirit can we discern matters clearly in the church.<p>Although the church is a great subject in the Bible, the Apostle Paul&#8217;s Epistle concerning the church is very short with only six chapters. If we are going to know the church, the main thing is not to exercise our mind to know the teachings, but to exercise our spirit. Thus, Paul prayed for all of us, that God, the Father of glory, may give to us a spirit of wisdom and revelation (Eph. 1:17). For the church, we need such a spirit, and we all have a spirit, but we have to exercise our spirit. We need to use our spirit. If you are in your mind, you could never be clear about the church. The mind is the wrong organ with which to realize the church. However, if you exercise to enter into your spirit and stay there, you will see the church. The church is absolutely something in the spirit.<p>A sister once told me that I talked too much about the church life and asked if I ever spoke about the family life. When she said this, I realized deep within that she was just in her mind. Because she was in the mind, the family life was everything to her. If she would have changed her position by turning herself from the mind to the spirit, she would have contacted the Lord Jesus. She would have seen the church life. The church life is not in our mind. We should not exercise our mind to understand the church. The church life is in our spirit. We need a spirit of wisdom and revelation, not to merely understand the church, but to see the church.<p>Some Christians have asked me: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you agree with the denominations? Does this mean that only you are right and all the others are wrong?&#8221; We in the Lord&#8217;s recovery should never be so foolish as to argue with people. We may encourage them to turn to their spirit and wait in the presence of the Lord and see what the Lord would speak to them in their spirit. Simply help them to turn to their spirit. To know something about the church and to see something of the church, we have to be in the spirit. It is only by our spirit that we can realize the church.<h2 class=head2>The Need for Wisdom and Revelation</h2><p>Paul prays for a spirit of wisdom and revelation (1:17). Wisdom is the ability to realize and understand things. For example, if you would give me a camera, I may not know how to put in the film or how to take a picture. I may not even realize that I have to take the lens cover off. I simply do not have the wisdom to know and understand how to operate a camera. Wisdom is to know and understand something, but revelation is to see something. Suppose there is a big factory with many machines. We may have the wisdom to know how to operate all the machines, but if the factory is not open to us, we cannot see anything. On the other hand, if the factory is opened, we can see everything, but if we do not understand the machines, our seeing means very little. We need both the wisdom and the revelation. Our spirit is a spirit of wisdom and revelation. We must turn to our spirit to get the wisdom to know and understand the things of the church and also to receive the revelation to see the things of the church.<h2 class=head1>THE HOPE OF GOD&#8217;S CALLING</h2><p>First, we must have the proper base and foundation of being in the spirit. Then Paul prays that we &#8220;may know what is the hope of His calling&#8221; (v. 18). Because we have been called by God, we now have a marvelous hope. Paul&#8217;s concept is that this hope is our destiny and also our destination. We all must see the hope, the destiny, and the destination to which God has called us.<h2 class=head2>The Father&#8217;s House</h2><p>The hope of God&#8217;s calling is not that we would go to heaven. Although this traditional thought is held by many Christians, it is superstitious and completely off the line of the revelation in the Bible. In the New Testament and even in the entire Bible, you simply cannot find a verse where God says clearly that when we die, we will go to heaven.<p>Throughout the centuries, many have held the concept that the Father&#8217;s house in John 14 refers to a mansion in the heavens to which the believers go after they die. The King James Version renders John 14:2, &#8220;In My Father&#8217;s house are many mansions.&#8221; But if you look into the Greek text, you will find that in the same chapter, the word translated mansions in verse 2 is the same as the word translated abode in verse 23: &#8220;If anyone loves Me,...We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; The only difference is that in verse 2 the plural form of the word is used, and in verse 23 it is singular. According to the Greek, it is not mansions in John 14:2, but abodes: &#8220;In My Father&#8217;s house are many abodes.&#8221;<p>When I was young, I heard a respected Bible teacher say, &#8220;John 14 tells us that the Lord Jesus has gone to prepare mansions for us in the heavens. After He has prepared them, He will come back to take us there. Because He has not come back yet, this means He has not finished the mansions. The Lord Jesus Himself has been building these mansions for over nineteen hundred years and still He is not finished. Consider what marvelous mansions those will be.&#8221; At that time, I was really captured. I said: &#8220;Lord, thank You. I do not care what kind of poor cottage I may live in today. You are preparing a marvelous, gorgeous, all-splendid, big mansion in the heavens for me, still not yet finished!&#8221; I held this kind of teaching for many years. Then one day, after nearly twenty years, the Lord opened my eyes to see the truth concerning all these things, and I cast aside all of these traditional and superstitious teachings.<p>The Lord&#8217;s word, &#8220;I go to prepare a place for you&#8221; (14:2), does not mean that He has gone to the heavens to build a big mansion for us. God&#8217;s intention in the Gospel of John is not to build a physical mansion in the heavens and then bring us there. This is absolutely against the concept of this book. The main concept in the Gospel of John is that Jesus as the Word was God. Then He became flesh to die on the cross for us that we might be redeemed. In His resurrection, He wrought Himself into His redeemed people that they might be regenerated, born of God. As a result, God can be in us and we can be in God. God&#8217;s intention is that He would abide in us and that we would abide in Him (John 14:20; 1 John 4:13). As long as we are in the Lord and the Lord is in us, whether the abodes will be in the heavens or on earth should not matter. We are not for the heavens; we are for the Lord. The heavens are not our abode, but the Lord Jesus is. We abide in Him, and He abides in us.<p>We should not trust in the traditional and often superstitious teachings that we have received in the past. It is not so simple to understand and interpret the Bible. We need to ask ourselves what is meant by &#8220;My Father&#8217;s house&#8221; in this book. In the Gospel of John, this expression is used twice: in 14:2 and also in 2:16. In chapter two the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Do not make My Father&#8217;s house a house of merchandise.&#8221; Here the term, My Father&#8217;s house, refers to God&#8217;s temple. Then in verse 19 the Lord said, &#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&#8221; John tells us that the Lord&#8217;s meaning was that His body was the temple (v. 21). The Jews tried to kill Him, to destroy His body on the cross, but in three days He resurrected His body. Now in resurrection this body is not only the Lord&#8217;s own physical body but also His mystical Body, the church. In John 2 the Father&#8217;s house is God&#8217;s temple, and God&#8217;s temple is the Body of Christ, the church, produced out of the Lord&#8217;s death and resurrection. If the term &#8220;My Father&#8217;s house&#8221; denotes the church in chapter two, it would not be logical for it to denote the heavens in chapter fourteen of the same book.<p>In 14:2 the Lord said, &#8220;In My Father&#8217;s house are many abodes;...I go to prepare a place for you.&#8221; By this word, the Lord reveals that in the church there are many abodes. Furthermore, His going to prepare a place for us was His going by His death and resurrection. By His death on the cross, He accomplished redemption to remove every obstacle between God and man, opening the way for us to have a standing, a place, in God. By His resurrection, He was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit that He might regenerate His redeemed people, entering into them to dwell in them. As a result of His going through death and resurrection, we have become His abodes. God abides in us, and we abide in God. In chapter fifteen, this mutual abiding is clearly revealed by the Lord&#8217;s word, &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you&#8221; (v. 4). The Greek word translated &#8220;abide&#8221; in this verse is the root of the words translated &#8220;abodes&#8221; and &#8220;abode&#8221; in 14:2 and 23. The verb, abide (Gk. meno), is the root of the noun, abode (Gk. mone). Chapter fourteen deals with the noun, the place, the abode. Then chapter fifteen refers to the verb, the action, the abiding. Before you can abide, you need the abodes. The abodes are prepared through the Lord&#8217;s going in chapter fourteen. Then the mutual abiding is revealed in chapter fifteen.<p>In John 14:3, the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, that where I am you also may be.&#8221; The explanation of &#8220;where I am&#8221; in this verse is provided in verse 10: &#8220;I am in the Father.&#8221; Therefore, the Lord was revealing to His disciples that they would also be where He was, that is, in the Father. While the Lord was speaking this word, He was among His disciples, but it was not yet possible for them to be in the Father. He needed to go, to accomplish the work of redemption through His death on the cross, to take away sin. He also needed to be resurrected, to open the way that the disciples might be brought into the Father and that the Father might be brought into them. The Lord&#8217;s work is not to bring us merely to the heavens. The Lord&#8217;s work of death and resurrection is to bring us into God and to bring God into us.<p>In verse 20 the Lord said, &#8220;In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&#8221; In that day, the day of resurrection, the disciples would know that He is in the Father. Surely if He is in the Father, they will be in the Father because where He is, there they would also be (v. 3). Since He is in the Father and the disciples are in Him, spontaneously, they also are in the Father. Because the Father is in Him and He will be in them, the Father also will be in them. Furthermore, verse 23 says, &#8220;We [the Lord and His Father] will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; This abode is one of the many abodes in verse 2. It is a mutual abode for the Triune God to abide in the believers and for the believers to abide in Him. We must drop the false, unscriptural, and leavened concept of going to a physical, heavenly mansion. We must care for Christ and for the mutual abode, the church.<h2 class=head2>The Freedom of Glory</h2><p>We do have a hope as a result of our being called by God. This hope is that we will be transformed and transfigured, thoroughly conformed to the image of Christ. When we look at ourselves, we realize that we have many flaws. Physically, I have many wrinkles and spots. But one day, we will all be the same as Christ, not only inwardly, spiritually, but even outwardly, physically. We will be absolutely like Christ in His glory (1 John 3:2; Col. 3:4). Today, Christ in us is our hope of glory (Col. 1:27). But one day, all my wrinkles and spots will be gone. I cannot tell you how wonderful, beautiful, and glorious we will be! Today, because we are still under corruption, we groan in ourselves (Rom. 8:23), waiting eagerly for that day of glory when we will be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God (v. 21). We will be delivered out of groaning to enjoy the freedom of glory. This is our hope, our destiny, and also our destination. Day by day, we are marching onward toward this destination. Our hope is that, one day, we will arrive. This destination is not the heavens, but the freedom of the glory of the children of God. When we are all fully conformed to the image of Christ, we will be in glory. Today, I am fully content to be in the church life. In the church, we are on our way to glory, and this glory is the hope of our calling.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S INHERITANCE IN THE SAINTS</h2><p>The second matter that Paul prays for us to know is &#8220;the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints&#8221; (Eph. 1:18). We have seen that God&#8217;s inheritance in the saints is the Christ that has been wrought into us. Actually, the Christ that has been wrought into us is the church, so the church is God&#8217;s inheritance. This matter is very deep and profound. Do not think that the church is an organization, a group of religious people, or any kind of social or religious entity. The church is simply Christ wrought into us in a corporate way.<h2 class=head1>THE TRANSMISSION OF GOD&#8217;S POWER PRODUCING THE CHURCH</h2><p>The third matter that the apostle prays for us to see is &#8220;the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe&#8221; (v. 19). We must pay attention to the short phrase, toward us, in this verse. This great power is not something which is unrelated to us. This power is toward us. Continually, this great power is directed toward us who believe. We are the object of this power.<p>We should never forget the four items which constitute this power. First, it is the power that raised up Jesus from among the dead (v. 20), the resurrection power. Second, it is the power that seated Christ at the right hand of God (vv. 20-21), the transcending power. It cannot be held down, suppressed, or oppressed; it transcends everything. Third, this power subjected all things under the feet of Christ (v. 22). This is the subduing power. Fourth, it is the power that gave Christ to be Head over all things (v. 22). This is the overruling power that rules over everything. We have to realize this power in all of these aspects. This great power is the resurrection, transcending, subduing, and overruling power, and it is this power that produces the church.<h2 class=head2>Experiencing the Divine Transmission</h2><p>In verse 19, this great power is &#8220;toward us who believe.&#8221; To receive God&#8217;s power, there is no other condition than that of believing in the Lord Jesus. As long as you believe in the Lord Jesus, this power is toward you and even in you. Then verse 22 says that Christ has been given to be Head over all things to the church. This word &#8220;to&#8221; indicates a transmission. Here we have a divine transmission of all the power which God has wrought in Christ into the church. Although we may see this, it could be merely a doctrine to us. We must also see how to apply it.<p>To experience this power, the first thing we need to realize is that this power is in us already. It is just like the electricity that has already been installed into a building. But with most of us, our &#8220;amperage&#8221; is too low. Our capacity to receive the transmission of this power is too small. This power has been installed into us, but because our capacity is too small, many times in our experience &#8220;the fuse burns out,&#8221; and the power does not work. We must all look to the Lord that our capacity may be enlarged that we may experience the power that is within us.<h2 class=head2>Manifesting the Resurrection Power</h2><p>To experience this power within you, first, you need to have a strong desire to get completely out of death. If you cannot tolerate death within you, you will realize the resurrection power. Many Christians are indifferent toward death. As long as they can come and sit quietly and hear the choir sing and the pastor give a good sermon, they are content. They may love the Lord and fear Him. They may try not to do anything sinful or be worldly. They may save some money for the offering, and sometimes they may even pray for the church. However, whether the church meetings are dead or living, they would not care. Concerning death, they are altogether indifferent. Someone who is indifferent like this could never realize the power of resurrection. If you mean business with the Lord and if you hate death and are desperate to be delivered from anything dead, deadened, or deadly, you will see the power that is &#8220;toward you.&#8221; If you are genuinely grieved that your city is so dead, with nearly no one loving the Lord and standing for His testimony, and if you are desperate with the Lord, then the resurrection power will be manifested.<p>As long as there is any amount of death among us, the church is short. Death is a reduction of the church. The more death there is among us, the less church we have. The less death, the more church there is. Suppose we come together, yet we are all in a dead condition. That is not the church. That is just a religious community. The church is something so living and powerful that it swallows up all death. The church is something in the resurrection power.<p>Some may say that to have power you need the so-called &#8220;baptism of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; I have seen many who said that they experienced such a &#8220;baptism.&#8221; They spoke in tongues, but there was no power with them. In mainland China, no one has ever been as prevailing in preaching the gospel as Dr. John Sung, yet he never spoke in tongues and was absolutely against the tongue-speaking movement. He was strongly opposed to speaking in tongues, yet he was so prevailing, so powerful, in the gospel.<p>Also on the island of Taiwan, all the missionaries, even those who opposed us, had to admit to our brothers that no work of the gospel on that island could compare with the work among the &#8220;little flock,&#8221; as they called us. Yet among us we would never encourage people to speak in tongues, although we do not oppose it. The resurrection power is not with speaking in tongues. The power is right within us, but we have to be desperate. Then the resurrection power will be manifested.<h2 class=head2>Manifesting the Transcending Power</h2><p>Not only is the church in resurrection, it is also transcendent. If anything continues to suppress or entangle us, we are not in the reality of the church. The church is utterly transcendent. We must realize that all of our problems are opportunities for us to experience God&#8217;s transcending power. In the midst of all our problems, we should say: &#8220;Hallelujah! Deep within me, there is the transcending power that seated Christ at the right hand of God, far above all.&#8221; Our wives may be opposing us, or our husbands may be bothering us, but we are sitting in the heavenlies, transcendent (Eph. 2:6). All things are ours, even life or death (1 Cor. 3:21-22). All things are for the church. We need all the troublesome situations for God&#8217;s transcending power to be manifested.<p>As Christians, we may try not to make any mistakes. At times, we may have been in fear and trembling, looking to the Lord and praying, &#8220;Lord, save me from making any mistakes.&#8221; But regardless of how much you prayed in this way, you made a big mistake. It seems that the Lord did not hear or answer your prayer. Actually, however, He did hear your prayer and answered it. He knew that you needed that big mistake. In His sovereignty, the Lord will allow us to make some mistakes.<p>Today in the church, there are many young brothers and sisters who have recently been married. Every brother who loves the Lord, looks to the Lord for a good sister to be his wife. Every sister who loves the Lord also prays that the Lord would prepare a good brother for her. Eventually, every brother gets a good wife, and every sister gets a good husband. Each wife is exactly what the brother needs, and each husband is exactly what the wife needs. The Lord has never made a mistake. Eventually, however, the honeymoon is over, and the wives and husbands begin to &#8220;grind&#8221; each other. Then the children that we have help in the grinding process that we need to pass through. As the many grains of wheat, we need to be crushed and ground to make the bread, the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 10:17). If certain persons and situations are grinding us and we complain, that means we are not transcendent. Because we are all under the grinding stone, we need the transcending power. This power is within us. If we experience God&#8217;s transcending power in all of our circumstances, the church life will be manifested.<h2 class=head2>Manifesting the Subduing Power</h2><p>Ephesians 1:22 says that God has &#8220;subjected all things under His feet.&#8221; This is God&#8217;s subduing power. All things have been put under Christ&#8217;s feet, and today it should be the same with the church. We only need to be desperate and pray: &#8220;Lord, all the things have to be under me. You are the subduing power and You are within me.&#8221; The more that things are subdued under our feet, the more the church comes into being. The church life may not be so manifested in your locality because many things have not yet been subdued. Some may be subdued by bad or even unclean habits. Others may be subdued by the modern way of dressing. In their dress, they may follow the flow of this age, the present course of the world. How can we have the proper, adequate church life if we are subdued by many things? Paul said, &#8220;All things are lawful to me, but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything....all things are lawful, but not all things build up&#8221; (1 Cor. 6:12; 10:23). This shows that Paul had the real freedom and was not subdued by anything. We should not have outward regulations in the church life, but we need the subduing power to live a subduing life. Then when others come among us, they will realize that we are those who experience God&#8217;s subduing power. Nothing in the current of this modernistic age will subdue us. Rather, all these things will be under our feet. If we fully experience God&#8217;s subduing power, the church life will be fully manifested. God&#8217;s power is to the church, and this power issues in, produces, the church.<h2 class=head2>Manifesting the Overruling Power</h2><p>Then the fourth item of God&#8217;s power is the overruling power. Christ is the Head and we are His Body. We are one with the Head. He is overruling all things, and we share in His overruling. When all things are under the rule of the Head and His Body, the church is manifested.<h2 class=head2>Our Need to Be Desperate</h2><p>Now that we have seen the power that produces the church, our only need is to be desperate. We should pray, &#8220;Lord, I am desperate to be saved from anything of death and from anything that would suppress, subdue, or overrule me.&#8221; Then we will see the power that is within us. The word dynamo is an anglicized form of the Greek word translated &#8220;power&#8221; in Ephesians 1:19. A dynamo is a generator. We must realize that within us there is a generator, a dynamo. It is dynamic and powerful, but it needs our cooperation. We have to have our capacity enlarged by being desperate. Then we will see the manifestation of the church in our locality.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>TO BE STRENGTHENED WITH POWER INTO THE INNER MAN</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:16-21</h1><h2 class=head1>THE INNER MAN</h2><p>In this chapter we will consider the second prayer of the Apostle Paul in the book of Ephesians. In the previous chapters, we have seen that in Paul&#8217;s first prayer, the key is our spirit. Now in the second prayer, the key is the inner man. The spirit is for our seeing, for the revelation, and the inner man is for the experience. Our spirit is for us to use as an organ to see the things of the church, but the inner man is not just an organ. The inner man is a person. By this person, we can experience Christ that the church may come into being. Actually, the inner man is simply our spirit with something added. When Christ as life comes into our spirit, it becomes a person. The inner man is our regenerated person with God&#8217;s life as its life.<p>We all have to see the difference between the spirit as an organ and the inner man. According to 1 Thessalonians 5:23, man is of three parts: spirit, soul, and body. Our soul is our human life. This is why in the New Testament, the same Greek word psuche is translated &#8220;soul&#8221; in some cases (Luke 12:20; Acts 2:43) and &#8220;life&#8221; in others (Luke 12:22-23; John 12:25). Because our human life is in our soul, our soul is our person, our being, and our self. Therefore, the Bible refers to people as souls. In Acts 7:14, seventy-five persons are called seventy-five souls. A soul is a person because a human being&#8217;s life is in the soul, but the spirit by itself is merely an organ. Just as our body is an outward organ to contact the outward, physical world, our spirit is an inward organ to contact the spiritual world. Before being saved, each of us was a soul, a being, a person, with two organs: the body as an outward organ and the spirit as an inward organ. But now Christ has come into our spirit as life, and this life is not psuche, the soul-life, but the divine life. Whenever the New Testament in the original Greek speaks of this life, it always uses the word zoe (John 1:4; 1 John 1:2; 5:12). Zoe is the divine, eternal, uncreated life of God, which is Christ Himself. Christ is our life in our spirit (Col. 3:4; Rom. 8:10). Without this life, our spirit would only be an organ, not a person. As saved ones with Christ as life in our spirit, our spirit has become a man, a person, a being. It is not merely an inward organ, but it is now an inner man. This is the inner man referred to by Paul in Ephesians 3:16.<p>Before we were saved, we had only one life, the soul-life, but now we have another life, the divine life in our spirit. Because we now have two lives, we have a problem. By which of these lives will we live? If we live by the soul-life, psuche, we will be soulish, but if we live by the divine life, zoe, we will be spiritual. We should all desire to live by the life in our spirit, by the new divine life, zoe, and not by the old human life, psuche.<p>In Ephesians 1 our spirit is revealed as an organ for us to receive revelation concerning the church. In Ephesians 3 our spirit is a person, the inner man, for us to experience Christ for the church. Because chapter one refers to our need to see the spiritual revelation, it reveals the spirit as an organ. Chapter three shows us that we have to live according to what we have seen. For this we need the inner man, a person. As a person, our spirit is for us to live by and for us to experience what we have seen.<h2 class=head1>STRENGTHENED WITH POWER</h2><p>For us to see, we need revelation in our spirit, but in order to live and experience what we have seen, our inner man needs to be strengthened, empowered. Many of us have to admit that our soul, our outward man, is stronger than our spirit, our inner man. This is why Paul prayed in Ephesians 3:16 that we would be strengthened &#8220;with power.&#8221; &#8220;Power&#8221; in this verse is the same Greek word for &#8220;power&#8221; in 1:19. We need to be strengthened with resurrection power, transcending power, subduing power, and overruling power. If there is any amount of deadness around us not yet conquered, it is hard for our inner man to be strong. Therefore, our inner man needs to be strengthened with the resurrection power to conquer all deadness. For this we have to be desperate that the resurrection power may swallow up all our death. If anything of death remains around or within us, we are weakened in our inner man.<p>We also need to be strengthened with the transcending power. If anything still suppresses or oppresses us, we are weakened. We have to be desperate and pray: &#8220;Lord, where is Your transcending power? I should not be suppressed or oppressed by anything. Regardless of my situation, I should be transcendent.&#8221;<p>Then we need the subduing power to put all things under our feet. The hardest thing for us to subdue is our temper. If your temper could not be subdued, your inner man could never be strengthened. The thing that weakens our inner man the most is our temper. Suppose you lose your temper four times in a week. When you come to the meeting, how strong would your inner man be? You will be too weak to function in the meeting. If someone would ask you why you did not function, you may say that you did not have the anointing or the Lord&#8217;s leading, but these answers are untrue. The only reason you did not function is that you were so weak in your inner man. Your inner man was fully weakened by your temper. If you are going to be strong in your inner man, you have to subdue your temper, and if you can subdue your temper, you can subdue everything. You cannot subdue your temper in yourself and by yourself. Only by God&#8217;s subduing power within you can you subdue all things. You have this subduing power within you. It is with this subduing and overruling power that our inner man is strengthened.<p>Paul prays in Ephesians 3 that we would be strengthened with power. This power is the power revealed in Ephesians 1. We all have to realize that it is with this power-the resurrection power, the transcending power, the subduing power, and the overruling power-that our inner man is strengthened. We need to be strengthened into our inner man with the power that raised Christ from among the dead, that seated Christ at the right hand of God in the heavenlies, that subjected all things under His feet, and that gave Him to be Head over all things to the church. Today our inner man is weak because we are not desperate. We need to be desperate to experience this power that is within us so that our inner man might be strengthened.<h2 class=head1>THROUGH HIS SPIRIT INTO THE INNER MAN</h2><p>Paul also prays that we would be strengthened with power &#8220;through His Spirit&#8221; (Eph. 3:16). This power is one with the Spirit. You can never separate the power from God the Spirit. Strictly speaking, God&#8217;s Spirit is this power. We need to be strengthened with this power through His Spirit in our spirit. Here Paul adds the phrase, &#8220;into the inner man&#8221; (v. 16). We need to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man. This word &#8220;into&#8221; indicates transmission. You are receiving the divine transmission of this fourfold power, the resurrection power, transcending power, subduing power, and overruling power. In chapter one, this power was toward us, but in chapter three, the strengthening is with this power into our spirit, into our inner man. This power for the strengthening is not only within us but also in the heavens being transmitted into us. With electricity, when you turn the switch off, the flow stops. When the electrical switch is on, the current of electricity is flowing. This current is not only in the building. It is also being transmitted into the building. God&#8217;s power is not only something within us, but also something in the heavens being transmitted into us. The strengthening, strictly speaking, does not originate from within us; it comes from the heavens, from the throne, and is being transmitted into us. This strengthening is something living, transmitting, and flowing. Many times we have the feeling that there is something within us strengthening us. With this strengthening, there is the flowing of the Spirit within us. Something is being transmitted and imparted into us by this flowing. This is the strengthening with power through His Spirit into the inner man.<h2 class=head1>THAT CHRIST MAY MAKE HIS HOME IN OUR HEARTS</h2><p>The issue of this strengthening is &#8220;that Christ may make His home in your hearts&#8221; (v. 17). Not only is Christ in our spirit, but also, as a person, He must inhabit our whole inward being, our heart. The heart is composed of the three parts of the soul-the mind (Matt. 9:4; Heb. 4:12), the emotion (John 16:6, 22), and the will (Acts 11:23; Heb. 4:12)-plus the conscience (Heb. 10:22; 1 John 3:20), a part of the spirit. The heart includes all our inward parts. This means that when we are strengthened into our inner man, Christ will take over our entire inward being. When we are strengthened into our inner man, into our spirit, it will be easy for Christ as the indwelling Spirit to saturate every inward part of our being. It will be easy for Christ as the indwelling Spirit to take over our mind, our emotion, and our will. Then Christ can settle down in our being, making His home in our hearts.<p>Christ is in us, but He may not be settled in us. If I come to your home as a guest, I am in your home, but I am not settled there. I can only go where you would allow me. I have seen your home, but I have not made my home there. In the same way, Christ is in us, but not settled in us. This is because our inner man has not been strengthened. Our inner man needs to be strengthened with the fourfold power. If all our deadness has been swallowed up, if all the rebellious factors have been conquered, if all the troublesome things have been subdued, and if we exercise the overruling power, we will be so strong in our spirit, in our inner man. Then our whole being will be opened up to Christ as the indwelling Spirit, making it easy for Him to get into our mind, emotion, and will, into our every inward part, to take possession of all our being. He will be able to make His home in our hearts. The church life comes out of Christ making His home in our hearts.<h2 class=head1>THAT WE MAY BE FILLED UNTO ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD</h2><p>After the strengthening of the inner man and Christ&#8217;s making His home in our hearts, there is a third item: &#8220;That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God&#8221; (Eph. 3:19). When our inner man is strengthened, there is a free way for Christ to take full possession of our entire being, making His home in our hearts. God in the Son, as the life-giving Spirit, will take over and possess our whole being, making us one with God. Then we will be filled, not with doctrines or knowledge, but with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God. All this fullness dwells in Christ (Col. 1:19; 2:9). Through His indwelling, Christ imparts the fullness of God into our being. Eventually, whatever God is in His fullness will be our content. We are becoming a people filled up with the Triune God and saturated with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God. This is the issue of the transmission of God&#8217;s power, and this is the reality of the church life.<h2 class=head1>NEEDING TO BE DESPERATE</h2><p>Then Paul says, &#8220;But to Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us&#8221; (Eph. 3:20). Again, this power is the power in 1:19. It is the power that accomplishes the spiritual things for the church within our inward being. The word &#8220;operates&#8221; in this verse refers to the inward energizing of this power. If you mean business with the Lord, if you are desperate, something within will be energizing you, but if you are indifferent, the power within you will not operate. If you are indifferent toward the meetings and if you are indifferent toward your lack of fruit, how can this power within you operate to energize you? But if you pray to the Lord in a desperate way, you will immediately experience the inner energizing. God is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, but He is able only according to the power that is operating in us. How much this power can operate to energize us depends upon how desperate we are. We all have this power within us. With some it really works, but with others it does not work. This is because some are desperate and others are indifferent. The secret to the operation of this power is that we need to be desperate. God needs our human cooperation. If we do not cooperate with Him, He can do nothing. May the Lord be merciful to us that, from now on, we would be desperate. We need to have the deep feeling that we cannot go on being an indifferent Christian. We must consider this a matter of life and death. If we become desperate, we will have the realization that something within is energizing us and that something from the heavens is constantly being transmitted into our being. Then there will be glory to Him in the church (v. 21). Today there is not much glory to the Lord in the church because of our indifference. We all have to realize our need for the inner operating, the energizing, of this power for the strengthening of our inner man.<p>May we never forget these two prayers in the book of Ephesians. We need a spirit of wisdom and revelation that we may see the church, and we need our inner man to be strengthened that we may live and experience all that we have seen. The revelation of the church and the experience of Christ for the church issue in the genuine church life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>LIVING BY OUR NEW PERSON FOR THE NEW MAN</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 4:23-24; 3:6; 1 Pet. 2:2; Eph. 3:16; 4:13-14, 22-24; 2 Cor. 4:16b; Col. 3:9-11</h1><h2 class=head1>WORSHIPPING GOD IN REALITY</h2><p>In this chapter we need to learn something concerning reality. According to John 4:23-24, we need to be those who worship God, the Father, both in spirit and in reality. Although we may know how to be in spirit, we may not have that much reality. Reality is simply Christ as our experience. The more we experience Christ, the more reality we have. Little by little, we have to gain more reality.<p>All the positive items in the Old Testament were only &#8220;a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ&#8221; (Col. 2:16-17). All the items of the ceremonial law were shadows. The body, the solid substance, the reality, of the shadows is Christ. Christ is the reality (John 14:6). Whenever we come to worship God, we have to come with Christ as our reality. In ancient times the children of Israel came to worship God with various kinds of offerings (Deut. 12:5-7; Lev. 1-5). All of those offerings were types of Christ. Moses wrote four long books concerning the worship of God: Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. In these books Moses did not tell the Israelites how to kneel down, how to bow down, or how to prostrate themselves. He did not tell them how to be quiet, how to sing a song, a hymn, or a psalm, or even how to praise. Throughout these books, Moses gave them thorough and detailed instructions on how to handle the offerings. He taught them how to bring the offerings and how to kill the sacrifices. He also taught them how to offer the sacrifices. He told them what part of the sacrifices they had to burn, what part they could keep, what part they could enjoy, what part they had to share with others, and even what part they had to enjoy with others in the presence of God. To worship God is altogether a matter of handling the offerings.<p>Today in much of Christianity, people worship in a quiet, formal, and organized way. This is the natural, human, religious concept of worship. From the books written by Moses, we can see that the worship God desires is not according to this religious concept. The genuine worship is fully, absolutely, a matter of handling the offerings. We have to worship God with the offerings, and all the offerings are types of the different aspects of Christ. We all must learn how to handle Christ.<p>In ancient times when an Israelite came to worship God, he had to have an offering (Deut. 16:16). In the same way, we must have something of Christ to bring to God (1 Cor. 14:26). For us to have something of Christ depends upon our daily experiences, our daily laboring on Christ. Every Israelite received a portion of the good land. He had to labor on that land so that he could have some produce, some harvest, and he had to keep the best part of his harvest for the worship of God. The top tenth of the produce of the land, the tithe, had to be kept aside for the worship of God (Deut. 14:22-23). Then when the time of the feast came, they all brought their offerings to God. They put all of these offerings together, offered them to God, and enjoyed them together in God&#8217;s presence. How they handled and enjoyed the offerings meant everything. This is a clear picture showing us that the real, genuine worship is nothing other than to handle Christ, offer Christ to God, and share Christ with others.<p>Having Christ as your offering depends on your daily experiences. If you have not been experiencing Christ in your daily life, you will surely be dead and silent. This is because you have not gained Christ in your daily life. Because you have not gained anything of Christ, you come to the meeting with your hands empty, with nothing in your spirit. You have nothing of Christ to share with others, to please God, or to glorify the Father. Thus, you can only be a religious worshipper, sitting and keeping quiet. If you are laboring on Christ every day, experiencing and enjoying Him, you will surely gain something of Christ. You must gain Christ day by day, bit by bit. This morning you gain a little bit of Christ, this evening a little bit, tomorrow morning a little bit, tomorrow evening a little bit more. Day by day something of Christ is being gained by you. Then you will come to the church meeting with the rich surplus of Christ in your spirit. You will have something of Christ to share with others. You could never remain silent because something is bubbling up from within you. You are filled up and overflowing. You may say: &#8220;O, hallelujah! I am so full of Christ. Brothers, last night Christ was so sweet to me.&#8221; This is the real worship that God desires. God cannot be satisfied with your being quiet in the church meetings. God can only be satisfied with His dear Son, Christ. We have to have something of Christ to bring to the meeting, to offer to God, and to share with one another. The best worship is to share Christ with others.<p>I can testify that Christ is my peace offering to God. He is my peace; He is your peace; and He is the peace between us. Without Christ, I could not be at peace with the brothers. How can we be one? Without Christ, we would fight with one another, but Christ is our peacemaker. &#8220;He Himself is our peace&#8221; (Eph. 2:14). With Christ, there are no problems. He has neutralized every difference between us. There is no room for any natural, religious, or cultural differences in the church as the new man. Only Christ is here. In the new man, &#8220;there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all&#8221; (Col. 3:11). Now we can share Christ as our peace with all the saints. To share this kind of genuine experience of Christ is the real worship. The real worship to God is the handling of Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE NEW MAN</h2><h2 class=head2>The Birth of Our New Person</h2><p>Colossians 3:11 tells us that in the new man there is no natural person, but Christ is all and in all. However, the new man begins with the new birth in our spirit (John 3:6). We need to see the development from our new birth to the one new man where Christ is all and in all.<p>Man is of three parts-spirit, soul, and body (1 Thes. 5:23). Man&#8217;s human life is in the soul. This life in the soul is our being, our person, our self. Before being saved, man is a soul (Acts 7:14), a person, with two organs: the body as an outward organ to contact the outward, physical world, and the spirit as an inward organ to contact God and the spiritual world. When we believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him, He came into our spirit as life. Now in our spirit, we have another kind of life, the divine life of God. Formerly we had only the human life in our soul, but now we have the divine life in our spirit. As a result, our spirit has now become a person. Formerly it was only an organ because it did not have life, but now it has also become a person with a life. By being born again, you became another person. Formerly you were a soulish person with the natural, soulish, human life; but now you have the divine, eternal, uncreated life in your spirit. By being regenerated, you have been converted to be another person. Formerly, your person was the soul, but now your person is your spirit. Now you must live, not by your soul, but by your spirit. You need to realize that you have a spirit, and you also need to realize that your spirit is your person.<h2 class=head2>The Growth of Our New Person</h2><p>John 3 tells us of the new birth in our spirit-&#8220;that which is born of the Spirit is spirit&#8221; (v. 6). Then 1 Peter 2:2 speaks of the newborn babes. &#8220;As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word, that by it you may grow.&#8221; First, we are reborn; second, we have to grow. This growth has to be in our spirit. For newborn ones to grow does not mean that they pick up a lot of knowledge in their minds. To grow means that the very Christ within our spirit increases. The increase of Christ in our spirit is our real growth in life.<p>Christ is in our spirit, but to grow we have to enjoy Him. We have to eat Christ, drink Christ, and breathe in Christ. We have to take Christ in again and again. Day by day and bit by bit Christ will be increasing within us. With some this growth may have stopped. Although you may have been born again over twenty-five years ago, the amount of Christ within you may be nearly the same as when you were first saved. You may have picked up a lot of knowledge in your soul. You may have learned all the biblical teachings and all the regulations in Christianity. You may even have learned how to sing the hymns in a marvelous way. However, you have gained all these things in your soul. Where Christ is, in your spirit, there may have been hardly any increase. You may be an old babe, that is, a person who has been a Christian for many years with very little growth in life.<p>Some may boast that they have been saved for many years, that they have learned all the teachings in Christianity, and that they have heard many good, famous Christian speakers, but how much of Christ have they gained? Although a young brother may have been saved only a few years, he might have gained more Christ than they have. They may have a lot of knowledge in their soul, yet they may have gained very little of Christ in their spirit. Our unique need is to gain Christ in our spirit.<h2 class=head2>Living by Our New Person</h2><p>It is wonderful to be born again, but after our new birth, we need to grow. To grow simply means to have more of Christ added and worked into us. Formerly we were people in the soul, but now we must be people in the spirit. Our soul, our former person, has already &#8220;been crucified with Christ&#8221; (Gal. 2:20). We have to take this fact and put it into our practice. Realizing that our former person has been crucified, we should not live in that person, by that person, or with that person anymore. We have to deny our former person which the Bible calls &#8220;the old man&#8221; (Rom. 6:6; Eph. 4:22; Col. 3:9) and &#8220;the outward man&#8221; (2 Cor. 4:16), and we have to live by our new person, &#8220;the inner man&#8221; (Eph. 3:16). We have to realize that we are now another person, the new person in our spirit with Christ as life. Our person, our spirit, and Christ&#8217;s life are now one. This new person, our spirit plus Christ as life, is even our personality. Now our personality is not in the soul but in the spirit. We should not live in the old person anymore, nor should we allow or permit the old person to take any action. We have to live by the new person.<p>How do we apply this in our daily living? Suppose a brother intends to go to a department store to buy something. He should not check whether that is the Lord&#8217;s will or not. The first thing he has to check is whether his going is being initiated from his soul or from his spirit. Is it being initiated by his former person or by his present person, by the old man or the new man, by the soulish man or the inner man? It has to be initiated by his new person. It may be easy for us to learn this doctrine, but in most of our living, we may still be absolutely in our old man. To go to the department store to buy something is not bad or evil, but that may still be an activity of our former person. Although we are Christians in name, we may still be living in our old person. We may do things according to our consideration of whether a thing is right or wrong, good or evil, and not according to the principle of whether it is something of the old person or something of the new person. We, the reborn ones, may very rarely live in our new person.<p>God has no intention to ask you to be a good man. God&#8217;s intention is for you to live in the new person. It does not matter whether you buy something or not, whether you go shopping or not. What does matter is who goes, the former person or the present one, the person in the soul or the person in the spirit. If the person in the soul goes, Christ is not there, but if the person in the spirit goes, Christ goes, because in the spirit you are one with Christ. The new person is Christ as life in your spirit.<p>When these two, Christ as life and your spirit, are together as one, you have the personality of your new person. You need to see that you were not only saved but also reborn to be another person. Formerly, you were one kind of person, but you have been regenerated to be an absolutely different person. You were once a person in your soul. Whether that person was good or bad does not mean much. You may have been born gentle, mild, patient, kind, slow, and quiet. People always consider that this kind of person is very good. It may even be hard for you to lose your temper. Everybody would like this kind of person. On the other hand, I might have been born wild, tough, rough, and quick-tempered, without any patience. No one would like me. But whether you were born good or bad does not mean anything because we all need to be reborn. If you were born bad, you need to be reborn, but even if you were born good, you still need to be reborn. Regardless of our race, nationality, or natural disposition, we all have to be reborn. In this rebirth, we are all the same.<p>After our rebirth, we should no longer live by that old person but absolutely by the new person. The problem is that, even after our rebirth, we still live by our old person. We always consider whether a thing is right or wrong. If it is right, we will do it. If it is wrong, we will not do it. Thus, our standard of being a Christian is not a person but a behavior. This is the standard today in Christianity, but this is wrong. Our standard must be a person, not a behavior. Whether a matter is right or wrong, good or bad, we should only care for one thing: who is going to do it? Is our old person going to do it or our new person? It is not a matter of what you are going to do but of who is going to do it. The real subjective aspect of the work of the cross is to cross out your old person. It is no more I, the old person, but Christ, the new person (Gal. 2:20). It is not a matter of adjusting or improving your behavior. It is a matter of shifting your being from the old person to the new person.<h2 class=head2>Our New Person-the Reality of the Church Life</h2><p>May the Lord open our eyes to see that the church life is in this new person and nothing else. Regardless of how good, patient, humble, kind, and mild you are, as long as you are in the old person, you cannot experience the church life. You may be a very easy going person, yet if you are still in the old person, you are through with the church life and the church life is through with you. The church life is absolutely something in the new person. There is a new person within each of us. All of these new persons added together equals the church. What is the church? The church is the summation, the sum total, of all the new persons within us. The church life is in our spirit. This is why we need to grow and have to grow. By being born again, we become the newborn babes. Now we need to grow, not just in function, but in a person, in our inner man. Our whole person in the spirit needs to grow.<p>This is why Ephesians 3 says that we need to be strengthened with power into our inner man (v. 16). Our inner man is our spirit, but it is weak because it is short of power, the resurrection power, transcending power, subduing power, and overruling power. To grow we need to be strengthened, and the strengthening is by these few things: feeding on, drinking, breathing, and inwardly being filled with Christ. The more we feed on Christ, the more we drink of Christ, the more we breathe in Christ, and the more we are inwardly filled with Christ, the more we are strengthened. The more we are strengthened, the more we are empowered with Christ&#8217;s resurrection power. No death can prevail against us. All the deadness around us and within us is conquered by the resurrection power. When we are empowered, we are also transcendent, subduing, and overruling. This strengthening is the increasing of Christ within us, the growth of our inner man. By this strengthening our inner man, our new person, is growing every day.<p>We all need a change in our concept. We need the heavenly revelation so that we would drop all the wrong concepts we have collected from our background. We all have to realize one thing: as those who have been reborn, we should not live in our old person anymore. We have to deny and renounce that old person, and we have to realize that we now have a new person, our spirit with Christ as its life. We have to live and do everything by this new person. We should not care whether a thing is right or wrong, good or bad. We must only care for one thing: which person is going to do it, the old person or the new person? We should always be checked by this one point. If we feel that we are weak or empty in our new man, our new person, we need to be desperate and pray: &#8220;Lord, be merciful to me. Look at my situation. I am so empty, so weak, in my new person.&#8221; We need to deal with the Lord. Then we will be empowered.<p>If we know how to deal desperately with Christ, how to feed on Christ through pray-reading the Word, how to drink of Him by calling on His name, and how to breathe Him in day by day, we will be one with Him in our spirit. This will cause us, day by day, to grow in our new person. Today, we cannot see or realize that our new person is growing, but one day we will &#8220;be no longer babes&#8221; and &#8220;arrive at a full-grown man&#8221; (Eph. 4:13-14). That full growth will be the accumulation of Christ as the reality in us through all of our experiences of Him. It is not merely that we experience Christ a little bit as our patience, our strength, or our life. Rather, all day long we would live by the new person. If we are going to visit a brother, we have to check whether this is our old person, our self, or our new person, our spirit. We must check with this point and get a proper answer. Then we must go, not in our old person but in the new person. Even if a mother is going to talk to her children, she has to check whether her old person or her new person is going to talk. We are all born again, but are we living by the old person or the new person? Only by living in the new person can we have Christ as our reality. All day long, we must live by the new person. Even to study your lessons in school, you need to check this one point. For school you have to exercise your mind, but the new person, not the old person, should be using your mind. Whenever you study your lessons, you have to check: which person is going to study? If you study in the new person, your mind will work for you as an organ under the control of your new person. If you are going to dress yourself, do not check what kind of clothing you are going to wear. Firstly, you have to find out who is going to dress, the old person or the new person. We are the newborn Christians, yet most of the time we live by our old person and not by the new person, our spirit.<h2 class=head2>Putting On the New Man</h2><p>We all must see that, in the church life, all the members need to live by the new person. We should not live by a high moral standard nor by an immoral standard. We should not live by any standard of behavior but by a person. This is why 2 Corinthians 4:16 says that our outward man, the old person, is decaying, but our inner man, the new person, is being renewed day by day. The outward man has to be reduced, but the inner man needs to increase. We really have two persons within us; one is old and one is new. The old one has to be consumed, but the new one needs to increase. Our problem is that we do not realize this and continue to live by the old person and not by the new. We need a revelation so that we may have a shift from the old person to the new. Then we will be renewed in the spirit of our mind and put on the new man (Eph. 4:23-24), the corporate church life. The Apostle Paul says that we have to put off the old man, the old corporate man, and put on the new man (Eph. 4:22, 24). We all have to put off the old communal life, the worldly social life, and we have to put on the new communal life, the church life. We put on the church life bit by bit. We may participate in the church life yet still have something to do with the worldly social life. While we are being renewed in the spirit of our mind, we are gradually putting off the old communal life, and the new church life is being put on. This is what we need in the church life today. Eventually, with our new birth and through the growth of our new person, we will arrive at the goal, the new man, &#8220;where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all&#8221; (Col. 3:11). This is the church life.<p>After our new birth, we must grow, not in a doctrinal way but in a very experiential way. We all need to grow with Christ and live by our new person. We should not care for the adjustment of our outward behavior, but only for the inward shifting from the old person to the new person. We must live and do all things, both great and small, by the new person. If we do this, we will be empowered, having the real increase of Christ and growth in life. Then the old communal life will be dropped, and the new church life will be picked up. Eventually, we will have the full growth with Christ as our all in all. Then we will be in the proper church life, worshipping God not only in spirit but also in reality. We will experience the reality of Christ as our life, and we will grow into a full-grown man (Eph. 4:13). One day the Lord will bring all the local churches to this point. He is waiting for this. Probably that will be the day of His coming back.</body></html>
