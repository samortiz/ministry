   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Having Both the Concept of</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Plants Absorbing Water and the Concept</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>of Drinking the Living Water of the Divine River to Flow Rivers of Living Water</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The New Testament has both the concept of plants absorbing water and the concept of drinking the living water of the divine river to flow rivers of living water 1 Cor 3:6; John 4:10, 14; Rev 21:6; 22:1, 17b; John 7:38-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1 Corinthians 3:6 Paul said that he planted and Apollos watered.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There we can see the concept of plants absorbing water.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In John and Revelation, we see that when we drink the river of living water, we flow rivers from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do we want to absorb a little bit of water from a nearby stream, or will we be "crazy" to drink of the living water and flow rivers out from within us?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Are we satisfied to stay in Psalm 1?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Where should we go?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should go to Revelation 22!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Revelation 22 is the last "psalm."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Psalm 1 we absorb a little water bit by bit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sometimes a river may be dry, with no water for the tree to absorb.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in the last "psalm," in the last chapter of Revelation, a river of water of life is flowing for us to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is much higher than absorbing water as a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Concept of Likening the Saints to a Tree</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not Being as High as the Concept of Unveiling</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>the New Testament Believers as Branches</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>of the True Vine Christ in John 15</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moreover, the concept of likening the saints to a tree is not as high as the concept of unveiling the New Testament believers as branches of the true vine Christ in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today are we merely trees or are we branches?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are trees, we stand by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That is poor because Christ is separated from us, and, in a sense, we are competing with Him, since He is a tree and we also are a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the New Testament revelation eventually shows us that we are not actually God's plants by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are God's plants by being grafted into Christ to be made branches of Christ as the great true vine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is higher to be the branches of the true vine than it is to be an individual tree.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The local churches are not many trees.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The churches are actually one tree with millions of branches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This one tree is Christ, the great vine tree, and we are the branches of this tree.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are the members of Christ 1 Cor 6:15a; Rom 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the churches are one Body, one tree.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the believers are members of this Body and the branches of this unique tree.</S>
