   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the Ark Wandering,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Typifying the Desolation of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The visible church today is the tabernacle; it is already in ruins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the same time, the temple is not yet manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In God's eyes the church described in Ephesians 2 as God's habitation in the Holy Spirit is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But in actuality the church has not been fully manifested yet; it is still in its progressing stage.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1924 we spoke of the history of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The ark of the covenant was always advancing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, it passed through the river Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then it reached Shiloh Josh 18:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the time the Israelites went to war with the Philistines, the two sons of Eli had sinned and Eli himself had become foolish and corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He well knew the reason the Israelites were defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet he still tried to use the ark to fight for them with the hope that they would win the victory through the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the Israelites failed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The ark was captured to the land of the Philistines, and it remained in the house of Dagon 1 Sam 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Later, God brought in a curse, and the Philistines returned the ark on a cart drawn by cows chs.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>4 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At that time Samuel was raised up to fulfill his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was still a child and was girded with a small ephod 2:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here was a minister who was set apart for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The ark represents Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Wherever the ark was, there was the presence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The ark was known as the ark of the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was the center of God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Without the ark, the tabernacle was empty.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The tabernacle was meaningful only when it had the ark inside it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After the ark was taken away from the tabernacle in Shiloh 4:17 , it never returned to the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It continued to wander, until it was received into the temple when the temple was finished 1 Kings 8:1-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before David, there was Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that time Shiloh had already been rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The ark did not return to the tabernacle, but remained in the house of Obed-edom until the time of David 2 Sam 6:10 , when David welcomed the ark into Jerusalem vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>12-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Jeremiah 7:12 and 14 speak of how God dealt with Shiloh, and Psalm 78:60 and 1 Samuel 4:3 speak of how the ark had left the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Second Chronicles 5 speaks of how the ark was returned to the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God did not deal with Shiloh in the way of burning it down with fire, nor in the way of destroying the people there, but by removing the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Having a tabernacle without an ark this is judgment, desolation, and punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Shiloh had the outward form of the tabernacle only; the ark was no longer there.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is like Christianity having only the name of the church, but the central testimony of the church has been lost, and God's testimony has been removed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When Solomon became king, he went to Gibeon to pray for wisdom in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Later, when he received the wisdom, he went to the ark 1 Kings 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, according to 1 Kings 3:4 and 2 Chronicles 1:3, the Gibeonites still made sacrifices and sought for God at the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But from the day Solomon left the tabernacle, he never went back.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although in Gibeon there was still the outward, human worship, those who had received wisdom would never go back to the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who had received wisdom went with the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE REALITY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT The Normal Condition of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>at the Beginning Bearing a Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>of Oneness in All the Places</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church on earth today is one.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those who are in the church are men who are separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Under normal circumstances every brother and sister should be serving God; this should be their proper occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every one should be a consecrated one, and everyone should have everything in common.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Under such a proper living, the gifted ministries such as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers, as listed in Ephesians 4, are produced.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although these gifted ones are scattered in different places, they are still in the same church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is like the electric current being one, yet transmitted throughout many places.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although the intensity of light may be different from one house to the other, the electricity itself is one.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The light expressed in different places is different, but the nature of the electricity is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is the same with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although the churches in various localities are different as far as their localities are concerned, there is nevertheless only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The church exists for the testimony of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we say the "local church,'' our emphasis is the church, not the localness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The life that all the churches possess is a life of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For this reason all the churches should be one among themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although there were the manifested churches in Corinth, Ephesus, and other places, they were all one church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the normal situation.</S>
