   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For us to experience Christ as life in the dynamic salvation of God, we must know our spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have the spirit of the sonship of God in which we cry, Abba, Father Rom 8:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After we were regenerated, it became sweet to cry, Abba, Father, because our spirit has become a spirit of sonship.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the church, if you serve God by your body or by your soul, you are old.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>People can sense this oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The newness in God s service is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ephesians 1:17 shows that we receive wisdom and revelation with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul prayed that God would give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 3:5 he said that the New Testament revelation concerning Christ and the church was revealed to the apostles and prophets in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He also prayed in 3:16 that we would be strengthened into our spirit, our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then he said in 4:23 that we are to be renewed in the spirit of our mind.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have the Spirit of God as the pneumatic Christ in our spirit, but not in our mind, so we must set our mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then the Spirit of God within our spirit will come to fill up our mind, and we will enjoy the indwelling Christ as our life and our peace.</S>

   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>6:18 praying always in our spirit</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you take these verses away from Ephesians, it becomes an empty book.</S>

   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Apollos was fervent in his spirit in speaking Christ 18:25 .</S>
