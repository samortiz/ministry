   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TEACHING THE SAINTS TO KNOW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BASIC TRUTHS IN AN EDUCATIONAL WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At this point, we want to focus our attention on the truth lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1 Timothy 2:4 Paul tells us that God desires everyone who has been saved to be brought not just to a partial knowledge but to a full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Basically speaking in this century, regardless of what country a person lives in, he must have a basic education.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The United States practices compulsory education until a person is sixteen years old, and everyone is encouraged to at least have a high school education.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without this education as a base, it would be hard for a person to do anything with his human life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For so many years we missed the way to teach the truths in a lesson way, in a way of education, to let the saints have a basic knowledge of God s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every person should have a basic knowledge of human education, so he needs to pass through elementary, junior high, high school, and then college.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Throughout the past years what we have been practicing was like the giving of lectures by experts and specialists.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We had a college with no classrooms, no classes, no teachers, and no textbook.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We would always invite two or three specialists to give lectures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Just consider a university with five thousand students without classrooms, without professors, and without a textbook, only having famous specialists come in to give lectures.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every lecture given is marvelous and wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But after four years what will the students receive?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All they will receive is some terms and some principles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They will not have received the proper, basic education.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This has been exactly what we have been doing in the past years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many messages were like lectures, and every church expected the top expert to come to give the lecture.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My present burden is not to go to any place to give lectures.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I would rather go somewhere to set up classes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To have a school to educate the young people, we need classes, we need grades, we need lessons, and we need a textbook.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If I had not attended any classes in mathematics, and I had just learned from my parents or friends, I may have some fragments of the knowledge of mathematics, but I would not be able to teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whoever composes a textbook for mathematics considers the entire realm of mathematics and picks up some crucial points with some crucial lines.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When children study a textbook on mathematics, they should have a clear view of the matter of addition.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But we have not done this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our practice has been to give messages or lectures on topics such as sanctification and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I know some saints who have been in the church life and under the church s speaking for over thirty-seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If they were asked, however, to give a clear word concerning the Lord s redemption or concerning sanctification to a group of newly saved believers, they could not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Their feeling is that only I and the co-workers trained by me for years can do such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We heard that Christ is our Person and we also heard something concerning the essential Trinity, the economical Trinity, and God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But many of the saints cannot tell us what God s New Testament economy is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The saints have heard many messages concerning Christ s death, but who can speak something concerning the seven aspects of Christ s death?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Very few can give a proper message on justification in a good sequence and in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is even harder for many of the saints to speak the deeper truths concerning God s economy, God s dispensation, and God s dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many messages have been published concerning the divine Trinity, but how many of us can present a full word concerning the divine Trinity according to what we have heard in the past years?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is due to the fact that we had no proper way to acquire a spiritual education.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We did not adopt the educational way by classes with a textbook.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The popular educational system in the world today is for a person to pass through elementary school, junior high school, high school, and then college.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are going to educate the saints, we must take this system.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The good point of this educational system is that it gives people the popular, the common, and the normal basic knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have come to the conclusion that we must practice this educational system in the spiritual lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why I have been burdened to publish Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The one hundred ninety-two lessons of this series are meant to be covered in four years forty-eight lessons per year.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>With these truth lessons my burden is to upgrade the standard of Christians understanding of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many Christians only have a very limited knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They know that we were once sinners destined to go to the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But God loved us and gave His Son for us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His Son came to die on the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we believe in Him, we will be forgiven of our sins and we will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then we need to live a good life and when we die we will go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the extent of the truth which many Christians have.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But now we will have a series of truth lessons that will cover all the crucial points of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the first two volumes there are lessons which give us a key view of the entire Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you read or study all these lessons, you can have a general view concerning the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The view given in these truth lessons is not in the way of today s seminaries.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>My burden is not to give people lessons concerning the history, the geography, or the literature of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I care to give people the spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The lessons on Adam, Abel, Enosh, and Enoch unveil the spiritual significance seen in these Old Testament saints.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Through two lessons we are given a key view of the Old Testament in the entire book of Genesis from Adam to Noah Lesson Seven and from Abraham to Joseph Lesson Eight .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After studying these two lessons, you have a clear view of the first book of the Old Testament and all the great men in the book of Genesis are covered.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>By this fellowship you can realize the purpose of the truth lessons.</S>
