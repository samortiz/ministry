<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. A RIVER GLADDENING THE CITY OF GOD</H2><P>Psalm 46 speaks concerning a river gladdening the city of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. God Being Our Refuge, Strength, and Help</H2><P>God is our refuge, strength, and a help in distress; He is most readily found (v. 1). God is all this to us in the city. Therefore, even though the earth changes and the mountains slip into the heart of the sea, we will not fear (v. 2). In verse 3 the psalmist says, "Let the waters of the sea roar and foam; /Let the mountains shake at its swelling."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. There Being a River<br>Whose Streams Gladden the City of God,<br>the Holy Place of the Tabernacle of the Most High</H2><P>"There is a river whose streams gladden the city of God, /The holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High" (v. 4). This river signifies the flowing of the Triune God as life to us, as mentioned in Revelation 22. The streams of this river gladden the city of God, which is the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. God Being in the Midst<br>of the City to Be Our High Retreat</H2><P>God is in the midst of the city to be our high retreat (Psa. 46:7b, 11b). The city will not be moved; God helps her at the dawn of morning (v. 5b). In verses 6 and 7 the psalmist says, "The nations rage; the kingdoms are moved./He utters His voice; the earth melts./Jehovah of hosts is with us;/The God of Jacob is our high retreat." In the city we enjoy God as our place of retreat.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. God Making Desolations on Earth</H2><P>God has made desolations on earth, and He makes wars cease unto the ends of the earth (vv. 8-9). Throughout the centuries, God has made many desolations on earth. For example, He made Hitler a desolation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. God Being Exalted among the Nations on Earth</H2><P>"Be still and know that I am God./I will be exalted among the nations; I will be exalted on earth" (v. 10). This is a word to the nations. Today the nations are raging, but one day God, who rules and reigns in the city, will command them to be still and know that He is God.</P>
