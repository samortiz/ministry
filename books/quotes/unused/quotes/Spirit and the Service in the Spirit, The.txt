In other words, we will consider what our service should be before God and with what and in what we should serve
If we want to know how we should serve before God, we need to be clear about the fundamental matter of service
The object of our service and worship is not a thing or a common person, nor is it a matter or a work; rather, it is God
If there were no God, then we would have no worship or service, and we would have no need of worship or service
God is neither a material thing nor a psychological object; He is neither a doctrine nor a concept; He is neither a theory nor an 'ism'
When you contact these various items based on your understanding of them, your contact is proper; otherwise, it is wrong
Whenever we contact God and serve God, we must know and understand what kind of God He is and what His nature is
We must also remember that since God is Spirit, He cannot be felt with our body, nor can He be contacted with our soul
Since God is Spirit, we who worship Him must worship with our spirit and in our spirit; otherwise, our worship is improper and absurd
They might be considered a kind of worship or service, but they do not constitute the true worship and the true service
God is Spirit; therefore, you cannot contact Him with outward things, with material things, with your body, or with your mind
If you touch an electrical source with a wooden stick, no electricity will be transmitted because you are using the wrong thing
Although many people often worship God, they are not moved or inspired inwardly because they do not contact God with their spirit
Neither his mind nor his body can enable him to come into contact with God or to receive inner inspiration from God
We all know that if we insert a small piece of paper or wood in an electrical outlet, the electric fan immediately stops turning
We have said many times that both the Scriptures and our experiences tell us that man is of three parts: spirit, soul, and body
The body, which has a form, is the outward, visible part of man, including the limbs and the various parts of human anatomy
Man's thoughts, intentions, preferences, and feelings of happiness, anger, sadness, or joy are all functions of the human soul
Man contacts the physical things through the body, the psychological things through the soul, and the things of God through the spirit
Outwardly man has a body that belongs to the physical realm, and inwardly he has a soul that belongs to the psychological realm
Man is higher than all the other created things on the earth because man has a spirit, which none of the others have
Although this life of the spirit of man is lower than the uncreated life of God, it is higher than all the other created lives
God put a spirit in man, that is, He created man with a spirit, because He wanted man to worship and serve Him
Even though he is in contact with the air outwardly, he still does not have a relationship with the air inwardly
To further illustrate, there is sound in the universe and God wants man to hear it, so He created man with ears
Since God desired that man contact Him, worship Him, and serve Him as Spirit, He needed to create man with a spirit, which He did
Although some animals, such as monkeys, dogs, cats, and parrots, are very intelligent and clever, none of them has a desire to worship God
Without exception among the human race, all people in the world have the inner thought and desire to worship God
If there were no food, there would be no need to have a stomach; if there were no stomach, there would also be no need to have food
If there were no God, there would be no need for the human spirit, and if there were no human spirit, man would also have no need for God
The needs of the body are physical, the needs of the soul are psychological, and the needs of the spirit are spiritual
The human body needs clothes for covering, food for eating, houses for dwelling, and the means of transportation for traveling
They are very concerned about the matters of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, which are all related to the body
A poor man eats badly, clothes himself poorly, has a problem with housing, and has difficulty in transportation
He will discover that once the problem of material needs is taken care of, then the problem of psychological needs comes
Man's need for God is a matter of the need in the spirit; it is not a matter of the intellect in the human mind
In others' eyes it seems that he is fully blessed and has no lack in anything and should therefore be very satisfied
The ears need sound, the eyes need colors, the mouth needs tasty things, the nose needs air, and the stomach needs food and water
It is not enough for man to just care for the needs of his ears eyes mouth nose and stomach man must also satisfy the need of his spirit
Even the more, if your nose could not breathe in the air and your stomach could not take in food or water, you would feel more miserable
You would give up the whole world just to be able to breathe in the air; you would rather have food and water than bars of gold
For this reason, a man often would rather give up the world and sacrifice everything in order to pursue after God and gain Him
God wants us to worship and serve Him; therefore, He prepared a faculty for us to worship and serve Him, which is the spirit within us
Please remember that there is a spirit in man that there is a need in the spirit of man and that this need is for God
If you prayed to God, worshipped Him, and contacted Him this morning, you feel inwardly refreshed and satisfied
When a person is cut by a knife or beaten with a rod, he feels pain outwardly; this is the feeling of the body
In particular, when one does something immoral or something shameful, in his depths he feels unsettled or uneasy
His intellect, his mind, his consideration, and his thought may let him go, but this feeling in his deepest part does not let him go
The spirit was created by God for man to contact Him; hence, the feeling of the spirit is especially keen with respect to God
Very often the mind and intellect of man consider the existence of God illogical, yet the spirit of man senses that there is God
Very often the mind and thought of man cannot perceive the things of God, yet the spirit of man can sense the things of God
It is through the sense of the spirit that God enables man to know Him and perceive the things that are of Him
Because man has the sense of the spirit and is able to know God and perceive the things of God, man can worship and serve God
Man is not for the existence of the body or for the enjoyment of the soul but for the service of God in spirit
The function of the spirit within man is to enable man to know God, serve God, contact God, and have fellowship with God
Just as man cannot contact God with the five senses of his body, neither can he touch God with the mind, emotion, and will of his soul
From that time on, due to sin, the spirit in man was deadened to God and had lost its function with respect to God
Man only knows that he has a body and a soul with the mind, emotion, and will; he is not aware that he has a spirit
Man realizes that he has a body to contact the physical things and a soul with the mind emotion and will to contact the psychological things
Although colors exist, he cannot touch them with his hands, smell them with his nose, or hear them with his ears
The spirit of man has lost its feeling and function, and it has become dead to such an extent that even its existence is not felt
The Bible says, 'You, though dead in your offenses and sins' and 'You, though dead in your offenses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh'
Formerly his spirit was taking the lead within, but now since his spirit is dead, his soul has assumed the leading position
It cannot contact God but can only remain in itself; it does not like to be under God's ruling but likes to act according to its own will
Their living and their behavior exhibit their hatred for others mostly according to the desire of their inborn nature of hate
Their living and their behavior show their love toward others mostly under the direction of the desire of their inborn nature of love
According to these two things-love and hate-loving others is better than hating others; loving others is right and hating others is wrong
In others words, both the one who hates and the one who loves do not hate or love out of their contact with God in their human spirit
One kind of love is of God and is by the spirit; another kind of love is of the Christian himself and is by the soul and the flesh
The Christian with the second kind of love was born with a love for others; his natural disposition is to love others
They have this kind of love without having to contact or touch God, and even without having to confess the existence of God
Even before they were saved, before they knew God, and before they confessed that there is a God, they already had such a love
Brothers and sisters, if this is being spiritual, then these ones were already spiritual before they were saved
Brothers and sisters, the Lord's salvation is not merely for us to behave well and be an outstanding, respectable person
Rather, it is for us to serve God and to contact God in all things in our daily life that we may live and express Him
In the church there is another kind of Christian whose love and virtue come from his contact with God and trust in God
Some of these believers might have been cruel and wicked previously but now they love God draw near to God and contact God with their spirit
They allow God to fill them up in their spirit so that their spirit is strengthened to overcome their soul and their flesh
Some of the brothers and sisters live this way in the spirit so that God may receive their service and worship
No matter what is being expressed in his outward living, inwardly he is always living by and according to the soul and the flesh
Through His death in the flesh He dealt with our flesh, and through His resurrection He imparted Himself as the Spirit into us
We do not merely receive Him as our Redeemer to deal with our sins, still less as a rabbi, a teacher, to teach us, as Nicodemus did
According to what the Lord was outwardly, Nicodemus regarded Him as a rabbi who came from God as a teacher to teach us
Many who saw the Lord casting out demons and healing the sick thought that He was the One who came particularly to heal them physically
Many who saw the Lord feeding the five thousand with five loaves and two fish thought that He came to do miracles to sustain them physically
They did not know that the Lord wanted to enter into them as the Spirit to be their salvation and to be with them
They knew Him only as a Savior outside of man; they did not know that He wanted to enter into man to be a Savior within man
People had this kind of understanding and consideration because they thought that their problems were merely outward
Nicodemus thought that his problem was that he lacked better teachings for his outward conduct, his outward behavior
In the early days, all those who contacted the Lord and followed Him thought that man's problems are all outside of man
Those who came to be fed with bread saw the need of their body outwardly, but they did not see the need of their spirit within
In those days the disciples saw the need for Christ outwardly; they did not see that they needed a Savior within them
No matter how much he was taught and corrected in his outward conduct or behavior, he still could not be saved inwardly
He could be of the spirit, could understand the spiritual things of God, and could participate in the kingdom of God
They did not have the intention to receive Him within to be their Savior so that the spirit within them might be healed and saved
The real need which they had and which the Lord would supply was not the outward food of the flesh but the inward spiritual life
To the disciples who followed Him, the Lord showed them how He would enter into them as the Spirit that they might live with Him
He showed Nicodemus that He is the One who is able to regenerate man, and then He led him to receive Him by exercising his faith inwardly
The Lord is now the Spirit of life in resurrection, and the Spirit is embodied in His words for man to receive
In order to receive the Spirit and life, man must not merely contact Him outwardly; rather, man must contact Him inwardly
On the evening of the day of His resurrection He came into their midst and breathed into them that they might receive the Spirit
From that time-the evening of the day of the Lord's resurrection-the Lord led His disciples to know and appreciate His presence within them
Now His presence with them would be at every moment, would not be limited by time or space, and would be invisible
It was not until they came to the village, entered into a house, and reclined at the table with Him that they recognized Him
Once a person receives Him within, immediately by His Spirit He enters into him, not into his mind, emotion, or will, but into his spirit
No matter how you try to teach his soul or improve his flesh outwardly, you cannot cause the spirit within him to be made alive
No outward method, be it ethics, education, or even religion, can be of help to the deadened spirit within man
Previously, because our spirit was deadened and we lived according to our soul and our flesh, we were neither willing nor able to serve God
Now since our spirit has been made alive, we live according to the spirit and therefore we are willing and able to serve God
The verses above show us that in the matter of service to God there are two different sources: one is the flesh and the other is the Spirit
The flesh not only profits nothing but also results in death, while the Spirit not only gives life but also imparts peace
The result of our serving God by the flesh is nothing and death whereas the result of our serving God by the Spirit is life and peace
Perhaps due to our ignorance concerning spiritual matters we may not even know that we must serve God by the spirit and not by the flesh
After we have been saved in the same way that we conduct ourselves we serve God mostly by the flesh and very little by of and in the spirit
In their consideration, there is only such a thing as man committing sin by the flesh, but not such a thing as man serving God by the flesh
Not only so, the facts also show that many indeed serve God by the flesh just as they commit sins by the flesh
Although many Christians have been saved, they still serve God by the flesh, just as the apostle Paul did before he was saved
We have already seen that God is Spirit and therefore He created man with a spirit that man may serve Him in spirit
The contact that God wants to have with man is a contact that is in the Spirit of God and in the spirit of man
Unless a person's spirit is touched by the Holy Spirit, he has no way to understand the things of God and thus he cannot serve God
It is wrong for them to have the concept that God will come upon their body and to prepare themselves to touch God with their body
If someone always expects to feel God with his body, the result will be that the demons, not God, will come upon his body
None of the parts of the soul, whether the mind, the emotion, or the will, can reach God, know God, or contact God
Some have believed in the Lord by believing the doctrines of the Bible with their mind instead of receiving the Lord with their spirit
If you ask them further whether they are saved, they will recite to you Ephesians 2:8: 'For by grace you have been saved through faith'
If you question them as to whether they are truly saved and have eternal life, they do not have the assurance and they dare not say so
They have only received the scriptural doctrines in their mind; they have not yet experienced the Lord's salvation in their spirit
Their spirit is neither moved nor dealt with by the Spirit of God in spite of the fact that their mind is affected and taught by the message
God's word may enter into man's mind through man's understanding, but God Himself can enter into man's spirit only through the Spirit
They cannot receive inspiration from the Bible nor can they touch God in their spirit through the reading of the Scriptures
Their spirit has not been touched by God in His word, and therefore they have not received the supply of God's life
They have not been moved, strengthened, enlightened, or cleansed in their spirit by God as the Spirit through His word
In their regular morning and evening prayers, they recite the same things from their mind as if they were reciting from a book
They recite something first concerning themselves and then concerning their family, the church, the nation, and the world
Every day when they pray, they recite once in this manner, and if they cannot finish it in the morning, they make it up in the evening
It only causes his heart to feel burdened and his spirit to be dry and empty, without being watered or satisfied
Very often when the brothers call a hymn or offer a prayer in the meeting, they do it with their mind and not with their spirit
The hymns they select come from the considerations in their mind based on certain needs and not from being moved in their spirit
At the time of preaching, they speak the preconceived message in a very good order from their mind according to their memory
It is no wonder that it cannot bring the audience into contact with God, nor can it cause them to be moved by God
Even in visitation and in contacting people in spiritual matters, many brothers and sisters also merely use their mind and not their spirit
Just as the mind in man's soul cannot contact God, so the emotion and will in man's soul also cannot contact God
A person's emotion might be moved and his will might be changed, yet it is possible that he still has not contacted God
A certain matter may be very spiritual, but if we do not use our spirit to contact God in that matter, we simply cannot touch God
When a person believes in the Lord, it is not enough that he receives the truth of the gospel merely with his mind
Only then can he touch the Spirit of the Lord, that is, contact the Lord Himself and receive the Lord's salvation
He may have understood and comprehended Christ in his mind, but in his spirit he has not yet contacted or touched Christ
The reason for this is that he uses his mind to study the doctrines about Christ instead of using his spirit to contact Christ Himself
He will be able to receive Christ's salvation of life and experience a change from within his spirit to his outward being
He can only contact the message itself by the mind, emotion, and will; he cannot touch the Christ in the message
The message itself, which is merely letter and knowledge, cannot afford man the salvation of life or the spiritual supply
Only the spirit can contact God and receive life through understanding the Bible and comprehending the truths by the mind
When we read the Scriptures, we must draw near to God, contact God, and have fellowship with God in our spirit through His word
Although the Bible says that we should pray also with the understanding , it does not mean that we pray only with the understanding
If we pray only with the understanding, with the mind, with the intellect, we can neither receive inspiration nor sense God's presence
To pray with the mind is to pray according to what the mind remembers and thinks, without any feeling in the spirit
Many times we first decide on what to pray and then we exercise our memory to pray with our mind according to what we have already decided
Also, we often merely pray according to a record or report of the items for prayer by repeating the items once
Of praying according to what he remembers and considers in the mind, he prays according to the sense and burden in the spirit
When he comes to the presence of God, the Spirit of God touches his spirit and causes him to feel that he is full of shortcomings before God
He just follows the feeling in his spirit to confess to God all his shortcomings before Him in order to relieve the burden in his spirit
If, without any feeling in our spirit, we still pray for it, then we are praying according to our mind and with our mind
We surely will not be able to touch God and His presence, because we are in our mind uttering a prayer of the mind
Any prayer that is uttered out of the feeling deep within us is a prayer of the spirit because it comes out of the spirit
We should pray for many matters, but we should not pray merely according to what we remember and consider in our mind
In our prayers we should follow the feeling in our spirit not only when we petition God but even when we praise and thank God
We should not praise and thank God merely according to the doctrines, knowledge, or sentiments concerning some outward things
In many instances, the activities in the meeting are carried out merely according to rules, common sense, or certain needs
These activities are all done according to one's mind or emotion, instead of being done in one's spirit according to the sense in the spirit
There is still the need to touch the feeling of God and receive His inspiration by fellowshipping and contacting Him in the spirit
If he does this, the word he preaches is merely of the knowledge, of the letter, of the mind, and not in the spirit
Even when we go to visit others, we must contact them in our spirit and according to the feeling in our spirit
Only by contacting others in the spirit with the presence of God can we touch the Spirit of God and also touch the spirit of others
Only by this can others touch the Spirit of God with their spirit and receive the supply and help from the Spirit of God in their spirit
It is difficult to find another place in the Bible which speaks of our condition in the spirit as clearly as this one
Life is the issue of the spirit, and the spirit is the source of life; therefore, by touching the spirit we touch life
In verse 6, before the apostle says that 'the mind set on the spirit is life and peace,' he says that 'the mind set on the flesh is death'
Life causes us to know the things derived from the spirit, thus enabling us to know the spirit from the positive side
Just as life enables us to know the spirit from the positive side, so death also enables us to understand the spirit from the negative side
If we thoroughly understand these four things, we can clearly know the spirit, which is decidedly related to them
In the Old Testament time, the Spirit of God only fell upon men, so that men received the power of God from without
Today in the New Testament time, the Spirit of God is not only the Spirit of power but also the Spirit of life
He further enters into man so that man may have the life of God inwardly, and He also dwells within man as the Spirit of life
We can blend into it some concentrated fruit juice that contains sugar so that it becomes a glass of sugarjuicewater a threeinone drink
The water signifies our spirit, the fruit juice concentrate represents the Spirit of God, and the sugar stands for the life of God
The spirit, in which rests the life of the Spirit of life of which we are speaking, includes the Spirit of God and our spirit
Spiritual fact and spiritual experience tell us that the Spirit mentioned here is the mingling of the Holy Spirit with our spirit
By speaking in this manner, he clearly tells us that the spirit he mentioned before is the one spirit, which is the mingling of 'the Spirit
Now when the Spirit of God enters, He not only enlivens our spirit but also adds the life of God into our spirit
When we have such feelings, we know we are setting our mind on the spirit, walking according to the spirit, and living in the spirit
The spirit itself is relatively difficult for us to sense, but we can easily sense such feelings of life in the spirit
The law of this life, or we may say this life itself as the law, approves and accepts whatever agrees with the nature of this life
All that it approves and accepts or opposes and refuses is made known by what it feels and what it desires us to feel
Since this law is the law of the spirit of life in us, the sense of this law is the sense of the spirit of life in us
The spirit of life in us is not only the place where the Spirit of God and the life of God dwell, it is also the place where the new man is
If in our outward action and behavior we mind the spirit of life within us, then we are living by the spiritual new man within us
We can say that this consciousness of being natural and peaceful is the result produced by the sense of the law of the spirit of life
If we mind the spirit of life within us, we will naturally walk and live according to the law of the spirit of life within us
The more we walk according to the spirit and live in the spirit, the richer and deeper this kind of sense within us will become
The consciousness of death makes us feel just the opposite of these-unnatural, uneasy, unrestful, and uncomfortable
All that belongs to our inward new man belongs to the spirit; likewise, all that belongs to our outward old man belongs to the flesh
Whether we set the mind on the flesh or set the mind on the soul, we are in both cases setting the mind on the flesh
We could not touch the watering and joy of life and peace, but sensed only the dryness and depression of death
If we were in the spirit and if we spoke by the spirit we would feel satisfied and restful within which means we would sense life and peace
Death not only causes us to have such depressed, empty, uneasy, and unhappy feelings but also makes us lose the sense of life
We cannot quite apprehend directly what the spirit actually is, but by the sense of the spirit, it is not difficult for us to know it
If we walk and live by closely following the sense of the spirit, then we are following the spirit and setting our mind on the spirit
These senses are from the spirit; therefore, they can cause us to touch the spirit and thereby know the spirit
The physical part refers to the body, and the metaphysical refers to the psyche, which is the soul spoken of in the Bible
We must be clear concerning the impotence of the soul in spiritual things and regard it as an important matter
Toward spiritual things they are often cold in heart; they are not only slow in understanding but also slothful in seeking
Many brothers and sisters are good, but they are not spiritual; they are good, but they do not live in the spirit
That which is included in our soul, analytically speaking, is the mind, the emotion, and the will-these three parts
Man after the fall, especially today's man, lives largely in the mind and is directed by the thoughts of the mind
Nowadays there are so many theories schools and educational methods and they all have one aim dealing with mans thought to win mans mind
Man loves, detests, rejoices, mourns, and is excited or depressed-these are all functions of the emotion in man's soul
With such people, when you reason with them in thought, it is often difficult to get through, but you can very easily move their emotion
Man decides, determines, judges, chooses, receives, and refuses-these are all functions of the will in man's soul
Just as those who are in the mind or emotion live in their mind or emotion, so those who are in the will likewise live in their will
Sometimes, no matter how you reason with them, you cannot win them over, but if you shed a few tears, you can win them over
We only need to see whether or not he acts by the mind, emotion, or will, and whether or not he lives in the mind, emotion, or will
As long as he acts and behaves by any one of these three, or as long as he lives in any one of these three, he is a soulish man
Though before men he seems to be without sin and faultless, before God his spirit is blocked, and his spiritual understanding is dull
Many brothers often use thinking to deal with spiritual things, and they use their intellect to touch the matters of the service
A man living in the mind lives in the soul and definitely becomes a soulish man with no ability to understand spiritual things
Just as the mind is the difficulty of the brothers in spiritual things, so the emotion is frequently the hindrance of the sisters
Emotion is their pitfall; it keeps them in the sphere of the soul, living by the soul and being a soulish person
Whenever one who is in the mind encounters anything, he naturally thinks through the matter again and again, considering it from many angles
One who is in the emotion unconsciously cares very much for the emotion in dealing with others and handling things
If we can recognize what kind of person is soulish, it is not difficult to realize what kind of person is spiritual
Since a soulish person lives by the mind, emotion, or will, a spiritual person must be one who does not live by these
Since a soulish person lives by the soul and not by the spirit, then a spiritual person must live in the spirit and not in the soul
They live by the spirit and in the spirit, and they allow the spirit to be the master and source of their action and behavior
The spirit in them occupies the preeminent position; it is the source of their behavior and starting point of their action
Although they use their mind, emotion, or will, they always follow the sense of the spirit in using these organs of the soul
Whenever they encounter something, they do not first use the mind, emotion, or will of the soul to contact and deal with it
Rather, they use their spirit first to touch and to sense it, seeking first in the spirit for the Lord's feeling as to this matter
The fall of man caused man to fall from the spirit to the soul so that man no longer lives by the spirit but by the soul
He wants us not only to live a faultless life, but even more to live a spiritual life, a spiritually faultless life
Although their spirit has already been enlivened, they do not know they should use their spirit and live by their spirit
Although they are wellbehaved Christians and their conduct and behavior are blameless they still are living in the soul not in the spirit
Although they know that man should contact God in the spirit, they still use the soul to touch the things of God
They find it convenient to use the mind, emotion, or will of the soul and are not accustomed to using the spirit
No matter how excellent and strong any part of our soul may be, it still cannot apprehend the things of God or understand spiritual things
We must also see that our soul and all things that belong to it have already been crucified on the cross of Christ
We must see how powerless the soul is before God, how it cannot comprehend the things of God and cannot please God
We must ask the Lord to make us see not only the impotence of the soul but also the dealing of the cross with the soul
He should fear his emotion just as he fears sin and in fear and trembling live in the spirit not being directed or influenced by his emotion
One who is in the will should see his will as the enemy of God in the things of God, as the opponent of the spirit
Rather, we should let the spirit occupy the first place to govern, direct, and employ our mind, emotion, and will
On the one hand, we can employ all the organs in the soul by our spirit, and on the other hand, we will not live by the soul
Even if one's behavior is perfect and one's living is blameless, what is lived out is still the self and not God
Perhaps our mind is sound, our emotion is clean, and our will is not crooked, but they are still the elements of the self
No matter whether we live in the mind, in the emotion, or in the will, we are not living in the spirit and therefore not living in God
Every saved person may be considered a double person in that each one has an outer man and an inner man with an outer life and an inner life
As we have said before, this is like having two kinds of lamps in your room; one is an oil lamp and the other is an electric lamp
The apostle says that we are not sufficient of ourselves for the ministry, but that our sufficiency is from God
One day he suddenly remembers two brothers who often miss the meetings, so he decides to visit them and eventually he goes
His visiting was initiated in his emotion, passed through his mind, and was decided by the will; therefore, it was entirely out of the soul
Whatever comes out of the urge of the emotion, the consideration of the mind, and the decision of the will is from the soul
We must see that even the good things in the service, such as visiting the brothers, can possibly come out from the soul
Our problem now is that the brothers and sisters everywhere are almost all doing the right things from the wrong source
It is right to love the brothers, it is right to minister to them, it is right to visit them, and it is right to help them
We must condemn the emotion the mind and the will which all belong to the soul and we must also condemn everything that comes out of them
We must realize that our emotion, mind, and will are soulish things and that whatever comes out of them are from the soul
Because we have been crucified with the Lord on the cross, everything belonging to us has also been crucified with Him
Just as God put our soul to death through the cross, so also He put all the parts of our soul to death through the cross
We condemn our emotion, our mind, and our will; as soon as we think about doing something, we condemn our thinking
If an unsaved person were to condemn his mind, emotion, and will, then he certainly would become a 'stone' person
If he were to condemn, judge, and reject the outer man while he is inwardly dead, then he naturally would become a 'wooden' person
If we are willing to let our outer shell be broken to pieces, then our inner man will be lived out from within
Even though they serve God and do His work, they do it by the soul and not by the spirit, from the outer man and not from the inner man
In this way the spirit gains the ground and the opportunity within us and is spontaneously lived out from within us
When the brother is telling you his problems, you simply return to your spirit and fellowship with God in spirit
You are in spirit, so you can touch the things within him and can recognize his flesh that is behind his words and excuses
You can speak a few living words to him from your spirit which come from God's inspiration and not from your considering
Perhaps God wants you to say to him, 'Brother, God has given you such an unreasonable wife because you are too much in your reasonings
God knows this, so He has especially given you such a precious, unreasonable wife to deal with your reasoning every day
We should not only avoid serving by our mind or by our emotion, but we should also refrain from serving by our will
We must reject the soul and render help to others out of the spirit that we may give them the spiritual supply
These works are done for the Lord but they are from the human soulfrom mans zeal mans good intention mans perception and mans opinion
Apparently, they are scriptural, but their source is neither God nor the spirit; rather, their source is man and the soul
The problem is not a matter of whether the work is right or wrong, but what the source of the work is and where the work comes from
We should condemn our zeal, judge our ideas, and reject our vigor, thereby denying everything of our self, our soul
We must stand in the death of the cross, allowing the entire outer man to be put to death by the Holy Spirit with the cross
Only this kind of service can help others to touch God, minister life to them, and solve their spiritual problems
If these functions dominate our service to God, then our spirit will lose its position and will not be able to manifest its function
They should all come out from the spirit and allow the spirit to be dominant, to have authority, and to control everything
We have lived in our mind emotion and will too deeply and for too long so it is not easy for us to be saved from them or to get out of them
It is very difficult, however, for us to not live by the self because it is not merely inside of us, but also it is simply us
It is truly hard for us not to live by the self the mind emotion and willand to live without the self by rejecting the functions of the soul
It is relatively easy not to do the things that are evil or wrong but to do the things that are good and right
We must know, though, that if we do not do things by the spirit, then what we do in our service to God does not have much weight or value
Now, however, you realize that although these things are good, they are spiritual hindrances which prevent you from touching your spirit
Once you have this realization you will hate your thinking and cleverness your sympathy and concern for others and your views and opinions
Every time you meet with some situation, you are in fear and trembling, being afraid that your mind, emotion, or will may come out first
If we are willing to do this, then we can return to our spirit to contact God and touch His feeling, thereby serving Him
There is another kind of preaching, however, which comes from God as the issue of one's contact and fellowship with God
In God's eyes, however, they all belong to death and come out of death, and they also come from man, from the soul
If we have been enlightened before the Lord, we will fear this kind of preaching and prayer more than we fear committing a gross sin
If we have the light before God, then we will fear the self doing anything of service to God more than we fear committing a sin
Rather, human cleverness, human thinking, human decisiveness, human perseverance, and human zeal are sufficient for man to do these works
Our Lord says we can bear fruit only if we abide in Him and He in us, because apart from Him we can do nothing
Otherwise, regardless of how much we can do, our work will still be condemned by God and will not be acceptable to Him
Unless God deals with you severely, it will be difficult for someone like you to realize how terrible your mind is
You are a person with a thoughtful mind, so God allows you to encounter some situations which are beyond your comprehension
When you touch him, you can still tell that he was born a very clever person, but you feel that his cleverness has been broken by God
Of using his mind, he uses his spirit first, and instead of acting according to his thinking, he acts according to the sense of his spirit
With someone who is rich in emotion and who lives in his emotion, God will also raise up environments to strike and touch his emotion
Rather, it means that his emotion has been dealt with and broken by God and can no longer occupy the first place within him
The sufferings we face and the circumstances we encounter are mostly to deal with our natural man and the things in our soul
If these things are not broken, then the spirit within, the life within, which is our inner man, cannot be released
In order to release our spirit from within, God often uses the environment to break our outer man, our outer shell
Since this treasure is put into an earthen vessel, it is not easily manifested, so God must come in to break the earthen vessel
The afflictions we have due to God's dealing and breaking are just like death working in us to break us as earthen vessels
Although the outer man is decaying, the inner man, the regenerated spirit, is being renewed and is growing stronger day by day
Regardless of how good the things released from our outer man-our soul-are, they are not the treasure within us
If you are a thoughtful person, God will raise up circumstances to deal particularly with your mind in order to break it and tear it down
After we are saved or revived in our pursuit of the spiritual growth God comes to us not to build up but to tear down what we originally had
If we know this and have this experience, we will be able to discern if a person's service is from the spirit or from the soul
We still must ask and touch whether his strengths, good points, and being right are from the spirit or from the soul
You will be able to sense that this brother, although he is good and right, is living actually in the soul and has never been broken
Whenever he encounters a situation, he lets his spirit come in first, and only then does he use his mind, emotion, and will
The Spirit of God has the ground within him and rules not only in his spirit but also in his mind, so his mind becomes sharper and wiser
Since the Spirit of God reigns in him and enters into his inward parts to such an extent, it is no wonder that he is wise!
Every spiritual person is rich in emotion because the God who has entered him and filled his emotion is rich in emotion
Like the spiritual apostle Paul, they are truly joyful when they are happy and truly sorrowful when they are sad
The Holy Spirit within him has the ground and is able to enter and reign in every part of his being, including his mind, emotion, and will
Every part of his being, under the strengthening and control of the Holy Spirit, not only becomes stronger but also is used properly
Just as serving God by the letter is actually serving God by ourselves, so also serving God by the Spirit is serving God by God Himself
If our service is not from the first source, then it is from the second source, and if it is not from ourselves, then it is from God
It can be carried out by us outside of God and independently of God, without any need to rely on God, seek God, or fellowship with God
It requires us to rely on God, seek God, fellowship with God, be in God, and absolutely take God as our source
In order to have this kind of service, we must be in fellowship with God; we cannot act independently of God, God and we being separated
A service which is from God and has spiritual value must be one in which we are joined to God and in fellowship with Him by abiding in Him
Rather, it originates with Christ and comes from Christ and is prayed by the Christ abiding in us to the Christ sitting on the throne
Any kind of service must be a service rendered through us by the God abiding in us to the God sitting on the throne
We cannot merely think of Him one minute and then immediately serve Him zealously without contacting Him or being mingled with Him
The apostle said that his service in the new covenant was not from himself or by himself; it was from God and by God
It is true that he served God, but it was more a matter of God operating in him and bringing him along to serve God
In this way God was able to gain all the ground in him and to operate in him through His Spirit, motivating him to work and serve
God's life became his life, God's nature became his nature, God's feeling became his feeling, and God's view became his view
We must meet Him, touch Him, and contact Him inwardly in order to be able to render the service which is from Him
You cannot say that because you were able to give a good message yesterday, so today you can give the same message again
Service to God is carried out not by relying on experience but by depending on God through fellowship and contact with Him
Some have often said to me Brother Lee teach us some of the secrets of service because once we have the secrets we will be able to do it
On the first day it turns, it must contact the electricity, and on the last day it turns, it still must contact the electricity
If this were the case, what he would do would be merely a work, and God's element could not be found in his work
We must set aside our excitement, thoughts, and opinions to allow Him to gain the ground in us, to fill us, and to operate in us
These five men did not hold a meeting for discussion or use their mind to think and then make a decision to send two of them out to work
Under these circumstances, the Lord was able to get through and operate in them, thus sending them out to preach the gospel
When people came across this kind of work, what they felt and obtained was not a thing, but God and the life of God
When we fellowship with God in this way and allow Him to occupy us, He can easily reveal His heart's desire to us and flow Himself out of us
The way is this: You should turn yourself to God, allow Him to occupy your every part, and give Him the first place in every part
If you give God the ground and opportunity, then it will be easy for God to operate in you, causing you to receive a commission and a burden
The center and goal of the service of the saints and of the church are not to build up an enterprise or a work but to minister God's life
It does not matter what profession the worldly people are infarming business industry education all emphasize having a successful enterprise
God's desire is that the emphasis of our service be on ministering God's life instead of producing a work or enterprise
He measures our service and work only by how much of His element people have gained and been filled with inwardly
It is not that our service, our work, is weighty if we gain a few more people, do a few more activities, and obtain a few more things
Some do not have the divine life yet, but after our contact with them and our help to them, God's life gets into them
Our service and work should only minister God's life to people and should only use God's life to attract people
When people come to our meetings, we should give them the sense that they have touched the spirit, met God, and received the supply of life
When we abide in Him, live in Him, and fellowship with Him like this, we allow Him to pass through us and flow out from us
We must always remember that the service of the church is God's flowing out to supply others with the divine life
