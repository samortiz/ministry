   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SIGN OF REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now proceed to chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we have the signs of regeneration vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1-8 , the brass serpent vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>9-16 , and the bride vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>22-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some may be surprised to hear that regeneration is a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In chapter three of John there is a definite ground for us to say that regeneration is a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verse 2 Nicodemus said to the Lord Jesus, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that the subject of Nicodemus' conversation with the Lord is the signs He was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After Nicodemus referred to these signs, the Lord answered and said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God" v. 3 . Does this not indicate that being born anew is a sign? The Lord Jesus seemed to be saying to Nicodemus, "You are talking about signs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I would like to speak about a sign that is certainly worthy of consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the sign of signs, the sign of being born anew."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Regeneration, therefore, is indeed a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE REALITY OF REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have pointed out that the Gospel of John is a book of mysteries and that these mysteries are divine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do you not believe that our being regenerated is a mystery?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No doubt, our regeneration is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do you understand fully what regeneration is?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Can you analyze it?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Can you explain adequately what happened to you when you were regenerated?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Can regeneration be studied scientifically in a laboratory?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Scientists may say that there is no such thing as regeneration, for it is beyond their ability to analyze it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we say that regeneration is a mystery, unbelieving scientists would say that this is altogether something unreal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But we would declare, "Regeneration is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Your pride in your scientific knowledge is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Regeneration is much more real than you are.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nothing you have and nothing you are is real.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everything is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But our regeneration is the reality in human life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can testify that in human experience nothing is as real as regeneration."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What in our human life is more real than regeneration?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suppose you have a gold coin in your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That coin, of course, is real.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You can look at it and touch it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But a gold coin is not as real as regeneration is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Regeneration is the greatest reality in human life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But although regeneration is a reality, we cannot analyze it or understand it thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, because regeneration is a mystery, it is also a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I can testify that after I was regenerated many things happened to me that I could not understand or explain.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Has this not been your experience as well?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Young people, since you have been regenerated, have your parents not had difficulty explaining certain things that have happened to you?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The parents of a young brother may say, "What has happened to our son?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is quite different now from what he was before.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As time goes by, he seems more and more different.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We cannot explain what has happened, but we know definitely that he is not the same."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is an illustration of regeneration being a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A person who has been regenerated bears a sign upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every genuine Christian, every one who has been born of God, bears such a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Anyone who claims to be a Christian but who does not have the sign of regeneration is a pseudo-Christian, a false believer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Regeneration is a sign, and every one who has been regenerated bears this sign.</S>
