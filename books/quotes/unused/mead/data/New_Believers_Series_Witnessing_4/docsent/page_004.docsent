   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is truly tremendous!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When a person receives the Lord Jesus as his Savior and confesses Him as the Son of God, he is doing a great thing, a tremendous thing.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What a great and tremendous discovery this is!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Among the billions of men throughout history, he has suddenly found out that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is indeed a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We would marvel if someone were to discover an angel among us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How much more marvelous is it when someone discovers the Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not know how many million times more superior the Lord is than the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no comparison between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The angels are far, far inferior to our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here was a man on his way to bind all those who believed in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But after he fell and rose up, he went into the synagogues and proclaimed that Jesus is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He either was mad or had received a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was not mad.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Indeed, he had received a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He actually had met the One among millions of men who is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Like Paul, you also have met this Man among men, the One who is the Son of God.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You surely will proclaim aloud, "Jesus is the Son of God!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How can a person sit still and act as if nothing has happened when he has believed in the Lord Jesus and is saved?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a person has believed in the Lord Jesus and yet does not feel anything, if he considers this to be nothing marvelous or special, we doubt whether he has believed at all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here is something great, marvelous, extra- ordinary, special, beyond all imagination Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God.</S>
