   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Overcoming Mammon</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Have Spiritual Power</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In church history the Moravian church was the group that had the strongest mission.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Its founder, Count Zinzendorf, gave up all his possessions for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sister Eva also gave up all that she had.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A few decades ago, seven Englishmen came to China to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They were known as the Cambridge Seven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Among them was C. T. Studd, who was a cricket champion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He had received an inheritance of two hundred fifty thousand pounds, which equals 1.2 million U.S. dollars, and he gave it all away.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When he told the British Consulate that he was going to China, the Consulate General was shocked by his consecration and dared not accept his application.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After a week Mr. Studd was still firm concerning his decision.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God could use Mr. Studd in a great way because he had overcome mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Mammon stands in opposition to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason, every child of God has to overcome the power of mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If anyone does not overcome its power, he will have no spiritual power.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The power of mammon does not lie in how much mammon a person possesses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Its power on the poor may be stronger than its power on the rich.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Working Only to Sustain Our Living,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not to Make Money</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason, no Christian should try to make money.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Men think that it is wrong to make money by unrighteous means and that it is right to make money by righteous means.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But mammon itself is unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Just as God Himself is righteous, mammon itself is unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Luke 16 speaks of making friends with the "mammon of unrighteousness'' v. 9 . Money is intrinsically unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Its nature is contrary to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to be clear about the position money occupies.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we are not clear, it will be difficult for us to go on as a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christians cannot try to make money from the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do, we lose our Christian standing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We say that our Father is over and above everything and that we are His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet if we would try to make money from the rickshaw coolies, whether it is ten thousand or twenty thousand dollars, it would be a shame to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are only two kinds of people on this earth, the unbelievers and the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot make money from the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What then about making money from the brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Would we not feel ashamed to make money from our brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, no one can neglect dealing with money properly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A Christian cannot make money; he can only work to sustain his living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>OCCUPATIONS God Having Ordained That Man</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Take Up Occupations That Involve Manual Labor</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The second question is occupations.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What are the occupations that God wants?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's will for man is that he has to eat bread in the sweat of his face Gen 3:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Old Testament God ordained that Adam had to till the ground and that Abel had to tend to the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Men like Abraham and Jacob were all herdsmen.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Genesis 4 speaks of the "artificer in brass and iron'' v. 22 . All these are manual labor.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the New Testament the apostles were fishermen, and Paul was a tentmaker.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These are also occupations that involve manual labor.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul said that to the one who works, his wages are accounted according to what is due Rom 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Occupations that are based on one's labor are proper occupations, for they have no element of money-making.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Such kinds of occupations increase and add to the value of the goods.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You cannot consider these kinds of occupations as making money; they are merely a selling of our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There are only a finite number of things in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Suppose there were only ten thousand cattle in the world, and through my farming there are now eleven thousand; my labor has caused the world to have one thousand more cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Suppose there was only one stalk of wheat, and through my farming there are now thirty stalks or one hundred stalks.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is to cause an increase in value.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Why do I gain some money?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is because I have caused the world to have ninety-nine stalks more.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Paul brought the material home, sewed it into a tent in the night, and sold it the next morning.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The money he made came from the work of sewing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, if you buy five rolls of fabric, store it away until the price for the fabric is high, and then sell it, you have made your money without increasing the value of the fabric by one bit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We cannot engage ourselves in this kind of business.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All the occupations that do not increase the value of the goods must be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have to have a turn in our mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The mentality of many people is focused on money, not on value.</S>
