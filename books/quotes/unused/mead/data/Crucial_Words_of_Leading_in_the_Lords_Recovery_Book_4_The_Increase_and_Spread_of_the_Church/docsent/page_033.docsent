   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE CONTENT OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SMALL GROUP GATHERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will consider a point that is crucial to the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The success and survival of the small groups hinge upon the content of the small group gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have heard many encouraging testimonies regarding the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Most of these testimonies speak of the effectiveness of the small groups in recovering the dormant saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>While these testimonies are good, the small groups should do more than specialize in recovering dormant saints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to study more aspects so that the small groups can have more functions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we start counting from the summer of 1950, the Lord s recovery has been in Taiwan for the past thirty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In these thirty-five years we have baptized more than one hundred thousand believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Recently, we counted the information cards for the church in Taipei, and there was a total of more than fifty-eight thousand forms.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since the number of saints in the church in Taipei typically makes up half of the total number of saints in the churches in Taiwan, there should be more than one hundred ten thousand saints in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, there are at most fifteen thousand saints who are in the church life in Taiwan at the moment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This shows that there are close to one hundred thousand saints who are not meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we estimate the number of saints who have left the country or passed away to be ten thousand, then there should still be ninety thousand saints that we need to find and bring back to meet with us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A brother who is a doctor testified that quite a few of the directors in the hospital where he works are brothers who have not met with us for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These ninety thousand saints are scattered among Taiwan s eighteen million people, like drops of water in a great lake.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must find them and bring them back.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I beg all the churches to pay attention to the information cards.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These cards are our gold mines, and we should dig much gold from them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church in Taipei has more than fifty-eight thousand information cards, but not more than five or six thousand people meet regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we calculate those who have left the country or passed away to be five thousand people, then there are still more than forty-five thousand who need to be located.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we must exert some effort.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We entreat all the meeting halls and group gatherings to pick up this burden and seek out the lost ones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The churches should study their information cards to find those who are not meeting and bring them back.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE FOCUS OF</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE SMALL GROUP GATHERINGS Retaining the Existing Saints</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There are three matters that must be the focus of our groups.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First, we must keep the existing ones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we preached the gospel and baptized new believers in the past twenty-eight years, we did not have a proper way to retain them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result, many of the newly baptized ones left.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If half of the fifty-eight thousand people had remained in the church life, the churches would have a completely different look today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, the small groups must focus on retaining the existing ones and not allow them to be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Recovering the Dormant Saints</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Second, in order to recover the dormant saints, we must cooperate with the churches to locate and bring back those for whom we have information cards.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This may seem like we are looking for needles in a haystack, but it still must be done.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since they are our family members, we must by all means find them and bring them back.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, all the churches on the island need to use the information cards to recover the saints, making an effort to seek them out one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to sort the information cards, we need to use computers to establish a clear filing system.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The records of the saints who are deceased should be put into one file but should not be discarded or burned; this is our history, and it must be kept in a proper manner.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The records of those who have gone abroad must also be sorted out.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should locate where they are living and determine if they are meeting with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After we enter this data into the computer, we can know at the touch of a key how many brothers and sisters have passed away, how many have gone abroad, and how many are in other various situations.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is something we need to do urgently.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In addition, we also need to discuss a new publication, New Way and New Doors.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have decided to publish a global church newsletter in English, Chinese, and Spanish.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It will be typeset and mailed to different places for printing and distribution.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the first six issues, we will print a global list of more than six hundred local churches, including the date when the saints began to meet in the locality, the number of saints on the name list, and the number of those who meet regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Note: This information was subsequently published separately as A Table of the Churches in the Lord s Recovery in 1985.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Using the computer to analyze our information cards will be a tremendous help to this effort.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The editorial office for this publication will be in Anaheim, where we have both Chinese and English editors.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If a church receives a request, please write down the initial and the present condition of the church, the address of its meeting hall, and the number of saints who meet.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I believe this will be a great help to the churches throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For example, there is a small church in France, and if the brothers and sisters there are able to read New Way and New Doors, they will be very encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Similarly, those who are able see the situation in the more than one hundred churches from Mexico to Argentina will be encouraged as well, and their burden for prayer will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the same way, many will be able to read about the current situation in the churches in Taiwan, and they will be encouraged.</S>
