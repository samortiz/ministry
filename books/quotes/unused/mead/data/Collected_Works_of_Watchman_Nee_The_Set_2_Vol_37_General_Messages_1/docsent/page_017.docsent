   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEEP EXPERIENCES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Writing to the Corinthians, Paul said, "To boast is necessary, though indeed not expedient" 2 Cor 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He admitted that it was "not profitable" Gk. for himself to write what he wrote in 2 Corinthians 12.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But for the sake of others he had to do it; he was obliged to speak of "visions and revelations of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brothers and sisters, this should be our attitude also.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many of us cannot stand the test of visions and revelations; as soon as we have a little experience, we blow the trumpet, and everyone knows about it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul knew that it was of no profit to himself to mention the Lord's visions and revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why then did he mention them?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was forced to do so because some doubted his apostleship, and there were problems concerning the foundation of the Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Did Paul disclose all his revelations?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Far from it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He wrote, "I know a man who is himself in Christ, fourteen years ago whether in the body I do not know, or outside the body I do not know; God knows such a one was caught away to the third heaven" v. 2 . He did not divulge this experience until fourteen years later.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What depth there was in Paul!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It would be a wonder if we could hide away something we received from God for seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But for fourteen years Paul never divulged his experience; for fourteen years God's church knew nothing of it; for fourteen years not one of the apostles had heard of it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul's roots were deep beneath the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some people would be inclined to say, "Paul, let us hear all about that experience of yours fourteen years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Tell us about your experience in the third heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It would be most helpful for us to know the whole story."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But he said, "I know such a man whether in the body or outside the body, I do not know; God knows , that he was caught away into Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not allowed for a man to speak" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To this present day this experience of Paul's has not been uprooted; still no one knows about that experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brothers and sisters, this matter of root is a matter of extreme importance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you want to have Paul's work, then you need to have Paul's "root"; if you want to have Paul's outward conduct, then you need to have Paul's inner life; if you want to have Paul's manifest power, then you need to have Paul's secret experience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The trouble with Christians today is that they cannot keep any spiritual thing or any special experience undisclosed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As soon as they have a little experience, they have to tell it abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They live their lives before men; nothing is hidden within them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They do not have any root.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May God show us Paul's experience, and may He lead us into having depth!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>SUPERFICIAL LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Isaiah 39 we are told that when the news of Hezekiah's sickness and recovery reached the Babylonian court, messengers were dispatched with letters and a present for Hezekiah.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hezekiah had been a recipient of the grace of God, but he was unable to stand the test of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's Word says, "And Hezekiah was glad for them and showed them his treasury, the silver and the gold, and the spices and the precious oil, and his whole armory and everything which was found among his treasures" v. 2 . Hezekiah could not overcome the temptation to display everything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He had just been wonderfully healed of his sickness and no doubt felt self-important and thought there were few people in the world who had had such a remarkable experience as he.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After all, how many had been given such a marvelous sign at the time of their healing as the shadow on the dial of Ahaz going back ten degrees Isa 38:8, KJV ?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In his elation Hezekiah displayed all his treasures.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that he had not passed through the dealing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His natural life was not dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was apparent that all his roots were exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whatever Hezekiah knew and whatever he had were known to the Babylonians.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because of this exposure, Isaiah said to him, "Hear the word of Jehovah of hosts: Behold, the days are coming when everything which is in your house and which your fathers have laid up as a treasure unto this day will be carried away to Babylon; nothing will be left, says Jehovah" 39:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The measure in which we display things to others will be the measure of our own loss.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The measure in our life that we exhibit before others will be the measure we give up in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a solemn matter, and it demands our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Alas, so many people cannot forbear disclosing their experiences!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They have to speak to their heart's delight.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is like Hezekiah opening up his treasures to others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A brother once said, "Many of the brothers fall sick, and when they recover, they give their testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I wish I could develop some sickness but not a fatal one and that God would heal me; then I would have something to say at the next testimony meeting."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This brother's motive for healing was to be able to give a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He sought an experience in order to have something to talk about.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This superficial kind of living brings grave loss to us; it rules out the possibility of spiritual progress.</S>
