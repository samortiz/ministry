   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN SPIRITUAL RECOVERIES AMONG US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The spiritual recoveries among us are the most precious part of our history.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The history of how God has blessed us is focused not on acts or actions but on spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The sequence of these spiritual recoveries is very meaningful, just as it was with God s recoveries in Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not be proud, but we should speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE RECOVERY OF THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All of the truth recovered among us began with the matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The gospel was preached in China for many years, and many lovers of the Lord gave themselves to sow the seeds of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, the Chinese believers were not clear about the matter of salvation until God began to work among us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1933 I went to Soochow to preach the gospel in an evangelistic hospital run by the Presbyterians.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was a large hospital, having fifty or sixty students in its nursing school alone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I was invited to stay at the hospital and preach the gospel to the nursing school students.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I had the Lord s presence, and almost all the students who had not been saved were clearly saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once they invited me to preach the gospel in the hospital s chapel, and I preached from John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I told them that although they may have believed, they needed to know whether they had eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was a heavy word, and it was striking to the ears.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The presiding pastor was off to the side of the room, and his gestures indicated that he did not agree with me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He kept making faces at me, trying to stop me from speaking in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I pointed my finger at him and said, You are a pastor, and you still do not know whether you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Later, this pastor told some people that I was wrongly preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He said that no good Christian could know with certainty whether he was saved until the judgment at the great white throne.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was the prevailing atmosphere in Christianity in those days.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>People were saved, but they did not understand the truth regarding the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The recovery of the assurance of salvation began when Brother Nee published several messages concerning salvation, such as The Assurance of Salvation and Do You Know that You Are Saved?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Subsequently, many brothers and sisters in China gave testimonies of being clear about their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The struggle for this truth continued until Japan invaded China; the Sino-Japanese War began before this truth prevailed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Initially, the battle for this truth was severe; many pastors rose up and accused us of being too bold and too proud.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They said, Even as elderly pastors, we do not dare say that we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have simple experiences and think that you can say that you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, the truth that a person is saved as soon as he believes is now preached everywhere; even those who formerly opposed us are preaching this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this matter we fought the good fight.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Luther recovered the way of salvation through justification by faith, but he did not recover the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The assurance of salvation was first recovered by the Brethren, and the booklet Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment by George Cutting made this truth clear.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment ranks third in sales worldwide after only the Bible and The Pilgrim s Progress.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although people were saved in the past, they did not know that they were saved, and they did not have the joy of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since they did not know that they were saved, they did not have the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>George Cutting testified that people can not only be saved by faith but that they can immediately know that they are saved and thereby have the joy of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This truth was recovered in the West; the recovery of the assurance of salvation among us began after this truth was released by the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The assurance of salvation has been fully recovered among Chinese Christians; not only do we confess this truth, but also all the orthodox preachers confess it as well.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the first item of the recovery the assurance of salvation.</S>
