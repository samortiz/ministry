   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Bronze, Signifying</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Testing of God s Judgment</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Bronze signifies the testing of God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ as a man was tested again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was tested throughout His life on earth, and He was tested when He stood before the priests, Herod, and Pilate to be tried and sentenced to death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Moreover, Christ was tested by God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Every day of His life Christ was under God s testing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In typology bronze signifies the testing of God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the reason the altar in the outer court was built with bronze instead of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The altar is a means and a place of testing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As such, it typifies the cross as both the means and the place where we are tested by God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The brass serpent lifted up on a pole in Numbers 21:9 was a type of Christ as the One who was made in the likeness of the flesh of sin and lifted up on the cross to be judged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Just as the serpent was lifted up on the pole, Christ was lifted up on the cross to be tested by God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In every way He stood God s test and passed through it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Daily we also are under God s testing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The kind of life we have at home, at work, and at school is subject to God s test.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What a brother says to his wife will be tested by God, and the attitude of a young person toward his teachers and classmates at school will also be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God will even test our motives, intentions, and all that is in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we experience God s testing, we gain not only gold and silver, but also bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This causes us to be a different kind of person, a person who is not careless about the way he behaves, speaks, and expresses his attitudes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A person who experiences the bronze is a person under the cross, under God s test.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Under God s testing, a young person may be examined by Him when he is about to say or do a certain thing at school.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A brother will also experience God s testing in relation to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Suppose he intends to say a strong word to her.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At that point the Lord may test him, and he will realize that he should not utter such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead of saying a negative word to his wife, the brother may say a positive word to the Lord, telling Him, Lord, how wise and how good You are!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I love You, Lord, and I love my family.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through such an experience, the brother will gain some experience of bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First we should gain bronze from our daily experience with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we should bring it to the meetings and, as we function by exercising our spirit, offer it to the Lord as a heave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This bronze, experienced and possessed by us, is also material used for the building of God s tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Onyx Stone, Signifying Christ s</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Redemptive Work as the Base</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>for the Spirit s Transforming Work</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The onyx stone mentioned in 25:7 was red in color.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This onyx stone signifies Christ s blood shed for redemption as a base for the Spirit s transforming work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ s redemption is the basis for the transforming work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Other Precious Stones, Signifying</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>the Transformation of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The other precious stones signify different aspects of the transforming work of the Holy Spirit based on Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The experience of the onyx is the basis for the experience of the other precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As we have pointed out, this means that Christ s redemption is the foundation for the transforming work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all need to experience the Spirit s transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, we need to love our parents, relatives, neighbors, and especially the brothers and sisters in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God, however, does not accept our natural love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In His sight, our natural love is clay, not precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We may feel very positively about our natural love, but to God it is loathsome and uncomely.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our love needs to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need a love that is transformed by the Spirit with Christ s redemption, termination, and replacement as the basis.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then we shall love others with a pure love, a love which is the product of the precious transforming work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To love others in this way is very different from loving them in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should not be satisfied with our natural morality, ethics, character, or behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All these things need to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First we must be redeemed, terminated, and replaced and then transformed metabolically by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the experience of the precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we bring these precious materials to the meetings of the church and offer them to God as a heave offering, we shall help to build the church as God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then our meetings will be filled with the offering of such precious materials and a wonderful work of building will take place among us.</S>
