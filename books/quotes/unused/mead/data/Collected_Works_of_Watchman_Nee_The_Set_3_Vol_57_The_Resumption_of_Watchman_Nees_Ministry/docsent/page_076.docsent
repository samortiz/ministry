   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE DESOLATION OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE ADVANCE OF THE CHURCH Church Conference Date: April 19, 1948, Friday, evening</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Witness Lee: First I would like to explain the nature of this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The purpose of this meeting is to share with the majority of the brothers and sisters the things that we, the co-workers, have been discussing for the last few days.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I will first begin with a question: From the Bible and from church history, what is the way for us to serve in the church?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brother Watchman Nee: We have to ask first of all if the church has taken a different stand with respect to its service to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Is the church different today in its stand toward service?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here we have two absolutely contradictory views.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many people do not realize that the church is in desolation on the one hand and is advancing on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE DESOLATION OF THE CHURCH Beginning from the Time of the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The way that the church has taken for the past two thousand years has become progressively poorer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In God's view the church is fully in desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We see many sins and errors existing in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From the Bible we see that even the early churches were already in desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During Paul's time there were already false shepherds, false prophets, and false apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The condition at Ephesus seemed to be better.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet in reality it was also in desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Philippians Paul said that all were seeking after their own things and no one was seeking after the things of Jesus Christ 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Second Timothy was written by Paul right before he died.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There we see also the condition of the desolation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First Timothy speaks of the elders and the deacons 3:2, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But in 2 Timothy Paul could only entrust the testimony to the faithful ones 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was as if he was saying that even the elders and the deacons had become untrustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1 Timothy he spoke concerning how the elders had to be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But in 2 Timothy he could only concede that there were wooden and earthen vessels in the great house 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Second Peter tells us that at Peter's time some had betrayed the Lord and denied Him 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By the Middle Ages the church had become degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was not carried into Babylon at the fourth century; it had already fallen into desolation at the time of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is why judgment begins from the house of God 1 Pet 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John's Epistles were written thirty years after Paul's Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In John's Epistles we see that some had even denied Jesus as the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They did not acknowledge that Christ had come in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These were those who had come as the antichrists 1 John 2:22; 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, the book of Revelation, written between A.D. 90 and A.D. 95, speaks of seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Other than two that did not receive a rebuke, the remaining five received severe rebukes Rev 2 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the way from the degradation of Ephesus to the Lord's vomiting of Laodicea out of His mouth, there was a continuation of degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The lampstand at Ephesus was removed, and Laodicea was vomited out of the Lord's mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although there were some recoveries in between, it was a situation of desolation for the most part.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The book of Jude has only one chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It tells of some who had crept into the church unnoticed v. 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Historically speaking, the situation of desolation continued.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From the second century forward, the Roman Catholic Church was formed in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>During the second to the third century, the practice of the local church was abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By the fourth century, at the time of Constantine, the formal church was established.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the early churches once a man believed in the Lord, he immediately dropped the world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The believers did not work for money, but for the sake of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The saints had all things in common.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The brothers and sisters continued steadfastly in meeting and in the apostles' teachings Acts 2:42-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because those who believed risked everything to believe, many were afraid to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Acts says that three thousand and then five thousand were added into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But it is possible that a few times more than three thousand and five thousand people had not dared to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many people would say that to go in this way would cost them their name and position.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Pentecost not only brought in people; it also kept people away.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Pentecost is something that cannot be touched.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once a man touches it, it ruins his life.</S>
