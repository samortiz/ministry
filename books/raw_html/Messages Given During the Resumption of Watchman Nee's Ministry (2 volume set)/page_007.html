<H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matthew 11:1-19</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT BEING CAUSED TO STUMBLE BY THE LORD</H2><P>The passage we just read records how men were caused to stumble by the Lord. Here John the Baptist must have been extremely puzzled by Christ. Why would Christ not do something spectacular, such as healing the blind and the lame? Before this time, John the Baptist gave a strong testimony for Jesus, declaring that Christ is the Lamb of God and that He came to take away the sin of the world (John 1:29). A second time he declared, "Behold, the Lamb of God!" (John 1:36). When Christ was baptized, John saw the Holy Spirit descending upon Him (John 1:32). However, here John was caused to stumble by the work of Christ. Formerly he told others that he was not worthy to untie the thong of Christ's sandal (John 1:27). Now he was sending men to Christ and was pressing Him to answer honestly if He was the Christ.</P><P>At the same time, it would have been possible for Christ to be caused to stumble by John the Baptist as well. John was supposed to be Elijah. He was supposed to be very successful. Why is it that he ended up in prison now, and why is it that he failed today? However, the Lord was not caused to stumble by John.</P><P>Today, many people are caused to stumble by the Lord. They are caused to stumble by the way Christ lived. John's food was locusts and wild honey; his clothing was of camel's hair (Matt. 3:4). You cannot find such clothing even in a fur store. Yet when Christ came, He ate and He drank. He was absolutely the opposite of John the Baptist. For this reason, men were caused to stumble by Him. It is easy for a person to have a preconceived idea of what a spiritual man should be, and if anyone does not fit such a pattern, this person would be caused to stumble.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT BEING CAUSED TO STUMBLE<br>BY ANYTHING OR ANYONE</H2><P>Around 1921, there were about fifty students in Trinity College in Foochow. They all became Christians through my preaching. At that time, I was trying to use Miss Barber's baptistry to baptize them. Miss Barber asked who the baptizer would be. I told her that the Bible indicates that whoever preaches to another is qualified to baptize that one. Miss Barber said that it was better to let Leland Wang baptize these ones because he was older than I was. Later I tried to recommend Brother Dan-wu Wu, for he was twelve years older than I was, and he was of course older than Leland Wang. However, Miss Barber insisted that Leland should be the baptizer. When I brought up the matter of age, Miss Barber remained unchanged about her choice. I then said, "Since you had already made up your mind in the first place to have Leland do the baptizing, why did you bring up the matter of age?" In spite of this, I was not caused to stumble.</P><P>Once Miss Barber wrote me a letter and told me definitely not to come to one of her meetings. Nevertheless, when the time of the meeting came, I went, by forcing my way through the door, so to speak. When Miss Barber saw me, she said, "It is so good that you have come. I have many things to talk over with you. I need your help." In this instance, I was not caused to stumble by Miss Barber either.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY TO AVOID BEING CAUSED TO STUMBLE&#151;<br>LAYING ASIDE THE OUTWARD APPEARANCES<br>AND REALIZING THE SPIRITUAL REALITY</H2><P>We have to realize the spiritual reality behind everything that God has arranged. We should not consider merely the superficial outward appearances. There may be a thousand things along the way that could cause you to stumble, but what you have to do is to lay aside all these things and look straight ahead at the spiritual reality, rather than to be affected by the apparent errors.</P><P>In 1926 at White Teeth Lake, one day I saw an article by Mr. Jeffrey in the magazine Witness and Testimony. After Miss Barber saw that same article, she told me that Mr. Jeffrey would soon be separated from us. I did not quite agree with her, and I said to her, "You just like to make big assertions and outlandish remarks. This is your temperament." However, after one or two months, Mr. Jeffrey did indeed separate himself from us. Later, when I was in India, I met him and asked why he left. I told him what Miss Barber had told me. After he heard those words, he resolved to take care of the problem on that very day. Immediately, he bought a ticket and sailed home to England to apologize to Mr. Sparks, because at the time he left the latter, he had spoken something against him. Today, men are easily caused to stumble by small things. We need the grace of the Lord that we will not be caused to stumble by anything or anyone.</P>
