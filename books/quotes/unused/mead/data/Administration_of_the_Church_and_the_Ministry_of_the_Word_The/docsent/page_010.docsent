   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Everyone Receiving a Burden</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Serving the Lord according to Burden</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Everyone who serves the Lord must receive a burden and have a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This also applies to the sisters even though they are not involved in the church administration or in giving messages.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the sisters fellowship together and visit people simply because it is time to do so, they are doing so out of obligation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The sisters should seek to know the result of their fellowship and visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They should know the condition of the sisters under their care.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They should not say, As long as the Lord works in them, they will be all right, but if the Lord does not work in them, there is nothing we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must receive a genuine burden.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even though many sisters have the desire to serve the Lord, few have risen up to serve the Lord lately.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The brothers, however, continue to serve as usual.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should sense that the situation with the sisters is not right and receive the burden to stir them up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We also need to study the result of our gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should consider why many remain unsaved even though there are so many sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some brothers should rise up to receive the burden to preach the gospel until someone is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must have a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The problem is that we are gradually leaning toward responsibility in our service; we lack a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since our prayers are mostly without burden, our prayer meetings are ineffective.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If someone is saved when we preach the gospel, we thank and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If no one is saved, we are at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we give messages, we are at peace even if there is no effect.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The same applies to the administration of the church and visiting the brothers and sisters; we are at peace even if there is no result.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since this is our condition, our prayer is a prayer of obligation, not a prayer with burden.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we pray with a burden, our prayer meeting will be different.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some brothers and sisters will weep bitterly and mourn in prayer, feeling that they cannot go on in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They will feel that the gospel preaching, the administration of the church, and the condition of their meeting are unsatisfactory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This kind of prayer is out of a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some say that it is easy to lose their burden after a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, those who have been shown mercy receive burdens continually.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is a serious problem if our burden disappears after we have worked for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, a Christian can continue to work out of obligation even though he has no burden, because his conscience will bother him if he stops working.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever our service becomes a matter of fulfilling an obligation, our service has already degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Genuine service is not a matter of obligation but a matter of burden; burden always goes beyond obligation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE SECOND PROBLEM</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>LACKING A FEELING FOR COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Another problem among us is that although the serving ones are capable, they do not have a feeling for coordination in their spirit when they come together to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It seems as if everyone is able to serve without others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Consequently, few among us have the spirit of a learner and the spirit of needing help.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who truly coordinate in spirit should have a strong feeling that they cannot do anything without the help and coordination of others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our present coordination is one of formality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They do their part without needing anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may not argue, but there is not much interdependence in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This shows that our spirit of service is improper.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the situation of those who work with the young people and the children.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The coordination is formal; everyone does what he should do when it is his turn.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is cooperation, not coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Coordination means that we cannot do anything without one another.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is a sense that we need others and that others need us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Those who work with young people should be like this; all the service of the church should also be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is normal when the deacons and elders mutually need one another, and the saints feel that they cannot do anything without the elders and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today we have rules and arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The elders do things pertaining to elders, and the deacons do things pertaining to deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everyone works when it is his turn.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, we do not have a deep feeling that we cannot go on without the elders and deacons in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some brothers not only lack a sense of the need for the elders and deacons, but they even think that elders and deacons are unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is dangerous.</S>
