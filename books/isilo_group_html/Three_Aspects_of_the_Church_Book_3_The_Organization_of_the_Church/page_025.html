<p>In the New Testament two verses speak of the relationship between gifts and grace. The first verse is Ephesians 4:7, which says, &ldquo;To each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.&rdquo; This word is marvelous. The grace we receive is according to the measure of the gift. In other words, the amount of grace a person receives is according to the measure of the gift given to him. Gift is like a glass, and grace is like water. The amount of water that a glass can contain depends on the capacity of the glass. If the capacity of the glass is one cup, the amount of water it can receive is one cup. Thus, if a glass is large, it can receive a great amount of water, but if a glass is small, it can receive only a small amount. How much water that can come into the glass depends upon the capacity of the glass. In like manner, how much grace that we can receive is according to the gift that God has measured to us.</p>
<p>The second verse is Romans 12:6, which says, &ldquo;Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us.&rdquo; The gifts that we receive are according to the grace given to us. Ephesians says that grace is given according to the gift, but Romans says that gifts differ according to grace. The relationship between gift and grace is of two sides. The two are inseparable. Whether it is grace given according to gift or gift given according to grace, in either case the two cannot be separated. Once a person loses grace, he loses any related gift. If a person loses grace but still exercises his gift, his exercise of the gift will be abnormal. The normal condition of a gift is altogether in grace.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Explanations of the Two Verses</h2>
<h2 class="head4">Gifts Being Received according to Grace</h2>
<p>Although we spoke first of Ephesians 4 and then Romans 12, according to sequence Romans 12 comes before Ephesians 4. First, Romans speaks of gifts being according to grace, then Ephesians speaks of grace being according to gifts. When we are saved, God first gives grace, not gifts; that is, God imparts Himself into us. Grace is God Himself&mdash;the life of God, the Spirit of God&mdash;and this is what God gives to us first. When God saves us, He gives Himself to us as life and as the Spirit. As a result, we have grace within us. Before we were saved, we had only sins and were empty within. Now that we are saved, we have grace within and are no longer empty. Upon being saved, God Himself&mdash;God&rsquo;s life and God&rsquo;s Spirit&mdash;came in. God, as life and Spirit, is grace to us.</p>
<p>According to Romans 12, God gives us gifts according to grace and based on grace. Hence, the gifts in Romans 12 are given according to grace. God&rsquo;s life, God&rsquo;s Spirit, and God Himself become grace in man. Grace is the basis. Out of grace come gifts. Within is grace, and without are gifts. The grace we receive is the same, but the gifts manifested in us differ. In some the gift of love is manifested, in others the giving of hospitality is manifested, and in still others the ministry of the word is manifested. It may be easy for us to understand that the ministry of the word is a gift, but it is probably difficult to understand that giving hospitality is also a gift.</p>
<p>The most difficult thing for some Christians is to give hospitality. Some saints are willing to do whatever the brothers ask of them, except give hospitality. Giving hospitality is too troublesome. In the church, in the past there was always the practice of giving hospitality among the saints. In recent years, however, the saints seem to have lost this grace. Thus, they have also lost the gift. Nevertheless, there are some who having received God&rsquo;s grace are not only willing to give hospitality but also consider it the sweetest matter. In this way, giving hospitality has become their gift. From this we see that gifts are produced out of grace and are given to us according to the grace within us.</p>
<p>Even though gifts may differ, they are the result of the same grace. This can be compared to the circulation of blood in our body. When blood flows to the ears, it enables them to hear. When blood flows to the eyes, it helps them to see, and when blood flows to the mouth, it enables the mouth to speak. However, if the blood circulation stops, almost immediately the ears cannot hear, the eyes cannot see, and the mouth cannot speak. There is only one circulation of blood, but when it flows to different places, it enables different functions to be manifested. Similarly, everyone has the same grace, but the gifts manifested within them are different. We all have received the same grace, but the gifts that are manifested through us are different.</p>
<p>Paul received a large measure of grace. According to Old Testament typology, the grace that Paul received can be compared to a large bull. In contrast, we may have received only a small amount of grace. According to Old Testament typology, the grace that we have received may be equivalent only to a small pigeon. It is the same grace, but its measure is different. Hence, the gifts that are produced by this grace are also different. The main point is that gifts result from grace. We cannot expect someone without God&rsquo;s life and God&rsquo;s Spirit to have a gift. Only a person who has the life of God has a gift. Of course, in the Old Testament age it was a different matter. In the New Testament everyone who has a gift has life and grace.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 3, The Organization of the Church &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
