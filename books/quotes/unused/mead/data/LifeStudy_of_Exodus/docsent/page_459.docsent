   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FORTY-TWO THE SANCTIFICATION OF AARON AND HIS SONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE THE PRIESTS 10 Scripture Reading: Exo 29:29-46</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that if we would be brought into oneness with God, we need to offer the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This offering is not actually food for God in a direct way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, it solves the problem between us and God so that we may have fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>PROPITIATION MADE UPON THE ALTAR</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Exodus 29:35 and 36 say, And thus you shall do to Aaron and his sons, according to all which I have commanded you; seven days you shall fill their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And every day you shall offer a bull as a sin offering for propitiation; and you shall purify the altar when you make propitiation upon it; and you shall anoint it to sanctify it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The seven days mentioned in verse 35 signify a full course of time, that is, our entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every day we need to offer Christ as our sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to verse 36, the bull as a sin offering was offered for propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here the emphasis is propitiation on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The altar is purified by having propitiation made upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The altar, we should remember, is a dining table.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever we are about to serve a meal, we first clean the table.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We want to remove all dirt that is there and purify the table.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The sin offering purifies our dining table, the altar, and makes it clean as a place for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 36 says that the altar was to be anointed in order to be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this verse nothing is said concerning the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in principle the matter of sanctification through the sprinkling of the blood is revealed elsewhere in the writings of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no question that the altar is purified by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here, however, the altar is sanctified by the anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Blood signifies the death of Christ, and oil, the anointing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have the blood to purify us and the Spirit to anoint us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Again, we may use the illustration of a dining table.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we clean a dining table, we like it to be bright and shining.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The blood purifies us, and the oil causes us to shine.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore we need both the blood to make us pure and the Spirit to cause us to shine.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is to be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to remember that to be sanctified is to be separated and marked out.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All other tables may be unclean and dull.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are dirty, and they do not shine.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But there is one table the altar that is purified and anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, it is clean, and it is shining.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a result, this table is different from all other tables and separate from them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 37 says, Seven days you shall make propitiation on the altar and sanctify it, and the altar shall become most holy; all that touches the altar shall be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here we see that propitiation was to be made on the altar every day.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After the altar had been sanctified, it became most holy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Anyone who touched the altar became holy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that the altar on which propitiation has been accomplished and which has been anointed with oil has become most holy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As such, the altar itself is able to sanctify the one who touches it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whoever touches the altar is sanctified, and whatever is put on the altar is likewise sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, anything offered on the altar is spontaneously sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every day we need to offer the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we do this, we have a dining table that has been fully cleansed and anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whatever is placed on this table will then be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every morning we need to offer Christ as the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This will cause us to have a good morning.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>People often greet one another with the words good morning.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we speak of a good morning, we should refer not to a greeting, but to having a good morning through offering the sin offering to God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we present Christ as the sin offering to God in the morning, we shall have a good morning, a morning of propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The result will be that we shall have a good day, for that good morning will sanctify the entire day.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the foregoing message we used the illustration of man inviting God to dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we offer Christ as the sin offering, there will be no problem between us, those who invite God to dinner, and God, the One who is invited.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Instead of problems, we shall have the redeeming blood and the anointing oil signifying propitiation and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now there is peace between the inviting one and the invited One, and we can proceed to serve God food for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The matter of propitiation needs to be understood according to the background of the practice in ancient times.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Especially among Jews, when two parties had a problem, there was the need of propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After propitiation had been accomplished, the parties involved could eat together.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because propitiation had been made, they could be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then in peace they could enjoy a meal together.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is a picture, a type, of the relationship between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Because of our sin, we have a problem with God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The source of this problem, this trouble, is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He injected sin into us, and that sin has become a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But Christ came as the Lamb of God to take away sin.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this way He solved the problem and made propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, whenever we offer Him to God as the sin offering, we may enjoy what He has done for us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In this way, because He has made propitiation with God on our behalf, we no longer have a problem with God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Instead, we have peace, and in peace we can feast with God.</S>
