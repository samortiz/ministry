AMONG THE CHILDREN<br />
AND YOUNG PEOPLE</h1>
<h1 class="msg">LESSON NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING PATTERNS<br />
FOR FOSTERING THE CHILDREN<br />
AND YOUNG PEOPLE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Thes. 1:5-8; 2:1-20; 2 Thes. 3:7, 9; 1 Pet. 5:2-4</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>For new believers to live a holy life for the church life, there is the need of the aspect of fostering&mdash;1 Thes. 2:7-12; Eph. 5:29, footnote 1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul likens the apostles both to a nursing mother and to an exhorting father; the apostles regarded the believers as children under their fostering care; just as parents care for their children, fostering their growth, so the apostles cared for the new believers&mdash;1 Thes. 2:6b-7, 11.</li>
	<li>First Thessalonians is a word to beginners, to new believers; those who are working with young people or with new believers can receive from this book both a direction and an outline to follow&mdash;1:3 and footnote 2.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Paul fostered the young believers mainly by presenting them a pattern of life, a pattern of a proper living; this pattern was actually Paul himself&mdash;v. 5; 2:10; 2 Thes. 3:7-9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The apostles not only preached the gospel but also lived it; their ministering of the gospel was not only by word but also by a life that displayed the power of God, a life in the Holy Spirit and in the assurance of faith&mdash;1 Thes. 1:5.</li>
	<li>The apostle Paul stressed repeatedly the apostles&rsquo; entrance toward the believers; this shows that their manner of life played a great role in infusing the gospel into the new converts&mdash;vv. 5, 9; 2:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The apostles were struggling and speaking the gospel to the Thessalonians in the boldness of God&mdash;v. 2.</li>
		<li>The apostles were free from deception, uncleanness, and guile&mdash;v. 3.</li>
		<li>The apostles were first tested and approved by God and then were entrusted by Him with the gospel; hence, their speaking, the preaching of the gospel, was not of themselves to please men but of God to please Him&mdash;v. 4; Psa. 139:23-24.</li>
		<li>The apostles were never found with flattering speech nor with a pretext for covetousness&mdash;1 Thes. 2:5.</li>
		<li>The apostles did not seek glory from men&mdash;v. 6a:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>To seek glory from men is a real temptation to every Christian worker; many have been devoured and spoiled by this matter&mdash;1 Sam. 15:12.</li>
			<li>Lucifer became God&rsquo;s adversary, Satan, because of glory-seeking; anyone who seeks glory from men is a follower of Satan&mdash;Ezek. 28:13-17; Isa. 14:12-15; Matt. 4:8-10.</li>
			<li>How much we will be used by the Lord and how long our usefulness will last depend on whether we seek glory from men&mdash;John 7:17-18; 5:39-44; 12:43; 2 Cor. 4:5.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The apostles did not stand on their own authority, or dignity, as apostles of Christ&mdash;1 Thes. 2:6b.</li>
		<li>The apostles cherished the believers and yearned over them as a nursing mother would cherish and yearn over her own children&mdash;vv. 7-8, cf. v. 17; Gal. 4:19; Isa. 49:14-15; 66:12-13.</li>
		<li>The apostles imparted not only the gospel of God to the Thessalonians but also imparted their own souls&mdash;1 Thes. 2:8; 2 Cor. 12:15.</li>
		<li>The apostles considered themselves as fathers in exhorting the believers to walk in a manner worthy of God, to have a walk that will enable them to enter into the kingdom of God and usher them into the glory of God&mdash;1 Thes. 2:11-12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To do the work of fostering&mdash;to shepherd people and to cherish and nourish them&mdash;is to give them a proper pattern; Paul fed his spiritual children with his own living of Christ&mdash;vv. 1-12; 2 Cor. 1:23&mdash;2:14; 1 Cor. 9:22; Acts 20:28:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Parents are patterns, models, for their children; whatever the parents are, the children will be also; imitating is related to growing; children grow by imitating their parents&mdash;2 Thes. 3:9; Heb. 13:7.</li>
	<li>To give the new believers and young ones a lot of teaching is not the proper way to take care of them; the proper way to foster them is to show them a pattern; by showing them a pattern, you water them, supply them, nourish them, and cherish them&mdash;2 Cor. 3:6; 1 Cor. 8:1b; 1 Thes. 2:8.</li>
	<li>The source, the origin, of the apostles&rsquo; preaching was God and not themselves; whenever we preach or teach, we must impress others with the fact that what we are saying is not the word of man but is truly the word of God&mdash;v. 13; Heb. 4:12.</li>
	<li>The church in Thessalonica imitated the churches in Judea&mdash;1 Thes. 2:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Reports concerning the churches in Judea reached the believers in Thessalonica; they must have heard about the churches and the saints, and these reports fostered the growth of the Thessalonian believers&mdash;v. 14.</li>
		<li>Nothing can foster a church or a saint as much as a true story about other saints or churches&mdash;Acts 27:21, footnote 2; Rom. 16:4, 13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The inoculating word was part of Paul&rsquo;s fostering of the saints; even inoculation is included in fostering; Paul inoculated the believers against the eventual coming of the Judaizers&mdash;1 Thes. 2:15.</li>
	<li>Paul likened the departure of the apostles from the Thessalonians to a bereavement, a loss the apostles suffered from being separated from the new believers and that caused the apostles to miss them; this word implies that the apostles considered the new converts precious and dear to them&mdash;vv. 15-17.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Those who work with the Lord in fostering the believers to walk worthily of God will receive a reward; this reward will be the believers we have fostered, becoming our crown, glory, and joy&mdash;1 Thes. 2:19-20; 1 Pet. 5:3-4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Because the apostles rendered such a care to the new believers, the apostles will eventually receive a reward from the Lord&mdash;1 Thes. 19-20.</li>
	<li>First Thessalonians 2:20 indicates that since the apostles were the believers&rsquo; nursing mother and exhorting father, the believers, as their children, were their glory and joy; apart from them, the apostles had no hope, glory, or crown of boasting&mdash;vv. 19-20.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;When the Chief Shepherd is manifested, you will receive the unfading crown of glory&rdquo;&mdash;1 Pet. 5:4; Matt. 24:45-47.</li>
	</ol></li>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
