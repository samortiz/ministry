   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIVINE ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thank the Lord that we can have this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this conference the Lord has given me a burden to consider with you the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity and its result.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, we will consider the accomplishment of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is something that God has planned, purposed, and arranged.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In eternity past, God had a divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Based on this economy, He had a move to accomplish His divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first thing that God accomplished is the creation of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In His creation, there are the heavens, the earth, and the myriads of created things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But among all these things man is the center.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Genesis 1, we see that God spent only a few days to create all things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After all things were ready, on the last day He created man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When man came out of God's creating hands, he had no lack.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He had everything he needed for his eating, dwelling, working, and living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that time, God did not reveal to any of His creatures, not even to the angels, the purpose of His creating all things, including the heavens, the earth, and man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This mystery of the creation was hidden in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After God created all the other things, He created man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He created man with a distinctive feature: man was created according to His own image.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, He created man according to what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's image, that is, what He is, is that which is in God, which is love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is love, He is light, He is holiness, and He is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God created man according to this love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason, there are these four virtues within man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although we have become fallen because of our ancestor Adam, and have been damaged and have become corrupted, within every one of us there is still love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We still prefer holiness to being common, and we all want to be righteous and do not want to make mistakes or to wrong others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The reason for this is that we are all created according to the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man is like God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moreover, God created man after His outward likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although, on the one hand, the Bible says that God is invisible, yet, on the other hand, God created man according to His image and after His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, man is the most comely object among all of God's creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I believe every one of us appreciates himself when he looks in the mirror.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more we look at ourselves the more we like ourselves, because we are made according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Genesis 1 says that God created all things after their kind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man was created according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, man is of God's kind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are of God's kind, because we are created according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is like your picture being made according to you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although it does not have your life and nature, it is truly your portrait.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Of course, it is equally right to say that this picture is not you, because you have a life, nature, and thoughts; you can breathe and speak, whereas the picture cannot do any of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From this we can see the relationship between God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God is the source of man, and man is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In eternity past, God had an eternal plan, which is to work Himself into a group of chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For this reason, He created man, not only according to His image, but with a spirit, so that man can receive Him and express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The man that God created has a spirit, a soul, and a body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need not probe into the spirit and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The outward body alone is wonderful enough to confound the mind of the best doctors.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In addition to this body, there is also the soul, with its thoughts, loves, and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How wonderful it is!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only after we have understood the Bible a little will we understand ourselves, for it is the Bible that has unveiled to us God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It tells us that God created man according to His image with the purpose that He would enter into the created man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since we are created according to Him, it becomes comfortable and good for Him to enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we live in a rented house, we will not feel entirely comfortable while living in it, because the house was not built according to our intention.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>My house in Anaheim was built for me by the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am not a civil engineer, nor do I know anything about architecture.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But I did know how the house was to be built.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I drew up a plan according to my own intention.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After the brothers finished building it, I moved in and indeed felt comfortable in it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is because it was built according to my intention and my plan.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The same is true with God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He had a desire, which is that one day He would move in and dwell in the man He created.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, the man God created fell.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But God would not give up.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He came personally to accomplish redemption and to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We who are created by God are God's vessels, and we are made to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If there are still friends among us tonight who have not believed in the Lord, I would tell you respectfully that belief in God is the greatest truth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Because we are vessels created by God, we will feel empty if we do not have God within.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whenever God comes in, we feel that we are on solid ground.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Every one among us, whether old or young, can testify of this.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Before we believed in the Lord, we were empty within.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There was no content, and our feet were not on solid ground.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One day, we heard the gospel and called on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He entered into us to be our life, and He has become our content.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God's goal is not merely to have many individual believers.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He wants to have a corporate man, who is the church, as His counterpart, His Body, for His corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is God's eternal economy, His plan, His purpose, and His arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is also the desire of God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This matter is clearly revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>After I was saved I began to love the Bible very much.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This book has been in my hands for sixty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I read it nearly every day.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The way it is written is very wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Concerning any subject, the way it is revealed to us is a little here and a little there.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When I read it, I was like a child playing with a jigsaw puzzle.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I have been playing with this puzzle for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Now the Bible has become a clear picture within me.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It shows us that in eternity past, God had a desire, which is to gain a group of people the same as He is, so that He can enter into them to be their life, their nature and everything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the end, He is not only joined to these people, but is mingled with them as one.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>These people become His believers, and He gathers them together in His life in various localities to be the churches in those places.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>These churches constitute the Body of Christ, which is His corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We are now in such a process.</S>
