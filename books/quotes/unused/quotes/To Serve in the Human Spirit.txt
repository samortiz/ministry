It shows us that for the proper Christian service we must serve in the Body, in our human spirit, and by prayer
Having been placed in the Body , as members we must be tempered together , and as living stones we must be built up together
Without the growth in life the church cannot be built up , and without the built up church there cannot be the genuine service
When we were regenerated, we were born of the Holy Spirit in our spirit , and we became one spirit with the Lord
In the book of Ephesians, a book on the Body of Christ, Paul speaks of our regenerated human spirit in every chapter
We need much prayer individually and corporately, never initiating or doing anything without it, and always praying in our spirit
We all must pray that in these days the Lord will gain this unique and genuine service in many localities throughout the world
In Romans 12:1 Paul exhorts us to present our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is our most reasonable service
We are burdened that all of us may be brought into this heavenly vision, the vision that no one can serve the Lord without the Body
All of our service must be in the Body because, as Christians, we all have been regenerated to be members of the Body
The very part of the body we may consider the most beautiful would become terrifying if it were separated from the body
We appreciate the beauty of the human eyes, but if we saw some human eyes outside the body, we would be terrified
If they were detached from the body, not only would their beauty be gone, but their function also would be gone, and they would be useless
In these days may our eyes be opened that we all may be brought into a full realization of our need to be in the reality of the Body
May we realize that we cannot serve without the Body, and that we cannot even have a spiritual life outside the Body
Such a vision will capture us, wreck us, and spoil us for all the individualistic works, for all the independent services
The only thing we need today is the heavenly vision that will cause us to realize that we are already in the Body
When you see this vision, it will seem so foolish that you could have been a Christian for years without realizing that you are in the Body
You have been regenerated into the Body, and by a single glimpse of the vision, you will have the clear realization that you are in the Body
After we obtained the citizenship, we received congratulations from the President and from a number of government officials
Further Talks on the Church Life by Brother Watchman Nee covers the matter of the ground of the church in detail
The matter of the church ground is very serious; it is something of life and death, not merely a matter of doctrine
You may have presented your body already, but you may be short of the transformation of your soul by the renewing of the mind
If we would give up the self, lose the self, and turn to the spirit, right away we would be in the reality of the Body
Your point may be right, but your motive may be wrong, and the instrument or means that you are using may also be wrong
If your arguing for a certain point has its source in the spirit and is done by means of the spirit, there is no problem with your arguing
Without the tempering, a quick person could never go along with a slow one, and there could never be any building between them
In cooking it is not sufficient merely to mix certain ingredients together to prepare a dish that has a pleasing taste
In the preparation of certain dishes it is necessary to temper the ingredients together to give them a delicious taste
All of us have been placed into the church here together, but the delicious taste will be lacking if we have not been tempered together
The phrase, 'you were called in one Body,' clearly indicates that all of these items are for the one Body, for the Body life
Even though we may feel that to stay with that particular saint is like being put into death, we should not try to escape our situation
We need to remain where we are that we may bear and even forbear, that we may take the cup our Father has given us
If we stay together to have the meeting life for a period of time, surely we will offend one another again and again
If you forgive others and forget their offenses, if you love them no matter how much they offend you, you will have peace
You will simply receive whatever another does to you as something from the Lord for you, something that you need
Without the proper building up together whatever we do to have some outreach to preach the gospel or to help other Christians does not work
Only when we are qualified by being built up together will it be easy to bring someone to the Lord or to help other members
For the service it is necessary for us to be in the reality of the Body, to be built up, to be qualified, to be equipped
From our experience we know that the real equipment for us to fight the battle as the service to the Lord is to be built up in the Body
We need to see clearly that if there is no building up, there is no possibility of having the genuine Christian service
He has not regenerated us to be perfect units, each complete in ourselves, but He has regenerated all of us to be members of one Body
During a period of at least two years, from 1940 to 1942, Brother Watchman Nee gave a message each week on the seeing of the Body
In that morning training time of more than three hours Brother Nee did not do much speaking in the way of a message
Out of so many trainees there may have been only one or two who received his approval in the matter of seeing the Body
Brother Nee could be very bold with us as trainees because we had given him our permission when we were accepted for the training
When Christians who meet together are not happy with each other, often some stop meeting with the others and start a meeting of their own
The Apostle Paul established or appointed elders in every church , and he told Titus to appoint elders in every city
In the Bible there are the elders of the church and the elders of the city, but there are no elders of a church on a particular street
To send something to the seven churches means to send it to the seven cities, and to the seven cities equals to the seven churches
We treasure the book of Revelation, and we especially treasure this revelation in chapter one: seven churches equal seven cities
Would you talk to another brother about the poor condition of the meetings and consider starting another meeting in his home?
It is easy to love the church because it is very living, very encouraging, very uplifting, and the meetings are wonderful, even marvelous
If the church were merely a physical building, it could remain the same year after year, with very little change
The church can be compared to our physical bodies, sometimes living and strong, and at other times, weak and not so living
If you could leave and start another meeting because the situation is poor, it is clear that you have never seen the Body
When you hear others who are still very free talk about the Body you may realize that they have never seen the Body because they are so free
If you keep in mind all these tests, you will realize that you have not seen the Body because you are so individualistic
During that time from 1940 to 1942, all of us were surprised when Brother Nee shook his head and told us that we had not seen the Body
In our experience many times the tempering together comes out of practical situations in working together in coordination
In the detailed coordination necessary to prepare the hymnal, we two brothers learned many lessons and we were very much tempered together
If you have seen the Body, you would never complain, murmur, criticize, or say anything against any of the members
For this reason, Paul speaks of lowliness, meekness, and longsuffering in Colossians 3:12-15 and in Ephesians 4:2-4
If we have seen the Body, there will be no more complaints, no more quarrels, no more murmurings, no more criticism
There will be no complaining, but all of the offending will be chased away by forgiveness with love and with sympathy
The strong ones do not need the parents to love them as much, because they are able to take care of themselves
Many times in the church life we love the strong ones, and we fail to care for those who may need our love more
Being tempered together is the power of the service; the real power in the service comes out of being tempered together
Suppose there are three brothers serving together, coming together to preach the gospel and take care of the new believers
The first brother has been somewhat critical of the second, and the second has been somewhat dissatisfied with the third
A small amount of criticism will tear down whatever has been built up by their preaching, and the impact will be lost
If we have the genuine oneness with love for one another, this oneness with the love is the impact of our preaching
Many reports have come back from others who have been influenced and impressed with the love and the oneness they have experienced here
What if a day would come that we would lose this oneness and yet still claim to be the church here in Los Angeles?
In this message we come to six crucial points in the book of Ephesians, which is a book on the church, the Body of Christ
Eventually we shall see that Christ and the church, the Head and the Body, are the administration of the whole universe
Paul referred to God not as the God of the Hebrews, but as the God of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Father of glory
If you do not have the vision in your spirit, if you do not have a spirit of revelation, a seeing spirit, you could not see the Body
If your eyes do not have sight, you could not distinguish one color from another, and you could not view the scenery
The Body of Christ is something different from all the scenes we could see, something different from all the colors we could see naturally
Although you may talk about certain sights or certain views, if you do not have eyes to see, how could you see?
Although you may listen to different people and read different books, yet you find yourself more and more confused
Of turning to our spirit to be clear concerning the church, we go to teachers or to the writings of the great teachers of the past
Some of the writings may be a veil over our eyes that would keep us from the vision of the church in our spirit
If you open your eyes, all the doubts are gone, all the questions are gone, and you do know what the particular color is
You may not be able to explain what you see, but your eyes can substantiate the colors and can distinguish one color from another
The spirit of revelation is not something that descends on you from the heavens after you have prayed for three nights
In the same way, if you take away all the veils from your spiritual eyes and turn to your spirit, you will see the church
Many of our concepts and the teachings we have received in the past have become layers of veils that frustrate our vision and confuse us
Our vision is colored by some of our particular experiences, or by the teachings of those who brought us to the Lord
Unless these sisters would turn themselves to the spirit and forget their emotions, they cannot be clear about the local church
In addition, there are some who are so strong in their will, so stubborn in their will, that they could not be clear about the Body either
All of us need to forget about what we feel, what we think, and what we decide, and turn ourselves to the spirit without any veils
If we turn to the spirit, if we turn to the Lord in such a way, then we come to the Word, right away we will be clear about the Body
We are too strong in the emotion, in the will, and in the mind, but we are not strong enough in the inner man, in the spirit
In chapter four of Ephesians, after the strengthening in the inner man, there is the renewing of the spirit of the mind
The mind should be set upon the spirit and the mind should be governed possessed occupied taken over controlled and subdued by the spirit
All of us need to be renewed again and again, daily, hourly, moment by moment, all the time, in, with, and by such a renewing spirit
We need to pray that we would be emptied in the mind and emptied in the emotion, but filled unto the fullness of God in our spirit
These six points in the six chapters of Ephesians are crucial, and we could spend much more time on each of them
If such is the case, as those who are serving the Lord, we shall serve not only with power, but also with authority
Peter and the others served God with authority, not merely with the power that is according to the concept of many Christians today
Are you going to serve the Lord merely with power, or are you going to serve Him with authority, which is in another category?
The authority in all the heavens and on the earth has been given to the Head, and the Head is identified with the Body
Whatever the Head has accomplished whatever the Head has obtained whatever the Head has attained to all are to the church which is the Body
If you realize that you are members of such a Body which is identified with the Head you will say There is no need for us to beg any longer
We are members of the Body that is identified with the Christ who is enthroned as the Head and the Lord of all
Christ and the Body, Christ and the church, the Head and the Body, are the administration of the whole universe today
By pray-reading all these verses, we receive a deep impression concerning the way the Apostle Paul served the Lord
There are many verses telling us by what way, or by what organ, he served God after he met the Lord Jesus on the road to Damascus
We need a vision, a revelation, that to serve God it is necessary for us, in addition, to know our human spirit
When we need electricity for any purpose, we simply go to the proper place to touch the proper organ, the means to apply the electricity
The crucial question then is where to find the switch, where to find the organ, the means to apply the heavenly electricity
There is no way to tell people how they can be regenerated if you do not recognize that God has created our human spirit to contact Him
Our human spirit is the switch, the proper organ or the means to apply the heavenly electricity that has been installed in us
How pitiful it would be if we could not find the switch and did not know how to touch it, how to use it to contact the Lord!
When we speak of handling the switch, using the switch, or touching the switch, we are talking about the exercise of our human spirit
When something fits in with our likes or dislikes, we have a certain feeling in our emotion, and we just give up our spirit
We all need to learn to exercise our spirit to the extent that we even know how to be provoked in our spirit, to be angry in our spirit
We would prefer not to know anything about others unless it is necessary because the Lord has burdened us for them
We need to spend time reading and pray-reading all the verses related to the way the Apostle Paul served God in his spirit
Paul had been a person zealous in serving the God of his forefathers, but he was zealous in his natural emotion
Now he is no longer zealous in his natural emotion, but he is burning in his regenerated spirit and burdened in his spirit
Some versions capitalize the word spirit in these two verses, because in Greek there is the definite article-the Spirit
We have seen clearly that the Body of Christ is absolutely in the Holy Spirit, and that the Holy Spirit is absolutely in our spirit
Ephesians 2 tells us that the building of the church, the Body, both universally and locally, is in our spirit
When you exercise your spirit, you touch the Body, and when you touch the Body, you are in the authority of the Head
The capital that we need for service is the authority of the Head, and the way for us to touch this authority is by exercising our spirit
Your spirit can be damaged by only a little bit of gossiping, a little bit of murmuring, or a little bit of dissatisfaction
When we turn to the spirit, we get into the reality of the Body, and in the Body we are empowered and authorized by the Head
If we do not know how to exercise our spirit, how to apply our spirit, it is impossible for us to minister Christ as life to others
And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power'
To lay hands on someone is to represent the Body in accepting the new member and to transmit what is upon the Body to the new member
We all need to learn to be living in our spirit, flexible in the spirit, with nothing decided, nothing settled, nothing fixed
If we exercise our spirit, He will come out along with our exercise of our spirit, and that will be life ministered to others
Our natural life, our soulish life, is very dusty, very earthy, and it is good to be food for the serpent, the Devil
Peter 5:8 tells us that the Devil, like a roaring lion, is walking about on this earth seeking those he can swallow up
He can get into you without you realizing what he has done, just as germs that you cannot see can come in and make you sick
Whenever you live, behave, act, move, do things, and say things in the soul, you are good for the serpent to eat
The offended ones try to vindicate themselves by going to this one and that one to maintain that they are right and others are wrong
From experience we have learned that the problem today in the practice of the church life is absolutely a matter with us
All of us know that whenever we say something for ourselves, whenever we vindicate something of our own, we are through with the spirit
It might be that we are right according to the tree of knowledge of good and evil, but we are good to be food for the serpent
You may come to the meeting and may still partake of the service, but there is no life and no ministry of life
If you stand up to speak without life, others will sense the death and the deadening because you are not in the spirit, but in the soul
We are authorized, not only empowered, but authorized in the Body, and we are one with Christ to minister Him as life
If we look into the content of all the verses, if we read and pray-read them, we will see that the serving ones took the way of prayer
They had no other way, used no other method, and took no other means for the Lord's work, for His service, but the unique way of prayer
We do believe that this is the Lord's move among us, but with each one of us it must be a matter in the spirit
It would be wonderful if the Lord would lead so that some could go out to cover all the leading cities of this country
In the initial stage He may grant the guidance to some of the brothers and sisters to cover only the leading cities along the west coast
We are in the Lord's recovery, and we need to drop the old way of religion and be delivered fully out of the influence of that old way
That way of organization is wrong, and we need to be delivered from the influence of that way, the old way practiced in religion
We need to come back to the pure Word to see the way taken in the early days by the first group of Christians in serving the Lord
The conference in chapter fifteen of Acts did not concern the work, but the teaching, the doctrine, and the faith of the church
In our consideration, we would then make our training the same as a seminary, a Bible school, or a Bible institute
There is a great difference between the service that is full of prayer and the service that is done without prayer
The more we read through this book, the more we realize that prayer was the only way, the unique way, for them to meet every situation
The first is that they were continuing steadfastly in prayer, and the second is that they prayed in one accord
They were all one, not only in one spirit to pray in the spirit, but they were in one mind, in one will, and in one purpose
We may come together to serve, but each one of us may come in the way of having our own mind, our own will, and our own purpose
It is true that they had not yet received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, the outward baptism of the Holy Spirit
They were continuing steadfastly in the teaching of the apostles and in the fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in the prayers'
In the first chapter of Acts there are the praying serving ones, and in the second chapter there are the praying converts
If we are not persons who pray all the time, we could never cause one that we bring to the Lord to pray continually
All of us need to have adequate prayer so that we will be equipped and enabled to speak forth in the meetings with boldness
Prayer is mentioned before the ministry of the Word, which indicates that the prayer is more important than the ministry of the Word
We need to pray before we minister the Word, and we all need to pray before we come to the meeting to prophesy
In Acts chapter ten we need to be impressed that both Peter and Cornelius had a specific hour set aside for prayer, the prayer hour
At one end, Cornelius received the vision by prayer, and at the other end, Peter likewise received the vision by prayer
We may hear that the Lord has put together a certain number of families for His move not by their discussion, but by their prayer
According to this principle, many times the Lord confirms His speaking by speaking the same thing to two persons separately in their prayer
We were not in the habit of corresponding with one another, and a long time had elapsed since we had last heard from one another
Two letters confirmed my resignation from my job, first the one from Manchuria, and then the one from Brother Nee
The King James Version translates the word ecstasy as trance however the word ecstasy is an anglicized form of the Greek word used here
The church prayed not only unceasingly; the word used here also means that they prayed fervently and earnestly
We all need to pay our full attention to this matter, that we may learn this unique way for the Lord's service
No one can tell you with whom you should go out, where you should go, or what is the right way for you to carry out the ministry
The literal meaning here is that, when Paul and Silas were praying at midnight in the prison, they sang hymns to God
It may not seem logical to us for them to cause such a disturbance at that hour with so many other prisoners there trying to sleep
Perhaps at a certain time out of your prayer you may be led to stand up in one of your classes to say something about Jesus Christ
When we go to the airport to see someone off, have you ever considered that we all might kneel down to pray right in the airport?
In 1935 we had public gospel preaching on the streets in the evenings, with a good number of the brothers and sisters there
Some would stand there preaching, others maintained the order, but most of the saints knelt down on the street to pray
Before the preaching, many brothers and sisters knelt down on the street to pray, to shout, to cry to the Lord
Even while the preaching was going on, a good number continued to kneel there supporting the preaching until it was over
That was really a wonderful display of prayer that subdued the evil spirits and conquered the rebellious spirit
In a proper sense, we should not be people so much in our sober minds, but people of prayer in a heavenly ecstasy
If we have adequate prayer in the spirit, our prayer will bring us into an ecstasy just as in the case of Paul and that of Peter
Whether you have some special gift of healing or not, wherever you go, you need to pray for any you meet who are sick
If we consider all these verses from the book of Acts, we will see many aspects of the prayer life for the Lord's service
Paul deals with the matter of the Christian life and the matter of the Christian service in the book of Romans
If you have the Body with the Body practice, the Body expression, and the Body life, then you have the Christian service
The first aspect is a matter of the Christian life a life matter and the second aspect is a matter of the Christian service a service matter
Immediately following this parable, the Lord gave us the parable of the talents, which is something related to our service
We need to use the talent, the gift, which the Lord has given us, to do some business and to make some profit for the Lord
We need to grow in life with the oil, with the light, and with the going out of this world to meet the Lord in His coming back
He realizes the fact that the old man has been put to death and the fact that with the old man there is nothing good
In chapter twelve so many redeemed ones who are walking in the Spirit are composed together in the Spirit as one Body
The little children can do many things, but they cannot serve, because they simply do not have the adequate growth in life
Even if you have life, but are short of the growth in life, still young, childish, even like a babe, you cannot serve
Without the building up of the church, there is no possibility of having the church service, the Christian service
The hand is good, quite useful, but if it is cut off from the body, it becomes not only dead, but also ugly, terrible, and even terrifying
The members of the body are beautiful as long as they are attached where they belong in the body, but in any other place they are terrible
The Body life is in Romans 12, and the church service is in this Body life with the members of the Body, of the church, functioning, serving
If you say that you are in the reality of the Body, you need to consider seriously where the Body is, practically speaking
If we could give up the service of the Lord, there would be no need for us to talk about the Body, the church life
We know that all the believers are priests, and that the function, the duty, the responsibility, of the priests is to serve the Lord
According to the spiritual reality, the priesthood is the building up of the priests, the coordination, the cooperation of all the priests
When we are built up together as a spiritual house and have the coordination of the priests, then we can preach the gospel
The first gospel preaching was on the day of Pentecost, when one hundred twenty people were built up together, coordinated
Rather they preached the gospel in a prevailing way, in a coordination of all the saints, all coordinated as one
In the Old Testament types there are two different orders of priests, the order of Aaron and the order of Melchisedec
To be holy simply means to be sanctified, and to be sanctified simply means to be separated from the common things unto the divine things
We all need to go to the Lord and pray for a period of time, like those one hundred twenty in Acts who prayed for ten days
After those ten days, when they came out to the people to tell them that Jesus is the Lord, the Savior, they did this in a royal way
When they came out from the presence of the Lord with the heavenly authority, they were kings, they were royal
When we are built up together, separated from the world unto the Lord, and we pray before the Lord, we will be the holy priests
We come out to tell the people something about the Lord as royal priests, kingly priests, with the heavenly authority
When we as a Body go to the Lord and remain in His presence, we are the holy priests, the holy, separated ones before God
What comes out is not merely preaching of the word, of the gospel, but preaching the gospel with the kingly, heavenly authority
If we are going to serve the Lord in the way of the church service, we need to pay our full attention to these three matters
We will be qualified, empowered, to minister the Lord to others as the royal priests, the kingly priests, with the heavenly authority
The message, the word, the ministry, will be weighty because there is the heavenly authority of the royal priest
The coordination, the separation, and the authority-these three are the qualifications, the equipment we need to minister
You need to check whether you have been built up in the reality of the Body, whether you are in the coordination of the priesthood
In Acts 19:13-16, the seven sons of Sceva attempted to cast out the evil spirits by using the name of the Jesus that Paul preached
The real service, the prevailing service, does not depend upon knowledge, ability, eloquence, or so-called gifts
If you would be willing to be built up together with others, simply lose yourself, let yourself be lost, in the building of the church
You realize the separation with the saints from the world unto the Lord, and you do have the authority of the heavens
On the day of Pentecost Peter was one in the coordination and was one with the separation and one with the heavenly authority
When those one hundred twenty people stayed in the presence of the Lord for ten days, all of them were the holy priests
Because they were royal priests, even the highest power on this earth was afraid of them because of their authority
The first is that in the church all the serving ones must be built up together as a spiritual house, the priesthood
Among them there is a priesthood, a priestly body, a corporation, a coordination of a group of believers built up together, serving the Lord
The holy priesthood is a group of serving ones who have been separated from the satanic system of the world unto the service of God
Because they are separated from the world and entrusted with heavenly authority, they are qualified and equipped to serve the Lord
From that time, we need to learn to live, to walk, to act in the spirit, not in the mind or emotion, not in the soul
We need to learn not only to walk, to live, in the spirit but also to serve in the spirit, and to serve in the newness of the spirit
To walk, to live, in our spirit means that we will be in the Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit is now indwelling our spirit
Suppose on the Lord's day morning we are having a morning service in the way of the letter, and we have one to take charge of the service
For the prayer meeting, you may look in the index of the hymnal and select a good hymn related to prayer just according to the letter
There is a way that is not according to your mind, your mentality, but according to the inner feeling of your spirit
We need to learn not to act or serve according to knowledge, but to act and serve according to the inmost feeling
Word by word, sentence by sentence, the message came out, not according to the mentality, but according to the anointing
One way is to offer a prayer according to knowledge, according to a routine, much like coming to an office to do routine work
We should not pray according to knowledge or routine, but according to the inner feeling, the inmost feeling of the anointing
In such a case we can sense something living, something anointing, something enlightening, not merely something of teaching
By the inner sense we know when a brother or sister is praying in the spirit or merely praying in the letter, according to knowledge
When anyone utters a prayer from the spirit, there is a spontaneous expression of agreement from the spirit of the others
Within them there is an 'Amen,' but they suppress it, they would not release it, simply because of their opinion
Whether they would utter it or not, when anyone prays in the spirit, there is always an echo in the spirit of others
You need to take care of this anointing and fellowship with the saints according to the inner feeling, the inner sense
During the very time you are listening to her, you need to exercise your spirit to sense her spirit and to sense the anointing within you
At that very moment you need to forget your knowledge of the Scriptures your knowledge of the Christian teachings and give up that knowledge
Merely to preach that we are all sinners and that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God who died on the cross for our sins does not work
He had actually stolen chalk from the school, but when he heard these words, he said to himself, 'That doesn't matter'
Your husband works hard to earn a living for you, and at the end of the year you forced him to buy a pair of high-heeled shoes for you
There are living stories of such experiences in the gospel preaching according to the inner feeling of the spirit
If you would keep your knowledge in your memory at that time, you will do a lot of damage, and you will hinder the Spirit
While you are speaking, you need to forget about your knowledge and come back to the spirit to minister in the spirit
She was very strong in character, and she was very prominent in everything that was done for the whole evening
Another sister was serving at that same dinner, and she was the only one of the serving ones who did anything wrong
She had learned something of Christ, how to live in Christ, how to act in Christ, and even how to adjust her wrongdoings in Christ
It is possible to do many things in the Lord's service and yet have nothing of Christ ministered through you or by you
There are many lessons to learn in ministering Christ to others by cleaning, by cooking, and by doing many different practical things
We need to learn the lesson to serve others and to serve God by ministering Christ to others no matter what we are doing
If you are in the spirit when you are playing the piano, by playing the piano you will minister Christ to others
It was her habit to invite the young missionary ladies who had just come to China to have tea with her in the afternoon
A number of those young sisters could testify how much the life of the Lord was ministered to them by the serving of that tea
While they were drinking tea, several times this sister pulled her skirt down so that she was more fully covered
If others cannot sense Christ in the kitchen while you are cooking, it is doubtful that they will sense Him in the meetings in a real way
Unless we learn the lessons in these matters, the church life will be damaged, and death will be brought in through the practical matters
In that case, the more the saints come together for the practical service, the more the church life will be damaged
Whenever a brother or a sister serves in the flesh, there is a sense of something old, even six thousand years old, as old as Adam
We take care of sound teachings simply because those teachings have much to do with the matter of Christ as life
If doctrines and teachings are not related to Christ as life, we would not take care of them and would not talk about them
What we mean by the word coordination is simply to be built up together, to serve in the way of being built up together
The more you serve, the more you exercise your gift, the more you will be united, the more you will be coordinated with others
Since such a brother is so capable in himself, there are no lessons for him to learn, and there is no need for him to coordinate with others
If you would learn the lesson to be coordinated with others, you need to learn how to look down on yourself, how to be limited by others
There was a sister in China who was quite capable, educated, and experienced in doing things, and she loved the Lord very much
The more she served, the more all the others were dismissed, dismissed because of her ability and her capability
The first week that you come to serve the Lord you may take care of seventy percent of the things and the others take care of thirty percent
After one week, there are eight percent, then twelve, twenty, and eventually, maybe after one year, one hundred percent
The percentage of the work in your hands is always being reduced, yet the number of the people serving with you is always increasing
The more people you have traveling with you, the more problems you have-the luggage, the things others forget, all the special needs
One of the biggest problems is to visit a church with several co-workers to be received for hospitality by the church
If you have some helpers that are a burden to you in the service, then you will be limited, broken, and adjusted
After six months if all of the service is in your hand and nearly all of the people are goneyou are almost the only one leftthat is serious
Rather you need to consider the percentage of the service that is in your hand, and the number of the serving ones
We may talk about being broken, but the way to be broken is to serve the Lord with your brothers and sisters in the way of coordination
We can come together week after week, month after month, and year after year, but we can never have a church life
We can never be blended as one in the spirit because our natural life, our soulish life, our human nature, has never been broken
There is only one way for you to experience the real brokenness of the natural life, and that is to be coordinated with others
You cannot merely close yourself in your room to read the Scriptures and pray and praise the Lord that you are broken
Suppose that, under the Lord's sovereignty, this sister is placed in some kind of coordination and put among seven sisters
After passing through such a testing, how could this sister close herself in her room in her old way and praise the Lord that she is broken?
The sovereignty of the Lord brought her into such a situation to show her that she has to be broken in this very matter
All of these eight will then be built up together, and they will bring more and more people to be coordinated with them
We need to learn to serve in a way that we could be coordinated with others and others could be coordinated with us
The more lessons you have, the more you need to learn, and the more you learn, the more the lessons will continue to come
If you are such a brother the Lord will send you more sisters and probably under His sovereignty He will send you the most troublesome ones
We need to practice to know the way of the church service, which is a service of coordination, never a service of an individual person
If the brothers would give you just a little hint that they would not have you minister, you should be willing to take it
