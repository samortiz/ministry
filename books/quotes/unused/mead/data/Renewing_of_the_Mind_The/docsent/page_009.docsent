   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>You should not think that your mind is too dull.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do not think that only those who are naturally intelligent will grow and quickly understand the truth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If man's growth in the truth were governed by his natural intelligence, it would be entirely a matter of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Your personal growth has nothing to do with your intelligence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If your nous is renewed, you can understand God, and you can know everything of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The person beside you may be the most intelligent and wise person, but he cannot understand; only you can understand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, you should specifically ask God to give you a renewed nous.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Otherwise, you will have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once again I stress that you must go to God in a specific way to seek after this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before you believed in the Lord, you did not love men.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After you believed in the Lord, you began to love men more.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If there was no such change in you, I am afraid that you are still not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you are saved, you will surely see a change of heart and an improvement in the matters of loving, forbearing, and serving.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before, you loved to be great, but now, you would rather suffer, be defrauded, and forbear.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is because you have a new heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Others will also see your change and say that you were a certain way before, but that now you are changed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But my question is: has there been any improvement in your thoughts?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Has there been any improvement in your mental power?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Are your thoughts more orderly and concentrated?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Or are they still the same as they were before you were saved?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If this is so, your nous is still not renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Regardless of whether a believer is wise or foolish, he should know that his mind as well as his heart should be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, in his nous he should have the same improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God is without respect of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He destroys the wisdom of the wise and the understanding of the prudent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God puts the wise and the foolish all on the same level.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The nous of the foolish needs to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The nous of the wise also needs to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As long as your nous is renewed, you can know God, understand His will, perceive, analyze, and synthesize what God has given you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is what you did not know, understand, or see and what you could not verbalize or analyze before.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, you will be able to run the race before you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Indeed, the difference between a renewed nous and an unrenewed nous is like the difference between a bright, clear window and a dark, dirty window.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a believer's nous has not been renewed, he cannot think or work like a person with a renewed nous.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If his nous is renewed, his thinking ability will be at least several times if not ten times more than before.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, his mental power will be much improved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But if his thoughts are not renewed, his thinking will not be improved because his thoughts are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Just as there is a great difference between death and life, there is a great difference between a renewed nous and an unrenewed nous.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just as there is a difference between heaven and earth, there is a difference between a renewed nous and an unrenewed nous.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we earnestly and single-mindedly deal with our nous in the way that we dealt with our salvation in the past, our sky will always be clear.</S>
