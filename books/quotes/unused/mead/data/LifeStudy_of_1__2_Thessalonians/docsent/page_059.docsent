   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Fornication always involves overstepping the regulation of the marriage relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The relationship between male and female was ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Marriage is a holy matter that was ordained by God and is under His strict regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, the contact between male and female must be according to God's ordination and regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Otherwise there may be some kind of transgression, overstepping, breaking of God's regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 7 Paul says, "For God has not called us for uncleanness but in sanctification."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Greek preposition translated "for" in this verse, epi, means upon, on condition of.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Uncleanness in this verse denotes uncleanness in things like fornication and adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some teachers say that verse 6 speaks of taking advantage of a brother in doing business.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To refer uncleanness here to unfair gain in business is not acceptable according to the context of this section, which begins in verse 3 with the charge to abstain from fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, verse 7 is the concluding word of this charge.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The apostle's charge to abstain from fornication is based upon sanctification v. 3 , strengthened by sanctification v. 4 , and concluded here with sanctification, because fornication, as the most unclean thing, destroys the holy standing and character of God's called saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God has not called us on condition of uncleanness, but He has called us in sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that we must always remain in sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's calling has nothing to do with uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His calling is in sanctification, and this sanctification is versus fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 8 says, "Consequently, he who rejects, rejects not man but God, Who also gives His Holy Spirit to you."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This verse is the conclusion of the section which begins in verse 3.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word "rejects" here refers to the charge given in the preceding verses.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here Paul seems to be saying, "I have given you a warning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you reject it, you are not rejecting me, but you are rejecting God, the One who gave His Holy Spirit to you."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here the Holy Spirit is referred to as the Holy One who sanctifies us, making us holy before God Rom 15:16; 1 Pet 1:2; 1 Cor 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The will v. 3 , the call v. 7 , and the Spirit of God are all for our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God had His will first, then His call, and then the giving of His Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By His Spirit we may be sanctified to answer His call and fulfill His will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God has given His Holy Spirit to us to sanctify us, to make us holy, to separate us unto God for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, this Holy Spirit is moving, working, and acting within us constantly for a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we fall into fornication, we reject this indwelling Spirit who is working within us to sanctify us unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is Paul's meaning here, in the verse that concludes a section on sanctification versus fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>May we all, especially the young people, be impressed with Paul's word of warning.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The age in which we live certainly is no better than the age in which Paul lived.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, the cities where we live today are not better than Corinth or Thessalonica.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the contrary, both the age and the cities may be worse.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we need this warning concerning sanctification versus fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>BROTHERLY LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In verses 9 and 10 Paul goes on to exhort the believers regarding brotherly love: "Now concerning brotherly love, you have no need for me to write to you, for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another; For indeed you do it unto all the brothers in the whole of Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But we entreat you, brothers, to abound more."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The words "brotherly love" are a translation of the Greek word philadelphia, composed of phileo, to love, and adelphos, brother.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here Paul reiterates his word in 3:12 concerning love: "And the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love to one another and to all, even as we also to you."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This emphasis on love indicates that love is a vital factor in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to Galatians 5:14 and Romans 13:10, love is the fulfillment of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we love others, certainly we shall not commit fornication, steal, or lie.</S>
