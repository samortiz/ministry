 <h2 class="head2">Turmoil among the Lord&rsquo;s People<br />
in the New Testament</h2>
<p>In the New Testament the Lord Jesus selected twelve of His disciples and appointed them to be apostles (Luke 6:13). One among the disciples selected by the Lord Jesus was Judas, who also became a betrayer (v. 16). During the apostle Paul&rsquo;s lifetime, the church life passed through turmoils that were full of problems.</p>
<p>I have been in the church life since 1932, and I was with Brother Nee for eighteen years. During those eighteen years with Brother Nee, turmoil came in every five or six years. In 1949 I went to Taiwan. From 1949 until 1989 there have been three different times of turmoil, including the present one. The rate has decreased from once every five or six years to once every twelve years.</p>
<p>Turmoil is the destiny of the progressing church, the pilgrim church. While the church is journeying on this earth as a corporate pilgrim, it is destined to suffer turmoil. We need such turmoil for our purification. According to our point of view, turmoil is not very good, but according to our real situation, turmoil is needed. Therefore, we should not expect to remain free from turmoil in the church life all the time. In Acts 20, after Paul had a long talk with the elders of the church in Ephesus, he warned them of fierce wolves who would come in among them, not sparing the flock (v. 29). In verse 30 he said that men would rise up from among them to speak perverted things to draw away the disciples after themselves. In the past three years, some have risen up among us to speak perverted things.</p>
<p>An article entitled &ldquo;Being Realistic&rdquo; was published in a periodical entitled <em>The Word and the Testimony.</em> The author of this article is John So, and the editors of the periodical are John Ingalls and Bill Mallon. This article insinuates that I am like the Japanese army when it invaded and occupied the Philippines in the Second World War. This implies that I invaded the church in Anaheim, taking it and possessing it in order to make it &ldquo;the church of Witness Lee.&rdquo; The article goes on to indicate that the meeting on Ball Road in Anaheim is no longer a local church, because it has lost its ground. According to this article, the ground of the church in Anaheim has become a person (Witness Lee) and his work and ministry, and it is now occupied by us, just as the site of the temple in Jerusalem is occupied today by the Moslems. Is this not a perverted word?</p>
<p>In another portion of this article, under the heading &ldquo;The Nicolaitans,&rdquo; I am categorized by innuendo as a Nicolaitan. In the way of innuendo, I am also likened to Balaam, who peddled the word of God in order to make money.</p>
<p>This article by John So also likens me to Jezebel, who called herself a prophetess and killed all the prophets of God, making herself the unique oracle of God. Is this not a perverted word that fulfills Acts 20:30?</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRESENT TURMOIL IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>The present turmoil among us can be considered a rebellion, a rebellion with a conspiracy. I have been quiet for more than two years. You have probably never heard me speak concerning this matter. On occasion I have expressed something related to this matter in the elders&rsquo; meetings, but not in a very clear way. Since the ones who initiated this rebellion have made it so obvious, even through the printed page, I feel that after such a long period of silence I should let you know some of the facts. But in this message I will say only a little bit in principle. For the details in full, see the book entitled <em>The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion.</em> It is published by Living Stream Ministry and is free of charge.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Instigated by the Evil One</h2>
<p>Having thoroughly considered during the past two years the things that have happened in the rebellion, I came to the conclusion that this rebellion is the work of the devil, the evil one (Matt. 13:19), because nearly everything brought out by the rebellious ones was not logical or reasonable, and some of the ways by which they did things were inhuman.</p>
