   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE SPIRIT OF PAUL Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 6:11-13; 7:2-4, 12-16; 10:1-2, 7-12; 11:1, 5-31; 12:1, 11-19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we read the verses above carefully again and again, we can see what kind of spirit this man, the Apostle Paul, had.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul wrote fourteen Epistles in the New Testament, but not one of these Epistles gives us a picture of Paul's spirit in the way that 2 Corinthians does.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we have pointed out already, 2 Corinthians can be considered as an autobiography of the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this chapter I want to point out what kind of spirit the Apostle Paul had when he was serving the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am not referring to Paul's attitude, thinking, knowledge, or emotions but to his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our spirit is the deepest part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It may also be considered as the genuine, real part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A genuine man is a man in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may be kind to others, but we are kind falsely because we are kind in the soul, not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes we love others but we love them falsely because we love them in our soul, not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we do things in our spirit, we are real and genuine because our real man, our real being, is in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometimes we talk with people in the soul, not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we speak in this way, we are merely saying something to fit the situation and our talk is worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we speak to others in the spirit, we are real and genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this chapter we want to see nine aspects of the wonderful spirit of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am not referring to the Holy Spirit but to the human spirit of Paul Acts 17:16; 19:21; Rom 1:9; 2 Cor 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>AN OPEN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Based on the Scripture reading, the first characteristic, the first virtue, of the spirit of this writer is its openness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This man Paul has an open spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not easy to have an open spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the contrary, it is easy for us to close our spirit, to shut our spirit up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It could be that most of the time we are closed in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more we are fallen, the more we are closed in our spirit; the more we are delivered, the more we are saved, the more we are open in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For the church life we need an open spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may open your mind, open your emotion, and even open your entire heart, yet you would still not open your spirit to others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When you open your spirit, you are fully, thoroughly open to others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In today's society, hardly any person is open to another person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are open to one another at most in the soul, not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Among the Christians it may be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For the church building, for the church life, we have to be open to one another in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have to open to you in the spirit, but this needs the Lord's grace and this needs the working of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our natural man has to be broken; then we will be open in the spirit one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Are you really open in your spirit and from your spirit to the brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although this is not easy, there is the need of such an openness in our spirit toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was not so easy for the Apostle Paul to be open in his spirit to the Corinthian believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When you are welcomed by a group of people, it is easy for you to be open in the spirit to them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When you are criticized, opposed, and looked down on by others, however, you will become as closed as "a snail."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You will withdraw your whole being into a "hard shell" and hide yourself there.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When others criticize you, you remain in the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When others welcome you, you will come out to greet them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The shell into which we withdraw when others despise and criticize us is the shell of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we withdraw into this shell, no one can touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the members in a local church are all "snails," how can the church building be prevailing?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For the Lord's sake and for the building up of the church, we all have to be open one with another.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to open ourselves to the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have never seen two snails working together.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Every snail is individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is the need of the divine breaking to break the shell of the self so that we all may have open spirits.</S>
