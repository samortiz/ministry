<h2 class="head2">Being Careful to Make Up Lessons</h2><p>In the meeting for the edification of the new believers, there is one point that we need to pay attention to. Those who are responsible for visiting the new believers must learn these topics well. Otherwise, when they go out, they will not be able to help the new believers make up the lessons. I hope the brothers could realize this problem. Perhaps the new believers' message is an hour and a half long. However, when they make up lessons for the new believers, they finish it in two minutes. It is not that they speak just the outline; they speak an outline of the outline. I remember that some brothers, when they made up lessons for others, spoke just one sentence: "The message for the new believers today says that we need to read the Bible every day.'' They did not say anything wrong; what they said was correct. But when you go to a person's home to make up lessons, if you only speak a sentence such as, "You need to read the Bible every day,'' I think this word is equivalent to not speaking anything, unless the Holy Spirit works in a special way. You should not speak just one sentence; you must be trained to speak carefully paragraph by paragraph so that those who listen may feel as if they have gone to a meeting. Otherwise, the loss is quite great.</p><p>Please remember that after the gospel has been preached, the future condition of our meetings depends on whether or not the new believers' edification meeting is strong. There are those in our midst who have just heard the gospel. If the meeting for the edification of the new believers is not strong, then we have no way to meet their need. We must learn to lead them onward. How strong the new believers' meeting is determines how strong the next generation will be. If you cannot help the new believers' meeting to be strong, the next generation cannot be strong. Yes, the people have all believed in the gospel and are all saved, but there is no church. That is something similar to what a revival meeting does. There is preaching and there is a result, but no church.</p><h2 class="head2">The Teaching and the Fellowship of the Apostles</h2><p>I want you to especially remember what is spoken in the book of Acts. Acts 2:42 says, "And they continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.'' Verse 41 speaks of baptism, and verse 42 says that they continued in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles. Please remember that the apostles gave teaching and fellowship immediately after the church had three thousand people saved. Hence, the edification of the new believers is a very crucial matter. What the apostles were doing there is what we are doing here today. The so-called edification of the new believers is the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles. Today you cannot say that once a new believer is saved, you can indifferently let him go. You must give him teaching and tell him to continue steadfastly in this teaching.</p><p>The gospel preaching meeting brings the new believers in. After this we need to raise them up. If we have begotten so many and are not able to raise them up, the church will never be strong. Therefore, the gospel preaching must be strong and the new believers' edification must also be strong. Both must be strong in order that we may have a future.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MEETING ACCORDING TO 1 CORINTHIANS 14</h2><p>We all have to learn and wait much before God concerning how to have this meeting. This meeting is all the brothers and sisters gathering together and some preparing themselves before God to be led to rise up to function. Many people can surely give the church much help when they function. Therefore, in this meeting you can have personal testimonies, sharing, and more than one brother speaking.</p>
