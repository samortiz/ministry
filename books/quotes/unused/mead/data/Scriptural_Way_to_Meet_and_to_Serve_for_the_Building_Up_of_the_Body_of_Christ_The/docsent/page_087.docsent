   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Ministering the Life Supply to the Hungry Ones</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What I expect and what I would charge you to do is to go to minister the life supply to the hungry ones.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not consider that you are the only one who has been trained, qualified, and equipped with something to supply.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You must have the assurance that you are really one with the very Lord and that you are living Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you do have something, you do not need to advertise or promote yourself; you do not need to prove that you have something.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Fellowship spontaneously and normally with those who are around you, your neighbors Eph 4:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not boast and do not sell your cargo.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Simply fellowship in a humble, gentle, and lowly way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You may say, Brothers, may we pray together?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>May we turn to John 1:1?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let us enjoy the Lord in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Pray, but in your prayer do not have a facade that you have received so much from the fellowship of the training contained in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is better to put what you have received in your pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Gradually, a little of it may come out.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After a few minutes, a little more may come out.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Item after item will come out of your being to edify, cherish, and nourish people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not teach the doctrines concerning the so-called truths, but supply people with life, with the very processed Triune God, without an outward declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Be one with the Lord in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You do not need to promote, advertise, or declare.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Simply be what you are in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Have a gentle and meek attitude and a lowly appearance all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Always live this way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then you will surely have a lot within you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As such a person, you will have Christ accumulated in your daily life day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Something of the dear Christ will be accumulated in your being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You do not need to do anything in particular.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Simply live in this way, and something will come out of you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You do not need to say that you have received so much from these messages; let others say this about you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Gradually, they will realize and will taste that you surely have received some riches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Simply live whatever you are and be whatever you are in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then the truth will be with you and the reality will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Life will come out of you as a dispensing to support others and to supply them with the riches which you have enjoyed of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the Lord s way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The root, the influence, and even the impact of the traditional way is present with us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not by our preaching or teaching that this deeply rooted matter could be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To preach and teach with a facade will help the root to become deeper rather than pull it up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our being and our living need to be in the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>LIFE SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The life supply is the supply of the unsearchable riches of Christ Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This supply has to be carried out in our living and our being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It must be the contents of our transformed being.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The life supply is the supply of the riches of Christ enjoyed by us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not merely something objective of Christ; it is a subjective experience and enjoyment in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must bear all these riches which will spontaneously become a life supply dispensed into each one whom we contact.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should go to supply all the saints in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not go to tell others that you have received so much and that many days would be needed for you to tell them everything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This will just help the doctrinal way to become more deeply rooted.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Simply live and be what you are and contact people according to the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our salesmanship is not like the worldly salesmanship.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not need advertisement.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We do not need propaganda.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We do not need to make a big facade, a show, to let people see what we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, we need to be little Nazarenes, like Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord Jesus is lowliness and humility.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>His lowliness and humility are not merely virtues of the human character.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He lived lowliness and humility, and He is lowliness and humility.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When He speaks, He ministers Himself, He imparts Himself, and He dispenses some elements of His person into His listeners.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, people are infused by Him with what He is, not just taught, edified, or instructed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord Jesus only ministered for about three and a half years, forty-two months, but He imparted and dispensed much.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even though Peter, James, John, and the other disciples did not realize what they were infused with, they still received some infusion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After three and a half years, this infusion, which remained within them, came out on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Go to the church in your locality, not to preach, but to infuse, to impart, to dispense.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This way will be slow, but do not be bothered by the slowness; the slower it is, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we would live in the way of infusing others, how good our situation would be after three, five, or ten years!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The life supply is the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit Phil 1:19 , making truth real with the essence of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the church in your locality, make the very truth which you convey real with the essence of the divine Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Do not merely teach, preach, or have an activity as a show.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Simply live what you are and be what you are in the Lord, bringing nothing but the reality of the processed Triune God to others.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We need to infuse others with the reality of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Only this infusion is the life supply, and all the churches need this supply.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Also, we should not gossip by speaking idle words which work nothing but which will be recorded for the upcoming judgment at the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In Matthew 12:36 the Lord Jesus said, And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they shall render account concerning it in the day of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I am concerned that perhaps one day when we stand before the judgment seat of Christ, the heavenly tape recorder will replay word after word of our idle speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord Jesus indicated that whatever we speak as an idle word will be recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should take every opportunity to minister, to impart, to dispense, and to infuse those around us with something of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The life supply cherishes and nourishes the seeking believers Eph 5:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we would live in the way we have spoken of in this chapter and be this way, the ones that we contact and fellowship with will eventually have the deep conviction that they are cherished and nourished.</S>
