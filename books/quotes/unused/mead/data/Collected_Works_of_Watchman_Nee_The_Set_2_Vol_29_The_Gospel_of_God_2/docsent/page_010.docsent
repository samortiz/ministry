   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BELIEVERS BEING THE GIFTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GIVEN BY GOD TO THE LORD JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Seventh, there is another reason why we will not lose our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Bible we see that a relationship exists between the Lord Jesus and God, and a relationship exists between the Lord and us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many Christians have not clearly seen the relationship between God, the Lord Jesus, and us sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, they misunderstand and think that they can lose their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is a wonderful word in the Bible that says we Christians, the saved sinners, are the gifts given by God to the Lord Jesus John 17:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Father is here, and the Son is also here.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Father gave the saved ones as gifts to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If God has given us as gifts to the Lord Jesus, is there the possibility for us to lose our salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to consider the matter from two angles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, God gave us to the Lord Jesus as a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we were to perish and lose our salvation, if our salvation were not eternal, God's giving us to the Lord Jesus would become a joke on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is like a mother giving soap bubbles to her son.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Have you ever played with soap bubbles?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One dips a tube into soapy water, blows on the tube, and out come the bubbles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We know that those bubbles will disappear in a few minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But when the son sees it, he will be thrilled; he will think that the ball is great fun.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He does not know that it will break after a little while.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If God were not omniscient, it might be possible for us to perish because God would not know whether our salvation would be temporary or permanent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But God is omniscient; He knows whether we will be saved eternally or temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If God were not omniscient, it could be possible that He would give us as a soap bubble to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if God is omniscient, He would know that after three or five years, that bubble would break.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If He were to do that, He would simply be giving air to the Lord Jesus; He would not be giving a gift to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God is an eternal God; whatever He does is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If God gives us as a gift to the Lord Jesus, He cannot regard that as a token favor only.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Second, for God to do this would cause a problem to the Lord Jesus also.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suppose God gave us to the Lord Jesus, but three or five years later we perished and lost our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To us, we would have lost it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But whose fault would it be that we lost it?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You could blame the gift given by God for being corruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But you could also blame the Lord Jesus for not being able to take care of it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many times people have sent me some very good gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I was away from home, I lost one of them, or damaged them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Either I can blame the gift for being poor, or I can blame myself for being careless in keeping it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God told the Lord Jesus that He gave those people to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What would happen if one day those people were to become lost?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot blame only God for giving the Lord Jesus a token favor, but we have to also blame the Lord Jesus for not being able to keep those whom God had given Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In John 17:6, the Lord Jesus said to the Father, "I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They were Yours, and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All the saved Christians are given and awarded by God to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 9 says, "I ask concerning them; I do not ask concerning the world."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus did not pray for the world, but "concerning those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, we Christians are the gifts given by God to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 12 says, "When I was with them, I kept them in Your name, which You have given to Me, and I guarded them; and not one of them perished, except the son of perdition."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the Lord's prayer, He said that He kept every one of those whom God had given Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There was only one son of perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was Judas.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Judas never believed; from the beginning he was the son of the enemy and was never saved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord Jesus said that except for Judas, not one of the ones God had given Him perished.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>My friends, you have to know that God has already given you to the Lord Jesus; He has already given you away.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is like a girl being given in marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we were saved, God had given us to the Lord Jesus already.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, all those whom God has given to the Lord Jesus, who have believed in the Lord Jesus, will be kept by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord Jesus said, "I kept them in Your name, which You have given to Me."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How could a Christian lose his salvation again?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After God has given you to the Lord Jesus, how could you vanish away?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Bible says that not one of those whom God has given to the Lord Jesus would perish.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God has given so many of us to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Think about it: After God has given all of us to the Lord Jesus, could we perish again after three or five years, simply because we are not good?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You should listen to what the Lord Jesus said in 6:37: "All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Why did you believe in the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Why did you come to Him?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You came to the Lord Jesus and received Him because God gave you to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"All that the Father gives Me will come to Me."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In other words, all those who come to the Lord are given to Him by the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The only reason that you come to the Lord Jesus, that you receive Him as Lord, that you trust in His redemptive work and in His resurrection as your proof of justification, is that God has given you to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In heaven God gave you to the Lord Jesus, and on earth you believed in Him and came to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God gave you over so that you would come to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What does it say after this?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>"Him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is no way for us to lose our salvation because God has already given us to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There is another portion in the Bible, John 10:29, which says, "My Father, who has given them to Me."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Who are the sheep of the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the Gospel of John, we are shown numerous times that we are the gift given to the Lord Jesus by God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God cannot give us away as a token favor that has no substance to it, and the Lord Jesus cannot simply throw us away after He has received us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Do not think that our salvation is a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Since we are not saved by doing this or that, neither can we be unsaved by doing this or that.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I thank God that formerly I was a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I, Watchman Nee, was not asking to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I rejected and opposed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But unexpectedly, God brought me through and caused me to accept the word which I had formerly rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God took me and gave me to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Once I was given, I no longer had any way to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When God gave me to the Lord, I received Him as the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>From that day on, I was in the Lord's hands.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Since we have been given by God and received by the Lord Jesus, how can we escape?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If it were we working by ourselves, and if it were we trying and striving to save ourselves, a little negligence or carelessness and we would be through.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But we must realize that it is God who has given us to the Lord Jesus and who has saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Let me give you a somewhat imperfect illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We know that recently Szechuan had a very severe famine.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I read many reports concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Children two years old, who could not even talk yet, were stretching forth their little hands to beg.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>They begged for food and clothing and maintained their livelihood through begging on the street; they had no other way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Suppose there was a rich person who had plenty of food and clothing at home.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If I delivered one of these children over to such a person, in reference to the material things, the child could be said to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Once I give the child over, he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>In the same way, we the sinners were dead in sin and perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>But as soon as God gave us over to the Lord Jesus, we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>To be saved means to be given over by God.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>While we were dead in sin and were waiting for judgment under condemnation, God gave us over.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>As a result we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This has nothing to do with you.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Since God has received you, He could not forsake you again.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>You were a lost person.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>You had neither food nor clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>God gave you to the Lord Jesus, and He received you.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>How could you be cast out again now?</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>There is no way it can be done.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>God has given, and the Lord Jesus has received.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The Lord said that whoever comes to Him will not be forsaken.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Whoever is given to Him by God will not be forsaken by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Hence, there is no way for such a one to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If you were able to perish, it would mean that God would not be consistent.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>God has already given over; and the Lord Jesus has already received.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>How can you perish?</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>It would be a miracle if it were again possible for you to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>I can say to God, "God, I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>I was a sinner; I was dead in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>While I was yet a sinner, I had no desire to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>But You gave me over, and the Lord Jesus has received me.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Once You have given me over, and He has received me, I cannot help but be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>The Lord Jesus said, "Him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out."</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>The phrase "by no means" in the original language is very emphatic.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>It means regardless of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>"By no means" is a strong expression, but because of our familiarity with the words, we do not pay so much attention to it.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>It means regardless of any reason, the Lord will not forsake us.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>There is absolutely not a single Christian whom He has forsaken.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>We are saved because of the Lord Jesus; we can continue in our salvation and be preserved in our salvation also because of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>If we think that salvation is of the Lord but that preservation is of ourselves, we will discover that no one can preserve himself for even a single day.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>I am putting aside man; I am putting down man, but I am exalting the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Everything is accomplished by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>This is a gift; it is a present.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>We will never be forsaken.</S>
