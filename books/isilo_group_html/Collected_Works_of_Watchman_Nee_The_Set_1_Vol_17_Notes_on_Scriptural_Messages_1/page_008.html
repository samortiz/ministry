If one strikes the blood but does not remove the leaven, he cannot be sanctified either. It is very pitiful that today many Christians have struck the blood, but few have removed the leaven!</P><P>It is said that during one Jewish Passover a carpenter examined carefully every item when the Feast of Unleavened Bread was approaching. Every place was cleansed and readied for the feast. On the night of the feast, he suddenly discovered that one of the sacks had molded bread. He dared not touch it even with his hands, but had to lift it up with two sticks and throw it into the fire. He had to keep this feast with such reverence. Brothers and sisters, how much time have we spent in dealing with sins?</P><P>If the leaven is not removed, there will surely be losses. All those who will not remove their leaven will be cut off from Israel. Please note that they are to be cut off from Israel; they are not to perish with the Egyptians in Egypt. They are driven from the people of God and are not punished with perdition together with those in the world. Without removing the leaven, one cannot fellowship with God's people. We should note that they are cut off from the congregation of the Israelites. Without striking the blood, there is no salvation. Without removing the leaven, one cannot meet together with the people of God. One becomes separated from the holy people of God and will not be able to enter Canaan with them.</P><P>If one does not remove the leaven, he will not perish in Egypt, but he will have no share in the millennium (Canaan). Striking the blood gives one eternal life, while  removing the leaven gives one the kingdom. Once a person is saved, he cannot perish anymore. However, if he does not remove the leaven, he will not be able to reign with the Lord. Based on what can we say this?</P><P>Removing the leaven in 1 Corinthians 5 is done by removing the evil man from among them (v. 13). This means that we should remove the sinning ones from the church of God, as one would remove leaven from the dough of flour. What are the sins that warrant a removing? They are the ones mentioned in 1 Corinthians 5:11: "A fornicator or a covetous man or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or a rapacious man." Those who are involved with these six kinds of sins are the ones to be removed. This is the meaning of being cut off from the congregation of Israel in Exodus 12.</P><P>What will those who are involved with these six kinds of sins suffer? First Corinthians 6:9-10 says, "Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be led astray; neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals nor thieves nor the covetous, not drunkards, not revilers, not the rapacious will inherit the kingdom of God." From this we see that those who are cut off from the church in chapter five will be cut off from the kingdom of God. A legal cutting off is one which is a cutting off from the millennium. To be cut off from the congregation of Israel is to be cut off from Canaan. Canaan is not a type of heaven but a type of the kingdom.</P><P>Although there were many Israelites who left Egypt, only four entered Canaan! Two of them were living-Joshua and Caleb, while two of them were dead-Jacob and Joseph. This signifies that some are raptured alive, while some are resurrected from the dead. Oh, there are indeed many today who are saved through the striking of the blood. But how many will enter the kingdom through the removing of the leaven?</P><P>Brothers and sisters, the Passover is to lead us to the Feast of Unleavened Bread. After striking the blood, there must also be the removing of leaven. One has to trust in the blood and also in the work of the Holy Spirit. We cannot be too passive concerning the blood, and we cannot be too active concerning the leaven. Since we are saved through the blood apart from our work, we should now strive to remove the leaven and pursue holiness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XI. OVERCOMING SATAN<br>(EXODUS 12:12)</H2><P>"For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the Lord."</P><P>God will not only destroy all the sinners; He will also destroy all the false gods of Egypt. He will not only deliver us from death, but will save us from all of Satan's power (Heb. 2:14; Rev. 12:11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XII. THE FIRSTBORN BELONGING TO GOD<br>(EXODUS 13:1-2)</H2><P>"And the Lord spake unto Moses saying, Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine."</P><P>Exodus 13:1 tells us one thing, that henceforth every firstborn of Israel belongs to Jehovah. Hence, everyone who is purchased by the blood belongs to God. We are purchased by Him and do not have our own freedom. How many of us can say, "God, I belong to You. I am Your slave"? "For you have been bought with a price. So then glorify God in your body" (1 Cor. 6:20). The day that a person is saved is the day that he is sold. A slave is bought with a price, while a servant is hired with money. Those who are sold do not have any freedom of their own, while those who are hired still have their own freedom. We are God's slaves; we are not His servants. Every time the Bible mentions this matter, in the original language, the word slave is used. We are slaves purchased by God.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 17: Notes on Scriptural Messages (1) &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
