<p>We have learned lessons related to the Spirit, and we have studied what the Word of God says concerning the Spirit. The normal way that God comes to man is not as a thunderstorm. Rather, He enters into man in order to be a fountain of living water, and He flows out of man as rivers of living water. John 1 says that the Word was in the beginning, that the Word was God, and that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (vv. 1, 14). Chapter 4 says that the Lord is living water and that whoever drinks of the water that He gives will not thirst forever, for this water will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life (vv. 10, 14). In chapter 7 the Lord said that rivers of living water will flow out of those who believe into Him (v. 38). In verse 39 John goes on to explain, &ldquo;This He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive.&rdquo; This means that the living water in chapter 4 is the Spirit in chapter 7.</p>
<p>There is a clear type of the living water in the Old Testament. When the children of Israel thirsted in the wilderness, God told Moses to strike the rock so that living water would flow out of the cleft rock to quench the thirst of the children of Israel (Exo. 17:6). The living water was not poured on them; rather, they drank the water and took it into them. First Corinthians 10:4 says, &ldquo;The rock was Christ.&rdquo; The water that flowed out of the rock typifies the Spirit.</p>
<p>In Revelation the water of life is spoken of at least three times. Verse 17 of chapter 7 says that the Lamb will shepherd and guide the believers to springs of waters of life, verse 6 of chapter 21 says that he who thirsts will be given to drink from the spring of the water of life freely, and verse 1 of chapter 22 says that a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. The book of Revelation was written by John, and its concept and thought are a continuation of his Gospel. John&rsquo;s Gospel says that in order to be man&rsquo;s life, God was manifested not only as food for man to eat (6:35) but also as living water that flows into man to become a spring and flows out of man as rivers (4:14; 7:38). In Revelation John speaks of a river of water of life flowing out from God and of the tree of life growing on both sides of the river. The tree of life signifies the Lord Jesus as our bread of life, and the river of water of life signifies the Spirit flowing into us as the living water of life. According to this picture, the flowing of the Spirit brings Christ to us as bread, our life supply. This is Christ with the Spirit growing in us, and this is also the Spirit bringing Christ into us to be our life supply.</p>
<p>The entire Bible concludes with the holy city, New Jerusalem, with the river of water of life proceeding out of the throne and the tree of life growing on both sides of the river. The essence of the Bible is that there is a throne out of which flows the river of life with the tree of life growing along the river. This is God flowing out. The Spirit uses this picture in a symbolic way of writing in order to conclude the entire Bible. The Bible is concerned with God&rsquo;s flowing out in order to enter into man in the way of life. He is man&rsquo;s food and He is living water for man to eat, drink, and enjoy so that man can be mingled with Him as one.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John says that the Word was in the beginning, and the Word was God (1:1). God who is the Word became flesh (v. 14) in order to be the bread of life to man (6:35) and to flow out of man as the living water of life, which signifies the Spirit (7:38-39). God came as the Son to be the bread of life and then as the Spirit to be the living water of life. This is the river of life and the tree of life in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Whatever the Gospel of John says concerning the Lord Jesus&mdash;such as His being the light, the way, the reality, and the life&mdash;can all be seen in the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem He is light, life, reality, and everything.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John also says that the Lord Jesus, the Word who became flesh, is the Lamb of God and the Bridegroom who will take the bride (1:29; 3:29). Revelation says that the New Jerusalem is the bride and that the Bridegroom is the Lamb, Christ (19:7; 21:2, 9). All the crucial items in the Gospel of John are also in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>If we consider the Gospel of John, we will see that not one item in it is excluded from the New Jerusalem. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I and the Father are one&rdquo; (10:30). This means that He and the Father are inseparable. In the New Jerusalem God and the Lamb are also one and inseparable (Rev. 21:23; 22:1). The crucial points of the entire Bible, including the Gospel of John, are found in the New Jerusalem. The focus of the holy city, New Jerusalem, is the river of water of life proceeding out of the throne and the tree of life growing on both sides of the river (Rev. 22:1-2). This is a picture of God flowing out of the throne of grace in two steps: first, in the Son to be the bread of life to man and, second, in the Spirit to be the living water of life to man. The believers who allow God to flow through them will eventually become the building materials of gold, pearls, and precious stones and will be built up together to be the New Jerusalem, the dwelling place of God mingled with man (21:18-21). Conversely, the people who would not allow God to enter into them will end up in the lake of fire and will perish forever (20:15).</p>
<p>We need a clear view of this picture. May the Lord open our eyes to see that God has flowed out as the Son and has flowed into us as the Spirit to become the spring of living water to us. If our condition is normal, we will not need the outpouring of the Spirit, because the spring in us is more vigorous than the spring in Tsinan or the spring in Jericho. As long as we let Him flow freely within us, He will flow out of us as rivers of water of life.</p>
<p>We are not against the outpouring of the Spirit. Many children of God need the outpouring. They have fallen into a particular situation that requires that they be delivered by God in an extraordinary way. However, the normal situation of a believer is to live in God and to have God as the spring of living water flowing out as rivers of living water. If this is our situation, we will not depend on the outpouring of the Spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
