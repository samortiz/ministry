   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Scripture likens a newly regenerated believer to a baby because the life he has obtained in the spirit is as feeble as a physical baby.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is no problem if the believer grows out of babyhood within a short time, because every grown-up begins by being a baby.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, if a believer remains a baby for a long time, and if the stature of his spirit remains the same several years after regeneration, then something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A man's spirit can grow, and the intuition in the spirit can also grow and become stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A newborn baby does not have self-consciousness; his nerves are very feeble, and he is childish in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A newly regenerated believer is just the same.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His spiritual life is like a spark of fire, and his intuition is feeble and not very functional.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, a baby should grow daily.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His knowledge should be broadened daily through use, exercise, and growth until his self-consciousness becomes fully developed, and he can utilize his senses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The same is true with a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After he is regenerated, he should gradually learn to use his intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The more he uses it, the more experience and knowledge he will gain, and the more he will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Just as a person's consciousness is not very keen when he is born, a believer's intuition is not very sensitive when he is first regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Fleshly believers are those who remain as babies for a long time and do not grow.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This does not mean that they do not have the outward suppression of sin or an increase in biblical knowledge during that time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It does not mean that they do not strive to work for the Lord or have not received the gift of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The believers in Corinth had all of these.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They were "in everything...enriched in Him, in all utterance and all knowledge... with no lack in any gift" 1 Cor 1:5, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to man's view, are these not growth?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We would probably say that they were the most spiritual believers because of their growth in utterance, knowledge, and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even so, the apostle said that they were still babies and fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How could this be?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Is growth in utterance, knowledge, and gifts not growth?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can observe a very important fact that the Corinthians grew in secondary issues, but their spirit did not grow, and the intuition in their spirit had not become stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>An increase of eloquence in preaching, an increase in biblical knowledge, and an increase in the gifts of the Holy Spirit are not increases in spiritual life!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a believer's spirit, with which he fellowships with God, has not become stronger and keener in the eyes of God, he has not grown at all!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How many Christians are growing in the wrong direction today?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How many think that after they are saved, they should pursue higher biblical knowledge, better eloquence in preaching, and more gifts of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They forget that they should pursue the growth of the spirit with which they have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eloquence, knowledge, and gifts are just outward; only the intuition is inward.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The most pitiful thing today is that believers allow their spirit to remain as a baby, but they fill their mind, emotion, and will with eloquence, knowledge, and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even though these things are precious, they cannot be compared with the position of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God has newly created this spirit in us which can be called our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What should grow and become full-grown is this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we misunderstand and do not pursue the growth of the spiritual life and the intuition, which enable us to know God, the matters of God, and have fellowship with Him, but instead we pursue the increase of riches in the soul, we will not have any progress at all in God's view.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the eyes of God, our spirit is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is concerned with the growth of this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to His view, no matter how much our eloquence, knowledge, and gifts increase in our mind, emotion, and will, they are worthless in the spiritual realm if there is no growth in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We expect daily to have greater power, broader knowledge, more gifts, and better eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the Bible says that even if we have all these things, our spiritual life has not necessarily grown.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the contrary, our spiritual life may remain the same, without an inch of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The apostle said that the Corinthians "were not yet able to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But neither yet now are you able."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In what aspect were they not able?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They were not able to use the intuition to serve God, to know God deeply, and to receive the revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Corinthian believers were not able to do these things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"Were not yet able" means that they were unable when they had just believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"Neither yet now are you able" means that even after they had believed in the Lord for several years, after they were full of eloquence, knowledge, and gifts, they were still not able.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Through the word "yet," the apostle indicated that even though they were rich in eloquence, knowledge, and gifts, their spiritual life was the same as when they were without eloquence, knowledge, or gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There was no difference.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Real growth is measured by the growth of the spirit and intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everything else is fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These words should be deeply engraved in our hearts.</S>
