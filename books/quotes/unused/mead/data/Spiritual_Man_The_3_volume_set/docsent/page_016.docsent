   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Man's spirit is the noblest part of man; it dwells in man's innermost part.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The body is the lowest and remains outside.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The soul dwells between the spirit and the body and is the medium of the two.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The body is the outer shell of the soul, while the soul is the outer shell of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the spirit tries to control the body, it has to do so with the help of the intermediary soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before man fell, it was the spirit through the soul that controlled the whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the spirit wanted to do something, it communicated to the soul, and the soul activated the body to follow the order of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is what it means for the soul to be the medium.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The soul is potentially the strongest part because both the spirit and the body are incorporated into it, take it as their personality, and are affected by it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But in the beginning, man had not sinned, and the power of the soul was fully under the control of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, the power of the soul was the power of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The spirit could not drive the body by itself; it had to do so through the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can see this from Luke 1:46-47: "My soul magnifies present tense the Lord, and my spirit has exulted perfect tense in God my Savior."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here we see the change in tense according to the original language, which indicates that the spirit must first exult before the soul can magnify the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The spirit first communicates the exultation to the soul, then the soul expresses this exultation through the organs of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In conclusion, the soul is the seat of personality; man's will, intellect, and emotion all lie in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The spirit is the part with which man communicates with the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The body is the part with which man communicates with the physical realm.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The soul is in the middle of these two parts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It exercises its judgment to determine if the spiritual realm is to rule or if the physical realm is to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes the soul rules through its intellect and senses; when that happens, the psychological world rules.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Unless the soul yields its rule to the spirit, the spirit cannot rule.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, the soul has to authorize the spirit to rule before the latter can rule over the soul and the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The reason for this is that the soul is the origin of man's personality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The soul is the master of a person because man's will is part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the spirit controls the whole being, it is because the soul has yielded itself and has taken a lower position.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the soul rebels, the spirit will not have the power to control it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the meaning of "free will" in man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Man has the absolute right to make his own decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is not a machine which turns according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He has his own faculty of deliberation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He can choose to obey God's will, and he can choose to oppose God's will and to follow the devil's will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to God's arrangement, the spirit should be the highest part and should control the whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet the main part of man's personality, the will, is of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man's will soul has the power to choose to let the spirit rule, to let the body rule, or to let the self rule.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because the soul is so powerful, the Bible calls it "a living soul."</S>
