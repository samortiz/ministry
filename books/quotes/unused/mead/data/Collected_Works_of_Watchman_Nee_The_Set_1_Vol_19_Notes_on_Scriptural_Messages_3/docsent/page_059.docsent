   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"For this ointment could have been sold for over three hundred denarii and given to the poor" v.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>5 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They had a better way of using the money, which was to give to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They considered it too much to serve the Lord but not too much to serve men.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a man does not have a love for Christ, he will surely replace the love that he ought to offer to the Lord with works that he does for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a man thinks that offering the best to the Lord is a waste, he will surely spend his best on men.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a man is not a Christian, he saves everything for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since he is a Christian, he knows that it is wrong to be selfish.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The question is, on whom should the three hundred denarii be spent?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Either it is spent on Christ, or it is spent on men.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What a pity that many believers today are like the disciples of that day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They do not have a heart single for Christ; they do not have the chastity and the fervent love for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, they try to fill this lack with hard works.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"And they were infuriated with her" v. 5 . At the beginning they were only criticizing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later they began to be infuriated with the woman, but Mary could not keep back the ointment just because they were infuriated.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The flask was broken and the ointment had flowed out.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No sacrifice can be retrieved from the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Mary dared to do this out of love to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>She did not care about the others' criticism and fury.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What did our Lord say?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He said, "Leave her alone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why do you trouble her?" v. 6 . What the Lord meant was that it was all right for her to love Him and obey Him too much.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There was no need to criticize her.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Criticizing her this way was to trouble her.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Oh, even if we love the Lord too much or offer to Him too much, He will still forgive us!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord thought that it would be wonderful if they would love Him as much as Mary did.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if they could not do it themselves, they should not stop others from loving Him this way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our hands should not touch all those who love the Lord, and we should not bother them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Such an act of Mary was indeed a waste and was too much in the eyes of man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To the ordinary mind, it was enough to use some ointment; there was no need to use the pure nard.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And even if pure nard was used, there was no need to have it in an alabaster flask.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even if one used an alabaster flask, there was no need to spend three hundred denarii on it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They could not keep themselves from criticizing and even becoming infuriated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But to the Lord, this act should not be criticized.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord said, "Leave her alone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why do you trouble her?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To the Lord, their criticism and fury were a kind of trouble to her.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord thought that such an act was permissible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This was why He said, "She has done a noble deed on Me"!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Mary's act was a noble deed and should not be criticized.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At that time, three hundred denarii was enough money to buy a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was enough to hire a few laborers for a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Lord went to Bethany and stayed at the house of Mary, Martha was busy serving; she did not have any slave to help her.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This shows that they were not rich.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But Mary did not care for her own ease and comfort; she spent her all on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We cannot be too much in loving the Lord and in serving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not a waste to spend everything on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"She has done a noble deed on Me" v. 6 . The Lord was opposed to the disciples' concept, who thought that such an anointing and consecration to Him was a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord said that it was a noble deed and not a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is a noble deed to love Him too much, to obey Him too much, and to be spent on Him too much; it is not a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is a noble deed to love Him to the extent that we forget about the criticism of those who are older in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is a noble deed to love Him to the extent that we forget about the need of the poor outside.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is not a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is a noble deed to love Him to the extent that we waste everything on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord thinks that we can never be too much in the way we treat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our love to Him can never be too much.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our obedience to Him can never be too much.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>No matter how man sees it, and no matter how those who serve together criticize, the Lord says that this is a noble deed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The result of the preaching of the gospel is not only to send sinners to heaven but to make every saved person a lover of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is why the Scripture says, "If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed!"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>1 Cor 16:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All the Marys should be satisfied with this word from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we expect approval from our fellow disciples, we have to live according to the worldly wisdom, and we cannot consecrate out of a care for what is on the Lord's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should be satisfied with the Lord's approval, and we should not be concerned about men's criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord was not opposed to the idea of giving to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He was only opposed to their remark that this was too much and that it was a waste to do it on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He told them, "For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good for them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But you do not always have Me" Mark 14:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord meant that there would be many more opportunities for them to give to the poor, but the time was short for them to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>"She has done what she could" v. 8 . The question here is not how much was done but how much was left.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>For a rich man to give a little to the Lord is not difficult, but it is difficult for a poor person to offer up all he has to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>"She has done what she could."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>She did not save anything for herself.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Praise comes from the word all.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Without giving "all," there is no love.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we love God, we have to love with all our heart, all our soul, all our strength, and all our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Many times our attitude toward the Lord is no better than our attitude toward a taxi driver.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Sometimes we give a few coins to the taxi driver, but we think it is a waste to give even a few coins to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>What a pity this is!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Why did Mary do this?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Let us see what the Lord said.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>"She has anointed My body beforehand for the burial" v. 8 . In another two days the Lord would die.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In the Gospel of Matthew, the Lord mentioned four times to the disciples that He was going to die, but they did not understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Only Mary understood.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>She understood that the Lord was going to die for her and that He would die to deliver her from the punishment of hell.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>She loved the Lord, and she had to anoint Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The real power of love to the Lord comes from the death of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Those who do not understand the Lord's death cannot really love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>One has to be on time to anoint the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>After the Lord resurrected, it was too late to anoint Him!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Mary Magdalene bought some ointment and went early on the first day of the week to anoint the Lord's body, but she could not anoint Him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Lord had resurrected, and it was too late.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>"Anointed My body beforehand."</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Today is the time for us to consecrate ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If we wait, it may be too late!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>After the Lord resurrected, it was too late to anoint Him.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>After we have resurrected, it will be too late to consecrate ourselves to Him and love Him single-heartedly.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>At the time of the resurrection, even if there were a thousand worlds, we would gladly give them all up to love the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>But now we need to have the fullness of love that we will have for Him after the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Now is the time for us to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Romans 6 speaks of presenting our members to God.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Romans 12:1 speaks of the presenting of our bodies in particular.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This is total consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>It is easier to present the members, but it is hard to present the body.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>However, such a presenting is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>True holiness comes from an absolute consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This presenting is also reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>It is not a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>May we offer ourselves absolutely to the Lord, and may we love Him, serve Him, and obey Him while today is still today.</S>
