<h2 class=head2>B. Bearing God’s Image to Express Him</h2><p>[God’s creation of man in Genesis 1 is a picture of the new man in God’s new creation. This means that the old creation is a figure, a type, of the new creation. In God’s old creation the central character is man. It is the same in God’s new creation. Therefore, in both the old creation and the new creation man is the center.<p>God created man in His own image (Gen. 1:26) and then gave man His dominion. Image is for expression. God wants man to be His expression. Dominion, however, is a matter not of expression but of representation. God wants man to represent Him in His authority for His dominion. In the old creation man was created to have God’s image to express Him and also to have His dominion to represent Him.<p>The image refers to God’s positive intention, and dominion to God’s negative intention. God’s positive intention is that man would express Him, whereas God’s negative intention is that man would deal with God’s enemy, Satan, the Devil. In the universe God has a problem, the problem of dealing with His enemy. Since God’s enemy, the Devil, is a creature, God will not deal with him directly Himself; instead, He will deal with him by man, a creature of His creation. God deals with His enemy through man. Hence, in God’s creation of man there were two intentions. The positive intention is that man would bear God’s image for His expression; the negative intention is that man would have God’s dominion to represent Him to deal with His enemy.]<h2 class=head2>C. Fighting as a Warrior</h2><p>[The new man has the obligation of fighting against God’s enemy. Therefore, the church as the new man is a warrior fighting against God’s enemy, for the new man is now fulfilling God’s purpose to express God and to fight against God’s enemy for God’s dominion, God’s kingdom.<p>In Ephesians 6:12 Paul says, “Our wrestling is not against blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies.’’ “Blood and flesh’’ refers to human beings. Behind men of blood and flesh are the evil forces of the Devil, fighting against God’s purpose. Hence, our wrestling, our fighting, must not be against men but against the evil spiritual forces in the heavenlies. The principalities, the authorities, and the world-rulers of this darkness are the rebellious angels who followed Satan in his rebellion against God and who now rule in the heavenlies over the nations of the world. “This darkness’’ refers to today’s world, which is fully under the dark ruling of the Devil through his evil angels. “The world-rulers of this darkness’’ are the princes Satan has set up to rule the various nations. Because of the working of Satan, who is the authority of darkness, the earth and its atmosphere have become “this darkness.’’ “The spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies’’ are Satan and his spiritual forces of evil in the air. The warfare between the church and Satan is a battle between us who love the Lord and who are in His church and the evil powers in the heavenlies. We must fight against these spiritual forces.]
