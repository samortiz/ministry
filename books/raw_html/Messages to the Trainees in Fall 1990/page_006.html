<P>Question: When a brother's peculiarity comes out in a certain situation, is it right to speak to him to expose his peculiarity?</P><P>Answer: As long as we sense others' peculiarity, our sensing is also a peculiarity. If we react in this situation, our reaction is in our self. We should not react. If we are under the killing of the cross, we will not have any reaction. We should not have a negative sensation about the brothers and sisters. We must be "blind" and "deaf." We should not see anything, hear anything, or sense anything because we are walking according to spirit and are under the killing of the cross. When we have a negative consideration about someone, this indicates that we are not walking according to our spirit. However, we may have a responsibility to help a brother or sister. Therefore, we must be led by the Lord that we can speak to them what the Lord wants to speak.</P><P>Question: Sometimes I have been offended by someone's peculiarity, but after speaking to them about it, I feel better. Is this right?</P><P>Answer: If we are offended, our being offended is a peculiarity. As proper Christians we should not have a feeling or sensation that anyone has offended us. In this sense, we should be like a piece of stone. If someone kicks or beats a stone, it will have no feeling because it is lifeless. We, however, are very "living." Therefore, we must be killed by the cross. If we are killed by the cross, no one will be able to offend us.</P><P>If we all practice to walk according to spirit, our church life will become the New Jerusalem in our experience. However, if we are too sensitive and become offended with each other, the church life will be in turmoil. We need to experience the killing of the cross.</P><P>Question: Since asking whether we are in the spirit or in the mind may cause us to fall into our mind, how should we practice hesitating before we do anything?</P><P>Answer: We must practice not to analyze but simply to act, walk, and have our being according to spirit. To analyze is to turn back and stay in our peculiarity. Before we do something, we should hesitate and check with the Lord, "Am I doing this, or are You doing it with me?" Then if we feel that He is doing it with us, we should go ahead; but if we feel it is only we, we should stop. We must be simple.</P><P>Question: When I do not know what to do in a situation, often I pray very much. Is this the way to remain in the spirit?</P><P>Answer: We must learn to practice walking according to spirit. Whether or not we pray is another matter. If we do pray, we have to pray according to our spirit. Sometimes the Lord wants us to stop our prayer. We may pray much, but the prayer may not be according to spirit. Walking according to spirit is a very thorough practice. It implies behaving, acting, speaking, going places, and having our being according to spirit. The key to living the Christian life is to walk according to spirit.</P><P>Question: Does walking according to spirit mean that before we do or say anything we hesitate and ask the Lord, "Is this You?"</P><P>Answer: In order to walk according to spirit, we should not do things too fast. We should hesitate a little. We cannot say that to hesitate is to walk according to spirit, but to hesitate helps us to walk according to spirit.</P>
