Through God the Spirit<br>as the Dispensing Fellowship</H2><P>The dispensing fellowship of God the Spirit (2 Cor. 13:9, 11, 14) is to secrete the divine life-juice around us by six steps: regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification. By these six steps the Spirit, as the third One of the Divine Trinity, will finish His transforming work to make us completed pearls.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Second Corinthians 13<br>Encouraging the Believers to Be Perfected</H2><P>Second Corinthians 13 is to encourage the believers to be perfected by the experience of Christ as life and the enjoyment of the processed and consummated Triune God in the Father's love, with Christ's grace as the expression of the Father's love, and through the Spirit's fellowship that dispenses the Father's love in Christ's grace into the believers. Second Corinthians 13:5 says, "Test yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove yourselves. Or do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?" Verse 9 says, "For we rejoice whenever we are weak and you are powerful; this also we pray for, your perfecting." Verse 11 says, "Finally, brothers, rejoice, be perfected." Then verse 14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all." In 2 Corinthians 13 Paul teaches his kind of Christian perfection by Christ in us. The grace of Christ, God the Son, and the love of God the Father, and the fellowship of the Spirit as the third One of the Trinity are with us all the time secreting the Triune God in His life element around us to perfect us. James's perfection is far off from this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. This Kind of Christian Perfection<br>Being for the Building Up of the Body of Christ</H2><P>The genuine Christian perfection is for the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12). It is not for us to love our neighbors, to help the needy orphans and widows, to help us to reject temptation, or to help us overcome worldly pleasure. That is James's perfection.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crystallization-Study of the Epistle of James &nbsp; pg 50</div><br></body></html>
