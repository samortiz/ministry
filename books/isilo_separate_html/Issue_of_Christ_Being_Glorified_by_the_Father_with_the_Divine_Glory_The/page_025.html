We have seen that these three aspects are a house, a tree, and a man. Christ is the house for God to have a mutual abiding place for His rest, satisfaction, and manifestation. Christ as the vine tree is God's enlargement for His multiplication, spreading, and glorification. Also, Christ is the new man to carry out God's eternal economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE FUNCTION OF THE FATHER'S HOUSE</H2><P>God is the Owner of the entire universe, so in this universe there should be a house in which He can dwell.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. For the Processed and Consummated Triune God to Have a Mutual Abode</H2><P>The Father's house is for the processed and consummated Triune God to have a mutual abode with the redeemed and regenerated believers in Christ (John 14:2-3, 23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. For Christ to Make His Home in the Hearts of His Believers</H2><P>This house is also for Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, to make His home in the hearts of His believers who are strengthened in their inner man by the Father, according to the riches of His glory, with power through His Spirit unto the fullness (expression) of the processed Triune God (Eph. 3:16-19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. For the Invisible and Mysterious Triune God to Have a Household and a Kingdom</H2><P>The Father's house is for the invisible and mysterious Triune God to have a visible and solid household constituted by the children of God, the species of God, with His divine life for their growth in life and for His rest, satisfaction, and manifestation (Eph. 2:19). The house of God is the church (1Tim. 3:15), and the church is Christ because every member of the church is Christ (1 Cor. 12:12; Col. 3:10-11). The church is the composition of all the parts of Christ.</P><P>The Father's house is also for the invisible and mysterious Triune God to have a kingdom, composed of the believers in Christ as the citizens (John 3:3, 5; Rev. 1:4, 6; Eph. 2:19; Matt. 16:18-19; Acts 1:3), in two aspects. First, the kingdom of God as the church life in this age is for the believers' exercise and equipping in the divine authority (Rom. 14:17; Rev. 1:9; Acts 14:22; Matt. 18:18). Second, the kingdom of Christ in the kingdom age (Rev. 11:15; 2 Pet. 1:11) is for the overcoming saints to reign with Christ over all the nations (Rev. 20:4, 6; 2:26).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> </body></html>
