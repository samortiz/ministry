The Scripture references used in this book are taken from various translations which give the best rendering of the text
Many of us have been Christians for years and may have heard about life, but may have never heard anything about building
Near the tree of life is a flowing river, and at the flow of the river there is gold, bdellium , and onyx stone
Life produces the flow of life, and out of the flow of life come these three kinds of precious materials: gold, pearl, and precious stone
To know what these are for we must read the Bible through to the end where we see a city that is built with gold pearl and precious stones
Many Christians know that the Bible is a book of life, but not many Christians realize life in a proper and adequate way
From these verses in Genesis and Revelation, we can see clearly that life is for building and that building comes out of life
Simply because in any kind of religion, and especially in Christianity, people always pay attention to knowledge
Because spiritual gifts are mentioned in the Bible, Christians may have the misunderstanding that gifts are something of life
Genesis 2:9 proves strongly that knowledge is contrary to life, and 1 Corinthians proves that gifts are not life
For ye are yet fleshly: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not fleshly, and walk as men?
Many Christians today also have this misunderstanding-they think that if you have power, surely you must have life
The Lord told the disciples to wait until they would be clothed with power, which He likened to an article of clothing
Many Christians give their attention either to knowledge, gifts, or power, but very few give their full attention to life
We must tell others that the Bible shows us in Genesis 2 and Revelation 21 and 22 that life is the main emphasis
According to the Greek New Testament, there are three different kinds of lives: the bios life, the psuche life, and the zoe life
Regardless of whether our self is good or bad, we must hate the self, because it is an enemy and adversary to Christ
Paul says in 1 Timothy 1:14, 'And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus'
In the first part of the Gospel, we read that the Lord Jesus, who was God Himself, was the Word in the beginning
John 1:12 says, 'But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name'
By this, the Lord was showing Peter that, as one who had received Him, he must learn to enjoy Him by loving Him
It is by His grace that we believed in the Lord Jesus, and it is also by His grace that we love the Lord Jesus
All the mothers know that there are many things that no one but mothers can do for their children, because mothers have the loving power
She said that every martyr of Jesus is one who loves Jesus; every one who loves Jesus will give his life for Jesus
The Lord Jesus is not a doctrine He is not a set of gifts or a power He is a Person who needs our love our appreciation and our affection
One book among the sixty-six books of the Bible, the Song of Songs, illustrates how the Lord Jesus is altogether lovely
We may talk about Christ being our life, but if we do not have the real love toward Him, He is only life to us in doctrine
If we will pray in this way, we will see what love we will have toward the Lord and what kind of life we will live
You must realize that the 'zoe-life' is such a loving, wonderful Person and that love is the way to deal with Him
We have seen that to believe in the Lord is to receive Him, and that to love Him is to enjoy what we have received
When Saul of Tarsus was persecuting the Lord, the Lord came to him as a great light and he was smitten to the earth
There is much talk today about Christ as life, but not many Christians really know how to enjoy the Lord as life
If we did not have love, there would be no problem; but because the one we love is a person, there are problems
The stronger a person is, the more problems he will give you if you love him-and Jesus is the strongest Person
Though we say we love Jesus and we really mean it we have a real problem we are loving the strongest Person with the strongest personality
Because of the savor of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee
Following the appreciation is the enjoyment: 'As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons
You may think this is wonderful, but if you were the seeking one you would say, 'I am here resting, and He is there jumping and skipping
A short while before, He was with her in the banqueting house; now, she is still in the house while He is outside the wall
Now she is within the wall, and He is outside the wall; she is resting, and He is jumping, leaping, and skipping
Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether'
Even though she says that she is not ready, and that the Lord must wait until the shadows flee away, the Lord will not go along with her
Because of her strong personality, she holds the Lord very strongly and tells Him that she will never let Him go
If we would pray over the eight chapters of this book in the spirit, we would see how to take the Lord as our life
The Song of Songs is the unique book in the Bible showing us the proper way, not only to love the Lord, but also to enjoy Him as our life
Many Christians know all of these verses, but it is not a matter of knowledge; it is a matter of enjoying Christ as life
If we really desire to experience Christ as our life in a way of enjoyment, we cannot stay away from this book
John 11 shows us a real discrepancy between the lovers of Jesus and Himself and this discrepancy is exactly the same as in the Song of Songs
If we can see this, it will be easy for us to understand the experience that is recorded in the second chapter of the Song of Songs
Many people love the Lord but few of them really know how to take the Lord as life by forgetting their self and their personal character
The first appraisal is in 1:9: 'I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots'
The Lord speaks of a lily in Matthew 6 as one who lives on this earth, not trusting in his own strength, but upon God's mercy
During the night, she is His resting place, and during the day, she is His very expression for His move on the earth
God's life and building can be seen Within the Song of Songs; He shows by types His seeking ones, The Bride for whom Christ longs!
As time goes by, her concepts change, With doves' eyes she can see That naught can with her love compare- There's none so dear as He!
She's next a dove who hides herself Within the cloven rock; Now in her Lord's ascended life Is love which knows no shock!
Of smoke, a pillar she's become, And now, as wand'ring ends, Her will to His will is subdued, What fragrance sweet ascends!
In the last chapter we saw the Lord's appraisal of the seeking one in the first three chapters of the Song of Songs
The Lord's description of His seeker with different figures illustrated the state the seeker had attained at that time
In verse 7 she prayed, 'Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon'
She followed in such a strong way that the Lord praised her saying that she was like a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots
After the Lord's first appraisal of the seeking one, she enjoyed the Lord more and more, and she appreciated the Lord
Between 1:9 and 1:15, there are several verses showing how the Lord appreciated her and how she appreciated the Lord
If they were to appreciate the Lord more and more, this appreciation would give them a spiritual concept and the insight of the Spirit
They would look at their hair, their sideburns, their mustaches, their eye glasses, and their tee shirts in a different way
The doves' eyes are the spiritual insights that come from continually gazing on the Lord and putting our trust in Him
When the seeking one's eyes have become the eyes of the dove, she has lost her confidence in her natural strength
Not only did the Lord Himself consider the seeking one here as a lily, but even she herself recognized that she was a lily
All the improvements and all the stages of the growth in life can only come as we are taking Christ as our Person
We know that in typology myrrh signifies the fragrance of Jesus' death, and frankincense signifies the sweet flavor of His resurrection
For many months and years we need to be under the permeating fragrance of the death and resurrection of Christ
We must be permeated with the death and resurrection of Christ and with all the attributes of the heavenly Christ
In chapter two, she was under the apple tree for her satisfaction, but now Solomon lies down and has his satisfaction in her
She is not only the couch for Solomon to rest in at night, she is also the palanquin for Him to move in by day
As His palanquin, we will be built with the humanity of Jesus, the redemption of Christ, and the divine nature of God
It is made of the humanity of Jesus, the redemption of Christ, and the divinity of God; and the interior is fitted with love to Jesus
Of the first four figures-the horse, the doves' eyes, the lily, and the dove-the horse is clearly the strongest in personality
In the last four figures- the pillars of smoke, the couch, the palanquin, and the crown-there is definitely no personality
Eventually, by appreciating the Lord Jesus and enjoying His riches, her strong will has been subdued step by step
The cross and the resurrection life have worked within her to change her character and transform her personality
At first the seeking one is a horse pulling Pharaoh, but eventually she becomes a palanquin containing and carrying Solomon
We should not be conformed to the course of this age, but we should be transformed by the renewing of our minds
Because her concept, ideas, and insight have been changed, she does not trust in the horse's strength any longer
The moving vessel of Christ is not of natural birth, but something built with the resurrected and ascended humanity of Christ
The redemption of Christ is our supporting strength, and the divine nature of God is the very base of our building
He does not use anything of our natural make-up, but He uses His humanity, His redemption, and the divinity of God
He is always seeking our love, and only our love affords something for the interior decoration of the palanquin
The basic structure is of wood, silver, and gold, but our love is the only thing with which the interior is decorated
The more we love Him, the more we will lose our will, but the interior of the palanquin will be fully decorated
The goats are not scattered, but gathered; they are not on the plain, but on the mountainside, giving a picture of submission
By the time she was the moving vessel of Christ, all her wills had been dealt with and gathered together to present a picture of submission
Formerly, she had only the beauty of the renewing of her mind, but now she also has the beauty of the subduing of her will
As we have already mentioned, the discrepancy between the seeking one and the Lord in chapter two was due entirely to her strong will
Chapter three tells us of the maturity of the seeking one, and chapter four continues by explaining how she reached such a mature stage
Our will must be subdued; then it will be resurrected like the tower of David, the armory for the spiritual warfare
If our will has never been subdued by the Lord, it can never be a strong armory to keep all the weapons for the spiritual warfare
The secret of the maturity of the seeking one in chapter three is that her will has been completely subdued and resurrected
For the works and activities, there is the need of power to accomplish them and the need of gifts as the ability to perform them
Many hold the doctrine of sanctification, but they are not sanctified because sanctification is simply the Lord Jesus Himself
He was in the house of the poor, while all the Jewish leaders and priests were offering sacrifices and burning incense to God
Of all, she had the appreciation, and then she came into the enjoyment of eating the fruit of the apple tree under its shadow
It is digested and assimilated to become cells in your blood; these cells then become your organic tissue and even your very element
As we appreciate and enjoy the Lord, something of the element of the Lord is taken into us and eventually becomes us
It was by dealing with the emotion, the mind, and the will, that the Lord was able to work Himself into His seeking one
A horse has an exceedingly strong personality, but the palanquin does not have any personality of its own, though it does have a personality
All these elements are in His Person, and they will be wrought into us until we are transformed and our stubborn will is subdued
Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices'
The seeking one has become not only a palanquin in which Christ can move, but also a garden to grow so many spices
The Song of Songs begins with eating, drinking, and enjoyment on the seeker's side, but now the enjoyment is for the Lord
In chapters one and two, the seeker is eating the fruit of the apple tree and drinking the wine in the banqueting house
It takes the whole Bible to describe the seeker because the Bible starts with the garden and concludes with the city
May the Lord grant us doves' eyes so that we will have spiritual perception to see that spirituality is not merely for individuals
The conclusion for this group of figures is the palanquin for the Lord's move and the crown for the Lord's glory
In the second section, two more figures are used by the Lord to describe this wonderful person: a garden and a city
We can see her in the garden in Genesis 1 and 2, and we can also see her in the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21 and 22
He was her enjoyment, but now what He is has been wrought into her, and she is growing it back to Him for His enjoyment
Now we need to go back to see a few points about the improvement, the progress, and the growth of the seeking one
She realizes she still needs more; she needs even to abide in the death of Christ and in the resurrection of Christ
In 3:6, she was perfumed with the myrrh and frankincense, but in 4:6, she is going to a mountain of myrrh and a hill of frankincense
Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits' 'I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse'
All the spices that are grown in the garden are for the Lord's satisfaction and are the materials for building the city
It is not only a matter of being a boast to Him as a crown; we must grow something for the Lord Jesus to eat and enjoy
May the Lord have mercy on us that we may see His divine work of recovery and what is missing in today's Christianity
To the Lord we're as a garden, Out from which the spices flow; All the precious fruits of Jesus Freely in this garden grow
Spikenard, saffron, henna flower, Cinnamon and calamus, Frankincense and myrrh and aloes; O Lord, we would ever grow Thee thus
O Lord, come into Thy garden, Come, Beloved, come and eat Freely for Thy satisfaction Of Thy fruit, abundant, sweet
All the produce of the garden Is with resurrection filled That the Lord may have a city, Fruits of resurrection build
From the garden to the city, Growth transformed to precious stone; Christ is thus expressed, reflected- God in all His glory fully shown
Now the city, fair and comely, As the dawn, triumphantly, Is an army strong and mighty Marching forth in victory
When we consider all of the figures used to describe the seeking one, we marvel: from the horses to the garden, and eventually to the city
The first part of this book shows the first aspect of the Christian life; the last part shows the last aspect of the Christian life
You cannot read another chapter in the Bible and stay in the Lord's presence for another half hour, and then you have it
We cannot stretch ourselves on the bed to be a little taller, and then expect the next day to have grown half a foot
No one knows how long this seeker of the Lord Jesus stayed on the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense
Myrrh signifies the Lord's death, and frankincense signifies the Lord's resurrection, while Lebanon is a type of the Lord's ascension
In chapter two, there was the discrepancy between her and the Lord due to her satisfaction with her attainment
Not only had she experienced so much of the Lord's death and resurrection, but she had attained to the mountaintop of the Lord's ascension
There is only one way to be on the mountaintop of the Lord's ascension, that is, by the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense
To pray for a week is easy; even to fast for a week is easy; but to stay at the mountain of myrrh for five years is not easy
There is no other way to get to the mountaintop of the Lord's ascension except by the Lord's death and resurrection
By this the Lord is telling us that there are still the lions, the leopards, the enemy, and so many needy ones
In chapter three, she was even perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, that is, she was permeated and mingled with the Lord
She appreciated the Lord, she enjoyed the Lord, and she was even permeated with the Lord, but she never grew anything to the Lord
The henna flower is not from the Lord for her appreciation, but it is grown out of her for the Lord's appreciation
We cannot grow the things we appreciate, enjoy, and with which we are permeated without being fully built up as a garden
Regardless of how high our attainment might be, though it be to the mountaintop of Lebanon, it should never be for ourselves individually
We must go down to the valley to be built up with others and to grow all the things of the Lord with which we have been permeated
To be a crown with a tower of David is marvelous, but upon arriving at that stage we immediately need a turn; we cannot stay
In the foregoing chapters she enjoyed all these things, but in the garden the Lord Himself comes in to enjoy them
We left the valley to go to the mountaintop of ascension; now we must go back to be a garden to grow many things for the Lord's satisfaction
When the Lord brought Peter, James, and John from the valley to the mountaintop, they saw a real vision of Himself
May the Lord have mercy upon us that we may be willing to turn again and again until we become a garden to fulfill His purpose
In the first section the Lord was everything to her, but now in the second section the Lord enjoys everything out of her
Christians are encouraged to work for God but are not told that the way to work for God is not by the outer working but by the inner growth
When the Lord has been wrought into us, then we will grow out something, and this something will be our working
We must get ourselves to the mountain of death and the hill of resurrection and stay there for a length of time
We tell the Lord that we are going to fast and pray for three days, but the Lord says, 'Take something to eat and go to sleep'
Paul does not speak of experiencing a portion of the Lord's death, but of staying there until we will be 'made conformable unto his death'
We expect to stay at the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense, but we find ourselves on the mountaintop of Lebanon
In a sense, the garden is close to the city; yet when we consider the Bible, the garden is far removed from the city
It was not until 1935, when Brother Nee was going through this book with a few of us, that this point became clear
Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted'
Now the seeking one is in the heavenlies, and the Lord calls her to come down out of the heavenlies to put on something to suffer for Him
For the seeking ones of the Lord to deny the world is a marvelous thing; to deny themselves is even more glorious
He sacrificed all that He was in order to come to the earth to accomplish God's purpose by suffering as a 'man of sorrows'
The seeking one who reached such high attainment in her spiritual life still has some discrepancy between her and the Lord
Now the Lord says to her, 'Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners'
By all the cycles we will grow from the crown to the garden, and then from the garden to the city and the army
What we must see are all the turning points in life that we may grow up for God's eternal purpose, the corporate building
By the closer and deeper fellowship with the Lord mentioned in the last verse of chapter one, she became a lily trusting only in God
The natural strength was lost; she realized that to go on with the Lord she must drop all her natural power to do things for Him
After this, she was brought into the banqueting house, the house of wine, to have a further enjoyment of eating and drinking the Lord
All of her transformation was due to her appreciation and enjoyment of the Lord through the experiences of the Lord's death and resurrection
Many figures such as the myrrh the clefts of the rock and the secret of the steep places are pictures of the Lords death and resurrection
We cannot partake of the Lord Himself without participating in His death and resurrection, because these are elements of His very being
As the Lord's element gets into us, He kills all the negative items and nourishes us with all of the positive elements
The lily was transformed into a dove, and she stayed in the cleft of the rock and in the secret of the steep places
Figures constitute the first group: the horses, the doves' eyes, the lily, the dove, the pillars, the couch, the palanquin, and the crown
When we come out of the wilderness of our will, we become the pillars, the couch, the palanquin, and the crown
That is only the first half of the book, showing only the first half of the poetic portrayal of our spiritual experiences
He called her to leave her highest attainment, to leave the mountaintop of Lebanon and to go down to the valley to be a garden
She was so satisfied with her spiritual attainment that it created a kind of discrepancy between her and the Lord
Every time we are contented with our spiritual attainment, this satisfaction becomes a discrepancy between us and the Lord
We can hear the Lord immediately whenever He speaks, and we can realize whether His presence is with us or not
Many missionaries, pastors, and Christian workers have become captured by the church life from all their natural activities
In a sense, He has accomplished everything and has ascended to the heavens where He sits at the right hand of God
Even today, we must complete the Body by suffering the same kind of afflictions the Lord Jesus suffered as a man
Today there are many so-called servants of the Lord who have never touched any secular job or worldly business
Have you realized that Paul was in the tentmaking business even after he reached such a high attainment of spirituality?
Many socalled free preachers have left the denominations but they only care for their own ministry they care little for the Body of Christ
We are forced to take a special standing, a standing which is absolutely different from Christianity and the free groups
Through these experiences, we will become a city as God's dwelling place, God's habitation, and also an army to stand against God's enemy
The last attainment was reached when she became a producing garden, growing out what she had enjoyed of the Lord
Now He continued by showing her that whatever He did on this earth was not according to His own taste, opinion, or feeling
He worked for the Father, not according to His own desire, but according to His Father's desire and to fulfill His Father's purpose
There had been a separation between her and the Lord, but the barrier was removed by the myrrh dripping from her hands
In her working, in her doing, in whatever she does for the Lord, there is now the sweet smell of the dripping myrrh
During all that time, she had been dealing with the Lord more or less according to her feeling of the Lord's presence
When we lose the feeling of the Lord's presence, the best way to bring it back is to talk with others about Him
Now she is like the Apostle Paul, suffering for the Lord's purpose, not working according to her taste, but according to God's desire
She is no longer laboring for her contentment or satisfaction but for the fulfilling of Gods eternal purpose to build up the Body of Christ
Even chapter five shows some personal satisfaction and contentment, but now as a city she is absolutely not for herself
Now she is wholly for God's purpose of building up the church, which is seen at the end of the Bible as a built-up city
Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead
Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them'
The Lord likens her to three shining things and one terrifying thing: the dawn, the moon, the sun, and the army
Who is she that looketh forth as the dawn, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners'?
Proverbs 4:18 says, 'The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day'
To the Lord she is the city; to the enemy she is the army; and to the whole universe she is the shining one, shining forth all the time
According to the Bible, the sun signifies Christ, and the moon as the reflection of the sun signifies the church
Eventually, some of her admirers ask her to return: 'Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee
Christ will make His seeking lover Pillar, couch, and palanquin, E'en a crown, His boast and glory; He will do it all!
Paradise of pomegranates, Pleasant fruits, and henna flowers, Spikenard, saffron, myrrh, and aloes: His enjoyment now-not ours
He has come into His garden, Gathered myrrh and spices there, Eaten honeycomb and honey; Wine and milk He'll drink fore'er
From the garden comes the city, All materials thus supplied; God is satisfied completely, And the foe is terrified
Seemingly nothing else is required but where is the fulfillment of Gods purpose the building up of the Body the building up of the city
Today, nearly all Christians care only for their own needs, while some of the more improved Christians care for the needs of others
Regardless of how much we undertake for our own satisfaction and how much we help others to be satisfied, we can only reach so far
It is not simply a matter of our being satisfied or of satisfying others, but of the completing of the eternal purpose of God
There is another aspect of the Lord's suffering: His suffering for the formation and the building up of the Body
The Lord Jesus suffered for the producing of the Body, not from the Gentile world, but from the Jewish religious world
If we would seek just to be spiritual and to care for others, not seeking to care for the Body, all Christianity would be happy with us
Even after the seeking one in the Song of Songs has reached the fourth attainment of being a garden, the Body still has not been attended to
We all must participate in the fellowship of His sufferings that we may be conformed to His death for His Body's sake
When we go on to care for the ground of the church for the building up of the Body, they will be thoroughly offended
Can we only care for our personal spirituality go to the mission field set up a seminary to teach others or teach some Bible study classes
They will do this not because we are heretical or because we are wrong in seeking spirituality and preaching the gospel
She even appears as the dawn, the moon, and the sun, as well as celebrating the victory by the dance of two armies
The Lord first of all mentions something about her footsteps: 'How beautiful are thy footsteps with shoes, O prince's daughter'
From Ephesians chapter 6 we see that the shoes signify the preaching of the full gospel, including the preaching of the church life
If we have shoes on our feet, our feet are covered, protected, and separated from the earth, though they are so near to the earth
If from the first day we tell them they need Jesus, not one of them will ask us to go to the movies the next day
The second thing that the Lord mentions are the jewels: 'Thy rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a skillful workman'
Now her neck is not only full of submission for fighting the spiritual warfare, but it is also full of the resurrection life
We not only care for the Lord's work where we are, but we also care for the Lord's interests in the whole universe
Following the eyes, the Lord appraises her nose: 'Thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus'
Perhaps he could not say exactly what is wrong, but he knows that something is indeed wrong, because he has a nose as a tower
With this one there is the submission to the uttermost, and the beauty of her submission holds the Lord as a captive
The Lord goes on to mention something about her breasts: 'This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes'
Now it is she who initiates the move with the Lord: 'Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages
The field is the world in a general way, the villages are the local churches, and all the gardens are the different saints
She worked not only by taking the initiative, but also, in type, by covering the whole earth with all the local churches
If we are really qualified to work in the Lord and with the Lord, our scope and our sight will be widely broadened
Though chapter seven shows one who seems so qualified to work together with the Lord, there is still a further need
No matter how mature the seeking one has become, she still is in the old creation; she still lives in the flesh
Her spirit has been regenerated and her soul has been fully transformed, but her body is not the same as the Lord's
To find the Lord without is the expectation of such a mature one in the Lord as the seeking one has now become
Most Christians do not like to use a negative term to illustrate something of the Lord, as the Bible does here
If we had written the Bible, we would never have used the term 'thief' to describe the Lord when He comes back
Chapter eight of the Song of Songs reminds us that even when we become so matured, we are only sinners saved by grace
We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?
If she be a wall, we will build upon her a turret of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar'
In all the previous chapters, the most the seeking one did was to feed others, giving them something to eat and to drink
There are at least two translations that render the word turret as battlement which refers to the high towers on the walls used for fighting
We will build upon her item after item, aspect after aspect of the Lord's redemption that she may fight the battle
The seeking one knows how to build this younger Christian not only if she is a wall, but also if she is a door
A door in the Bible mainly signifies the experience of coming into the Lord's grace or coming into God Himself
She is unlike today's Christians, who try to help others, but do not know whether the person they are helping is a wall or a door
He has distracted nearly all of the Lord's children from God's purpose through many good, scriptural, and spiritual things
Nearly all of the sound, scriptural subjects have been utilized by the enemy to distract the Lord's children from life and building
As long as we do not care for the building, and as long as God's eternal goal cannot be accomplished, Satan would be happy
Though many have received help from the Catholic Church, they have been fully distracted from God's eternal purpose
When Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, a stone'
When Andrew brought his brother Simon to the Lord, the Lord changed his name to Cephas, which simply means a stone
Peter recognized Him as the Son of the living God, and then the Lord reminded him that he was a stone for the building up of His church
Peter, Paul, and John are the main writers in the composition of the New Testament, and all their writings speak of stones for the building
At the very beginning of the New Testament age, when Simon came to Jesus, the Lord immediately changed his name to Peter, a stone
After Peter stayed with the Lord for two or three years, he recognized Him as the Christ, the Son of the living God
Paul also spoke the same thing, and eventually the Apostle John gave the conclusion to the whole New Testament and even to the entire Bible
It has been buried in the Bible for centuries, but now the Lord has been merciful to us and has removed the covering
Surely the twelve Apostles were built up, for they became the twelve layers of foundation stones for the New Jerusalem
What the Lord is after today is someone to fulfill His purpose and to heed His goal, and by the Lord's mercy that is why we are here
There is no other way to fulfill the Lord's purpose, and this is why these are the main things in the Lord's recovery
We may be like a company of horses, or so improved that we are like a dove or even a palanquin, but we still need to go on to be the city!
If we would read all the Epistles again with the viewpoint of the building, we would see that they all are for this destination
He is our God, our Creator, our Redeemer, our Savior, our Lord, our life-giving Spirit, our way, our life, our everything!
Following the Acts, the Epistles tell us how this wonderful Person can come into us so that we can be built up together
1 Corinthians tells us how He is everything to us, and how we must become precious stones to be built up together as God's dwelling place
Up to the first part of this century the Lord used many different saints to recover numerous items for His recovery
Now, the Lord's intention is to put all of the items of His recovery together to build up the local lampstands
The Lord's recovery today is simply the building up of the local lampstands, or in other words, the real practice of the church life
Nearly all of the spiritual things have been recovered, and today the Lord is seeking the real practice of the church life
Many people are seeking to be holy and spiritual, but without being built up they are still short of the Lord's goal
Though some may be holy and spiritual, without the building they are still unable to fulfill God's consummate purpose
If holiness and spirituality are not for the building up of the local church, they are still short of God's purpose
What comes forth at the end of the Bible is not a group of spiritual persons or holy people, but a built-up city
When Peter was brought to the Lord, he was given a new name indicating that he was to be a stone in God's building
