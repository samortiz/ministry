<p>In Matthew 5:15 the Lord said, &ldquo;Nor do men light a lamp and place it under the bushel, but on the lampstand; and it shines to all who are in the house.&rdquo; A bushel is an instrument for measuring grain for the purpose of buying and selling. Spiritually speaking, a bushel signifies people earning money in order to make a living and have food to eat. This indicates that making a living can cover our light. On the one hand, while we live in the world, we should work with our own hands (1 Thes. 4:11), and we should not be lazy. On the other hand, we must realize that Satan often utilizes the matter of making a living to occupy God&rsquo;s people. If we carefully observe the situation among Christians, we will admit that the kingdom people often cannot shine for the Lord because they are too busy making a living. Those who are occupied with their eating, which is necessary for their living, do not care about shining for God.</p>
<p>If a lamp is placed under a bushel, its light will not be able to shine forth, and the lamp will eventually go out. We need to ask ourselves, &ldquo;Is my lamp under a bushel?&rdquo; If we cannot forget about making a living and about eating and are always afraid of going hungry, we are placing our lamp under a bushel. In order to shine for the Lord, we must first overcome the matters related to our living and our eating. Hence, in Matthew 6:25 the Lord said, &ldquo;Do not be anxious for your life, what you should eat or what you should drink; nor for your body, what you should put on,&rdquo; and in verse 32 He said, &ldquo;Your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.&rdquo; Let us give all these things to God! He is responsible for us and will take care of us. If many saints can break their bushels, our light will shine brighter.</p>
<p>Our lamp should not be covered or bound by a bushel; rather, it should be placed on a lampstand. A lamp placed on a lampstand is the same as a city being situated on a mountain. If we read 5:14 and 15 carefully, we will realize that the city in verse 14 is the lamp in verse 15, and the mountain in verse 14 is the lampstand in verse 15. Both the city on a mountain and the lamp on a lampstand indicate that the position of the kingdom people should be transcendent and heavenly. Such believers are transcendent and free. Everything related to their living, such as their reputation, position, education, and material riches, are not able to affect them; rather, everything is under their feet. However, if their lamp is under their bushel, the bushel will control them. The kingdom people are on the lampstand and above everything. Hence, their light is not covered but shines brightly.</p>
<p>We should not receive this word as mere doctrine. If our light is not shining brightly, it must be because we are still covered. We must ask the Lord to enlighten us so that we may see what is covering us. Any person, matter, or thing that controls us is a bushel that covers us. If we are befuddled by a romantic love, that love is a bushel. If our business occupies us such that we have no desire to draw near to the Lord, that business is a bushel. If our children occupy all our attention and time, our children are a bushel. When such persons, matters, and things touch us, we will be ruled by them and unable to transcend.</p>
<p>There is a common Chinese saying: &ldquo;A lamp set on a high place shines over a lower place.&rdquo; In Genesis 1 God set the sun, the moon, and the stars in the expanse of heaven, and they gave light on the earth (vv. 16-17). This shows that the position of the kingdom people has much to do with their light. When they leave the heavenly and transcendent position, they lose their ability to shine.</p>
<p>When a lamp is placed on a lampstand, it shines to all who are in the house. The house in Matthew 5:15 points to a realm. Our environment, such as a school, a store, an institution, or a home, is the realm where we shine. If our light is shining brightly, everyone in our realm will be enlightened.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Basis of Shining and the Realm of Shining</h2>
<p>Psalm 121:1-2 says, &ldquo;I will lift up my eyes to the hills. / From where will my help come? / My help comes from Jehovah, / Who made heaven and earth.&rdquo; These verses imply that God is in the hills. Isaiah 14:13 also indicates that God is on the mountain, in the highest place. First Timothy 6:16 says that God dwells in unapproachable light. Many verses in the Bible, such as 1 Kings 22:19; Psalm 29:10; 55:19; and Revelation 7:10, say that God is sitting on the throne. According to these verses, God is on the mountains, in unapproachable light, and on the throne. Therefore, when we touch God, we are on the mountain and in the light; that is, we touch the throne of God.</p>
<p>Instead of desiring dust and water, we should desire the mountains. If we are willing to pay the price to be filled with the indwelling Spirit, we will touch the high mountains. Whenever we are filled with the Spirit, we are on the high mountains. Revelation 21:10 says that John was carried away in spirit by an angel onto a great and high mountain and was shown the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. The throne of God and the light of God are in the holy city (22:3; 21:23).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 5 is simple, but the significance of His word is rich and profound. If we carefully consider verses 13 through 15, we will realize that this word is meaningful. The Lord first said that we are the salt of the earth and then that we are the light of the world. If He had first said that we are the light of the world and then that we are the salt of the earth, the order would have been incorrect, because our inward nature is the basis, and our outward conduct is the expression. There must be first the inward nature and then the outward conduct. We must first be delivered from dust and water to be salt before we can shine as light.</p>
<p>When the Lord spoke of being the light of the world, He used the picture of a city situated upon a mountain to indicate the position of our shining. He also used the picture of a lamp shining to all who are in the house to indicate the realm of our shining. When the kingdom people are shining, they have the position of a city situated on a mountain. As a result, they shine to all who are in the house. This implies that when the kingdom people are shining in the world, their position is high and great, because a city is great and a mountain is high. However, when the kingdom people function, they do not expect to be high or great; rather, they function in a smaller realm.</p>
<p>The basis for the kingdom people to shine on the earth is high and transcendent, because the God of glory is their life and power for them to live on the earth. However, the living of the kingdom people is humble and lowly; they are willing to be lowly people. They are not puffed up, nor are they haughty. They simply shine forth light upon those who come into contact with them. What a beautiful scene.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
