<h2 class="head3">Noah&rsquo;s Household Being Saved<br />
through Building the Ark</h2>
<p>The Bible shows that from the time of Adam, Abel, Enoch, and Noah, God&rsquo;s eyes were set on the tabernacle because He desires to have a habitation on earth among men. If we have insight, we will see that God&rsquo;s eyes were always set on the tabernacle and the temple. However, the descendants of Adam did not reach God&rsquo;s purpose. Rather, they were utilized by Satan, became Satan&rsquo;s building materials, and even built a city for Satan (Gen. 11:4). As a result, God could not find anyone on the earth to build His habitation. When God judged the world with the flood, Noah&rsquo;s household was saved through building the ark, and the earth had a new beginning (6:11&mdash;9:17). However, Noah&rsquo;s descendants formed nations and were utilized again by Satan to build the city of Babel (11:1-4). As a result, God was left with no one as material for His dwelling. Thus, God judged Babel and confounded man&rsquo;s language (v. 7).</p>
<h2 class="head3">God Calling Abraham and His Seed<br />
to Build the House of God</h2>
<p>God called Abraham, and charged him to go forth from his land and from his relatives and from his father&rsquo;s house to the land that God would show him (12:1). God also promised Abraham that He would give that land to his seed (vv. 7; 13:14-17). God promised Abraham two things: land and descendants. The land would serve as the site of God&rsquo;s house, and the descendants would be the materials for the building of God&rsquo;s habitation. Abraham waited for the fulfillment of this promise, and his son Isaac also waited. Later, this promise was passed on to Jacob, the son of Isaac. Although Jacob was not the firstborn, he sought the birthright and employed crafty means to cheat his older brother and gain the birthright. Jacob, being hated by his older brother, was forced to leave his parents and flee to his uncle&rsquo;s house (25:29-34; 27:5-46). While Jacob was fleeing to his uncle&rsquo;s house, he had a dream in which he saw a ladder set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and there the angels of God were ascending and descending on the ladder. God was standing above the ladder, and He blessed Jacob. When Jacob awoke, he took the stone that he had put under his head, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on top of it. He considered this place to be the house of God, the gate of heaven, and called the name of this place Bethel, which means &ldquo;house of God&rdquo; (28:10-19). This indicated that God would raise up the sons of Jacob to be His house.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Israel Being the Real Habitation of God</h2>
<p>The sons of Jacob later became a great race, but they were enslaved in Egypt (Exo. 1:1-14). God delivered them out of Egypt and raised up the tabernacle among them (40:17). We must understand this with spiritual insight: the erecting of the tabernacle was the beginning of God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth. From then on God was watchful of this tabernacle. The tabernacle can be considered as the symbol and figure of Israel. However, the tabernacle itself was not God&rsquo;s habitation; Israel was God&rsquo;s habitation. The tabernacle was a symbol, a type. When Israel was in a normal situation, God dwelt among them; when Israel was not in a normal situation, God did not dwell among them. Psalm 133 says, &ldquo;Behold, how good and how pleasant it is / For brothers to dwell in unity! / ...Like the dew of Hermon / That came down upon the mountains of Zion&rdquo; (vv. 1, 3). These verses refer to the condition of God&rsquo;s habitation, the tabernacle and the temple. When God&rsquo;s people dwelt together in unity, they were God&rsquo;s habitation on earth, and God dwelt among them. When they were apostate and desolate, God went out from among them, and the temple was destroyed. Before the end of the Old Testament age, God restored the children of Israel, and the temple was rebuilt.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The New Testament Focusing on Building<br />
the Church as the House of God</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Being Built through<br />
the Lord&rsquo;s Death and Resurrection</h2>
<p>The New Testament speaks of the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place. God wants us not only to be spiritual and God-fearing men but also to be those who can dwell with God&rsquo;s people together in unity, who can be coordinated into one entity, and who become a spiritual temple as His dwelling place. John 1:14 says that the Lord Jesus, as the Word, &ldquo;became flesh and tabernacled among us..., full of grace and reality.&rdquo; In chapter 2 when the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&rdquo; (v. 19), He spoke of the temple of His body (v. 21). He seemed to be saying that the Jews would crucify Him, but in three days He would be raised up. This means that the Lord would resurrect three days after His death to build up the mystical Body as God&rsquo;s temple. The physical body that the Jews destroyed on the cross was what the Lord Jesus put on in incarnation. The Body that was raised up when He resurrected from the dead is a mystical Body. Through His resurrection from death He imparted His life into us and regenerated us so that we became members of His Body. After we enter the gates of the New Jerusalem, the Holy Spirit does a work of resurrection in us, stripping us of our earthy element and bringing everything in us into resurrection so that we can be transformed in resurrection and built together into the Lord&rsquo;s mystical Body. This mystical Body is the church and also the temple built by the Lord in resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Apostles Building the Church<br />
with Gold, Silver, and Precious Stones</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus first spoke of the church in Matthew 16:18, saying, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; When He first spoke of the church, He spoke of building. The apostles also preached concerning the building of the church. The purpose of the work was not merely for people to be saved, to be spiritual, to be consecrated, and to become gold, pearls, and precious stones. The work of the apostles was for the building of the church. In 1 Corinthians 3:12 the apostle Paul says that some build with gold, silver, and precious stones, and others, with wood, grass, and stubble. The work of the apostles was to build the church with gold, silver, and precious stones. Their work was not merely a matter of salvation or transformation. Their desire was to build the church of God with valuable materials.</p>
<p>The New Testament takes the line of God&rsquo;s house as its center, which house is the church built by the apostles. This church is not abstract but specific; it is built in every locality. The Bible clearly states that the church is to be built in locality after locality (Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5). God builds His dwelling place in the New Testament age by building the church as His dwelling place. The practical way to build God&rsquo;s dwelling place is to gain people to have God&rsquo;s life and be built together through the transformation work of the Holy Spirit into a dwelling place of God in every locality. This is God&rsquo;s desire, God&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Christ Being the Head<br />
and the Church Being His Body</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire must be accomplished in Christ His Son. God is embodied in the Son, and the Son has the first place and the preeminence in the universe so that He can be expressed and glorified. Not only so, the Son of God is expressed in the church, He is the Head of the church, and the church is His Body (Col. 1:18-19; Eph. 1:22-23). The Head and the Body are equally crucial, and Christ and the church are balanced truths in the Bible. We must not neglect either. The vision at the end of Revelation shows that God&rsquo;s redeemed throughout the ages become a city. Christ, the Lamb who was slain, is the lamp of the city, and God is the light of the city (21:23). This means that God is in Christ, and Christ is in the church. God is expressed in Christ, and Christ is expressed in the church. Ephesians 3:21 says, &ldquo;To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations forever and ever. Amen.&rdquo; This verse does not say, &ldquo;To God in Christ be the glory,&rdquo; but &ldquo;To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; This means that He is to be expressed in the church. All that God is, is for Christ, and all that Christ is, is for the church.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, the Bible speaks of this building. This building is for Christ and takes Christ as its center and everything. Christ&rsquo;s being the center and His being everything depend on this building. When this building is damaged, Christ cannot be seen as the center and cannot be expressed as everything. Christ and the church are two aspects of the divine vision. They are the mysteries of God and are the corporate man in the universe, with Christ being the Head and the church being His Body.</p>
