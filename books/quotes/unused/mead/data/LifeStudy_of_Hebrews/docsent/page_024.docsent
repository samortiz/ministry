   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Man in Prophecy</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although the situation at the end of the book of Genesis was very pitiful, it is most promising by the time we come to Psalm 8.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The psalmist surely was inspired when he said, When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Under the inspiration of God, the psalmist prophesied the recovery of what had been lost in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He repeated the words of Genesis 1, prophesying that man s lost ordination was to be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, Psalm 8 is a recovery of man s lost ordination which was given in Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The divine ordination bestowed upon the created man in Genesis 1 was lost at the time of man s fall.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The psalmist prophesied that this ordination would be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we shall see shortly, the man prophesied in Psalm 8 is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is revealed in Hebrews 2.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A Little Inferior to the Angels</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the prophecy regarding the recovery of man s lost ordination in Psalm 8 it says that God has made man a little lower than the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Hebrews 2:7, it is quoted as a little inferior to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is according to the physical, not the positional, situation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Physically speaking, man is lower than or inferior to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Having Been Crowned with Glory and Honor</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, the prophecy in Psalm 8 says that God has crowned man, who is lower than the angels, with glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was not fulfilled in any man until the man Jesus ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, this prophecy is concerning the Lord as a man and it is fulfilled in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Being Set over the Works of God</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The prophecy in Psalm 8 also says that God has made man to have dominion over the works of His hands and that He has put all things under his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the quotation in Hebrews 2 it says that God has set man over the works of His hands and has subjected all things under His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Clearly this is a repetition of what is mentioned in Genesis 1:26-28.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It may be called the recovery of what was given to man in Genesis 1 and was lost due to the fall of man in Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>C. The Man in Fulfillment</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hebrews 2:6-9 is the fulfillment of the prophecy in Psalm 8.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It tells us that the man in this fulfillment is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jesus is the second man 1 Cor 15:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although the first man failed God in His purpose, the second man succeeded.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Genesis 1 is the man in God s creation with God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That man failed God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then Psalm 8, speaking about the recovery of man s lost ordination, prophesied of another man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Without this second man, we and the ordination given to man are lost.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But we have the second man who has recovered man s lost ordination and has fulfilled God s original purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This second man is presented to us in Hebrews 2.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Made a Little Inferior to the Angels</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because of the Suffering of Death</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The man Jesus, in the fulfillment of the prophecy in Psalm 8, was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to our physical make-up, we are inferior to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The make-up of the angels is somewhat superior to ours.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Jesus came as a man, His physical make-up was also inferior to that of the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He became a man, taking on man s flesh, blood, and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why did He take on a physical make-up that was inferior to that of the angels?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For the purpose of suffering death for us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to suffer death, He needed a physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Without such a physical body there would have been no way for Him to die for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This was the reason that He was made a little inferior to the angels.</S>
