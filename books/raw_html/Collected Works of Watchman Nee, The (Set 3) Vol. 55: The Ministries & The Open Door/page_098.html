<h2 class="head1">REVIEW OF SEEN AND HEARD (BIOGRAPHY NO. 1)<br />BY JAMES M'KENDRICK</h2><p>In preaching the gospel, one needs to exercise the gifts; however, he also needs to exercise his spirit. This means that there is the gift of preaching the gospel and the spirit of preaching the gospel. One who has the spirit of the gospel preaches in season and out of season. Only a few people are raised up every ten to twenty years in the history of the church who have the gift of the gospel. These people are few and far between. But everyone who loves the Lord can and should have the spirit of preaching the gospel. It is not limited to special gift.</p><p>I have read the biographies of many evangelists, including Finney, Moody, and Stanley. They all had the spirit of preaching the gospel and the gift of preaching the gospel. Their biographies can encourage us, but we cannot imitate them, because we do not have as great a gift as they did.</p><p>I particularly love this book Seen and Heard because we can say that Brother James M'Kendrick did not have the gift of preaching the gospel, but only the spirit of preaching the gospel. He was an ordinary man just like us. There was nothing special about him, but his heart was melted by the Lord's love, and he was extremely anxious for the needs of sinners. He could love, and he could cry. He could pray, and he could shout. The Lord's love was so strong in him that he was not able to refrain himself. Man's need made him restless day and night. As I read about him, I was often forced to weep with him. While Brother Yu Cheng-hua was translating this book, many times he also wept with him. M'Kendrick became a fool for the Lord's sake. He was beside himself that the gospel could go forth. Not all young brothers have the gift of preaching the gospel, but we must not lack the spirit of preaching the gospel. May this fire burn in us until we can no longer control ourselves. May this fire, because it consumes us, also consume sinners until they have no ground to refuse the Lord. May the fire of the gospel be ignited in China, first burning God's children and then sinners. Sinners will be saved in great numbers. If this fire does not burn us, it will not burn those in the world. The church can become the hindrance to man's salvation. O Lord, have mercy on the church! May the Lord have a way in the church so that He can gain access to the world. Fire! Fire! Let the fire of the gospel glow&mdash;first kindling us, and then setting the church ablaze.&mdash;Watchman Nee</p><p>(Published by the Gospel Book Room, P. O.
