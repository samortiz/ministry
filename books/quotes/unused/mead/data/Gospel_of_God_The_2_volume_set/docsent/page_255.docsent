   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HURT OF THE SECOND DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are similar passages in the Bible that speak of these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 2:11 tells us that those who overcome will not be hurt by the second death, and Revelation 20:6 says that one group of people will not die again and that the second death will not have authority over them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second death is the lake of fire at the end of Revelation 20.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that the defeated ones will suffer the hurt of the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although they will not suffer the second death itself, they will suffer the hurt of the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once a person is saved, he will not suffer the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But this does not guarantee that he will not suffer the hurt of the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We know that the time of the lake of fire and brimstone is the time when the new heaven and the new earth begins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Satan, the world, and death will all be cast into the lake of fire at that time Rev 20:10, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Also at that time a man will be cast into the lake of fire if his name is not recorded in the book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That will be the time when unbelievers are officially put into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, during the millennium, the defeated Christians will suffer the hurt of the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Of course, this dealing will not be like the dealing that the unbelievers will have; it is not for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a Christian is joined to the world and if he loves the world and the things of the world, the Lord will allow him to go into corruption, to suffer a little of what the unbelievers will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is what being hurt by the second death in Revelation 2 means, and this word is spoken to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word "hurt" in the original language means to injure someone and to damage him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second death will cause pain for some.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From the time of the great white throne on, there is the second death itself, which is the suffering for eternity in the lake of fire and of brimstone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in the millennium there is only the hurt of the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If some Christians have not dealt with their sins, they will still suffer the hurt and pain of the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE END BEING TO BE BURNED</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us now read two passages from the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hebrews 6:4-6 says, "For it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, and yet have fallen away, to renew themselves again unto repentance."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These verses describe a person who has many qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is impossible for him to be an unsaved person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He has seen the light.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He has seen the revealed God, the Only Begotten of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He has known the love of God, and he has tasted the heavenly gift, the unique gift, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Bible, gifts as a plural noun refer to the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and gift as a singular noun refers to the unique gift, the only begotten Son of God, as in John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This gift is different from the gifts of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This person not only has God and the Lord Jesus, but has also become a partaker of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He knows God, he has tasted the Lord Jesus, and he has the Holy Spirit living within him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, he has tasted the good word of God and the powers of the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The powers of the coming age are the powers of the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The gifts and powers of the Holy Spirit are particularly abundant in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The millennial kingdom will be full of works of power, miracles, wonders, and other such things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To say that one has tasted the powers of the coming age is to say that one has tasted the things of the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, this person is definitely a saved person.</S>
