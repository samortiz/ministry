   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TURNING POINT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But suddenly the Lord is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She was in the banqueting house with such a rich enjoyment, but He was outside.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What happened?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the point of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we are going to enjoy the Lord as life, we must see this discrepancy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The seeking one was enjoying the Lord in such a rich way in the banqueting house.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She had the rest and the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She was satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But suddenly, while she was resting, He was leaping and skipping.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What a discrepancy!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Song of Songs 2:8 is an important turning point in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Suppose you were the one in the banqueting house.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Would not that be wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many of you who are in the church life have been brought to such a position.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You have arrived in the banqueting house, and you have already discovered that the Lord is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You are still in the banqueting house, but His presence is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Perhaps two months ago He was with you, but now He is not.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps last year He was with you in the banqueting house, but this year He is not.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You would say, "What's wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am still so much for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am still seeking Him, and I am still enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But something is missing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is still lovable, but there is something separating us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I don't love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The world is through with me, and I am through with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If someone were to give me the world, I simply wouldn't want it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I just love my Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do believe that by the Lord's mercy so many dear ones in the church life today would say these things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yet, something is missing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is out, and you are still in. You can see Him, and He can see you, but it seems that there is still some distance between Him and you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have been asked by so many concerning this one thing, but I have never answered because I knew that the answer would be given when we covered the Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE MAIN HINDRANCE TO THE LORD AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is the problem?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before answering directly, we need to see something in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>John 11 records the case of a dead man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Jesus is life, but how could this dead man experience Jesus as life?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>John 11 shows us a real discrepancy between the lovers of Jesus and Himself, and this discrepancy is exactly the same as in the Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Martha is the best representative.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She represents you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Martha and her sister, Mary, along with Lazarus, their brother, really loved the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I do not believe that you and I could love the Lord Jesus more than they did.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Lazarus became very sick, and Martha and Mary sent a petition to the Lord Jesus for Him to come and help them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But it seems that the Lord did not have any human feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was just like a piece of wood or stone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He heard their petition, but He did not go.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He did nothing, and He said nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many times the Lord will remain silent, and at those times, His silence is more important than His utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then after a few days, the Lord decided to go.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But Martha did not thank the Lord for His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>She did not say, "O Lord, how marvelous that You have come!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thank You for Your presence."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Instead, she complained that the Lord did not come soon enough.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"Lord, if You had been here earlier, my brother would not have died."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This means that she put the whole blame upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They thought, "Now what is the use for Him to come?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Lazarus is already dead."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At the time they wanted Him to come, He did not come.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now when they did not need Him anymore, He came.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then the Lord told her, "I am the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is not a matter of time, whether it is too early or too late; it is a matter of Me. I am the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If I came five days ago or three days ago, it would be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now that I have come a few days later, it is also the same.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I am the resurrection, and your brother will rise again."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then Martha became the best expounder of the Bible, for she really knew the doctrine of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>She said, "Yes, Lord, I know that he will be raised up at the last day.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We know that doctrine already."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then the Lord said nothing more to her, but Martha went to tell her sister that the Lord had called her.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It was not, however, the Lord who had called her, but Martha.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Finally, the Lord came to the grave, and Martha voiced her opinion again.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>"Lord, he's stinking by now.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He's been in the grave four days."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But do not laugh at Martha.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Laugh at yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>She represents all the believers who love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We do love the Lord, but like Martha, we are always the greatest hindrance to His being our life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is because we have never been subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Our personality and character have never been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>To take the Lord as our life, we must take His character and His personality as our personality.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is not enough simply to quote Galatians 2:20, "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me who loved me, and gave himself for me."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must repudiate our personality and take Him as our unique Person.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Then we will have no concepts or opinions, for our personality will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He, as a living Person, will be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If Martha had really learned the lesson, she would not have asked the Lord to come in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>She would have said, "Lord, we would like for You to come.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But whether You would come or not, is up to You.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Whether You would cause my brother to survive or not, is also up to You.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Whether You would do anything, is up to You."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>To say this is easy, but to learn this lesson and to be brought to this point takes years.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>By reading through John 11, we see that Martha did absolutely nothing to help the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Instead, she did everything to hinder and frustrate the Lord from being life to them.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If we can see this, it will be easy for us to understand the experience that is recorded in the second chapter of the Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The seeker in the Song of Songs is just like Martha.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The Lord is training and disciplining the seeking one to forget about herself, her personality, and her will, and to take the Lord Himself as her Person.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The Song of Songs mainly teaches us this one unique lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Strictly speaking, it is not a book of love.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It is not a matter of learning the lesson of faith, patience, or how to become more powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>For so many years, the Lord will train us in one thing: to put our personality aside and to take Him according to His intention, His way, and for His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Many people love the Lord but few of them really know how to take the Lord as life by forgetting their self and their personal character.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>And so many do not have any intention to learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Just as the seeking one in the Song of Songs, they have no intention of responding to the Lord's call.</S>
