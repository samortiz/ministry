<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE ELEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ISRAEL'S SIN AGAINST JEHOVAH<br>AND<br>JEHOVAH'S PUNISHMENT UPON ISRAEL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(5)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ISRAEL'S HYPOCRITICAL WORSHIP TO JEHOVAH</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Jer. 7&#151;10</H1><P>In this message we will consider further Israel's hypocritical worship to Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. JEHOVAH'S CORRECTION TO ISRAEL,<br>HIS HYPOCRITICAL WORSHIPPERS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jehovah Doing to the House<br>That Is Called by His Name<br>as He Did to Shiloh</H2><P>The tabernacle and the ark were once at Shiloh, a place which eventually was defeated and overtaken. In 7:12-14 Jehovah says that He will do to the house that is called by His name, in which Israel trusts, as He has done to Shiloh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Jehovah Casting Israel Out from before Him</H2><P>Jehovah will cast Israel out from before Him, as He cast out all the seed of Ephraim (v. 15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Jehovah Making the Valley of Topheth<br>the Valley of Slaughter to Bury Them</H2><P>Jehovah will make the valley of Topheth the valley of slaughter to bury them, and their corpses will be food for the birds of the sky and for the beasts of the earth (vv. 32-33). Jehovah will cause the voice of gladness and the voice of joy to cease, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem. He will make the land a waste (v. 34). There will be no joy; instead, the whole land will be a waste.</P>
