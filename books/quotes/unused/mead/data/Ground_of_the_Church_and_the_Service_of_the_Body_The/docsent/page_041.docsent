   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE EYES OF THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE MOVING WHEELS Scripture Reading: Rev 4:6, 8; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1:9, 12, 15, 17-21</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever the Bible speaks of the four living creatures, it is to show the kind of condition we should have before God in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the condition we should have in our service based on two items seen in Revelation 4 and Ezekiel 1, that is, the eyes of the four living creatures and the moving wheels.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>EYES BEING RELATED TO GOD S MOVE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eyes are for seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Revelation 4:6-8 speaks of four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind...around and within.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that the four living creatures are transparent on all sides and that they are able to see within, without, and all around.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ezekiel 1:15b and 18b-19a say, I saw a wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures...And the rims of the four of them were full of eyes all around.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And whenever the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These verses show that the eyes of the four living creatures are upon the moving wheels, indicating that the four living creatures move by the wheels.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Revelation shows that the four living creatures are full of eyes around and within, but Ezekiel says specifically that the rims of the wheels are full of eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the rims are the key to the move of the four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their move is entirely dependent upon the turning of the rims.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The turning rims being full of eyes mean that seeing and moving are altogether related.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not possible for us to move without seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The existence of the four living creatures, as recorded in the Bible, is a fact, and it is crucial that we see what the four living creatures symbolize spiritually and that we receive an impression of the four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The picture of the four living creatures is similar to an impressionistic painting; it illustrates the kind of service that God desires.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we read about these four living creatures, we need to see God s intention.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He desires that those who serve Him have eyes and that their eyes and their move be joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The rims are on the outer part of the wheel and are full of eyes; therefore, when the wheels turn, the eyes also turn.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that a person who serves God must first have eyes and then rims.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In other words, he must be able to see, and then he can move.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the book of Ezekiel the wheels refer specifically to the move of the four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The wheels indicate the swiftness of their move 10:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The greatest characteristic of these four living creatures is that their move is specific, swift, and agile 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The four living creatures go straight forward in four directions; they do not turn as they go vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>12, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Their move is straight and not crooked, yet they move in every direction.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even though they move straight forward, their move is not in only one direction but in four directions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, if they move toward the east, they can still move toward the west, the north, or the south.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even though they do not turn, they are able to move in all four directions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a very particular matter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>NOT ADHERING TO ROUTINES IN THE SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These few points indicate how our service to God should be.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first point is concerning the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A person who serves God cannot live in a foolish, confused, and blind way; instead, he should be bright, alert, and sharp.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Epistles written by the apostle Paul demonstrate that he was bright, alert, and sharp.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was like the four living creatures full of eyes around and within.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As such, he could see the condition of the church in Antioch, the church in Corinth, the church in Ephesus, and the church in Colossae.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was able to see the threat to the church from teachings mixed with Greek philosophy Col 2:8 ; he was also able to see the danger of the believers being distracted from God s economy by the preaching of the Judaizers Gal 1:6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Moreover, he was able to foresee problems related to the errors of some believers individual actions and the things that the leading ones needed to guard against before they actually occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Paul s Epistles we do not see a person who adhered to routines and was inflexible; rather, we see a person who adapted quickly to changing circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For instance, the Epistle to the Colossians is different from the Epistle to the Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The letter he wrote to the church in Ephesus fit their situation, and the letter he wrote to the church in Colossae fit their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He did not adhere to routines.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since the church is the Body of Christ, we cannot take care of it by adhering to routines; otherwise, we will be like a blind person trying to lead others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Paul s letters he spoke to Timothy in one way, to Titus in another way, and to Philemon in yet another way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The books of Romans, Hebrews, and Galatians are not all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These examples indicate that Paul was a person full of eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was clear in matters concerning the saints and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It did not matter whether a situation was corporate or individual.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was full of insight into the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is what it means for the four living creatures to be full of eyes around and within.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In our service we must have eyes, and we must be alert.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must be wise, and we must understand people s actual situations.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to my observation, those of us who serve full time do not have the condition of the four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We may be able to see, but we can see only one aspect or one point.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We cannot see all the aspects and all the points.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are not like the four living creatures, who are full of eyes and can see all sides.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Such seeing is lacking in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although it is good to abide by rules, we should not adhere to routines in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Every serving one should learn to understand the timing and situations related to different matters.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many serving ones still do things step by step, sticking to old routines while being faithful in their service.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This may be good, but it is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need to be full of eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need to know the saints in the place we are serving, and we need to know their condition.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need to have a deep understanding of their actual situation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should not rigidly hold on to the old things and old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>From practical experience, businessmen know that even though they made money yesterday by doing business in a certain way, they may lose money today by continuing in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Farmers have the same experience.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>A farmer may have slept peacefully yesterday, but he may not be able to do so today.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In northern China when the wheat is first ripening, there is no time to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If the farmer delays the harvest by one day, much of the wheat will fall to the ground and be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Opportunity must be grasped.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Some farmers may think that they can wait a few days once the wheat has ripened; however, much wheat will be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In order to seize an opportunity, we need to recognize the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We cannot simply continue to do the same thing every day.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Neither can we do something one way in the springtime and do it the same way in the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is good to follow proper routines, but we must also recognize opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we do something one way this year, we may not do it the same way next year.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we stick to a routine, we may suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Consider what would happen if all the serving ones in the church in Taipei adhered to a routine.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Surely the church s condition would be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The church in Taipei has been established over a long period of time, and all the services have been arranged; hence, the most crucial need is to strengthen the spiritual side.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>First, the church needs the living word.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Second, the church needs to be built in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Third, the individual saints need to be built up spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We cannot take care of these three needs in a routine way, because there is nothing routine in regard to these needs.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We need to see that spiritual supply and spiritual building up are what the saints lack the most.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I have been to several meetings in different districts.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Every meeting I went to gave me a feeling of famine.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The dishes on the dinner table were nothing but leftovers, without many nutrients.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I am afraid that the church is suffering from hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If a person is hungry, he will easily become sick.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Please remember that life always swallows up death.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Whenever life is gone, death will surface, and the most serious death comes from human opinions and human views.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Whenever there is a lack of God s word, God s opinion and God s view will be torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>None of the meetings I attended were able to satisfy people with the word; instead, all the meetings gave people a sense of hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The brothers and sisters who came to those meetings must have felt hungry, because they came to the meeting but were not supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>It is pitiful if we, as full-time serving ones, can sit in that kind of meeting and still be at peace, have no burden, adhere to routines, and think that we have fulfilled our duty.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Such an attitude indicates that we are serving blindly; that is, we cannot see the need, our eyes are not bright, and we do not know how to seize the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Presently we are not lacking in serving ones, but even though we have so many serving ones, the supply is obviously short.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>As full-time serving ones, we have more time, and we have received more perfecting in life and truth than most saints.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If we cannot supply the ministry of the word, how can we expect other brothers and sisters to rise up and function?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We can never shirk the responsibility of ministering the word.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This responsibility is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>However, among all the full-time serving ones in Taipei, not many have received the burden to minister the word to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Most of the serving ones are doing their jobs in a regular way and feel that it is good enough to be faithful to what they do.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>In the eyes of the saints, however, this is absolutely not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>When I sit among the full-time serving ones in a meeting, I often feel sorrowful, not because they have done something offensive but because they have not given the saints food.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Nevertheless, the full-time serving ones sit there and are peaceful meeting after meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Inevitably, a question arises within me concerning whether their inward being is bright and sharp.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If the apostle Paul were to observe such a situation, he would have said something.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>None of us should go to prayer meetings, bread-breaking meetings, and fellowship meetings and watch the time and the meeting go by tastelessly yet inwardly have no feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>This is an indication that we have no eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>If we were full of eyes, we would feel that this situation cannot continue.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We must receive the burden to pray to the Lord and be dealt with by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>If we are in a certain district meeting, we should take responsibility for the meeting in that district.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Nobody else can carry the load.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>If we do not bear it, who will?</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>We need to bring in food and water to give the saints the nutrients that they need.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>This has to do with our inward feeling and our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>We cannot sit around indifferently and be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>After all, we have eyes and can see.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Even though it is painful to be a person with eyes, feelings, and a keen sense, we cannot be without these items in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>We should not be able to tolerate seeing the saints come to the meeting but not receive a supply.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>We cannot say, I have done all that I am supposed to do.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>The elders arranged for me to serve in a certain matter, and I am serving accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>They assigned me a message, and I gave it.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>It is not my business how the saints receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>We cannot have such a transcendent attitude, considering that this is only God s business, not our own.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>We must learn to be sharp and not live a life of ease.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>According to the statistics of the last several weeks, there were approximately sixty saints coming to each of the district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>If over the next few weeks, the numbers begin to gradually drop, this will indicate that the saints are not receiving the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>After four or five meetings many may stop coming altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>We should not be insensitive to such a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>If we are insensitive, we are like a piece of brick or wood without any light.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>We need to sharpen our senses in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>We should not sit in comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>All of us need to pray and to endeavor to deal with the problem of our spiritual famine.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Such a problem is not the business of only a small number of elders or co-workers; it is the business of all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>The most dangerous thing facing the church at the present time is a lack of food.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>The saints are suffering from hunger, from famine.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>They are poor and weak.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>We cannot imagine the kind of problems such a situation will generate.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>This is a serious problem.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>The serving ones cannot be persons without eyes and feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Even if we must set aside our other responsibilities and deal only with the present famine, it is necessary to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>According to my observation of the present famine, we still have sufficient health to protect us, but I am concerned that we may become weak to the extent that all kinds of sicknesses will surface.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>We need to see that the great need in the church is to nourish the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>Whenever the saints come to a meeting, they are coming to a feast in order to eat and receive a supply.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>As serving ones, we should consider what we are offering on the table and whether the food is sufficiently nutritious.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>We need to consider whether or not there is sufficient food and drink in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>We must have feelings in regard to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>We cannot allow the meetings to continue in the present manner.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>We should not think that this is the elders or other people s business.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>We should have the feeling that it is our responsibility if the saints are suffering from hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>The serving ones should prepare food for the saints and supply them with food.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>At present this is the greatest need.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>We need to learn how to supply food and how to seize the opportunity to use our time to prepare the food.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>If we do not know how to seize this opportunity, even if we had more time, we would not be able to meet the need of this famine.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>Our situation now is one of famine.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>In regard to the building up of the saints, the ministry of the word, visitation, and spiritual supply, we are in the midst of a famine.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>We are short in all of these aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>If we look at the statistics of attendance, we will see that our service is questionable.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>This is because there is not an adequate supply for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>We have adhered to routines and affected the saints negatively.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>The church in Taipei has fallen into such a serious famine that we should focus on this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>We need to see that there is a spiritual famine here.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>We should supply the saints with the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>This is a most urgent need.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>It cannot wait and must be done aggressively.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>In every meeting we need to supply the saints with the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>Before a table meeting on the Lord s Day, those responsible for the districts as well as the full-time serving ones must pray to the Lord Jesus, saying, Lord, we cannot let the saints go home hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>If we have the feeling that we cannot let the saints go home hungry, this means that our eyes are sharp, that we are full of eyes around and within.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>We must have feelings regarding the things that we see.</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>If our eyes are sharp, our sharp eyes will control us in our move.</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>We must have a sharp feeling and then move by following the eyes that are upon the rims of the wheels.</S>
