   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ESSENTIAL INWARD ASPECT A. Christ in Us</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Bible verses tell us that Christ is in us Rom 8:10; 2 Cor 13:5; Gal 2:20; Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He can live in us because He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore other verses say that the Spirit is in us John 14:17; Rom 8:11; 1 Cor 6:19; Gal 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Christ was a man on the earth, He could not live inside anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now, however, Christ is the Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is like the air that is around us; He can easily come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the Spirit, the Lord regenerated us; our spirit is now born of the Spirit John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ now dwells in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. Christ as Our Life</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is by the Spirit that we enjoy Christ as our inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is the Spirit that gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In such a Spirit we enjoy Christ by reading His Word John 6:63; 2 Tim 3:16 , calling on His name 1 Cor 12:3 , and praying Jude 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the eating, drinking, and breathing of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This causes Christ to be dispensed into us as the Spirit for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need physical food, water, and air to sustain our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the same way, we need to take in Christ as the Spirit to sustain our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is our living bread, living water, and living air.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the Spirit of life for our essential being and living.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although the Lord has entered into us, we cannot say that our entire being is filled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are still full of our old nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead of expressing the Lord, we express selfishness, pride, rebellion, and many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We greatly need the inward sanctifying and transforming work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is all-inclusive; He contains every item of the process that the Lord went through.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He has the Lord's perfect human living, the killing element of the cross, and the resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we enjoy such a Spirit, our being will begin to change.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ's living will become ours, the negative things in us will be killed, and our life will be a life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>C. The Content of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we enjoy Christ in this way, He becomes our inward content.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is the content of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church is not a social club or just a group of people who meet together; it is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be His Body we must be full of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Suppose someone made a plastic model that looked exactly like your body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Would you call it your body?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Of course not.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order for it to be your body it must be full of your life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As the Body of Christ, we need to be filled with Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>So Christ became the Spirit to dispense Himself as life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE ECONOMICAL OUTWARD ASPECT A. The Baptism of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After His resurrection, Christ appeared to His disciples and instructed them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the baptism of the Holy Spirit Acts 1:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He said, "But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses...unto the remotest part of the earth" Acts 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to His word, the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the Body on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This baptism of the Holy Spirit was not for life essentially but for power and authority economically.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The disciples were already filled with the Spirit for life, but they needed to be "clothed with power from on high" for the work Luke 24:49 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This clothing is the "heavenly uniform" of the economical Spirit.</S>
