<P>According to the Bible, the offerings made by the believers in the meetings should be used for: (1) the local expenses, for example, rent, etc., (2) the relief of the brothers and sisters who are in poverty and want, and (3) the assistance of the workers and the expenses for the work, as commanded by the Bible. Actually, the workers of a locality should be supported by the believers of that locality. The funds of the meetings should be used in such a manner. The individual believer still has a responsibility towards relieving the poor and assisting the workers and the work. It seems embarrassing for me to make this statement. However, this is the truth; I must talk about it. Formerly the funds of the meetings were not used to assist the workers; they were used for the work in other localities, for example, the work in Kiangsu, England, Palestine, etc. This money was distributed to the workers responsible for the work in different localities, who are in fellowship with us. We need to do our best to supply them. The more we receive, the more we give away; the less we receive, the less we give away.</P><P>Now we have two offering boxes, and each box has two partitions. There are two openings on the top of each box. The funds for the church meetings should be put into one opening, and the funds for the work should be put into the other opening. This is necessary because, in the past, some have put funds meant for the work into the box for the meetings. In this way the meetings have taken advantage of the work. Therefore, please remember that if the funds are meant for the meetings, please put them into the opening marked "meetings"; if the funds are meant for the work, put them into the opening marked "work." (These are well-marked on the boxes.) If there is money designated for an individual worker, it should be wrapped up in paper with the name of the worker written on it. Although the boxes are there, the surplus or deficit of the funds for the work is the responsibility of the workers; they are not the responsibility of the brothers and sisters in the meetings.</P><P>According to the Bible, we should not accumulate money. Although this is the case, it does not mean we have to spend all of our monthly income in one month. Nevertheless, it is not good to purposely save money for next month. Therefore, every month we should distribute our funds according to what we have. Since the meetings do not use much, what is left can be used in other areas.</P><P>In the past, the fund for the meetings was managed by two sisters. Several months ago, it was managed by me. However, I do not know how to manage money. Because I am away much of the time, I privately asked Brother Chang to do the bookkeeping for me. Although the fund for the meetings is not too small, it is not that great either and is just enough for our use. From now on, we workers will no longer bear the burden of managing this fund. The brothers who manage the fund will give a monthly financial report to the church. In the past, it was the workers who managed the money. If there was a shortage, the workers made it up. If there was a surplus, we gave it to others. When there was a shortage, we did not feel good about asking you for money. Now that you are managing the fund, whether there is a lack or surplus, it will all be reported to you without reservation. Although only a few brothers are managing the fund, all of you may make suggestions in the prayer meetings as to how the fund should be spent. If you see a brother or a sister in need, you may also mention it in the prayer meetings. From now on, all the matters concerning the church may be discussed in every Thursday's prayer meeting. Thus, our prayer meetings are not merely prayer meetings; they are also meetings to discuss the affairs of the church. I hope the brothers and sisters will pray and understand the will of God in all things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONFERENCE IN OCTOBER</H2><P>Concerning the conference last October, I should have reported to you earlier. However, I took a few days to rest and was delayed until today to inform you of the situation. Thank God, He has already led us through all things! The making of the chairs cost over seven hundred dollars. The expenses for the conference were one thousand five hundred dollars. In total, we spent over two thousand two hundred dollars. Thank God, although we did not ask anyone for a penny directly or indirectly but only asked our Father in heaven, He has supplied all our needs. There were no large individual sums that came in during this conference. The sums were all in the amount of a few dollars to tens of dollars. The largest sum was two hundred thirty-one dollars; the smallest sum was a few dimes. Even so, the Lord has already led us through. We thank God and we also thank you for your help.</P><P>From now on, the workers will not be responsible for the meetings of the church. Two or three sisters and myself will manage the affairs of our little bookroom as well as the testimony God gave to us. The workers will manage the work. The affairs of the church should be managed by the believers. I hope that what I have said will make you understand the difference between the church and the work as well as the similarities between the workers and believers. I hope you are all clear about the teaching of the Bible concerning the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOTICES</H2><P>(1) Last year a book entitled Notes On Scriptural Messages was published.
