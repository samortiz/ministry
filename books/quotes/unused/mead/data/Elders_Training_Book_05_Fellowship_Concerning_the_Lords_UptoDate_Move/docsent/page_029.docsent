   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WANING OF THE MIRACULOUS THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the book of Acts miracles followed the apostles preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Eventually, in the book of Acts, though, there is a strong indication that the miracles were waning.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Acts 2 and 4 the believers had all their possessions in common.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This practice, however, did not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul told us in 2 Corinthians that he was in fastings often 11:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since fastings are listed in this verse with hardships, they must refer to involuntary fasting due to lack of food; hence they differ from hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hunger may refer to a situation where there is no way to obtain food; involuntary fasting may refer to a situation of poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There was a time when Paul lacked food and no one in the churches was sharing with him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul was such a great apostle who established so many churches, yet no church among these churches would have anything in common with him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was forced to make tents for a living Acts 18:3; 20:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To have everything in common according to what was practiced in the book of Acts was altogether over by Paul s time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul even had to exhort the Corinthians to bring their money on the first day of every week to give to the Lord 1 Cor 16:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If they were not reluctant to do this, Paul would not have charged them in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Corinthians did not have all things in common.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul even begged them to share their wealth with the poor saints in Judea 2 Cor 8:8-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The strongest miracle in the New Testament is not healing, but having all things in common.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To heal a sick person is not as great as to make everything common among thousands of people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only the Lord could perform such a miraculous thing among people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This great miracle, this bright moon, only shined for a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It had waned by the time of the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Throughout church history there were a number of times when Christians tried to practice having everything in common.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every time they tried they experienced failure.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The biggest item of the miracles recorded in Acts, having everything in common, took the lead to wane.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Apostle Paul also healed people miraculously.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Acts 19:11 and 12 say, And God did extraordinary works of power through the hands of Paul, so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick, and their diseases left them, and the evil spirits went out.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Despite the extraordinary works of power God performed through Paul, Paul eventually had a thorn in his flesh which God would not remove.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul entreated the Lord three times that this thorn might depart from him, but the Lord responded to Paul by saying that he had to enjoy and experience His sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul also told us that he labored more abundantly than all the apostles, yet he said it was not him but the grace of God 1 Cor 15:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul s experience and labor was of and by the divine grace, which is the Triune God as life to us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Gospel of John tells us that when the Lord came, grace came and that He as the incarnated God was full of grace 1:14, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul s intimate spiritual son, Timothy, was instructed by Paul to take the natural way for healing his stomach sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 2 Timothy 4:20 Paul said, Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul left such an intimate one in sickness without exercising any healing prayer for him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul and his co-workers were under the discipline of the inner life in this time of suffering rather than under the power of the outward gift.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The former is of grace and in life; the latter of gift and power miraculous power.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the decline of the church and in suffering for the church, the gift of power is not as much needed as the grace in life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, Peter was once rescued miraculously from prison by an angel of the Lord Acts 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul also was rescued miraculously from prison at Philippi Acts 16:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eventually, however, both Peter and Paul were imprisoned and martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They were among the many thousands of martyrs put to death by the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why did the Lord not perform any miracles to rescue them?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Most of the healings I saw in the Pentecostal movement were false healings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But I can testify that Brother Nee and I both experienced the healing of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I nearly died of tuberculosis at one time and also had a serious stomach ailment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I was healed of both of these illnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I was ill for nearly two and a half years with tuberculosis on my lungs, learning the lesson of grace and not of miraculous healing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After I recovered from this illness and began to minister the word in 1946, I have been laboring vigorously both day and night with nearly no time for vacation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even today I am still physically strong, not by miraculous healing but by the Lord s merciful healing of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thousands of seekers of Christ can all testify to the same experience I had.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They did not have a miraculous healing, but they enjoyed a kind of healing through the lessons of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is what George M ller called the healing by grace, not the healing by gift.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Any group throughout church history that practiced the gift of healing extensively, has been eventually exposed for pretense and falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One brother among us, who was once a missionary to Indonesia, participated in a Pentecostal revival there.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some of the believers asked the Lord to change water into wine for their Lord s table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One of their leaders performed a certain ritual to change the water into wine.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>During this ritual, the brother who now meets with us saw this Pentecostal leader about to add something to the water to change it into wine.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When this leader realized he was being watched, he stopped what he was doing and waited until a later time to change the water into wine.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What a falsehood!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What the Lord is doing in this dispensation of grace is the work in our spirit for the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A number of good saints who were very much used by the Lord died in sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They were never healed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many Christians who were all seeking, spiritual, and mature, eventually had a certain kind of disease that ended their life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They never were healed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Brother Nee was healed of tuberculosis on the lungs, and this was a real healing of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Meanwhile, he also had heart disease and this was never healed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For over forty years he suffered the effects of this disease and eventually he died of it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the dispensation of grace the Lord s work is for the new creation not for the old creation.</S>
