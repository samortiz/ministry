   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING FOR THE ENLARGEMENT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If the Lord Jesus is God s house, how can He go to prepare a place for us?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His going to prepare a place is the enlargement of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Corinthians 6:19 says that our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Peter 2:5 says that we are being built up as a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ephesians 2:21-22 says that we are growing into a holy temple in the Lord, into a dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Timothy 3:15 says that the church of the living God is the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>House and temple in these verses refer to the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The house is the temple, and the temple is the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The dwelling place of God is a mystery in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s dwelling place is a matter of a person, not a matter of a place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God s dwelling place is the church, which is composed of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The believers are the enlargement of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we grasp this thought, we will understand what God is doing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God dwells in the church, and the church is the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the church has the element of man and the element of God with the element of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is in the church, and heaven is also in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although the church is on the earth today, it is heavenly, because heaven is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, the church is the mingling of God and man, and it is the joining of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This dwelling place of God is different from His dwelling place in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God s dwelling place in heaven is merely heaven; it does not have the element of man and is not joined to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the church, obtained by God as His dwelling place, is a mystery, because God has entered into man and mingled Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When God comes, heaven comes, and because man is here, the earth is also here.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the mingling of God and man, and it is the joining of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although such an entity is not of the earth, it is on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although it is on the earth, it is of heaven and has the element of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Such a dwelling place, the mingling of God and man and the joining of heaven and earth, is the eternal dwelling place which God is building.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the place the Lord said that He would go to prepare; this place includes the church and heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In John 14:11-12 the Lord said, Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; but if not, believe because of the works themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Truly, truly, I say to you, He who believes into Me, the works which I do he shall do also; and greater than these he shall do because I am going to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In these verses the Lord was saying that He would enter into the Father, and He would also bring those who believed into Him into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here there is a person as well as a place.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Heaven can be expressed on earth because it is in God and is expressed through the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The element of heaven can be expressed on earth through the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The New Jerusalem, like the church, possesses the mingling of God and man, and heaven is also mingled with it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church is composed of the believers who are mingled with God and the condition, the element, of heaven that is also in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this way both God and heaven are expressed on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even though this is a miniature, we cannot fully apprehend it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the coming new heaven and new earth, the time of maturity and fullness, God will be fully mingled with man, and man will fully enter into God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God will take man as His dwelling place, and man will take God as his abode; thus, the elements of God and heaven will be brought into man and expressed on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is what the Lord Jesus meant when He said that He was going to prepare a place for us.</S>
