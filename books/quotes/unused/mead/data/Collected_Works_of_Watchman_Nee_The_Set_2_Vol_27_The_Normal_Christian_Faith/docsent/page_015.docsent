   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HE IS IN GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to read on.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 10:37-38 Jesus said, "If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me; but if I do them, even if you do not believe Me, believe the works so that you may come to know and continue to know..."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Know what?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The clause following is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is a big statement: "..that the Father is in Me and I am in the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Who then is this man?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He said that He was in God and God was in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Passages like the above are numerous in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I shall mention one more.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Read carefully John 14:6-7: "Jesus said to him, I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him." It says clearly that if you know Jesus of Nazareth, you have known the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why is this so?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is because He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>NO NEED TO ASK TO SEE THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One of the disciples was confused.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John 14:8 says, "Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Philip was asking to be shown the Father who had been mentioned again and again by Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 9 says, "Jesus said to him, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here Jesus made it very plain that to see Him is to see God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He made no apology about it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no need to see the Father anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you see Him, you see God!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Who is Jesus of Nazareth?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Is He merely the founder of the Christian religion?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Is He merely an example of self-sacrifice and humanitarianism?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Is He a social reformer?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Is He an advocate for universal love, peace, and freedom?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Listen to what He said about Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He said that He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is your conclusion?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Is He a lunatic or a liar?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Is He a hoax, or is He God?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a vital question.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Can He be a madman?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you read His biographies in the Gospels and observe His life and manner, you will realize that not only was He sane and sound, He was very sober and firm.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If there is a perfectly sound person in this world, He has to be the One.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His mind was clear, and His mentality was alert.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you study His deeds and words carefully, you have to confess that His thoughts are very logical and consistent, and His manners are most comely and appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To opposing ones He only needed to reply a few sentences, and their arguments against Him were defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He did not have a trace of madness in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A madman could never have done what He did.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then is He a liar?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A liar always lies for a profit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If there is no profit to be gained, what is the purpose of lying?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Why was Jesus crucified?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For no other reason than that He claimed to be God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the last judgment, the hour when His release or crucifixion was to be deliberated, He was examined as to who He was.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What was His answer?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He said that the Son of Man would be seen sitting on the right hand of the Majesty on high, descending on the clouds in glory Matt 26:64 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even then He claimed to be God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As a result, He was crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Is there a liar who would sacrifice his life for his lie?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>HIS WORD BEING TRUE</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once I met a person who wanted to talk with me about our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He read some books about Jesus and admitted that Jesus had a high standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He could consider Jesus as a perfect man, a model for humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But he could not believe that Jesus is God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I said, "If you admit that He has a high standard of morality, then He at least is not a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you agree that He is not a liar, then you have to accept His claim of divinity as truth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He repeatedly asserted that He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you admire His morality, you have to recognize His divinity as well.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Jesus of Nazareth is God!"</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>THE WORD BECAME FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Please read John 1:1: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Verse 14 says, "And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father , full of grace and reality."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What is the "Word" mentioned in verses 1 and 14?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Verse 1 speaks of the relationship the Word has with God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In reference to when, the Word was there from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In reference to where, the Word was with God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In reference to what, the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Today the Word has become flesh; He has taken on a human body and dwelt among men.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As to how He dwells, it says that He is "full of grace and reality," and "we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Who is this One?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He is Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Here we have only seen one of the five qualifications mentioned earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Only Jesus of Nazareth meets this first condition.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This proves that He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We shall go on to see the four other conditions or qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Jesus of Nazareth must meet all the other four qualifications before we can conclude that He is God.</S>
