   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Having Long-suffering by Being Restricted</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in Our Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 4:2 also speaks of long-suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to my experience, long-suffering is related to our spoken word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the church we must be careful concerning our speech and conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To keep from speaking something according to our particular desire is a real suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we can bear this suffering, we can bear any suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A brother may wrong us, but for the Lord s glory and for the sake of the church life, we should not speak a word about it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the exercise of long-suffering mentioned in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we have not learned this lesson, then whenever something happens to us, we will talk about it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a brother wrongs us, we will tell our spouse immediately, and then we will use the telephone to tell the story to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since we are not able to bear our suffering, telling people about it puts us at ease.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To utter, express, and talk about everything that happens to us requires no long-suffering or patience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we see the leading brothers quarreling, we may immediately go to relate this to another brother.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To do this may make us feel very light and at ease, and the more we talk in this way, the more we enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, if we have learned the lesson, for the Lord s glory and for the sake of His church we will not say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead, we will go to the Lord with tears.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If our dear wife comes in and asks why we are weeping, we will simply say, It is nothing to concern you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Praise the Lord, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To say, It is nothing is not a lie, because in fact it is nothing to concern her.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no need to say something to others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, we should have long-suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we learn to keep our words in such a proper way, we will realize the true meaning of the word suffering in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the contrary, though, we often do not suffer because we prefer to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We like to talk about whatever we see and whatever happens.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no burden or yoke to bear in this improper practice.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Immediately after a message is given, we may begin to criticize the speaker, saying, That was a poor message.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His language was broken, his accent was not right, his utterance was not very impressive, and I disagree with his emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The more someone talks in this way, the more comfortable he may feel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Again, if we have learned the lesson, we will say nothing negative about the ministry, despite what we feel about it, for the sake of the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our mouths will be under the control of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If when we return home, our children ask what the speaker said, we will be careful with our words.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we practice this, we will suffer in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our speech and conversation damage the church more than anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some like to speak in person, and others like to write letters.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It seems that there is no need to pay Western Union for a telegram.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If something happens to the ministry here, within a few days many churches overseas will already know about it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have many correspondents and mailmen who work without pay to deliver the news.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If something happens on the Lord s Day, the next morning a church mailman will come to tell you about it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is not a rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, it is my observation for more than thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Word after word is passed on by telephone calls, letters, and personal contact.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This builds up nothing but instead damages the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we consider our past, we will realize how much we have been involved in this practice of passing on stories, unconsciously creating rumors.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once a story is second hand, it begins to change, and eventually it can become a great exaggeration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is always the case with rumors.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order to learn the lesson of long-suffering, we need to experience the suffering of restricting our mouth and stopping our tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may see and hear many things, but we should not speak a word without the anointing and leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must not let the enemy use our tongue for his purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Regardless of what happens to us, even if a brother wrongs us, we should not say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we have learned the lesson of long-suffering, we will not enjoy our improper speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead, we will suffer by saying nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the proper meaning of long-suffering in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have been practicing the church life in Los Angeles already for three years.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we consider the past, though, we will see how much damage comes from speaking too freely.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Through our carelessness in speaking we have caused much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have caused others to suffer, and we ourselves also have suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Eventually, I made the decision to have long-suffering instead of another kind of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Either way we will have suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we do not suffer through long-suffering, we will suffer in a negative way by our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is better to choose long-suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then we will be saved from the wrong kind of suffering, and the church life will be kept from damage.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No one taught us this lesson in the way of Bible teaching, but by the Lord s mercy we have learned this from our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Bearing One Another in Love</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>to Avoid All Fear and Suspicion</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verse 2 ends with bearing one another in love.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In order to bear one another in love, we need to fight against suspicion and fear in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Instead of these two things, we should have only love.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To have suspicion towards a brother means that our love is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then after suspicion, fear will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If two brothers are suspicious of each other, they will be like spies to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This will produce a mutual fear between them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In order to realize the practical church life, we all must rise up to fight the battle against suspicion.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If there is no suspicion, there will be no fear of one another.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must give no ground to suspicion and fear.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We love our brothers; we do not fear them.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>First John 4:18 says, There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We are not in a political circle, where even the leaders are suspicious of one another.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We should never be suspicious of one another, and we should not try to spy on one another.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If certain brothers say something about us, let them do it.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We should not try to find out what they are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We should not go to a brother and say, Please tell me what they were talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we do this, we are acting as politicians, not brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Rather, we should leave this matter to the sovereign hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We can tell Him, Lord, if it is Your will that I should know, and if it is for Your glory and the good of the church life, You will let me know through some channel.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>There is no need for us to ask what someone said.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Because we have no suspicion of the brothers, we have no fear of them either.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Therefore, there is no need to spy.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Sometimes when certain brothers have come to tell me something, I realize what they are doing, so I say, Brothers, please say no more.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Do not go on.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is always a temptation to know others attitude toward us, how they consider us, and what they have said about us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In order to realize the church life, we must reject this temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We must have no suspicion.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We believe in the Lord and consider that all the brothers are good.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Therefore, there is no need to know too much.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Regardless of how others consider us and talk about us, we are in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If we practice in this way, the door will be closed to the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If, on the contrary, someone is suspicious, this will cause a reaction, and this reaction will cause a chain reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Then in the church we will have not love but only suspicion and fear.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We will have a church full of policemen.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We will become not a police state but a police church.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>On many occasions we have suffered much because of this.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>A brother might report, I saw three brothers talking in their house until midnight, or he may inquire, Why didn t we see that brother in the Lord s table meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This kind of speaking is the underground work of a spy.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This damages the church.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>It does not build up; instead, it kills and tears down.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If we truly intend to have the church life, we must learn the lesson to be careful in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Keeping the Oneness of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>in the Uniting Bond of Peace</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Ephesians 4:3 says, Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If we have peace only with God and not with all the brothers, we have lost the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The church life is tested by the peace we have, not only vertically with God but also horizontally with all the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We need this kind of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We should not be over- related or under-related to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The uniting bond of peace is the balanced relatedness in the church.</S>
