   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we thank You that You are training us.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We confess that we are still in the natural life which we received through birth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our concepts and our understanding of the Bible are very natural.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lord, deliver us from being natural.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You have regenerated us so that we would no longer be natural, but we remain in our natural life, and we are natural even in seeking You.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, we need You to speak a new word to us once again.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, have mercy upon us and be our High Priest, the One who is easily touched by the feeling of our infirmities.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, speak a word according to Your high priesthood and shepherd us and take care of us, especially of the co-workers who have been speaking for years in a natural way without any real understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, be merciful to us and bless us under Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Lord's recovery we need to learn how to know the Bible in its intrinsic significance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we know the Bible in this way, we will have a proper theology.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The theology of today's Christianity is wrong or inadequate in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have been raised up, taught, and trained under the influence of this theology, and we are still under its influence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Either consciously or subconsciously, the influence of the theology of Christianity remains in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to uproot this influence and not follow the way of the old theology in presenting messages.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the previous message we saw that the issue of Christ's being glorified is an incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before we begin to consider the three aspects of this incorporation, I would like to say a further word about the universal incorporation as the issue of Christ's glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have spent more than seventy years studying the Bible, but only very recently did I see that the Bible actually unveils just one thing the universal incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The purposeful God has an economy, and in His economy He intends to have a universal incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Deep within Himself, God has the purpose to produce a universal incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, for eternity in the new heaven and new earth, there will be the New Jerusalem, the unique goal of God in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although we have seen that the New Jerusalem is the goal of God's economy, we did not see that the New Jerusalem is an incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Revelation 21:2 the apostle John says, "I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem," and in the next verse he speaks of the New Jerusalem as "the tabernacle of God."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the tabernacle of God the New Jerusalem is God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are quite familiar with this aspect of the New Jerusalem; it has become old knowledge to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now we need to learn something new and see that as the tabernacle of God the New Jerusalem is the universal incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At this juncture we need to consider the Lord's word to the church in Pergamos 2:12-17 , the third of the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Pergamos in Greek means "marriage," implying union.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a sign, the church in Pergamos prefigures the church that entered into a marriage union with the world to be one with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As part of His promise to the overcomer in Pergamos, the Lord Jesus said, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna" v. 17 . The hidden manna refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Manna is a type of Christ as the heavenly food that enables God's people to go His way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A portion of manna was preserved in a golden pot concealed in the ark Exo 16:32-34; Heb 9:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This hidden manna, signifying the hidden Christ, is a special portion reserved for His overcoming believers, who overcome the degradation of the worldly church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>While the church goes the way of the world, these overcomers come forward to abide in the Holy of Holies, where they enjoy the hidden Christ as a special portion for their daily supply.</S>
