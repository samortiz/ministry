<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">PRIVATE TALKS</h1><h1 class="title">(3)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: 1934<br />Place: Foochow</h1><h2 class="head1">ON THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h2><h2 class="head2">The Ground of Locality of a Church</h2><p>There are many advantages in having the city as the unit of the church. Although not all the cities in the Bible have walls, cities historically experience the least amount of changes. There should be only one church in the city of Foochow, yet it can have seven or eight meeting places. All seven or eight places are under the same administration of the one church, and there is only one set of elders and deacons for this one church. A city, a town, or a village is the sphere of administration of a church. When speaking of the province of Galatia, the Bible refers to the churches in Galatia (1 Cor. 16:1). But in regard to Corinth, Ephesus, Thessalonica, and the seven cities in Revelation, the Bible speaks of the church in each locality; the names of the churches are derived from the names of the cities. In England there are two cities which are very close together; they have two churches. In the United States, New York City is composed of three former cities which were combined to form one greater New York City. Before they were combined, there were three churches, but after they were combined, there should only be one church.</p><p>The local church is the highest administration on earth; it is directly responsible to God. If a problem occurs in a locality, the church can only try to deal with it by itself; there is no higher place of appeal. Other churches can only give their advice. For example, Paul could not interfere with the fornicator spoken of in 1 Corinthians 5. He could only deliver the sinning one in his spirit to Satan. Acts 15 gives us another example. At that time, some people went from Jerusalem to Antioch and taught that believers should be circumcised and keep the laws of Moses. Paul went up to Jerusalem to settle this dispute, but this does not mean that Jerusalem was the center. It merely means that the matter originated from Jerusalem. (August 1)</p><p>God ordains that the church should take the locality as its unit. No unit that is greater than a locality or smaller than a locality can form the basis of a church. The table meeting at Pai-Ya-Tan (White Teeth Lake) has the following extra-local characteristics: (1) It can hire pastors, (2) it pays salary, (3) it can dismiss workers, and (4) all decisions are made by itself. (July 31)</p><h2 class="head2">The Oneness of the Church (July 31)</h2><p>The principle of the oneness of the church lies first in considering others better than oneself, and second in keeping all the good things of the Adamic old man from creeping into the church.</p><p>The Bible never commands us to like people; it only commands us to love others. Likes and dislikes are things in the Adamic realm. We cannot base our choice on our own disposition, and we cannot associate ourselves only with those who have our same disposition. We can see the work of Christ in every believer's character. For example, Americans are different from Englishmen (e.g., consider Dr. Stearns and his wife). It would be a disaster if we did things in the church according to our own disposition.</p><p>Elders and deacons are restricted to a locality, whereas truth is a matter for all the churches; therefore, it must be ascertained by the teachers. All those who are led by the Holy Spirit will surely have the same revelation. If any one individual does not accept a truth, he alone has to bear the responsibility for his refusal. After a teacher has ascertained a truth, all the churches should follow and submit to this truth.</p>
