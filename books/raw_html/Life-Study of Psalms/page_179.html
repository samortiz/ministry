<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Unable to Redeem Their Brothers</H2><P>Those who trust in their wealth are unable to redeem their brothers, needless to say themselves (vv. 6-9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Appointed to Die and Perish</H2><P>The ones who trust in their wealth are appointed to die and perish (vv. 10-14). They will leave their wealth to others (vv. 16-20). The psalmist, on the contrary, has the assurance that God will redeem his soul from the power of Sheol, for God will receive him (v. 15).</P><P>Those who trust in their wealth are not only foolish and senseless (v. 10) but are also likened to animals, even to beasts. Verse 12 says, "But man in honor does not remain; /He is like the beasts that perish." Verse 20, the last verse of the psalm, concludes, "A man in honor but without understanding/Is like the beasts that perish." Like the beasts, the foolish ones who trust in their wealth are appointed to die and to perish.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Not Trusting in Christ<br>for Their Redemption</H2><P>Those who trust in their wealth do not trust in Christ for their redemption. The worst thing a person can do is not to trust in Christ. To trust in Christ simply means to believe in Him. It is most foolish not to believe in Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Having No Share<br>in the Enjoyment of God<br>in His House and in His City</H2><P>Finally, the ones who trust in their wealth have no share in the enjoyment of God in His house and in His city. Because they are outside of Christ, they are excluded from the enjoyment of God in His house, the church, and in His city, the kingdom.</P>
