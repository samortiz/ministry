   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. The Result</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since the anointing is vital to God's presence, we need to obey the teaching so we can experience more of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then we can live at all times and in all places in the presence of God, living in the light of His face and touching His presence moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At this time we can enter into the reality of the hymn which says:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have passed the riven veil, Here the glories never fail; We are living in the presence of the King!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When man passes through the veil of the flesh and lives in the presence of God, he enters into the Holy of Holies and lives in the spirit, having fellowship face to face with God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is at this time that our spiritual experience reaches its peak.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In conclusion, the key to all our spiritual life is the anointing.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, the teaching of the anointing is truly the center of all spiritual experience and is also a very wonderful part of God's salvation.</S>
