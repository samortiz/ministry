   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION FOUR THE CALL OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AFTER RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>5:2 6:13 I. THE CROSS AFTER RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND THE MAIDEN'S FAILURE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>5:2 6:3 A. The Calling 5:2</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Song of Songs 5:2 says, "I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By this time, her own work and life have ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She is like one who is asleep; there is no further activity, work, endeavoring, struggle, effort, or anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She is perfectly at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The cross has not only dealt with all her sins, but has dealt with all her flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sin is no longer active, and the self is no longer active.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The whole outward man has been brought to a state of cessation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even when she does something, she does not feel that she is doing it herself; she feels that she is a bystander.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Indeed, she is asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But this does not mean that she is completely motionless, thoughtless, void of belief and activity, and void of work and living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The resurrection life of the Lord is in her, and the resurrected Lord Himself is dwelling and living within her through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although the outward man is silent, the inward man is active.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here we see a complete separation between the outward man and the inward man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Outwardly we can be asleep, but inwardly we are awake and are not sleepy at all.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This matches Paul's word, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the expression of perfect fellowship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A person who is perfectly one with the Lord is very quick, alert, and full of feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He can feel even the slightest voice or movement of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The inner man never sleeps.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever the Lord speaks, the maiden immediately hears, and she immediately identifies the voice of her beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What does the Lord do now?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He "knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this book, the Lord first revealed Himself as the King because He is after the throne in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then He was a caller, leading the maiden out of the inner walls into the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Finally, He reveals Himself as the Bridegroom, having a perfect love relationship with the maiden.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now a completely different revelation is unveiled: "My head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What kind of picture is this?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is clearly His experience at Gethsemane.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There His head was indeed filled with dew!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That night His head was filled with the drops of the night Luke 22:44 !</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here He reveals Himself as a son of sorrows.</S>
