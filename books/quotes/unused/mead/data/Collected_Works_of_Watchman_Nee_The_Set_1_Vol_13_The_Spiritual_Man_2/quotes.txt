[2]  THE EMOTION The Believer and the Emotion Chapter One Love Chapter Two Desires Chapter Three A Life of Feeling Chapter Four A Life of Faith Chapter Five
[3]  The knowledge most lacking among believers today concerns the existence of the human spirit and its function.
[4]  Many believers do not know they have a spirit in addition to their mind, emotion, and will.
[5]  Even after hearing that there is a spirit within man, they either think that their mind, emotion, or will is the spirit, or they are puzzled and do not know where their spirit is.
[6]  Because of this, believers do not know how to cooperate with God, control themselves, and fight against Satan, since all these three things require the work of the spirit.
[7]  At the time of man's regeneration, his spirit receives God's life and becomes enlivened.
[8]  It is the Holy Spirit who actively accomplishes this work.
[9]  Unfortunately, just as a believer does not understand that the spirit which he has received is new, he also does not understand that when he receives a new spirit, he also receives the Holy Spirit who dwells within him.
[10]  Even if a believer is so foolish that his experience never goes one step beyond the first half of God's promise, and he is not aware that the Holy Spirit of God is a person dwelling in him, it is an unchangeable fact that God has given him the Holy Spirit.
[11]  If he is willing to receive God's promise with faith, considering that God has not only given him a new life in regeneration but also the Holy Spirit, as a person, dwelling in his spirit to be his Lord, then his life will make great strides in the path of God.
[12]  Since we have seen that the Holy Spirit indwells the believers at the time of their regeneration, we should see in more detail where the Holy Spirit dwells so that we can understand His work within us.
[13]  We must remember that the real meaning of regeneration is not an outward change or the soul and the body being stimulated, but it is the spirit receiving life.
[14]  But the most important point is that when we receive a new spirit, we also receive the Holy Spirit of God to dwell within us.
[15]  If a believer does not know that the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit is in the deepest part of his whole being, which is deeper than his mind, emotion, and will, he will surely seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit in his mind, emotion, and will.
[16]  In the Chinese Union Version of the Bible, it is difficult for us to tell when the word spirit refers to the Holy Spirit and when it refers to the human spirit.
[17]  Why does God not say Holy Spirit but rather spirit in many places?
[18]  The capitalized word Spirit indicates the Holy Spirit and spirit indicates that it is not the Holy Spirit but a spirit besides the Holy Spirit, such as the spirit of man, etc. After reading this, do we not understand? In the original text there is no indication that it refers to the Holy Spirit or human spirit whenever just the word Spirit is used.
[19]  A regenerated believer, with his spirit enlivened and the Holy Spirit indwelling him, can still remain a carnal or fleshly believer, with his spirit still oppressed by his soul or body.
[20]  There is a specific path that a regenerated believer should specifically take in order to succeed in becoming spiritual.
[21]  Briefly, there can be at least two great changes in the life of a human being changing from a perishing sinner into a saved believer and changing from a fleshly believer into a spiritual one.
[22]  God can cause a sinner to become a believer and have His life; God can also cause a fleshly believer to become a spiritual believer and have His life more abundantly.
[23]  Once a man believes in Christ, he becomes a regenerated believer; once he obeys the Holy Spirit, he becomes a spiritual believer.
[24]  The resurrected Lord is the life-giving Spirit 15:45 ; therefore, His union with the believers is His union with the believers' spirit.
[25]  The soul is only the personality of a man and is natural; it should only be used as a vessel to express the results of the union between the Lord and the spirit of the believer.
[26]  The Holy Spirit is inside a believer; but the believer either does not know it or he fails to obey Him.
[27]  Therefore, he must know the Holy Spirit who indwells him and completely obey Him.
[28]  The believer must know that God's Holy Spirit, being a person, indwells him to teach, guide, and give the "reality," the truth, in Christ to the believer.
[29]  This work of the Holy Spirit can be done only after the believer acknowledges how ignorant and dull his soul is, and he decides that, even though he is foolish, he is willing to be taught.
[30]  When we know that within us there is a spirit, God's Holiest of all, which is deeper than mind and emotion and is able to fellowship with the Holy Spirit and when we wait for God's Holy Spirit, then we know that He truly indwells us.
[31]  When we consider how the Holy Spirit is God, how He is one of the Triune God, how He is the life of the Father and the Son, and then further consider His honor and how He indwells us, who are fleshly, we will surely fear, honor, and praise Him.
[32]  We have already seen how a soulish believer becomes a spiritual believer.
[33]  This does not mean, however, that he will no longer walk according to the flesh.
[34]  Verses 4 through 6 say, "That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit"; "those who are according to the spirit, mind the things of the Spirit"; "the mind set on the spirit is life and peace."
[35]  If he wants God to guide him in his spirit, he must wait for God in his spirit and not arbitrarily take his own feelings and thoughts as his guide.
[36]  As a believer gradually progresses on his spiritual path, he will gradually see more clearly that living for himself is a sin, even the greatest sin.
[37]  A believer who lives for himself is like a grain of wheat which is not willing to fall into the ground and die; therefore, he remains just one grain.
[38]  A believer may seek the filling of the Holy Spirit and want to become a spiritual man with power.
[39]  A believer may not want the flesh to die, but may instead want to receive the Holy Spirit to adorn it and provide more power to work for God of course, this is absolutely impossible .
[40]  It is not a small matter to initiate anything.
[41]  A believer should not rashly do something just because it is good, needful, and profitable to others.
[42]  The goal of spiritual work is nothing other than the spirit of man receiving life and building up the spirit which has life.
[43]  If the aim of our work does not pay attention to the spirit in the deepest part of man, then our work will not have any spiritual value and result.
[44]  When we no longer want others to understand in their mind, when we no longer want them to be moved in their emotion, and when we no longer want them to decide in their will, and instead only want their spirit to receive life, we will see that we absolutely cannot give life to others unless the Holy Spirit uses us.
[45]  Spiritual work often flows with the current of the Holy Spirit without any constraint and without the need for the strength of the flesh.
[46]  This is not to say that there is no opposition from the world or attack by the enemy; rather, it means that in the Lord there is always the sense of having the Lord's anointing.
[47]  When a believer's work is needed by God, he will feel the flow of the Holy Spirit no matter what kind of difficulty.
[48]  Whenever a believer feels this way, he must search to see whether this kind of "mechanical work" is still needed by the Holy Spirit or if it has accomplished His purpose so that now God is calling His own vessels to go on.
[49]  Therefore, at the present time the servants of God must get rid of all the work which God has not given, the work which he should have left long ago, the monopolizing work, the work which does not come from the Holy Spirit, the work which suppresses the spirit, the work which causes the believer to depart from the spirit, and the work which may be good, but which keeps the believer from being more noble.
[50]  A prayer that is not spiritual is not a prayer and will not see a result.
[51]  Generally speaking, before a believer has experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit, he is like the servant of Elisha, who was very unclear about the realities in the spiritual realm 2 Kings 6:15-17 .
[52]  Although he may have received the teachings of the Bible and some instructions, he only understands them according to his mind and has no revelation in his spirit.
[53]  The intuition in his spirit becomes quite keen only after he has experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[54]  When a believer passes through the baptism of the Holy Spirit, he comes in contact with God's supernatural power and touches a personal God.
[55]  After a believer has experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit and comes in contact with a personal God, after his spirit is released and freed, and he realizes the reality of matters in the spiritual realm, he will engage Satan in warfare if he has the knowledge.
[56]  This kind of warfare is a warfare of spirits; spiritual strength is required for such warfare.
[57]  A believer must understand how he can wrestle with the enemy by his spirit.
[58]  Without the spirit working for him, he does not know how the enemy attacks and how God wants him to fight.
[59]  If he walks according to the spirit, he will learn to work by praying unceasingly in his spirit and opposing the enemy in this way.
[60]  In the life of a believer, each level has its own danger.
[61]  While the saints live in the realm of the body, it wars against sins; while they live in the realm of the soul, it wars against the natural life; finally, while they live in the realm of the spirit, it wars against the principalities and powers.
[62]  When a believer becomes spiritual, evil spirits launch an assault against his spirit.
[63]  Because the enemy pays great attention to our spirit, it is necessary for spiritual believers to keep their own spirit in a proper state and constantly exercise their spirit.
[64]  Due to misinterpretation, believers assume that they should not do anything --that their mind should be "blank," letting the Holy Spirit think for them; that their emotion should not be allowed to have any affection, letting the Holy Spirit put His own affections in their heart; and that their will should not make any decision, letting the Holy Spirit decide for them.
[65]  Because believers misinterpret the nullifying of the flesh, they put their spirit into a passive state.
[66]  This allows an evil spirit to pretend to be the Holy Spirit.
[67]  In their ignorance believers think that any moving must come from the Holy Spirit, and they receive it unwittingly, forgetting that not only the Holy Spirit but also evil spirits can affect their spirit.
[68]  It occurs because believers do not realize that once they have this kind of experience, they enter into a closer connection with the spiritual world either God's or the devil's and give the Holy Spirit or an evil spirit the possibility of influencing them.
[69]  Many believers want to experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit, but they do not know that the Holy Spirit needs the cooperation of their spirit, that their personality is not nullified, and that they still maintain their free will.
[70]  Once believers have entered into the spiritual realm, if they do not have a daily attitude of resisting the enemy in the spirit, assaulting Satan with prayers in the spirit, and asking God to destroy all the works of Satan done through the evil spirits, they will soon see their own spirit fall from the heavens and become weak and powerless.
[71]  THE INTUITION, THE FELLOWSHIP, AND THE CONSCIENCE CHAPTER ONE THE INTUITION
[72]  If we want to understand more clearly about spiritual life, we have to analyze the spirit thoroughly and understand all of its laws.
[73]  Only after we have understood every function of the spirit can we comprehend the laws by which the spirit operates.
[74]  Once we know the laws of the spirit, we will learn how to follow the spirit, that is, to walk by the laws of the spirit.
[75]  The spirit dwells in the body and has a very close relationship with the body; nevertheless, it is completely different from the body.
[76]  "And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know....The anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him" 1 John 2:20, 27 .
[77]  This anointing also teaches us to deal with people.
[78]  We should not criticize a person, but we should definitely know him in order to learn how to associate with him or help him.
[79]  Not only should believers receive their initial knowledge through the spirit, they should continue in this way all the time.
[80]  In the Christian life, other than the revelation one receives in his intuition, nothing else has any spiritual significance because none of the other things are of the spirit.
[81]  Since they are not of the spirit, they are not the will of God; God only reveals the things concerning His will to us in our spirit.
[82]  When a believer's spirit is renewed, strengthened, and educated by the Holy Spirit, his soul loses its place and submits to the spirit.
[83]  Gradually, the soul becomes a servant to the spirit, and the body is conquered to become the soul's servant for the execution of the spirit's will.
[84]  Just as man has fellowship with the physical world through his body, he has fellowship with the spiritual world through his spirit.
[85]  This fellowship with the spiritual realm is not through the mind or emotion but through the spirit.
[86]  For a man to worship God and have fellowship with Him, he must have a substance that is similar to God's. "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit" John 4:24 . There cannot be fellowship between two different substances.
[87]  Here we see how highly God esteems the regenerated spirit of man.
[88]  If a man is not regenerated, his spirit is still dead; thus, God has no way to reveal to him the things pertaining to God.
[89]  Although he may be very intelligent, he still cannot comprehend the things of God.
[90]  Without a regenerated spirit, there will always be a separation between God and man; He cannot come to our side, neither can we go to His side, because man's intuition, apart from his mind, emotion, and will is still dead and unable to know the intention of the Holy Spirit.
[91]  A believer must know that only the Holy Spirit knows the things of God, and that He knows the things of God through the intuition, not through the mind.
[92]  Verse 14 says, "But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him and he is not able to know them because they are discerned spiritually."
[93]  Soulish men are those who have not been regenerated and who do not have a new spirit.
[94]  They can reason, judge logically, and express what they like, but they cannot "receive the things of the Spirit of God" because they do not have a regenerated spirit.
[95]  First Corinthians 3:1-2 says, "And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ.
[96]  These two verses are a response to the question, "If the spirit of man knows all the things of man, and if a spiritual man discerns all things, why are there so many Christians who are regenerated in their spirit yet do not feel that they have a spirit and are unable to know the many deep things of God through their spirit?"
[97]  Fleshly believers are those who remain as babies for a long time and do not grow.
[98]  This does not mean that they do not have the outward suppression of sin or an increase in biblical knowledge during that time.
[99]  It does not mean that they do not strive to work for the Lord or have not received the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[100]  If we misunderstand and do not pursue the growth of the spiritual life and the intuition, which enable us to know God, the matters of God, and have fellowship with Him, but instead we pursue the increase of riches in the soul, we will not have any progress at all in God's view.
[101]  "That...the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him" Eph 1:17 .
[102]  At the time of our regeneration we received a new spirit; however, many of the functions of the spirit are not manifested and remain concealed inside the spirit.
[103]  Therefore, the apostle prayed that the regenerated Ephesian believers would receive a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that they could really know God in their intuition.
[104]  Whether this spirit of wisdom and revelation is a hidden potential within the believers' spirit, which is enlightened by God through prayer, or whether it is some fresh wisdom and revelation, which comes from the Holy Spirit being added into the believers' spirit, the fact remains that a spirit of wisdom and revelation is indispensable in a believer's fellowship with God.
[105]  There is soulish wisdom, and there is spiritual wisdom.
[106]  Soulish wisdom comes from man's mind, but spiritual wisdom is given by God to us in our spirit.
[107]  Besides the intuition and fellowship, our spirit has another important function which is to correct our wrong doings and reprove us so that we will not have peace when we come short of the glory of God.
[108]  If we wish to walk according to the spirit, we cannot ignore what the conscience speaks to us because it is impossible not to make mistakes or incline toward making mistakes, no matter at what stage we are.
[109]  The following verse shows us the relationship between the conscience and man's fellowship with God in the intuition.
[110]  "How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
[111]  If man wants to fellowship with God and "serve God," his conscience must first be cleansed by the precious blood.
[112]  When we come forward to God, we do not use our bodies like those in the Old Testament, because our Holy of Holies v. 19 is in the heavens; neither do we use our thoughts and feelings because these parts of the soul cannot have fellowship with God.
[113]  If we have not done the thing yet, we should stop; if we have committed it, we must repent, confess our sins, and seek the cleansing of the precious blood.
[114]  The apostle Paul said, "I have conducted myself in all good conscience before God until this day" Acts 23:1 .
[115]  The conscience spoken of here is not the conscience of an unregenerated man, but a conscience filled with the Holy Spirit.
[116]  The apostle said, "I also exercise myself to always have a conscience without offense toward God and men" Acts 24:16 because "if our heart does not blame us, we have boldness toward God; and whatever we ask we receive from Him because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight" 1 John 3:21-22 .
[117]  If our conscience frequently testifies of God's pleasure, then when we unfortunately fail, we will trust more boldly in the blood of the Lord Jesus to wash us again.
[118]  If we desire to have a conscience void of offense, we should not depart for a moment from the blood that washes us eternally.
[119]  We should not depart, because we often give opportunities for offenses in the conscience in small matters, even if we have not slipped in great matters.
[120]  Since our sinful nature and its many hidden works are still within us, we may possibly have to wait for our spiritual life to grow more before we can know them.
[121]  If we wish to have a conscience void of offense towards man, we must first have a conscience void of offense towards God, because a conscience that has an offense before God naturally has an offense before man.
[122]  In walking according to the spirit and listening to the voice of the conscience, we should also remember that the conscience is limited by its knowledge.
[123]  If the believer walks according to the standard which he already knows: keeping obeying everything which he knows to be according to God's will and rejecting everything which he knows to be condemned by God, he is able to have a complete fellowship with God.
[124]  We have clearly said before that Christ is the standard of holiness for our life.
[125]  At the same time, even though the conscience is not the standard of holiness, it is the standard that testifies whether or not we please God in our daily living.
[126]  We have spoken concerning outward things such as food.
[127]  Concerning more spiritual things, regardless of how much knowledge we possess, there can never be the difference of freedom or bondage to us.
[128]  Towards young believers, God is very concerned about outward things such as eating, clothing, and so on because God wants to put to death the evil deeds of their bodies.
[129]  If young believers have the heart to follow the Lord, they will see that the Lord often causes them to subdue these things through the conscience of the spirit.
[130]  ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT CHAPTER ONE DANGERS IN THE SPIRITUAL JOURNEY ACCORDING TO SPIRIT
[131]  In the Christian life, nothing is more crucial than to walk daily according to the spirit.
[132]  This will always keep the believer spiritual, keep him from the power of the flesh, keep him following the will of God, and keep him from Satan's attack.
[133]  Many believers, although regenerated, seem to feel that they do not have a spirit.
[134]  Actually, it is not that they do not have a spirit, but only that they do not feel that they do.
[135]  One can have the sense of the spirit, but not know that these feelings come from the spirit.
[136]  Therefore, if a believer is truly spiritual, he can continue to work, whether his soul has any feeling or his body has any strength, because he lives according to the continually active spirit.
[137]  If a believer does not seek to truly know God in the intuition and walk according to the intuition, but simply postulates in the mind or, even more commonly, seeks after the stirring of the Holy Spirit in his feelings, he still is walking according to the flesh and causing his spiritual life to sink into a lifeless condition.
[138]  Since our spirit, as the organ for fellowship between the Holy Spirit and the believers, is so crucial, it is no wonder that Satan utterly abhors the believers knowing about the functions of the spirit and walking according to the spirit.
[139]  His aim is to have the believers live in the soul and "quench the Spirit."
[140]  Through these feelings and thoughts, he can confound the spiritual senses of the believers, so that in a state of confusion, the believers cannot distinguish what is really from the spirit and what is from the soul.
[141]  Satan has another way to attack the believer who diligently follows the guidance of the intuition in spirit; he impersonates the believer's conscience to accuse him.
[142]  In order to keep the conscience blameless, a believer is willing to accept the accusations of the conscience and remove all the things condemned by it.
[143]  The enemy uses the desire of the believer to accuse him, causing him to mistake this as the condemnation of his own conscience so that he will be without peace, become weary of dealing with the problems, and lose his boldness to go on.
[144]  In the life of walking according to the spirit, spiritual believers should be aware of other dangers besides the disguise of Satan and his various attacks.
[145]  Many times our own soul, for reasons of its own without the counterfeiting of the evil spirit , initiates a certain feeling to prompt us to act.
[146]  A believer must know that his body has feelings, his soul has feelings, and his spirit also has feelings.
[147]  A believer must learn to know the sense of the spirit because this is the first condition of walking according to the spirit.
[148]  If he does not know what is the sense of the spirit and the feeling of the soul, he will not be able to walk according to the spirit.
[149]  Because we do not understand the laws of the spirit and the importance of the senses of the spirit, many times when the spirit expresses its desires, we are still ignorant of them.
[150]  The spirit requires the soul and the body to be the organs for its expression.
[151]  The spirit is like the lady of the house, and the steward and servant must carry out the lady's wishes.
[152]  Believers become depressed in their spirit mostly when they turn inward to look at themselves.
[153]  There is a difference between the burden of the spirit and the weight of the spirit.
[154]  The weight of the spirit is from Satan, and its purpose is to cause believers to suffer; Satan uses the weight to suppress them.
[155]  The burden of the spirit, however, is from God.
[156]  This means that God's life and power can ebb away in the believers' spirit like the ebbing away of the tide.
[157]  When believers are soulish, they consider it as a spiritual peak when they feel God's presence in their feelings making them feel happy.
[158]  When it comes into contact with the Holy Spirit, it becomes full of light.
[159]  If believers do not exercise their will to control their spirit, to prevent it from being too much or too little, and if they do not maintain a cooperation between their spirit and the Holy Spirit, their spirit has neglected its duty.
[160]  In summary, a believer must understand all the laws of the spirit before he can walk according to the spirit.
[161]  If he is not watchful, and does not cooperate with God, he will become fallen.
[162]  The most important law of the spirit is to examine the condition of the spirit.
[163]  Only those who know the laws of the spirit are able to understand the various senses of the spirit and their meaning and walk according to the demand of the senses in the spirit.
[164]  However, in addition to understanding the laws of the spirit, believers who walk according to the spirit have to know another matter: the principle of the mind assisting the spirit.
[165]  In spiritual warfare, a believer does not always attack the enemy because he forgets the principle of the cooperation of the spirit and the mind.
[166]  We should first use our mind to initiate the prayer, using words which we know curse the evil spirit; then our spirit will move, and the words with which we have cursed him will be backed up by the power of the spirit.
[167]  Sometimes we only need to use our mind to consider a little, and the spirit responds; sometimes, however, we have to wait for a while before the spirit agrees with us, because our mind is too narrow, and we may not quickly realize through the spirit what the Holy Spirit delights in. Sometimes God desires to enlarge the scope of our prayers; He desires us to pray for the nation so that all of Satan's work behind the scenes will fail.
[168]  We already know that God's leadings are not always "direct"; rather, some are "indirect."
[169]  In His direct leading, God's Spirit moves in our spirit so that we may know His will.
[170]  We only need to pay attention to the motion in our spirit to know the will of God.
[171]  If a believer desires to walk according to the spirit, he must continuously keep himself in a proper condition.
[172]  "But to this kind of man will I look, to him who is poor /And of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at My word" Isa 66:2 .
[173]  "Do not be slothful in zeal, but be burning in spirit, serving the Lord" Rom 12:11 .
[174]  The flesh can become enthusiastic for a moment from stimulation or emotion, but this is only temporary and does not last long.
[175]  "For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness" 2 Tim 1:7 .
[176]  "Be holy both in body and in spirit" 1 Cor 7:34 .
[177]  If we want to walk according to spirit, we should always keep our spirit holy.
[178]  "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit" Gal 6:18 .
[179]  Just as Simeon, by the revelation of the Holy Spirit, knew that he would see the Christ of God before his death, a believer should also believe with assurance in his spirit that he will be raptured to the Lord before he dies.
[180]  If the believer has the witness of being raptured in his spirit, if he has firm faith regarding his rapture, and if his conduct also matches the raptured spirit in life and work, then this spirit will cause the believer to prepare for the coming of the Lord.
[181]  SECTION SEVEN THE ANALYSIS OF THE SOUL 1 THE EMOTION CHAPTER ONE THE BELIEVER AND THE EMOTION
[182]  When a believer has not experienced the sure work of the cross, which is brought about by the Holy Spirit, he may have experienced deliverance from sin yet still be soulish and unable to overcome his own natural life.
[183]  If we carefully study the soulish conduct and action of a believer, we see that both issue from his emotion.
[184]  Many believers do not know how to differentiate inspiration from emotion.
[185]  Emotion always enters from outside of man, whereas inspiration is given by the Holy Spirit within man's spirit.
[186]  Elsewhere we have emphasized that only the spirit can do spiritual work; all other works are without spiritual value.
[187]  A work is absolutely useless if it cannot cause man's deadened spirit to be enlivened, cause man to receive God's uncreated life, and cause man to have the Holy Spirit indwell his regenerated spirit.
[188]  If a believer allows the cross to do a deeper work in his emotion, he would soon learn that the emotion would not obstruct the spirit, but would even cooperate with the spirit.
[189]  The cross would deal with all the natural life of the emotion, renew it, and make it an instrument of the spirit.
[190]  We have previously mentioned that a spiritual man is not a spirit, nor is he a man without emotion.
[191]  In the experience of a believer, perhaps the most difficult thing is to submit to the Lord in the matter of love.
[192]  Moreover, when we incline our heart toward a certain person, it is very difficult for us to keep our heart calm.
[193]  Rather, we are under the influence of our emotions, trying ardently to please this person.
[194]  At this time, we probably have less of an interest in drawing near to God than we do of drawing near to the loved one.
[195]  On the one hand, if a believer does not have a deep love for the Lord, He is grieved; on the other hand, even those who love the Lord can grieve Him because they love Him in their souls.
[196]  If we want to walk according to the spirit, we should keep our love calm; otherwise, we cannot hear the voice of the intuition directly.
[197]  Desires comprise the greatest part of our soul-life.
[198]  These desires join together with our will and cause us to either rebel against or dislike the will of God.
[199]  Because we have too many desires, our feelings become confused and we are unable to quietly walk according to the spirit.
[200]  Fondness for pleasure is also a great expression ofemotional believers.
[201]  The emotion cannot bear allowing believers to live completely for God; it absolutely opposes the life that is constantly for God.
[202]  Though believers may accept the demand of the Lord's cross and put to death the emotion so that they may live for the Lord, the emotion still asks that a small area be reserved for its activities.
[203]  When we are shut in by God, seeing neither men nor sky, and are required to live in the spirit to work for Him before the throne, we know whether our emotion has been completely put to death or not.
[204]  God's purpose is that the believer would live in the spirit and also be willing to completely put his soul-life to death.
[205]  Therefore, God has no choice but to banish the natural desire of the believer.
[206]  When a believer is willing to forsake all his own desires, he gains a life of real rest.
[207]  In the past he had many desires, exhausting all of his wits, strength, schemes, devices, and methods to gain them.
[208]  CHAPTER FOUR A LIFE OF FEELING THE BELIEVER'S EXPERIENCE
[209]  When believers have a love relationship with the Lord and are fully satisfied with Him, they usually enter into the experience of a life of feeling.
[210]  Not only is he unable to recover what he thinks is lost, but day by day he feels drier and colder.
[211]  The believer who goes through such an experience thinks that his spirituality is at its highest when he has this experience and at its lowest when he loses it.
[212]  A believer often speaks of his own life as constantly being up and down.
[213]  He means that his spirituality is at its highest when he feels happy, when he feels that he loves the Lord, and when he feels the Lord's presence; his spirituality is at its lowest when he feels dark, dry, and bitter.
[214]  The Lord causes the believer to have different feelings so that he may learn how to overcome them and, thereby, overcome his environment.
[215]  If he can overcome strong and contradicting feelings, he can surely overcome any kind of changing environment.
[216]  In this way, a believer will stand on sure ground, and his living will be stabilized.
[217]  God wants a believer to behave the same way, whether he is full of feeling or has no feeling.
[218]  If we understand the significance of this experience which God gives us and walk according to His will, there is no danger at all.
[219]  However, when the believer fails to understand God's goal and lives by this kind of feeling intently pursuing in the presence of feeling while refusing to move in its absence there is inevitably a spiritual danger.
[220]  If a believer lives by this happy feeling, his will remains weak and is of no use to the spirit.
[221]  If we genuinely love God, we will still fervently love Him no matter what circumstance He puts us in. If we only love when the feeling is present but not when it is absent, perhaps we only love our feeling, not God.
[222]  The Bible discloses the proper course of a believer's life in the following verses: "But the righteous shall have life and live by faith" Rom 1:17 ; "the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God" Gal 2:20 ; and "we walk by faith, not by appearance" 2 Cor 5:7 .
[223]  After reading these verses, we know that a believer lives by faith.
[224]  We may think that the cross's most complete work is accomplished when we forsake outward, physical happiness and worldly pleasures.
[225]  Little do we know that in God's work of eliminating our old creation, there remains an even deeper work of the cross for us.
[226]  If we live by our emotion, we do God's will only when we feel happy.
[227]  If we live by faith, we see that we obey the Lord in all matters.
[228]  Since we once believed in God, loved God, and trusted God, no matter where He puts us or how He ill-treats us, and even if He causes us to go through the refining fire so that we would suffer both physically and emotionally, yet we will believe in Him, love Him, and trust Him!
[229]  This life of faith may be called a life of the will.
[230]  Although the believer may not feel that he should obey God, nevertheless, he wants to obey Him.
[231]  Hence, a believer who does the will of God only when he feels happy is not of much value to God, because he is stirred by God's joy to do God's will and not by his sincerity.
[232]  When a believer is regulated by a life of feeling, he neglects his duty towards others.
