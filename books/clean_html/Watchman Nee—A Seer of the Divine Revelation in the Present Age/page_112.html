<P>The number of attendants at the third overcomer conference was about three hundred, with over one hundred from different provinces throughout the country. There were two lines of messages. One line was the centrality and universality of Christ. This line disclosed how Christ is the center and the circumference in the universe and in the Christian life. He must have the pre-eminence in everything. The second line was God's overcomers. This line revealed how God called His overcomers in every age to replace His defeated people for the fulfillment of His purpose. The extract of these messages was published in the thirty-fourth issue of The Present Testimony of March&#151;April 1934.</P><P>In October of the same year, his fourth overcomer conference was held in Hangchow. The attendants were generally the same ones who came to his third conference in Shanghai. His messages again were along two lines. The first line was the life of Abraham, showing how Abraham was an overcomer to fulfill God's purpose. The second line was the spiritual warfare, showing how to fight the enemy for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose.</P><P>In his third visit to Chefoo in August of 1935, he held a special conference with the church there on the overcoming life of Christ. At that time the saints were greatly helped to experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Through this conference a revival was brought in, which spread to Shanghai and other cities. After the revival broke out in Chefoo, Watchman returned in September to Shanghai and held a conference with the church on the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>In October, following the conference in Shanghai, he also held a conference with the co-workers in Kulangsu in south Fukien on the same subject.</P><P>In January of 1937 he called an urgent conference in Shanghai for all the co-workers throughout the country. His burden was to share with his co-workers the new vision he had received from the Lord concerning the work and the local churches.</P><P>In the following November he held a conference in Hankow with his co-workers to release the same messages more adequately on his new revelation regarding the work and the local churches. Although the messages were the same as those given in Shanghai, the content was deeper and the revelation clearer. These messages were printed in a book entitled Rethinking the Work (The Normal Christian Church Life).</P><P>After his return from his trip to Europe, he called a special eleven-day conference in August of 1939. In this conference he released his messages on the principles of the Body.</P><P>In the years from 1940 to 1942, he held many special meetings. During this period he was both carrying out a training of the co-workers and at the same time helping the church in Shanghai to be built up practically. The crucial point he stressed in all these meetings was the need to see the Body. He also delivered a number of messages on the deeper things of the spiritual life. The messages contained in his book The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were delivered at that time.</P><P>In April and May of 1948, a special conference was held in Shanghai not only for the local saints but also for about eighty seeking saints from other cities throughout the country. In this special conference he spoke mostly concerning the work. His burden was to learn from the lessons of the past how best to go on in the future. It was in this special conference that he resumed his ministry. This conference resulted in all the brothers and sisters handing over all their possessions to the work. Brother Nee took the lead in this matter. This resulted in a revival, which in turn resulted in about eighty seeking brothers and sisters attending Watchman's first prolonged period of training in Kuling Mountain, Foochow.</P><P>In 1950 during the months of January and February, he held a long special conference with the church in Hong Kong. He spoke on overcoming wealth and how to hand over all our possessions for the furtherance of the Lord's work. At the same time he stressed that the believers who have been baptized in the Spirit into one Body should be built up in the church that the church might be a corporate means for the Lord to spread His gospel. A number of brothers and sisters were led to hand over all their possessions to the work, which in turn revived the whole church. Through this visit, the foundation was laid for the church in Hong Kong to receive much blessing in the years to come, both in life and in numbers.</P>
