   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Fruit-bearing Being to Enjoy God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although the branches of a fruit-bearing tree may bear much fruit, none of the fruit is the result of the work of the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The branches simply absorb the sap, the riches of the tree, and fruit grows.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we say to the branches, You have worked too hard, they will respond, This is not true; we are simply bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Actually, they are enjoying.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They do not contribute anything or perform any work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They simply absorb the riches of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more they absorb, the more fruit they bear.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more they experience this inward enjoyment, the more they bear outward fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Fruit does not come from the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Fruit comes from the tree, and the branches are merely channels through which the sap flows.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This process of life passing through the branches is an enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God has no intention for us to do anything for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He has no intention for us to worship Him or serve Him in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I hope we understand this word and not misunderstand it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God desires to be only one thing to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He presents Himself to us and places Himself within us for the purpose of being our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The more we enjoy Him, the more blessed we are.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more we enjoy Him, the more we know Him and are able to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more the branches abide in the tree, the more they allow the elements of the tree to abide in them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The sap and riches of the tree flow through the branches and from them bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is what God desires from us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must change our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to see a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have met many children of God in different places, and the more I spoke with them, the more I shook my head.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is difficult to find a person who knows God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is almost impossible to find a person who knows God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we meet a child of God, we may feel that he is a pious, God-fearing man who seeks God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, it is not easy to find a man who knows that God desires man to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Prayer Being to Enjoy God</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A sister once complained to me that although she had been trying to exercise patience for many years, she still found it difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She said that she had been trying by praying.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I asked her how she prayed, she responded, My patience is sufficient for only five trials.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After that my patience runs out.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, I tell the Lord that I have no patience, and I ask Him to grant me patience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I can only ask the Lord to help me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the prayer of a novice.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>An experienced person would tell others not to pray such a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more we pray this way, the less patience we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I asked if it was possible to forget about being patient when praying, she said, But my problem is a lack of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have to go to God to deal with my lack of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If I do not pray for patience, what should I pray for?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Are you saying that if I lose my temper and am short of patience, it is wrong to pray?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If I pray, should I not pray for patience?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I smiled and said, Sister, it is right to pray, but some kinds of prayer are not really prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This can be compared to trying to eat with our nose rather than our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This sister s problem was not a shortage of patience but a shortage of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>She did not need patience; she needed God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>She needed to forget about patience and seize God instead.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some may consider seize to be a strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But she needed to spend time before the Lord and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>She needed to absorb God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If God was added to her, she would have patience.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>My word confused the sister, however, and she asked, How can I enjoy God?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How do I absorb Him?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This sister s confusion is typical of many Christians who are unclear about enjoying God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even we are not clear; we are novices in knowing God, enjoying Him, touching Him, and fellowshipping with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>While we want God, our way is often wrong and to no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We try to fellowship with God, but our way of fellowshipping is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many of our prayers are offered in a wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are wrong because we focus on things rather than on God; we lay hold of things rather than of God; we pray for things rather than for God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For this reason, we do not enjoy or absorb God.</S>
