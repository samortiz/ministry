<P>In His human living, He lived in Nazareth in a carpenter's home for thirty years, and He ministered for three and a half years. He was a man who was altogether not glorious and even very lowly. Therefore, He was looked down upon and despised by many people. Some who despised Him said, "Is not this the carpenter....?" (Mark 6:3). He was not a glorious, divine carpenter. If He were, He would have become a great attraction. All the Jews would have streamed to Him in Nazareth. But when He came out, He had no outward beauty or comeliness for people to pay attention to Him.</P><P>His human shell concealed His divinity. This shell was altogether not handsome, beautiful, or comely. This means that He was a person with two natures, the divine nature and the human nature. The divine nature was glorious. Once, on a high mountain, He was transfigured for a short time (Matt. 17:1-2). Besides that short time, His divinity was concealed within His humanity for thirty-three and a half years. But on the mount of His transfiguration, the inner glory within Him swallowed up His outer humanity. Then He became glorious. That was a prefigure of His resurrection.</P><P>He was in a glorious divine nature and in a very low human nature for thirty-three and a half years. Then He died, and His death broke His human shell and released the inner, glorious, divine life (John 12:24). After three days, He entered into resurrection. When He became incarnated, He put on humanity. Then when He was resurrected, He brought His humanity into divinity.</P><P>Andrew Murray said that when Christ was resurrected, He sanctified His flesh. This means He made His humanity divine. He uplifted the human nature. Christ in His incarnation brought God into humanity, and in His resurrection He brought humanity into divinity. Andrew Murray used the word interwoven to describe this. By becoming incarnated and by being resurrected, Christ did an interweaving work. He interwove divinity into humanity and humanity into divinity. This is similar to the interweaving of two types of materials. Silk may be interwoven with cotton to produce a textile. We cannot say that this textile is only silk or only cotton. It is an interweaving of silk and cotton. In like manner, Christ is the interweaving of God and man. He was only God before His incarnation. But after His incarnation and through His resurrection, He became a God-man. God is now in humanity, and man is now in divinity. This is a kind of interweaving. Divinity was interwoven into humanity, and humanity was interwoven into divinity. Thus, divinity and humanity have become an interwoven cloth. Hallelujah, today we are wearing this cloth!</P><P>In reference to the resurrection of Christ, 1 Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is the very essence, the very element, and the very reality of the resurrected Christ. The resurrected Christ today is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). This is why we say that Christ is the pneumatic Christ. The pneumatic Christ is Christ as the pneuma, and the pneuma is the Spirit.</P><P>We have to realize that before Christ's resurrection there were the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jehovah in the Old Testament and then the Holy Spirit in the Gospels. But after His resurrection, Acts 16:7b speaks of the Spirit of Jesus, and Romans 8:9 speaks of the Spirit of Christ. Then Philippians 1:19 speaks of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Spirit of Jesus Christ is "the Spirit" mentioned in John 7:39, the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Jesus Christ.</P>
