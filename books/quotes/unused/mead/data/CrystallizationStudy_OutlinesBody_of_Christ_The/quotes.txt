[1]  Message Two The Reality of the Body of Christ Scripture Reading: Acts 26:19; John 16:13; Rom 8:16;
[2]  Phil 3:10; Eph 4:15-16, 20-24 The Body of Christ is God s heart s desire and His ultimate purpose; only those who have received revelation from God will see and enter into the reality of the Body of Christ Eph 1:17-18a; 3:9; Acts 26:18-19: The move of God s economy is like the turning of a great wheel, and this turning wheel in God s economy has the Body of Christ as its axis; all of God s move and work today are joined to and for the Body of Christ, the organism of the Triune God Ezek.
[3]  Message Four The Body of Christ in Romans Scripture Reading: Rom 12:1-16; 14:1; 15:5-7; 16:1, 4-5, 16b, 20 The subject of Romans is the gospel of God to make sinners sons of God to constitute the Body of Christ, which is expressed as the local churches 3:23; 8:14, 29; 12:4-5; 16:1, 4-5, 16b.
[4]  Romans 4 lays the foundation for Romans 12 16, where we see the Body life, the kingdom life, and the practical church life; the purpose of God s justification is to have a reproduction of Christ in millions of sons, who become the members of His Body 4:13; 8:29; 12:4-5.
[5]  Message Five The Body of Christ in 1 Corinthians Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:2; 10:17; 12:12-13, 20, 27 First Corinthians speaks concerning the Body of Christ emphatically and deals with the Body extensively, and 2 Corinthians is a book on the ministry of the new covenant 1 Cor 12:12-27; 2 Cor 3:8-9; 4:1; 5:18: If we desire to have the Body of Christ, we must have the new covenant ministry 1:3-4; 3:8-9; 4:10-12; 5:20; 6:1; 7:3; 11:2-3; 12:15; 13:11, 14.
[6]  The church of God in Corinth was a local expression of the one unique, universal Body of Christ 1:22-23; 4:4; 1 Cor 1:2; 12:27: The local churches are the many expressions in many localities of the one Body of Christ Eph 2:21-22; 4:16; Rev 1:11: The local churches, being the existence of the Body for its function, are the many expressions of the Body of Christ Eph 4:4; Rev 2:1.
[7]  Message Nine The Organic Building Up of the Body of Christ
[8]  to Meet and to Serve Scripture Reading: Eph 3:9; 4:11-16; 1 Cor 14:24-26, 31 God is doing the work of His recovery, and His recovery is to build up the Body of Christ...He is recovering the organic building up of the Body of Christ by the speaking of His ministry Elders Training, Book 9, The Eldership and the God-ordained Way 1 , p.
[9]  The overcomers see the Body, know the Body, care for the Body, honor the Body, and do the work of the Body; they keep every principle of the Body of Christ, as the continuation and extension of Christ on earth, for the full expression of Christ Eph 1:22-23; 3:18-19; 4:1-6: We must see the crystallized significance of the Body of Christ; this crystallized significance is that the Triune God and His chosen and redeemed people are constituted into one entity, which is the Body of Christ vv.
[10]  Eph 3:1; 4:1, 11-12, 16; 6:18, 20; Rom 8:2, 29 The church as the Body of Christ is a pure product out of Christ; only that which comes out of Christ with His resurrection life can be His complement and counterpart, the Body of Christ Gen 2:22-23; Eph 5:28-30: The Head of the Body is Christ, and the Body of the Head is Christ, so the Body of Christ with Christ as the Head is the Christ, the corporate Christ Col 1:18; 1 Cor 12:12; Col 3:10-11.
[11]  Anything other than Christ is not the Body of Christ, and anything other than Christ is a foreign element in the Body of Christ; thus, we must be desperate as Paul was to live Christ for the building up of the Body Phil 1:19-21a; 3:8-14.
[12]  4, 9, 14, 16: When we are imprisoned in Christ, we receive a revelation of Him to experience Him in His unlimited dimensions as the church-loving Christ, the new-man-creating Christ, the all-things-heading-up Christ, the gift-making and gift-giving Christ, and the home-making Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ Eph 3:18; 5:25-27; 2:15-16; 1:20-23; 4:7-8, 11-12; 3:17a.
[13]  The Body of Christ is the issue of the experience of Christ, so we need to pray desperately that we would live Christ for the Body of Christ to be a reality; the secret of how to live Christ for the reality of the Body of Christ is in Romans 8, which is a definition, description, explanation, and presentation of the law of the Spirit of life v. 2: Romans 8 uses this term the law of the Spirit of life to describe how the Triune God, after having been processed and consummated to become the life-giving Spirit, has been installed into our spirit as a law, a spontaneous, automatic principle and power within us; this is one of the biggest discoveries, even recoveries, in God s economy vv.
[14]  Message Twelve Living Out and Working Out the New Jerusalem
[15]  Whatever is ascribed to the New Jerusalem should be both our personal and corporate experience for us to become the New Jerusalem and build the New Jerusalem by the mingling of God with man for the oneness of the Body of Christ to fulfill the eternal purpose of God: The New Jerusalem is the totality of the overcomers; a remnant of the Lord s believers, the earlier overcomers, will be the bride of Christ for one thousand years 19:7-9; 20:4, 6 ; then they will join the rest of the Lord s believers, the later overcomers, to be the wife of Christ for eternity 21:2-3, 7 : The earlier overcomers, as the reality of Zion within Jerusalem, the reality of the Body of Christ within the church, have highways to Zion in their heart; they take the way of the church internally by being incorporated into God as their dwelling place through the crucified Christ, typified by the bronze altar as their nest for their refuge, and through the resurrected Christ in ascension, typified by the incense altar as their home for their rest Psa 48:2; 84:3-5; cf.
