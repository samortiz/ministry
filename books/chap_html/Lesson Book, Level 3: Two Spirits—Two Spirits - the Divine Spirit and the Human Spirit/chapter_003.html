THE COMPOUND OINTMENT IN EXODUS 30</H2><P>In the last lesson we saw that the divine Spirit was only the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jehovah in the Old Testament. The all-inclusive Spirit was "not yet" because the Triune God had not yet passed through the steps of His process. Yet Exodus 30:22-25 shows a marvelous picture that signifies the all-inclusive Spirit. "Moreover Jehovah spoke unto Moses saying, Take thou also unto thee the chief spices: of flowing myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty, and of sweet calamus two hundred fifty, and of cassia five hundred...and of olive oil a hin; and thou shalt make a holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded...." (Hin and shekel are ancient units of measure.)</P><P>This holy anointing oil was applied to the tabernacle, its contents, and the serving priests. It is a type (symbol) of the "compound Spirit." A compound is something that is the result of the union or mingling of different elements or ingredients. Every ingredient of this compound ointment and its unit of measure shows us something very significant about the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE INGREDIENTS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Olive Oil</H2><P>[In the Bible olive oil signifies the Spirit of God (Psa. 45:7; Isa. 61:1). Olive oil is produced by the pressing of olives. The olive oil signifies the Spirit of God, through the pressure of Christ's death, flowing out.</P><P>The olive oil is the base of the ointment; it is the basic element compounded with the spices. The four spices are compounded into the olive oil to make the ointment. This indicates that the Spirit of God, signified by the olive oil, is no longer merely oil, but now it is oil compounded with certain ingredients.]</P>
