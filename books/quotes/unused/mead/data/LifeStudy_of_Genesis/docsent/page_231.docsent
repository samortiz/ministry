   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 Man's Fall from Man's Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Others' Control</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Man did not remain very long under the government of his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first person to violate the rule of the conscience was Cain.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis 4 reveals that Cain was not shameful for lying and for murdering his brother, Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His lying to God about Abel's death was an open manifestation of his breaking of his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was arrogant and not at all ashamed about his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since man violated his conscience, violence filled the earth before the time of the flood 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As we saw in the previous message, before the flood there was no human government.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was only after the flood that God established a deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man began to exercise God's authority to rule over others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That was the beginning of human government.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, secondly, man fell from self-government to human government.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the first nine chapters of Genesis we see three kinds of government: the divine government, the government of the conscience, or self-government, and human government.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All Bible students agree that these governments constitute three of God's dispensations, three of the ways in which God deals with the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first dispensation was that of God's divine government, and the second was that of the government of man's own conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When man fell from the rule of his conscience, he came under the third dispensation, that of the human government.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I would like to say a word to the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We thank God that we are His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As human beings, we are under Him and He is the real government above us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We also have a conscience that He has provided for us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a good thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Moreover, we have many deputy authorities: the parents at home, the principals and teachers in the schools, and the government.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All of these are the deputy authorities of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By these three kinds of government the human race has been preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although mankind has not been saved, it has been preserved by these three kinds of government.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Humanly speaking, we all must have a fear of God, we all must listen to our conscience, and we all must respect God's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must respect our parents, the school administrators, and the government.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God uses all the deputy authorities to maintain the human race so that He might fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Never rebel against God, against the human conscience, or against human government.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's salvation moves in a direction opposite to that of man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Man fell firstly from God's presence to man's conscience; secondly, from man's conscience to human government; and eventually from human government to rebellion under Satan's instigation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In God's salvation we are firstly saved from rebellion to human government and from human government to the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually we are saved from conscience to God's presence in our spirit.</S>
