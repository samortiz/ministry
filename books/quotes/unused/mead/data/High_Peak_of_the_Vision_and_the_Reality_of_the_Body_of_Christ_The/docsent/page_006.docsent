   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE HIGH PEAK OF THE VISION 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer: O Lord, only You know our need.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to see You; we need to see Your economy, Your goal, and Your heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>O Lord, we worship You.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Everything on our side depends on Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You will have mercy on whomever You will have mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We pray that You will continue to have mercy on us and go on further to have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>O Lord, Your church has been on the earth for more than nineteen hundred years, yet her condition is still as it is today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>O Lord, we pray that You will deliver us from this religious age that we may truly enter into the state which You are after in Your economy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>O Lord, cleanse us and anoint us again tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We pray also that You will cover us with Your precious blood and remove for us all disturbance and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Give us the words and purify our words.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lord, we worship You in that You have destroyed Your enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"GOD BECAME MAN THAT MAN MAY BECOME GOD" BEING THE ESSENCE OF THE ENTIRE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I sense that I still need to fellowship with you brothers concerning the matter of the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Tonight we want to see the matter of "God became man that man may become God" in the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The words "God becoming man and man becoming God" sound very simple, but to be able to see how God could become man requires us to spend much time to study.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He came to become man that man may become Him, but how can man become God?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We also need to look into this point carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Strictly speaking, these words are the essence of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The entire Bible is an explanation of the eternal economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Up to the present time it has been thirty-five hundred years since the Jews began to read the Old Testament; Christians have been reading the Old and New Testaments for nearly two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Millions of people have read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, unfortunately, not many have truly seen the proper significance and real meaning in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This does not mean that throughout the generations no one has seen the visions in the Bible; but what people saw is fragmented.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One saw a little concerning one aspect, and another saw a little concerning another aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, among all the departments of the human race in the whole world, Christianity has the greatest number of books.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That no other department in the world has more books than Christianity is proof that many people have seen something from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>BROTHER NEE'S MINISTRY AND HIS ARRANGEMENT CONCERNING THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the Lord raised us up in China, He showed us the entire vision in the Bible in a brief and concise way through Brother Nee, the main points of which I fellowshipped with you in the previous chapter: the salvation of God, the church, Christ as life, and the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These are the things that Brother Nee saw clearly and spoke to us in the thirty years of his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I say again that, unfortunately, of these four great points that he showed us, the average brother and sister understood only the first three points and disagreed with the last point, that is, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At any rate, from 1922 to 1952, when he was put into prison, Brother Nee carried out his ministry for exactly thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then, in the twenty years after 1952 he was not able to write any book or do any work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 1950, before Brother Nee was put into prison, the Lord led him to make an arrangement among the co-workers, an arrangement that was unequaled before or after.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He rarely made this kind of arrangement because at that time the political situation kept changing and we did not know how to prepare ourselves for the change.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the two urgent co-workers' meetings he repeatedly said, "We ask Brother Witness to go abroad."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Afterward, when the Communists gained the upper hand, I was in Shanghai hurrying to finish the building of the big meeting hall, and the only job left to be done was to install the flooring composed of small marble chips set in cement.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the end of April 1949, Brother Nee sent me a wire telling me to turn over everything of the church in Shanghai to the elders and leave immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, I was sent out.</S>
