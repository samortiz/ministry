Numbers 16 records two instances of rebellion. We have seen the first rebellion, which covers verses 1 through 40. This was the rebellion of the leaders among God's people. Their end was the way of Sheol; they went straight down to hell. God's people should overcome the gates of Hades, but these ones were overcome by the gates of Hades instead. From verse 41 to the end of the chapter is the second rebellion. This was the rebellion of the entire congregation of Israel. In verse 41 the congregation murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying, "You have killed the people of Jehovah." The spirit of rebellion is infectious. Even when a person witnesses judgment on others, he may not stop the rebellion in himself. The people did not take warning from the result of the rebellion of the two hundred fifty leaders. On the contrary, when the rebellious ones were judged and sent to Hades, the whole congregation rose up in rebellion. They forgot that the gates of Hades opened up the first time because of the leaders' own folly. They forgot that it was not Moses and Aaron who had judged the two hundred fifty leaders, but God who had judged them. Moses and Aaron did not open the gates of Hades; God opened them. The congregation only saw men; they did not realize that authority comes from God, and they attacked boldly. As the entire congregation was attacking Moses and Aaron, God stepped forward and vindicated Himself. He showed that authority comes from Him alone. In reality, the people were not opposing Moses and Aaron; they were opposing God. Moses and Aaron saw the rebellion of the congregation, but they did not open their mouths to argue with them. Instead, God spoke. His glory was manifested in the tabernacle. His glory manifested itself not only in times of deliverance, but in times of judgment as well. God told Moses and Aaron that He would destroy the entire congregation. As soon as a man begins to rebel, he moves his feet towards the gates of Hades.</p><p>Before Moses and Aaron spoke, God stepped in to deal with the people. God's glory was manifested in the execution of His judgment. God could tolerate the ten murmurings of the people in the wilderness. He could tolerate their sin of reminiscing about Egypt or their lack of interest in entering Canaan. These sins prevented them from entering Canaan directly through Kadesh-barnea and caused them to wander in the wilderness for thirty-eight years. However, He could not tolerate their touching His authority. He would not tolerate them for another thirty-eight years but would destroy them in an instant. The sin of rebellion is more serious than any other kind of sin. The Israelites were already at the threshold of Canaan. If God would not let them go in, it would defeat the purpose of their exodus out of Egypt. Yet God was willing to let the entire generation go. He could bear many sins and forgive many trespasses, but rebellion is the pathway to hell; it is in the principle of death and Satan. This sin is more serious than any other sin. As the people were opposing God's authority, God spoke to Moses and Aaron, and after He spoke, a plague broke out. Within a few minutes 14,700 persons died. What a sobering thing! Fortunately, Moses had keen spiritual discernment; he ordered Aaron to take the censer, put fire in it from off the altar, place incense on it, and carry it to the assembly to make propitiation for them. This stopped the plague. This shows us how serious it is to stand against authority!</p><h2 class="head1">SAUL'S STUMBLING IN THE MATTER OF AUTHORITY</h2><p>After the children of Israel entered Canaan, they fell into confusion time after time during the period of the judges. Everyone did according to what was right in his own sight. God was not able to set up His authority among the people. God's authority was not found among them until the kingdom of Israel was established and the period of the kings began. When the Israelites came out of Egypt, the entire race experienced deliverance. By the time of the kings, the authority of the kingdom was established. Saul was the first king of the kingdom of Israel. God chose him and made him the authority, that is, God's deputy authority. Later, Saul fell in the matter of authority. God commanded him to destroy the Amalekites and everything they possessed, but Saul disobeyed God's command and had pity on Agag the king of Amalek. He was not willing to destroy the best of the sheep and the oxen of the Amalekites. He did not hearken to God's word. Therefore, Samuel said to him, "Does Jehovah delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices/As much as in obeying the voice of Jehovah?/Surely, to obey is better than sacrifice,/And to heed, than the fat of rams" (1 Sam. 15:22). He told Saul that God wanted obedience and submission from him, not the best of the sheep, oxen, and sacrifices. Saul was God's appointed authority, yet he did not keep his place as an authority. Saul was the greatest utilitarian in the Old Testament, and Judas was his counterpart in the New Testament. Saul was the Old Testament pragmatist, and Judas was the New Testament pragmatist. Saul was a little better than Judas; he spared things for the Lord, while Judas tried to save the money spent on the ointment for the poor. Yet the principle of rebellion in both cases is the same.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> </body></html>
