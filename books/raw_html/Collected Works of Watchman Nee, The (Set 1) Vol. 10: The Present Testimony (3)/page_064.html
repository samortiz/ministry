<P>What is the revelation of the Holy Spirit? It is the Holy Spirit removing the veil and showing you what lies behind a preacher's speaking. You may have seen what is meant by forgiveness and regeneration. This seeing is most precious. When you saw that Christ Jesus died in such a way, you believed. You may go to the countryside and see an old friend and preach to him. He may nod his head, but soon forget what you preached. He lacks one necessary thing; he has not obtained the revelation. Those who are blind cannot believe. Those who have no revelation cannot have faith. You must pray that God will make him see his sin and see the Savior. You may have preached three or five doctrines to him. But when he sees, there is no need to preach to him anymore. Just as he needs to see Christ's death, he also needs to see resurrection, ascension, and all the other truths.</P><P>Brothers, you may go to the countryside to preach the gospel to fifty people and tell them how man sinned, how the Lord died for man, and how faith brings in salvation. All fifty people may nod their heads. However, does this mean that all fifty are saved? Although they nod their heads, they walk away with no realization that lying and pride are sins. They have heard about sin but have not seen sin. They have heard about the Savior but have not seen the Savior. Thus, there is no possibility for them to believe. Every time we preach the gospel to someone, we must ask God to open their eyes so that they will weep at seeing their sin and receive the Lord when they see Him. After some time a theological professor may come and tell them that their sins are not really sins and that the Lord's death was merely an act of self-sacrifice. However, they will not be moved if they have seen something. They believe because they have seen something.</P><P>Death is an objective truth. It demands our believing. All the other objective truths also demand our believing. We have paid considerable attention to preaching the Lord's death. Nevertheless, it has not been effective. Something is wrong in the matter of faith, and this means something is wrong with the revelation. Once I preached about the truth of our crucifixion with the Lord. A brother said that it was good and that he would be victorious from then on because he now knew the way to victory. I said that after a few days it would not work because he had not yet seen. You may ask someone how they were saved, and they may say that they heard the teaching. However, this kind of salvation will not last for more than a few days. Mere understanding in the mind is not faith. When you read the Bible or hear in the meeting that you have died, resurrected, and ascended, you should not say, "I have examined myself and have not found any resurrection or ascension." Neither should you say lightly, "I have died, resurrected, and ascended." Instead, you should ask the Lord, "Make me see that I have died, resurrected, and ascended." If you pray in this way, the Lord will usher you into the objective truth, that is, into Himself. You will see that in Christ, you are dead, resurrected, and ascended. Since He has died, you also have died; since He has resurrected, you also have resurrected; and since He has ascended, you also have ascended. In this way you will say, "Lord, I thank You. In You I have died, resurrected, and ascended." You will say this because of faith. This faith is based on the facts behind the words.</P><P>Mr. Hudson Taylor was at one time continuously experiencing failure and weakness. Once he wrote to his sister about how his heart was very troubled because he felt that he was lacking sanctification, life, and power within. He thought that if he could only abide in Christ, everything would be fine. His sister prayed for him. For a few months he prayed, struggled, fasted, made resolutions, read the Bible, and used more time for quiet meditation. However, nothing was effective. He wished he could abide in Christ forever, but it seemed that after dwelling in Him for a short while, he came out again. He said, "If I only knew I could abide in Christ, then everything would be well; but I could not." From his diary we read the following story: one day he was praying again. He thought that if he could abide in Christ and could draw His juice and receive His nourishment and supply, he would have the power to overcome sin. He prayed again and read the Bible again. Then he came to John 15:5, which says, "I am the vine; you are the branches." He said, "I am the most foolish man in the whole world. I have been praying to be a branch; I wanted to abide in Christ. However, the Lord has said that I already am a branch and abiding in Him." O brothers, if we realize this, we will say, "Hallelujah!" We do not need to enter anything, because we are already in. We do not need to strive to be a branch, nor do we become a branch only after we have overcome sin. We are already a branch, and we are abiding in Him. The purpose of John 15:5 is to tell us that we are abiding in Him and that we should not leave this abiding. We are a branch. All the juice, nourishment, and love are ours. Mr. Taylor said that since he saw this, he became a new Hudson Taylor. This was a great turning point in his life.</P><P>Believing is not changing God's word into reality. It is believing that God's word is reality. During last year's special conference, I mentioned that the grace of God comprises three things: the promise, the fact, and the covenant. The promise is something which will be accomplished. The fact is something which has been accomplished. All the objective truths have been accomplished and are real. We only need to say to God, "Your Word says I have died, resurrected, and ascended. Therefore, I also say that I have died, resurrected, and ascended." Indeed, this is the way we can stand firm. God has spoken, and it is so.</P><P>Mr. ______ was a famous speaker in the Keswick Conventions. The turning point of his life was due to one incident. Once he chose 2 Corinthians 12:9, "My grace is sufficient for you," to be the topic of his message. After he had prepared the outline, he knelt down to pray, "I respectfully present the draft of this message before You. O God! I pray for Your blessings." After the prayer he realized that he could not use this message. "I was going to preach to the people that the grace of God is sufficient for us. But if anyone would ask me whether the grace of God is sufficient for me, I would definitely have to say no because I still have my temper and pride. If the grace of God is not sufficient for me, how can I say to people that it is sufficient for them? I cannot say that." It was Saturday, there was no time to prepare for anything else, and he did not have the choice not to preach. Confronted with this difficult situation, he knelt down and prayed again, "O God! Today let Your grace be sufficient for me. May this become my own experience. I have been proud, jealous, lustful, and filled with unclean thoughts. Make me overcome all these if Your grace is truly sufficient for me." He prayed the whole afternoon, but it seemed the more he prayed, the further God was away from him. Later he became tired and walked from his desk to the side of the fireplace for a rest. There on the wall by the fireplace hung a verse saying, "My grace IS sufficient for you." Immediately he became clear that the grace of God is not "going to be sufficient for me," nor "awaiting to be sufficient for me," but rather it "is sufficient for me." He did not need to ask God to give him sufficient grace; God's grace was sufficient for him. He jumped to his feet and said, "The grace of God is sufficient for me. Why do I have to pray?" This is faith, and this is also a revelation. He said, "Thank God, for many years I always anticipated sufficient grace from God. On that day God revealed to me that His grace is sufficient. I came to a great turning point in my life." The next day he was exceptionally powerful. Later in the Keswick Convention, he gave many messages and helped many people. Someone asked him how he became the way he was. He answered that he had seen the sufficiency.</P>
