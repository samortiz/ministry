   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD JESUS BEING A MAN ON THE THRONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Through His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, the Lord Jesus was brought to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A real man whose name is Jesus is on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is why we declare, Jesus is Lord and why we call, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God has always been the Lord, but now a man is on the throne as the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through His resurrection and in His ascension, God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus Acts 2:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God has made Jesus, a Nazarene, the Lord, and now today the Lord of heaven and of earth is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do you really realize that the Lord of the universe today is a man?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hallelujah for this man!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It would not seem strange to us to say that Jehovah Elohim is the Lord of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But it is not easy for us to realize that a man who could be crucified and buried could be the Lord of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Judas and the multitude came to arrest Him, He did not run away.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He willingly made Himself weak and allowed Himself to be arrested and crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the words of 2 Corinthians 13:4, He was crucified out of weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But after He was crucified and buried, God resurrected Him and set Him at His right hand, making Him the Lord of all the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today, the Lord of the universe is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE LORD JESUS BEING</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE PIONEER TO THE THRONE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We also need to see that the Lord Jesus led the way to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was the Pioneer, the Forerunner Heb 6:20 , cutting the path to the throne 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that He is not the only man destined for the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He has cut the path and has taken the lead so that we may follow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was the first one to the throne, and we will come after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we are marching to the throne, for God intends to bring us into glory and to set us on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE APPEARANCE OF THE MAN ON THE THRONE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Ezekiel 1:27 says, I saw as the color of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here we see that the appearance of the man on the throne has two aspects: From His loins upward He looks like electrum, and from His loins downward He looks like fire.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why does His upper part look like electrum, and why does His lower part look like fire?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The upper part of a man, from his loins to his head, is the part of feeling, of sensation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This part signifies his nature and disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to His nature and disposition the Lord Jesus on the throne looks like electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The lower part of a man s body is for moving.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The appearance of fire from the loins downward signifies the Lord s appearance in His move.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the Lord comes to us, He first comes as fire.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When He stays with us, He becomes electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, whenever the Lord moves through us, He moves like fire to burn, enlighten, and search.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After this burning something will remain, and that will be the electrum a mixture of gold and silver signifying the Lamb-God, the redeeming God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God wants us to gain Him as the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order for this to be our experience, He must first come to us as fire to enlighten, search, and burn.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then through the fire He becomes electrum to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, if we would gain Him as the electrum, we need to experience Him as the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually, we need to realize that nothing good dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Like Paul, we should be able to say, I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells Rom 7:18a .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The following is a partial list of the negative things that we have within us: division, strife, hatred, envy, temper, self-love, self-goals, ambition, selfishness, ego, and many other ugly, evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are full of these things, but we may have very little of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, we need the Lord to come to us and burn away all these negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After these things have been burned out, the electrum, the redeeming God, will remain in us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No matter how clear our sky is and no matter how much we may have the throne in our sky, we still need the Lord s presence as the fire which enlightens, searches, and burns so that we may have Him remaining in us as electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the Lord s visitation with us, and this is the Lord s move with us and on us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is a great blessing to be under the Lord s visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord comes to us as a consuming fire, and we gain Him as electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Often there is no need for us to declare that we have such a God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When others are with us, they will be able to sense that we have the electrum, the redeeming God, remaining with us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They may also have the impression that we are not light but are persons of weight.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are weighty with electrum, weighty with the Lamb-God.</S>
