As we read through the Scriptures, we find the serpent is not only mentioned in Genesis, but also in other books of the Bible
In Revelation 12 and 20 we find that Satan has various names the dragon, the old serpent, the Devil, and Satan
The only way to answer this question is to consult the third chapter of Genesis where the serpent is first mentioned
The Lord told him that his human spirit needed to be reborn of the Holy Spirit, for 'that which is born of the Spirit is spirit'
Not many Christians have observed that in His conversation with Nicodemus the Lord pointed that gentleman to the serpent
Although Nicodemus was a gentleman, a teacher, and a 'teacher of Israel,' the Lord indicated that he was a serpent
The Lord seemed to be saying to him, 'Your fathers were all bitten by poisonous serpents, and the poison of the serpents entered into them
Everyone who had been poisoned by the serpents and who looked to the brass serpent lifted up on the pole lived'
You must realize that you are one of the people who has been poisoned by the serpent and that you have the serpentine nature within you
Nearly all Christians have seen the eternal life in John 3:16, but not many have seen the serpent in John 3:14
In Genesis 315 the serpent is a little seed in the Gospel of John this seed grows and in the book of Revelation this seed becomes a harvest
We all must be on the alert because Satan, the one who tempted and damaged the first generation of mankind, is now within us
In His explanation of the parable of the tares in Matthew 13, the Lord Jesus used the term 'the sons of the wicked one'
As children of the Devil, people who have been born of the serpent, we all have the serpentine nature and life
Apparently little children are sweet; however, the more they grow, the more the serpentine nature within them is exposed
If we did not have such a record as Matthew 16, no one would believe that Peter, a leading apostle, could have become Satan
Some Christians think to themselves, 'After we are saved and are in the Body of Christ, Satan has nothing to do with us'
As all the fundamental teachers agree, this woman also refers to Mary, the mother of Jesus, because the seed of the woman was the Lord Jesus
The woman has a threefold significance, not only signifying Eve and the virgin Mary, but also the woman revealed in Revelation 12
The sun signified Jacob, Joseph's father; the moon signified Joseph's mother; and the eleven stars signified Joseph's brothers
According to the Bible, the people of God can be classified into three categories: the patriarchs, Israel, and the church
Now we can see that this woman is composed of the patriarchs, Israel, including Mary, the mother of Jesus, and all the church people
In the following verse it says that after the rapture of the manchild there will be a period of 'a thousand two hundred and threescore days'
The 'one week' of Daniel 9:27 specifies an era of seven years considered by all Bible teachers as the period of the great tribulation
After the rapture of the manchild to the throne of God, only the last half of the last seven years will be left
The manchild in Revelation 12 certainly is the complete fulfillment of the prophecy regarding the seed of the woman in Genesis 3:15
Firstly we have an individual mother with an individual seed, but eventually we have a corporate mother with a corporate manchild
When this seed of the woman was on earth, Satan, the serpent, was the strong man, and the Lord exercised His authority to bind him
Peter says that we were regenerated not by a corrupted or a corrupting seed but by an incorruptible seed the living and abiding Word of God
The Apostle John says Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God
The writer does not ask Christ, the Desire of nations, to come to die on the cross for us, but to 'Fix in us Thy humble home'
We all must praise the Lord that He has fixed His humble home in us and that He is now bruising the head of the serpent within us
Revelation 2:26-27 is a quotation from Psalm 2, a prophecy concerning Christ that predicts His rule over the nations
In the fulfillment in Revelation 2:26-27 the overcomers are revealed as the ones who will rule over the nations with a rod of iron
According to Revelation 20:4-6, we will also be co-kings with Christ to rule with Him in the millennial kingdom
