A COVERING CANOPY OF GLORY<br>AND AN OVERSHADOWING TABERNACLE OF GRACE</H2><P>There are two pairs of what Christ is in Isaiah 4. The first pair is the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth. The second pair is in verses 5 and 6 where Christ is seen as a covering canopy of glory and an overshadowing tabernacle of grace. The second pair is the issue of the first pair and is produced by the first pair. The canopy is covering, and the tabernacle is overshadowing. The canopy is of the divine glory, and the tabernacle is of Christ's grace in His humanity. When Christ was incarnated, He was full of grace and the disciples beheld His glory (John 1:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A.

Being the Divine Glory<br>Covering All the Interests of Jehovah God<br>in His Holy Mountain</H2><P>Christ as a covering canopy of glory is the divine glory covering all the interests of Jehovah God in His holy mountain (Isa. 4:5). The holy mountain is Mount Zion. God's temple was on Mount Zion, and God's people were there having all kinds of convocations. These convocations, these meetings of God's people, were the interests of God on the earth. God's interests on the earth need such a covering canopy of glory.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_161.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_163.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 162</div><br></body></html>
