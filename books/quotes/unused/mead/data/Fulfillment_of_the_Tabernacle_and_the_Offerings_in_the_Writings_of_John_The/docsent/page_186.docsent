   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN 16 Scripture Reading: John 12:19-29; 13:31; 14:13; 15:8; 17:1-5, 22</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider further the sign of the divine glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we consider this sign, we need to pay attention to a number of verses in the Gospel of John that speak of glory or glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE GLORIFICATION OF THE SON OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First we come to John 12:19-29.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to John 12, when the Lord Jesus went up to Jerusalem for the feast of Passover, He received a great welcome.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because the crowd went out to meet Him, the Pharisees said to one another, "You see that you are profiting nothing; behold, the world has gone after him" v. 19 . Then certain Greeks came to Philip and told him that they wanted to see Jesus vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Philip and Andrew spoke to the Lord concerning this v. 22 . From the human point of view, this seemed to be a golden time for the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 12:23 we have the Lord's response to the situation: "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here we have the first mention of the glorification concerning which the Lord later prayed in chapter seventeen.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually, the matter of glorification begins in 12:23 and continues through the Lord's prayer for glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 23 the Lord told His disciples that the hour had come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As verse 24 indicates, for the Son of Man to be glorified is for Him to have His divine element, His divine life, released from within the shell of His humanity to produce many believers in resurrection, just as a grain of wheat releases its life element by falling into the ground and dying in order to bear much fruit and thereby bring forth many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, in verse 24 the Lord says, "Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What, then, does it mean for the Lord Jesus to be glorified?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For the Lord to be glorified is for Him to die and be resurrected in order to bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that the bearing of fruit is His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 23 indicates clearly that the Lord was concerned for His glorification, and verse 24 explains what this glorification is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord was glorified by dying as a grain of wheat and then growing up in resurrection to produce many grains, that is, to bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These grains are actually the believers who are constituted into the house, the vine, and the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The crucial point, and the point we are now emphasizing, is that the thought of glorification, which is the subject of the Lord's prayer in chapter seventeen, begins in 12:23.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 12:28 the Lord prayed, "Father, glorify Your name."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is similar to the Lord's prayer in 17:1: "Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These two prayers are both for the same matter the matter of glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Knowing that the Father would be glorified in the Son's glorification, the Lord prayed first that the Father would glorify His name and then that He would glorify the Son so that the Son might glorify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to 12:28, after the Lord prayed, a voice came out of heaven, saying, "I have glorified it, and will glorify it again."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The crowd heard the voice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, they did not understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some said that it had thundered, and others said that an angel had spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In chapter thirteen the Lord again speaks regarding glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After Judas went out, the Lord said, "Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Shortly after speaking these words, the Lord went on to give the lengthy message recorded in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, this message began in 13:31, which speaks of the glorification of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, the Lord's message and His prayer are both on the subject of glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In His message to His disciples the Lord spoke concerning glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then in His prayer He prayed concerning the divine glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because chapters twelve through seventeen are concerned with the divine glorification, it would not be fitting to change the subject in the middle and bring in the thought of a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What does a heavenly mansion have to do with the Son's glorification?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The building of a heavenly mansion has nothing to do with divine glorification.</S>
