   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Attempting to Teach the Lord 1 "This Ointment Could Have Been...Given to the Poor"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sometimes men were not only dissatisfied with the Lord; they even tried to teach the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The disciples said, "Why has this waste of the ointment been made?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For this ointment could have been sold for over three hundred denarii and given to the poor" Mark 14:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They were teaching the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The disciples could think of another way to dispose of the ointment sell it and give it to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the Lord knew what Mary was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He said that she was doing a noble deed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord never does one thing or says one thing that He is not clear about.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He needs no one to correct Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only a foolish man will try to correct the Lord or teach Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2 "God Be Merciful to You!"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the Lord indicated to the disciples that He had to go to Jerusalem, Peter said, "God be merciful to You, Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What did the Lord say?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He said, "Get behind Me, Satan!"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Matt 16:21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Peter wanted to teach the Lord, but it did not work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the contrary, he only exposed his own foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3 "What Sort of Woman This Is"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once the Lord Jesus ate at the house of Simon the Pharisee.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A woman stood at the Lord's feet weeping, wetting His feet with her tears, and wiping them with the hair of her head.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Simon thought in his heart, "This man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what sort of woman this is who is touching Him" Luke 7:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here we should pay attention to Simon's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He seemed to be saying, "Look what kind of woman she is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How can You allow her to come near to You at Your feet?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although Simon did not open his mouth, the Lord knew what he was thinking, and He spoke about different kinds of forgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In effect the Lord was saying, "You, Simon, did not wash My feet, because you have experienced little forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This woman experienced much forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the reason she wet My feet with her tears."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once we have such an impression, we will realize how foolish it is for man to try to be the Lord's counselor!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the same time, we will know a Jesus of Nazareth that we did not know before.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord Likes to See Men</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Asking Great Things from Him</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In studying the Gospels carefully, we find that the Lord took pleasure in men asking Him for great favor.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The greater men's requests were, the happier the Lord was to answer them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>1 "If You Are Willing, You Can Cleanse Me"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Consider the story of the leper in Mark 1.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to Jewish regulations, a leper could not come in contact with any man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Any person who came in contact with a leper was defiled by uncleanness Lev 13 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here a leper came to see the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The very act of coming to the Lord was quite presumptuous.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should have a strong impression of this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As soon as a leper appeared on the scene, we probably would react.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Unless a man was ready to sacrifice himself and give his all, he would jump back at the sight of a leper and say, "You are hurting me!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I cannot touch you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why do you come to me?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the leper came to the Lord, he did not ask whether the Lord could cleanse him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Instead he said, "If You are willing, You can cleanse me" Mark 1:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This was a very piercing statement.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He put all the burden on the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It was all a matter of whether or not the Lord was willing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This was not an ordinary prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It was something that put the Lord's heart to the test.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord simply could have said, "Be clean," and the leper would have been cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But the Lord did not merely utter a word; He identified Himself with the leper's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He touched the leper with His hand and said, "I am willing; be cleansed!" v. 41 . If he was not cleansed, the Lord would become defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What a risk this would have involved!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must have the proper impression of the story before we can understand the actual picture.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord was ready to put Himself into the leper's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He joined His holiness and purity to the leper.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Either both would be clean or both would be defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Either both had to go outside the camp or both could return to the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord was ready to spend, and what a spending that was!</S>
