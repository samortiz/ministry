   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LIVING BY THE FAITH OF THE SON OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The other part of Galatians 2:20 is also very important: And the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From this point forward, we live by faith in the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We believe daily that the Son of God lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We say to the Lord, I believe that You are living for me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You are my life; I believe that You are living in me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we believe this way, we live this way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No matter what happens, we will no longer make any move.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The fundamental lesson of Romans 7 is that we should not make any resolutions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The basic teaching is that it is better that we not will to do anything, because such a willing is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since it is useless to do anything by ourselves, we should simply stop all our moves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The purpose of Satan s temptation is not only for us to sin but also for the old man within us to move.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When temptation comes, we must learn to refuse to move and to say to the Lord, This is not my business.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is Your business.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I look to You to live in my place.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Always learn to look to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Never try to move on your own.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are saved through faith, not through works.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same way our life is based on faith, not on works.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We were saved through looking to the Lord alone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today we live through looking to Him as well.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Just as salvation is accomplished by the Lord, without the involvement of any of our work, so also our living on earth today is a living of the Lord Himself, without the need for any involvement of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must look up to the Lord who saves us and say, It is You alone, not I.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After we say this, if we still move on our own, we are saying this in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must stop our own activity before these words can be meaningful in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Brothers and sisters, we must remember that failure comes not because we do too little, but because we do too much.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As long as man keeps on working, God s grace will not operate and man s sins will not be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the same way, as long as man is occupied with his own work, trying to do everything by himself, Christ s life will not be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a rule.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The cross will not produce any effect on those who trust in their own work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we insist on our own goodness, we will not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But when we turn away from ourselves to the Lord, we will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The same is true today.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we are working and operating, instead of the cross working in us and the life of Christ operating in us, this speaking will be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must learn to condemn ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must confess that we will never overcome by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not will and do not try to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Simply look to the Lord and say, I look to You as the One who is living in me!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Live on my behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I look to You for victory!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I look to You to express Your life through me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we say this, the Lord will accomplish it for us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if we frustrate our faith by our own work, the Lord can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to settle this question once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to believe daily and speak to the Lord daily in a definite way: Lord, I am useless!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I take Your cross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Lord, keep me from moving.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Lord, be my Master and live out of me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we can believe, hope, and trust in this way, we will be able to testify daily, It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives.</S>
