<h2 class="head1">BEARING THE CROSS</h2><p>Let me mention one more thing. As long as we are righteous in ourselves, we should be contented; it should matter little whether or not others know about our righteousness. Those who are constantly trying to justify their attitude before others do not know the cross. As long as we are right in ourselves, that is good enough; it should matter little whether others say that we are right. As long as we are right in our attitude, that is good enough; it should matter little whether others say that we are good or bad. The principle and standard of the Christian life are not right and wrong. The standard of our living is the bearing of the cross. The bearing of the cross is the unique standard of our living. The whole issue rests on whether or not we are bearing the cross, not on right and wrong. Before the Lord, are we willing to empty ourselves to suffer loss?</p><p>The basic principle in managing the church is not in determining right and wrong for others. We should have only one standard: If there is the bearing of the cross, it is right; if there is not the bearing of the cross, it is wrong. Forget about whether or not others are right or wrong. Just ask whether or not they are bearing the cross. The cross is the greatest "wrong" in the whole universe; it is a terrible "wrong." Jesus Christ the Son of God had no sin, yet He was crucified on the cross. Our sins are too deep, yet we do not have to die. We do not have to shed our blood; we are freely forgiven and freely saved. Do we not realize that this is the greatest wrong? If it were a matter of right and wrong, then the most right thing to do would be for us to go to the cross. We have sinned and deserve to die. Hence, bearing the cross means accepting all the wrongs, not complaining, not reasoning, and being filled with joy all the time. The world can endure, but it endures by swallowing its grudges. There is no joy in such endurance. But we can accept unjust treatment with much rejoicing in our heart.</p><h2 class="head1">GIVING UP EVERYTHING</h2><p>I would like to mention one more thing. The mind of Christ Jesus is one which gives up everything. Those who give up everything have the mind of Christ Jesus. May God be merciful and gracious to us, and may we be those who willingly give up all things, those who gladly suffer losses. A Christian should give ground to others; he should lay the tracks for others to go through. In speaking of the trespass offering, Leviticus 6:5 tells us that one should add one-fifth to what is owed when paying back that which is owed. We should learn to be those who suffer loss. We should put ourselves under the trampling of others. Christ Jesus did not need to be a slave. Yet He put off the form of God and took the form of a slave. He relinquished what He rightfully owned and received what He should not have received. In the days ahead may we learn more to be those who suffer persecution willingly and who remain joyful. If it pleases God to put us in a certain place, we will accept it with joy and gladness, because bearing the cross is more important than all the glory and position the world can afford. What does bearing the cross mean? It is described in the words: "He saved others; Himself He cannot save" (Mark 15:31). A true bearer of the cross does not save himself and his own glory. In particular, he does not save his own feelings. God will bless all those who are willing to go this way.</p>
