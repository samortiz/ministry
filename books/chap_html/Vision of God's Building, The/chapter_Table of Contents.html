Scripture opens with God’s creation and finishes with His building. God’s creation is for His building, and God’s building is the ultimate consummation which fulfills His purpose in creation. The principal means for accomplishing God’s creation is His divine power. But the main element utilized for God’s building is the divine life. We were born into God’s creation, but we are reborn for God’s building, which is the church, the ultimate consummation of which is the New Jerusalem. This building is of life, by life, and with life. Regeneration in life is the beginning, growth in life is the continuation, and maturity in life is the consummation of life for this building of God. Eventually, in the New Jerusalem, God’s ultimate building, there is a river of life flowing for those who participate in God’s building to drink, and the tree of life growing in the river of life for them to eat. These signify that the building of God is produced, nourished and sustained by God Himself and with God Himself in Christ as life to us. Hence, for us to partake of God’s building, there is no other way but by life and with life.<br><br>Life and building are the two key words in the entire Bible. Life is God in Christ as the living content, and building is the corporate expression of the Triune God. What a pity that both life and building are almost altogether neglected by today’s Christianity! For the proper church life, both must be fully recovered. In recent years the Lord has begun this recovery in the U.S.A. We have full assurance that He will swiftly accomplish it to the uttermost for the fulfillment of His purpose.<br><br>The following chapters are messages given in the winter conference of 1964 at Los Angeles. They are maintained in the simple spoken form. May the Lord use them for the building up of His seeking ones.<br><br>Witness Lee</p></td></tr></table></div>
