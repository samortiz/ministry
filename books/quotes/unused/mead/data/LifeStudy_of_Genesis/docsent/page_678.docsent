   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Joseph had the position and the power to do whatever he desired.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, he did not do anything for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>More than forty years ago, I heard someone say that the strongest thing is to be able not to do something that you can do.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You have the power, the position, and the opportunity to do a certain thing, yet you still do not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I became familiar with the story of Joseph many years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in the past I did not see that after Joseph had been enthroned to be the ruler of Egypt, he did not use his power to see his father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After Joseph was enthroned, he did nothing to rescue himself from being alone, even though he had been separated from his father for thirteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the brothers first came down to him, he still did not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Joseph had the power and the position to do something about his situation, but he did not do what he had the power to do.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that he was the most powerful person, one who has the strength not to do what he is able to do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Joseph was such a person because he was under God's hand, under God's restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During the first nine years of his rule in Egypt, Joseph must have contacted the Lord again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps as he prayed to the Lord regarding the possibility of visiting his father, the Lord instructed him to do nothing about it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Week after week Joseph might have prayed, "Lord, is now the time for me to do something to have my father brought here?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I believe that the Lord said to him, "No, this is not the time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is no need for you to do anything to fulfill your dream.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Simply wait and allow Me to do it."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By means of his prayer Joseph might have been confirmed in believing that his dreams were of God and that God Himself would fulfill them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because there was no need for him to do anything, Joseph remained silent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He had the strength not to do what he had the power to do.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When his brothers came to Egypt the first time, he did nothing to have his father brought to him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even when the time was right for his father to come to him in Egypt, Joseph did not go out to meet him on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I believe that this was the result of his being under the Lord's restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Joseph knew that there was no need for him to do anything to fulfill his dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the real denial of the self and the genuine bearing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To bear the cross means that you refrain from doing what you have the power to do.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You are qualified and empowered to do everything necessary to fulfill your desire, yet you refrain from doing so.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A person like this is the strongest person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The strongest person is not the one who is able to do something, but the one who is able not to do what he has the power to do.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This self-denial is the unique way to usher in God's kingdom and to realize the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As we shall see in the next message, the kingdom life came in through Joseph's ability not to do what he had the power to do.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to be such people today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no doubt that, in ourselves, we cannot be such people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our life is not the kind of life that has the power not to do what it is able to do.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we have the opportunity to do something, we simply do it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the life of Christ has the power not to do what it is capable of doing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This fact is the key to the four Gospels and to the life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Often He had the position, the power, and the right environment to do many things, but he also had the power not to do those things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, He could have asked the Father to send twelve legions of angels to rescue Him; yet He had the strength not to do this Matt 26:53 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This life of self-denial, of bearing the cross, is the life that ushers in the kingdom.</S>
