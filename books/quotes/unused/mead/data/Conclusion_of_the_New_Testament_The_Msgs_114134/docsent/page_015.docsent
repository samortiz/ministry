   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Fellowship denotes the partaking of, the participation in, God s Son.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This fellowship is universal and mutual.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The mutuality of this fellowship is not only between the believers and the Triune God but also among the believers themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The New Testament illustrates this fellowship by a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Gospels the Lord Jesus said that a feast had been prepared and that people were invited to it Matt 22:1-3; Luke 14:16-17 .</S>

   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We have been called by God into such a mutuality between us and the Son of God.</S>
