<h1 class="title">ISSUE NO. 18</h1><h2 class="head4">The Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 323, Shanghai,<br />June 1939</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Watchman Nee</h2><p>The Lord willing, my ship will arrive in Marseille tomorrow. I will probably stay in India and Singapore for a little while before returning to Shanghai....In reading The Open Door, I was happy on the one hand and worried on the other hand. If the co-workers do not have the basic qualifications for work, will the future of the work be different from the past? May the Lord grant us grace. You may have done much traveling, but are you sure of what you are doing? Everything depends on the knowledge of the cross in dealing with the natural strength.</p><p>Watchman Nee, May 22</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Witness Lee</h2><p>I am now on my way to Tsingtao by steamer with Brothers Chao Chi-gwang and Liu Bei-min. The Lord willing, I will stay in Tsingtao for half a month. Then I will travel along the Tsingtao-Tsinan Railway route to visit the brothers and sisters in Gao-Mi, Wei-Shien, Ching-Chow, and Tsinan. The Lord willing, I will return to Chefoo by the middle of July. The Lord's table meeting in Chefoo has now been subdivided into two places, one in Shuang-He-Li and the other in Brother Chao Xu-dong's house in West Hill. The condition of these meetings is quite good. I feel that there are two things pressing before us. One is the perfecting of the young workers, and the other is how much a local church has come up to God's standard. We cannot say that some people do not have the call, but it is too early for them to touch the work. It then becomes a real problem as to how to lead them on and perfect them. The more the work grows, the more we will see people turning to the Lord, and the greater this problem will become. As for the local churches, thank the Lord that He has granted us blessing in many places. We truly thank the Lord for the love of the brothers and sisters and their zeal toward Him. But we are still not up to the standard that the Lord has shown us. Is there a definite date for Brother Nee's arrival yet?</p><p>Brother Witness Lee on the Shun-Tien steamer, June 5</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Kaung and Brother Weigh<br />after Arriving in Chungking</h2><p>We left K'un-ming by bus on March 3 and arrived in Kuei-yang on the sixth. In Kuei-yang we had a few evenings of special meetings. The brothers and sisters in Kuei-yang meet every Lord's Day afternoon at the house of Brother Liu Jing-si for prayer. The Lord willing, they will soon have the Lord's table. We left Kuei-yang on May 11 and arrived in Chungking on the fourteenth. It was the Lord's Day, and we were able to remember the Lord with a few brothers in the afternoon. Recently, most of the brothers and sisters have been scattered everywhere. Under such circumstances, our work has been limited to personal visitations, home gospel meetings, and mutual exhortations. The Lord willing, we will go next Monday to visit the brothers and sisters in Hsu-Fu or Ch'eng-tu. Please pray for us.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Stephen Kaung and K.H.Weigh, May 16</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Hu Yi-min</h2><p>Presently, I am in working in areas around Li-Suh such as Loh-Toh-Loh, Yen-Wah-Loh, and Na-Bai-Loh. Every evening five to ten people come to listen. Once I spent sixteen to seventeen days between Yeh-Ji and Yen-Za. Although reaching that area involves only a four-day journey from Yeh-Ji, the inhabitants are all Sikang natives. They are not as willing to receive the word as the Li-Suh natives. If Brother Hsu comes, we can rent a house in this area and work for a longer period of time. During the next few months I will not be able to travel or do anything further. I wish I could be free from the burdens of family and the bondage of this world so that I might glorify the Lord's name all my life. My respectful greetings to the brothers and sisters in Shanghai.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Hu I-min, April 29</p>
