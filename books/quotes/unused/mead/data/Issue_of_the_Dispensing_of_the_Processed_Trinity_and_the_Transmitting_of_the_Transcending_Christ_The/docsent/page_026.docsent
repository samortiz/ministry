   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When I came to this country in the sixties, I observed the hippies with their long hair, beards, and wild clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A number of young people who came into the recovery in the sixties were like this.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While I was ministering the word, some of them sat on the front row in their bare feet.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But thank the Lord, they all got saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After a short time, their clothing began to change, their long hair and beards were cut off, and they began to wear shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Who adjusted them?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I did not say a word to them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They changed from being hippies to gentlemen because of the sealing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The sealing Spirit moves within us to soak us and saturate us, transforming us metabolically.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This sealing is unto a result, and this result is the redemption of our vile body, the transfiguration of our vile body, which is our glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the first fourteen verses of Ephesians 1 we see the threefold dispensing, from the Father's choosing to our being brought into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the completion of God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God brings us fallen sinners from the heap of collapse into Christ to be sealed under the gradual, fine dispensing day by day for the full course of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, as we remain under this dispensing, we will be matured and made ready to be transfigured in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then we will be in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such a dispensing issues in a spiritual, divine constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This constitution is the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church is not an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is an organism, and this organism is a constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is constituted with the Triune God mingling Himself with His chosen people in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Ephesians 4:4-6 there is a record or a portrait of this constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 4 says, "One Body and one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The one Body is the structure, the frame, and within this frame there is the one Spirit, who is the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The one Lord is the element v. 5 , and the one Father is the source v. 6 . The Spirit as the essence, the Lord as the element, and the Father as the source are constituted into this frame of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A group of chosen human beings becomes the very structure, the very frame, of this constitution, and they are constituted with the Triune God as the essence, element, and source.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the universe there is such a wonderful constitution, and this constitution is the church as the organism of the Triune God for Him to move, to act, to fulfill His purpose, and to express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We human beings created by God became fallen, so God came to redeem us to carry out His choosing and accomplish His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then He dispensed Himself as everything into our being to create a spiritual, heavenly, divine constitution, that is, the Body of Christ as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is wonderful, yet there is something more.</S>
