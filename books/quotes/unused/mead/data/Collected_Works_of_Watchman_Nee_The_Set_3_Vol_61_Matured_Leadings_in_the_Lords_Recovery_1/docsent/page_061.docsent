   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Whole Body Preaching the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Presently, the highest interest the bank pays is forty-five percent.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we can have a fifty percent increase in our gospel, every brother and sister will bring in half a person in a month.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that every two months we will bring in one person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In two months there will be one hundred forty thousand saints in China.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In four months we will have two hundred eighty thousand saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that in a few years' time, the gospel will spread throughout all the big cities in China.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If our preaching is isolated, we will never meet the need of the gospel in today's world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The whole church has to rise up to preach in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>May the Lord ignite the flame in China, and may it grow and spread.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>May the church be as absolute as the early church in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This fire will then spread to the West.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can procrastinate no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do not take this way, our independent gospel work will not get us very far in ten or twenty more years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1928 there were four hundred thousand Protestant communicants.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By 1948 the number only increased to four hundred eighty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 1928 there were eight hundred thousand Catholics.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By 1948 the number increased to 2.3 million.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What are we Protestants doing?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why has our number increased so slowly?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is truly our shame!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today the Chinese population grows at the rate of two persons every five seconds.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The number that we bring in cannot even match the rate of birth in China.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Protestantism has been in China for over one hundred twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After a century and a half of preaching, our number is still only five hundred thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Of this number, many are nominal members.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we compare ourselves with the early church, we cannot help but be ashamed!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is indeed foolish for God's children to not give themselves in a desperate way in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Please forgive me for saying a seemingly angry word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all think that the present political climate makes it hard for the church to preach the gospel, but how do we know that this situation is not sovereignly arranged by God?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How do we know that this is not for the purpose of turning the church to the Lord's will?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What the Lord could not gain through His calling, perhaps He is gaining through the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the Lord cannot move His children through love, He can turn them through chastening.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The rebuking rod often will do what the voice of love cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not learn to coordinate together for the gospel in the present situation, God may allow the devil's hand to move further, and the situation of the church may worsen still.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Consecration and Coordination</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our consecration must be specific.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more specific our consecration is, the better it is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Consecration of the heart is an abstract thing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can say that our heart is consecrated, but in actuality, our heart may still be with us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our heart can only be truly on the altar when our entire body and our possessions are on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Romans 12 is the clearest, most absolute, accurate, and definite passage in the entire Bible on consecration, and it speaks of coordination at the end of the chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a man is not willing to consecrate himself, how can he be coordinated with others?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not think that we are consecrating when we offer up a little money and material goods.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Consecration means offering up our entire person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only this will bring us into coordination with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we hold back anything for ourselves, we are merely practicing a kind of individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are so individualistic, how can we coordinate with others?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to coordinate with others, we have to deny ourselves and live in peace with all men, if possible v. 18 . Many people, however, drop their countenance, become angry, or murmur over a little money.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They argue and squabble until their faces turn red over what belongs to them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we hand over everything, it is easy for us to coordinate with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Coordination is spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the church in Foochow handed itself over, its number multiplied manyfold.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Chuenchow had been meeting with the same number around ninety for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A few months ago the leading brothers handed themselves over, and within a month the number increased by ninety-six.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now there are ninety-nine candidates who are preparing to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There are still four hundred others waiting to be interviewed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Handing ourselves over will afford the brothers and sisters a way to get into the gospel business in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many people are willing to put their whole heart into a secular business but are very indifferent about the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They work mindlessly and do not apply any seriousness to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We can only give our whole heart to the work when we have handed ourselves over.</S>
