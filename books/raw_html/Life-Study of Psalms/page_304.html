<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Considering God's Law<br>to Be His Word</H2><P>Verses 17 and 18 say, "Deal bountifully with Your servant that I may live/And keep Your word./Open my eyes that I may behold/Wondrous things out of Your law." This indicates that the psalmist considered God's law to be His word. This is indicated also by what the psalmist says in verses 28 and 29: "My soul melts because of grief;/Strengthen me according to Your word./Remove from me the way of falsehood,/And graciously grant me Your law." These verses prove that the psalmist thought of God's law as His living and loving word breathed out of God's mouth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. God's Word Being Sweeter<br>than Honey to Their Mouth</H2><P>For the psalmists God's word was sweeter than honey to their mouth (v. 103).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. God's Word Being More Precious<br>than Fine Gold to Them</H2><P>"Therefore I love Your commandments/More than gold, indeed, more than fine gold" (v. 127). This indicates that to the psalmists God's word was more precious than fine gold.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. God's Word Being a Lamp to Their Feet<br>and a Light to Their Path</H2><P>God's word was a lamp to the psalmists' feet and a light to their path (v. 105).</P>
