<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. As the Sower&#151;<br>the Distributor of the Divine Life</H2><P>We all know that Jesus Christ loves us and that He came to be our Savior. It is good that He is a Savior, but He is more than a Savior. He told us that He is the Sower (Matt. 13:3, 37). A sower sows the seed of life. Therefore, as the Sower the Lord Jesus is the Distributor of the divine life. He came that we might have life and have it abundantly (John 10:10b). But by what way did He come that we might have life? It was by His coming and sowing Himself into us. He is the Sower, the Distributor of the divine life, and because He has sown Himself into us, we all have this life. What is it to be saved? Some may say that to be saved is to be forgiven of our sins. This answer is correct, but it is not adequate. To be saved is not merely this. To be saved is to get Jesus into us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Sow&#151;to Impart, to Dispense&#151;Himself</H2><P>The Sower distributes the divine life into us by sowing, imparting, and dispensing. He did not merely sow, but He also imparted the divine life, to make sure that He got into you. And He did not merely impart, but He also dispenses the divine life in a fine way bit by bit. Since the day you were saved, Christ has been dispensing the divine life bit by bit every day. He cannot dispense too much into you at one time; otherwise, you would "burst."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. As the Life Seed of Wheat, Signifying the Word</H2><P>Christ sows, imparts, and dispenses Himself as the life seed of wheat. This life seed of wheat signifies the word (Matt. 13:3, 19-23; Mark 4:14; John 6:68). One day the Lord Jesus saw Peter fishing, and He spoke something to him: "Come after Me" (Matt. 4:19). Then Peter came, and he was caught. From that day on Jesus could never get out of Peter. By His word He imparts Himself into us as a seed. A seed is precious and tiny. But after it has been sown into the earth for two or three months, something comes up. This is the seed's growing. So it is also with Christ: first, He came; then, He sowed Himself. He sowed Himself as the life seed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. INTO THE HUMAN HEART AS THE GROWING EARTH</H2><P>Christ is the seed, and He sowed Himself into our heart (Matt. 13:19b). The human heart is the growing earth. In farming, the seed is planted into the earth and is mingled with the element of the earth. The seed grows together with the earth. This produces the plant. This is very meaningful. Christ has sown Himself into us, and both He and we grow together. He as the life seed has a certain kind of element, and we as the growing earth also have a certain kind of element, and the two mingle together and grow together to be one plant. This is the Body of Christ constituted with the divine life mingled with humanity. Today there is so much talk about what the Body of Christ is. But mostly this is doctrinal talk. The real Body, the Body of Christ in reality, is a plant growing out of Christ as the life seed sown into the human heart as the growing earth.</P>
