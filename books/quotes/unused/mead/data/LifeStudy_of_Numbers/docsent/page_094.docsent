   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The censers of the two hundred fifty men who had sinned against their souls, that is, against themselves, were made into hammered plates as a covering for the altar, as a sign to the sons of Israel and a reminder to them, so that no one who was a stranger, who was not of the descendants of Aaron, would draw near to burn incense before Jehovah, lest he become as Korah and as his company vv.</S>
