   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRACTICE OF ABIDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can we fulfill the Lord's word to abide in Him that He may abide in us?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christians today are prone to pay attention to outward formalities, rituals, and ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They neglect this crucial, spiritual matter of abiding in Christ and letting Him abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because the Lord's word here is mysterious and abstract, it is easy to pass it by.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we had not been grafted into Christ and had Him worked into us, we would still be fallen persons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>John 15, however, indicates that we are organically one with Christ the way a vine and its branches are one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We no longer need to live as fallen persons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may abide in Christ, and have Him abide in us!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John 3:6 mentions two spirits: "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have a spirit within, which can be born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The two spirits must be brought together by spiritual birth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, "He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To abide in the Lord, then, is to be one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In our daily practice, however, we disregard this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose I encounter a brother whom I have not seen for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I begin to converse with him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How is he getting along?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How is his family?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What has he been doing?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We easily talk on and on, but the whole time I am altogether in myself; none of my conversation is in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Though there is nothing outwardly sinful in what we say, I have left the Lord aside and acted in myself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nonetheless, I have no sense that I am off.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I do not condemn myself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If I talked to a brother in a mean way, however, my conscience would trouble me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If I lied to him, or told him what a poor character he had, or said that I could not stand being with him, then I would have to go to the Lord and confess.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I would also have to go back to the brother, apologize, and ask his forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the latter case we feel condemned, but in the former case we have no realization that we need forgiveness for acting in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How many of our waking hours do we spend being one spirit with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Does our conscience bother us when we are apart from Him, acting and speaking in ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may read the Bible yet be apart from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The time when we pray is when we are most likely to be one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Of course, we must pray properly till we are in our spirit; then our time in prayer is spent with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The rest of the day, however, we spend mostly in ourselves and by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A number of times I have been talking with someone, when suddenly I was reminded in my spirit that I was conversing according to myself, not by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I would stop talking and pray inwardly, "Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am not with You.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am not living by You.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead of abiding in You and letting You abide in me, I leave You aside.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am acting by myself."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not that what I was saying or doing was wrong in itself; my words and my conduct seemed blameless.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>My right words and my right actions were in myself, however, not in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are Christians, yet our Christian life is not by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are Christians, yet we live by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are Christians, yet we do not live in our spirit by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because this crucial matter of abiding was lost, John's mending ministry came in to restore.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He mended this tear by reminding us that we are no longer by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now Christ is within us, and we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He and we are one organism.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are His branches, grafted into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He lives in us, and we must live in Him.</S>
