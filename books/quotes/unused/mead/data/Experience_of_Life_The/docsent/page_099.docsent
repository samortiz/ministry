   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The same principle applies to our understanding of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God is an extremely wise and intelligent God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, in order to understand His will, human wisdom and intelligence are required.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A stupid person can never understand the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, neither can a person who depends only upon his own wisdom and intelligence understand the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is necessary is that man have intelligence, wisdom, and clear thinking, and that he put all these beneath the cross, allowing the cross to put the stamp of death upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This kind of person has his own mind, wisdom, and thoughts, yet he does not do things according to himself, for himself, or depending upon himself; he is used only according to God, for God, and depending upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He does not have his own aim or elements of his own self, much less his own scheming hand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He relies only upon the mercy of God; he waits for His visitation and seeks His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only this kind of people can understand the will of God and be clear concerning His guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From this we learn that natural ability and capability do not come to naught after having been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The brokenness and putting to death by the cross is not the final step.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The real death of the cross always brings in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jesus of Nazareth was put to death on the cross, yet Christ was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After Genesis 35, Jacob was completely dealt with and finished, yet a matured Israel came forth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, the dealing of the cross always brings in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more one's capabilities are dealt with by the cross, the more capable one becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The more one's wisdom is dealt with by the cross, the wiser one becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, this capability and wisdom are in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason, on one hand, we encourage people to read and study the Bible, to exercise their mind and foresight, and to learn how to behave as human beings, how to handle things, and how to work, to the end that they may be capable.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the other hand, we always tell people that education as well as capability are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we say this, we mean that these must be broken and become resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These two aspects apparently contradict each other, but for us they are practical and absolutely necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How can we differentiate natural ability from resurrected ability?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How can we tell which is an inherent ability and which is the ability that has been broken?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are seven points of comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We shall look first at natural ability:</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, all natural ability is selfish, and all its schemes and devices are for the sake of self.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Second, all natural ability is mingled with the elements of flesh and temper; therefore, when it is disapproved, it becomes provoked.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Third, all natural ability involves craftiness and maneuvering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Fourth, all natural ability contains pride and makes oneself feel capable, thereby resulting in boasting and self-glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Fifth, all natural ability is not under the control of the Holy Spirit and is extremely daring in doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sixth, all natural ability has no regard for the will of God; it acts entirely according to self-will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Seventh, natural ability does not rely on God and does not have to rely on God, but relies wholly upon self.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Resurrected ability is exactly the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First, all ability which has been broken and resurrected is not for self, neither does it contain any element of self.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Second, all resurrected ability is devoid of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Third, resurrected ability does not scheme.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Fourth, resurrected ability is not proud nor does it boast in itself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Fifth, resurrected ability is controlled by the Holy Spirit and does not dare to act according to our wishes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sixth, resurrected ability is for the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Seventh, resurrected ability relies upon God and does not dare to act according to self, though truly able and capable.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since we are clear now concerning the difference between natural and resurrected ability, we should examine ourselves in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we exercise our ability, is it for self or for God?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Am I making decisions on my own and acting individually and egocentrically, or am I able to stand the criticism of others and suffer their opposition?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do I employ schemes, or do I look to the grace of God?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do I give glory to God, or do I boast and glory in myself?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Am I controlled by the Holy Spirit or am I acting as I wish?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do I fulfill my own desires, or do I care for the will of God?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do I attempt to achieve the goal by any means, or do I commit all things into the hand of God, trusting Him for the outcome?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Am I depending solely on my own resources, or am I relying upon God with fear and trembling?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we examine ourselves strictly, we will discover that in our living and service, many areas are still in the natural constitution and of the old creation; therefore, we cannot bring forth fruit of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, dealing with the natural constitution is the deliverance which we need most.</S>
