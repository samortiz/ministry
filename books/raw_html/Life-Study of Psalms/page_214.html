<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD IN HIS HOUSE</H2><P>In the first section five matters are covered: God's move on the earth, God's victory in Christ, Christ's ascension, Christ's receiving the gifts, and Christ's building up the house of God. This brings us to the first item in the second section&#151;the enjoyment of God in His house (vv. 19-23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. After the Building Up of God's Dwelling Place</H2><P>The enjoyment of God in His house comes after the building up of His dwelling place, the church (v. 18b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Enjoying God Loading Us with Good</H2><P>Verse 19a says, "Blessed be the Lord, who day by day loads us with good." What is this "good" with which God is loading us every day? This good, as the "good" mentioned in Romans 8:28, does not refer to material things such as a nice home or a new car; rather, it refers to the Triune God&#151;to the dove wings gilded with silver and the pinions gilded with gold. This means that daily God is loading us with Himself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Enjoying God<br>as Our Salvation and Deliverance</H2><P>"God is our salvation./God is to us/A God of deliverance, /And to Jehovah the Lord/Belongs escape even from death" (vv. 19b-20). This reveals that in God's house we enjoy God as our salvation and deliverance; with Him are the goings forth, the way to escape, even from death. Only God can give us a way to flee death and to escape it because only God is life. When we enjoy Him as our life, we escape death. Actually, the way to go forth from death is God Himself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Enjoying God's Victory over the Enemies</H2><P>Verses 21 through 23 reveal that in God's house we also enjoy His victory over the enemies. For example, verse 21 says, "Indeed God will smash/The head of His enemies,/The hairy crown/Of him who goes about in his guiltiness."</P>
