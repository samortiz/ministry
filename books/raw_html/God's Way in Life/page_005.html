Here we would listen quietly to Your speaking. Speak to us the living word, the word of life. Lord, grace us, and speak into every one of our hearts. May You supply us, tend our wounds, heal us, and lead us on richly in the way that You desire today. Lord, operate here. Operate among and in us, that we can be free and that our spirits can be enlightened. For this, grant us the utterance, that we can explain Your need to all the people. May every word be food and supply to us.<p>O Lord Jesus, we tell You again that we love You. We treasure You. We want to follow You and exalt You forever. May Your name be exalted by the nations. May Your kingdom come, and may Your glory be manifested. May this glory be expressed among us this morning, and may You gain our worship and exaltation. Lord Jesus, may You glorify the Father’s name. Bless Your children, build Your church, and shame Your enemy. Amen.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRITUAL LIVING BEING TO LIVE CHRIST</h2><p>We have come to the second chapter, which is God’s Spirit of life becoming our way to live Christ in the spiritual living. We often talk about the spiritual living. But what actually is the spiritual living? Here we have a clear explanation: the spiritual living is simply a living that lives Christ. A spiritual living is not for us to be spiritual, but for us to live Christ. A spiritual living is not one where we do good, where we are humble, kind, or forbearing. A spiritual living is one where we live Christ. Whether or not our living is spiritual depends on whether or not we live Christ. In other words, true spirituality is Christ.<p>Who is Christ? He is the embodiment of the Triune God. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily (Col. 2:9). Outwardly speaking, Christ was a man and a Jew, one who lived on earth two thousand years ago. He was indeed a man, a noble and perfect man, but within Him He had God as His content. The fullness of God dwells bodily in Him in full measure. We all have to know that the One we follow, worship, love, and exalt is such a One. This is also the One we preach and supply to others. The name of this One is Jesus Christ.
