In this chapter we want to see the oneness of the Body of Christ.<p>Ephesians 4 and John 17 reveal that the oneness of the Body of Christ is divine. It is neither natural nor human, but something of God and something that even is God. This oneness is also organic, not humanly organic but divinely organic. The oneness of the Body of Christ is of God and also of life. This life is not the human, created life, but the divine, uncreated life. Therefore, the oneness is divinely organic and full of life. We need to be impressed with these two points: the oneness of the Body of Christ is divine, and it is divinely organic.<h2 class=head1>ONE GOD AND FATHER, ONE LORD, ONE SPIRIT, ONE ORGANISM-THE BODY OF CHRIST AS THE CHURCH OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>Ephesians 4:4-6 says, &#8220;One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.&#8221; These verses reveal that there is one God and Father, one Lord, one Spirit, and one organism-the Body of Christ as the church of the Triune God. The issue of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is the organic Body of Christ, which is the living church of the living God. The oneness of the Body of Christ is actually the triune, organic, and living God Himself.<h2 class=head2>The Uniqueness of the Triune God</h2><p>The oneness of the Body of Christ is unique because it is a oneness in the uniqueness of the Triune God. Paul speaks of the Triune God in Ephesians 4:4-6 by saying that there is one God and Father, one Lord, and one Spirit.<p>The apostle Paul&#8217;s reference to one God and Father indicates that the Father is the very source of our oneness in nature and in life. Ephesians 1 shows that God the Father has chosen us to be holy for sanctification and has predestinated us for sonship (vv. 4-5). In order for us to be holy, God must give us His holy nature. The nature of God is holiness itself. God gives us His nature of holiness to be our nature. Our being predestinated for sonship is a matter of life. For us to be God&#8217;s many sons, we must have God&#8217;s divine life. Therefore, God&#8217;s choosing and predestinating us indicate that He shares His holy nature and His divine life with us.<p>By being chosen we have God&#8217;s nature, and by being made sons of God we have God&#8217;s life. Second Peter 1:4 says that we are partakers of the divine nature. In John 3:16 the Lord Jesus said that everyone who believes in Him has eternal life. As those who believe in Him, we have the divine life. The divine nature and the divine life are of God the Father. The divine nature is included in the divine life. If there is no life, there is no nature. The divine nature is a nature of life. Therefore, when we receive the divine life, we have the divine nature. When we are enjoying and partaking of the divine nature, we are also experiencing the divine life. These two things can never be separated. God the Father as the source of the divine oneness has become our nature and life.<p>Paul said in Ephesians 4 that there is one God and Father and that there is one Lord, the Son. The one Lord refers to the element of the divine nature and the divine life. In the divine life and divine nature is the divine element. Any kind of substance has a certain element. A stand made of steel has steel as its element. The element of the divine life and nature is Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God. The Son is the embodiment of the Father, and this embodiment is the element.<p>Within the element there is the essence. Grape juice is the essence of grapes. The wine from grapes, the liquor, is sometimes referred to as the &#8220;spirit.&#8221; The spirit is the essence. God the Father is the source as our nature and life, God the Son is the element of this nature and life, and God the Spirit is the essence of the element.<p>God the Father is within us (Eph. 4:6); Jesus the Son is within us (2 Cor. 13:5); and the Spirit is within us (Rom. 8:9-11). We need to realize that God desires to be the God in us. Because we love the heavens, we would like to be in the heavens with Him. God, however, does not love to dwell in the heavens. He loves to dwell in us, in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:16). The Triune God today is within us.<p>We may ask, &#8220;How do we know that God is in us?&#8221; Let me illustrate in this way. Perhaps this morning I was unhappy with a certain person and wanted to correct him in an impatient way. But the very God within me said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t do that.&#8221; Is this not evidence that God is in me? Where is Jesus today? Surely He has ascended to the heavens because Romans 8:34 says that He is at the right hand of God. But at the same time, Romans 8:10 says that He is in us. How could Jesus, on the one hand, be in the heavens, and on the other hand, be within us? Consider the example of electricity. The same electricity in the power plant is also in our home. Our Jesus today is in the heavens, and at the same time, He is in us as the Spirit. The Spirit within us is the essence of the oneness of the Body of Christ.<p>Paul&#8217;s teaching about the oneness of the Body of Christ is based upon the oneness of the Triune God. We all have to keep the oneness of the Spirit because there is one God and Father as the source with His nature and life; one Lord, the Son, as the very element of the divine life with the divine nature; and one Spirit as the essence of the element of the divine nature and divine life. Since we have the Triune God within us as the source, the element, and the essence, we are one. We need to realize that we are all one. We are not one according to our race or culture, but we are one in the divine essence of the divine element of the divine nature and life. We need to see that the divine nature, the divine life, the divine element, and the divine essence are our oneness.<p>Actually, our oneness is the subjective Triune God, not the objective Triune God. The subjective Triune God is our real oneness. In 1963 I wrote a hymn on the subjectiveness of Christ (Hymns, #537). Our Christ is not merely objective. If He were merely objective, He would have nothing to do with us. He is subjective to such an extent that He has made Himself one spirit with us (1 Cor. 6:17). He and we are one spirit. This oneness is altogether by the essential Spirit, who is the very essence of the Divine Trinity.<h2 class=head2>The Uniqueness of His Organism-the Body of Christ as the Church of God</h2><p>In this oneness with the Triune God, we have oneness with one another. This is the oneness of the Body of Christ. This oneness is unique, that is, unique in the Triune God. It is also unique in the organism of the Triune God, which is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23). The Body of Christ is altogether organic. It is not an organization. We are the church to be the organic Body of Christ not by being organized, but by being enlivened, regenerated, and made alive with the Triune God as the oneness within us. No one can divide this oneness. Although Satan has divided many in Christianity, he can never divide the organic Triune God as the very essence of the oneness within us.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST&#8217;S PRAYER FOR THE ONENESS OF HIS BELIEVERS</h2><h2 class=head2>In the Eternal Life</h2><p>The Lord prayed in John 17 for this unique, organic oneness, a oneness totally of and in the divine life (vv. 2-3). We have pointed out in the past that the new way of meeting and serving for the building up of the Body of Christ is the way of life, whereas the old way is the way of organization. Today&#8217;s Christianity is a religious organization. The Body of Christ, however, is altogether a matter of life. Our physical body is not an organization, but an organism. Likewise, the Body of Christ, the church, is the unique organism of the Triune God. A wooden stand is made of pieces of wood organized together into one entity. Our physical body, however, is not organized but organic. Our body is built up by growing because it is an organism full of life. The Body of Christ is also an organism built up by the growth of the divine life.<p>Because our physical body is organic, we sometimes feel weak or sick. Even though we do not always feel happy about the condition of our body, we still have to nourish, cherish, and take care of it. The reason why the church life is not always so easy is because it is organic. New believers may declare how good and how marvelous the church life is. However, the church life may be good to them for only a short period of time, a &#8220;honeymoon&#8221; time. We do not always feel so happy in the church life, but we must take care of the church life organically just as we take care of our physical body. Our oneness in the church life is an organic oneness in the divine life, and we must care for this life.<p>After the Lord Jesus lived and accomplished His ministry in thirty-three and a half years, He prayed for the oneness of the Body of Christ, for the oneness of the believers. The Lord&#8217;s prayer in John 17 is the conclusion of His life and ministry on this earth. He did not pray such a prayer at the beginning of His ministry. The Lord prayed for the oneness at the end of His ministry because He had sown the seed of life into His disciples. By themselves and in themselves the disciples could never have been one. James and John were called &#8220;Sons of Thunder&#8221; (Mark 3:17). How could a son of thunder be one with others? After the Lord Jesus sowed Himself as the seed of life into His disciples, He prayed for their oneness in the eternal life. Peter, James, and John did not realize that Jesus had sown Himself as the spiritual seed of life into them. Based upon His sowing, He prayed, &#8220;Father...glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You, even as You have given Him authority over all flesh to give eternal life to all whom You have given Him&#8221; (John 17:1-2). The oneness of the believers is in the eternal life.<h2 class=head2>In the Name of the Unique Father</h2><p>In His prayer the Lord revealed that the oneness of the believers is also in the name of the unique Father (John 17:6, 11-12, 26). Although the disciples did not realize it at that time, the Lord infused into them the name of the Father. It is very intimate to call God, &#8220;Abba, Father&#8221; (Rom. 8:15; Gal. 4:6). When we realize that God the Father is within us, we feel He is very intimate. The sweet title &#8220;Abba, Father&#8221; has been made fully known to us in an experiential way because we have His life. Now we are one in Him by His life.<h2 class=head2>In the Word of the Father</h2><p>The Lord sowed the seed of life into His disciples and gave them the Father&#8217;s name. He also gave them the word of the Father (John 17:8, 14, 17-21). The word of God sanctifies the believers, separating them from all things other than God (v. 17). The things of the world within us are a replacement of God. Therefore, we need the sanctification in the word. The more we read the Bible, the more we are sanctified. The word of the Bible is like water washing us, cleansing us, and purifying us, purging our being of all things other than God (Eph. 5:26). The longer we live in this world, the more of this world we accumulate and pick up. This &#8220;picking up&#8221; always replaces God. Hence, we need the word to sanctify us, to wash us and cleanse us.<h2 class=head2>In the Glory of the Triune God</h2><p>The Lord prayed that the believers would be one in the divine glory for the expression of the Triune God (John 17:22-24). The glory which the Father has given the Son is the sonship with the Father&#8217;s life and divine nature (5:26) to express the Father in His fullness (1:18; 14:9; Col. 2:9; Heb. 1:3). The Lord Jesus has given us this glory. He has given us the divine sonship so that we can be sons of God to express God. We need to realize that we are glorious because we are the sons of God to express God. We should not go shopping in a light way, because we are sons of God expressing God. We do not want to lose our glorious status as sons of God. It is in this glory, the glory of the Triune God, that we are one. We are one in the name of the Father, in the life of the Father, in the word of the Father, and in the glory of the Father.<h2 class=head2>One in the Triune God as the Triune God Is One for the Expression of the Lord&#8217;s Glory</h2><p>We are one in the Triune God (John 17:21, 23), and we are one as the Triune God is one (vv. 11, 21-22). Our oneness is the oneness in the Godhead. In John 17 the Lord prayed for His believers to be one in the Triune God. Verses 21-23a say, &#8220;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me. And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one.&#8221; The three of the Godhead are one, and we are one in Their oneness. This is the unique oneness in this universe. Actually, our oneness is the oneness of the Divine Trinity, the divine oneness of the Triune God. Since the Triune God is our oneness, we should not have any division among us.<p>This oneness is for the expression of the Lord&#8217;s glory (John 17:1-3, 22, 24). When we all remain in the divine oneness, the real glory is expressed among us to the whole world. The Lord prayed for this divine oneness in the divine glory. I believe this prayer is still prevailing over us today. There is the need of the recovery today because many Christians have been divided by religion. In the history of the church, there was the development of Roman Catholicism. Then Christians divided from the Roman Catholic Church into the state churches such as the Church of England and the Church of Denmark. There was a third division from the Catholic Church and the state churches to private churches, or denominations, such as the Baptist, Presbyterian, and Methodist denominations. A fourth and even further division are the free groups. Although we stand as one with and receive all the Lord&#8217;s children, His believers, we do not agree with any of these divisions. We cannot leave our standing of oneness to join others in their divisions. We should not create or make any division. We have the oneness of the Triune God, and we are one in Him for His expression, His glory.<h2 class=head1>THE APOSTLE&#8217;S EXHORTATION</h2><p>We have the Triune God within us, and the Lord is answering His prayer to keep us and make us one. Based upon the Lord&#8217;s desire, the apostle Paul exhorted the saints in Ephesus concerning their walk. He exhorted them to keep the oneness of the Spirit. In the church, in the oneness of the Triune God, the saints should walk worthily of the Father&#8217;s selection and predestination. Paul said, &#8220;I beseech you therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord, to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called, with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing one another in love&#8221; (Eph. 4:1-2). We need to be lowly and meek, to suffer long, and to bear one another in love. To walk worthily of God&#8217;s calling, we need to be &#8220;diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace&#8221; (v. 3). Our mind, our will, and our emotion need to be attuned to the Spirit (1 Cor. 1:10) to keep the oneness of the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>DIVISION ANNULLING THE ONENESS OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 1:13 Paul points out that Christ is not divided. The unique and undivided Christ, taken as the unique center among all the believers, should be the termination of all divisions. Christ has not been divided, and neither should the believers be divided (vv. 10-12).<p>Perhaps one brother is quiet in the meetings, but another brother is very loud. Both of them need to be attuned to keep the oneness. Paul speaks of our need to be attuned in 1 Corinthians 1:10: &#8220;Now I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.&#8221; There should be no division in the Body of Christ (12:25a). In the Triune God, we have oneness. We have the oneness which is the Triune God Himself. Although this oneness is in us, we are full of opinions and preferences. Hence, we need to be attuned. We all need attuning so that there will be no division in the Body.<p>First Corinthians 11:19 indicates that there must be parties among the believers, that those who are approved may become manifest among them. Division annuls the oneness, and there should be no division in the Body. But when there are parties in the church, which are real divisions, these parties manifest the experienced ones and the approved ones. Parties, or sects, are useful to manifest the approved ones, who are not sectarian.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO DEAL WITH DIVISIONS</h2><p>Paul instructed us in how to deal with divisions in Romans 16:17: &#8220;Now I exhort you, brothers, to mark those who make divisions and causes of stumbling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them.&#8221; Concerning those who make divisions, we have to be watchful, mark them out, and turn away from them. In Titus 3:10 Paul said, &#8220;A factious man, after a first and second admonition, refuse.&#8221; In a family someone may become very ill with a contagious disease. Then the whole family has to quarantine him, to be separated from him. This, however, does not mean to hate him or to give him up. But for the sake of the health of the whole family, there is the need of some quarantine so that the family can be preserved and even healed.<p>Among us in the family of faith, there may be some who have the sick intention of spreading the germs of division. What shall we do? The natural, human thought is that to reject a saint is not so nice or polite. We feel that we are all the Lord&#8217;s children and that we should not offend people. Paul, however, says to mark those who make divisions and turn away from them. We should practice the Body life in this way. On the one hand, we receive all the believers in the principle of love according to God&#8217;s receiving and not according to doctrinal concepts. This is according to Paul&#8217;s instruction in Romans 14. On the other hand, Paul tells us in Romans 16 that we must mark those who make divisions and turn away from them.<p>In order to maintain good order in the church, a factious, divisive person, after a first and second admonition, should be refused, rejected. This is to stop communication with a contagiously divisive person for the church&#8217;s profit. Today we are here in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, and we must be faithful to the recovery. If we bring in division, we are no longer the recovery and become a part of the divisive situation today. We have to stand for the Lord&#8217;s recovery in truth and in life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Col. 1:19; 2:9; 1:18b; Eph. 1:22b; 5:23b; 1:23a; Col. 1:18a; 3:4a; Eph. 3:8, 10; 1:11a; Col. 3:11; Eph. 1:23; Col. 1:27</h1><p>The second emphasis in the Lord&#8217;s recovery is a wonderful person-Christ. Christ is the central subject of the Bible, and His riches are unsearchable (Eph. 3:8). In this chapter I would like to present a living biography of Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE WORD</h2><p>The first point in the biography of Christ is in John 1:1: &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#8221; Christ is the Word of God, and the Word is God. The Word, who is Christ, is the One who was, who is, and who is coming (Rev. 1:4b). He is all three tenses- past, present, and future, because He is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Heb. 13:8). In the past He is Christ; in the present He is Christ; and in the future He is Christ.<p>Christ was the Word in the beginning. &#8220;In the beginning&#8221; in John 1:1 refers to eternity past. Christ was in the beginning without any beginning. This is the first item of Christ&#8217;s biography. Christ is not only the Word of God but also the Word who was God in eternity past without any beginning. Christ as the Word of God is the speaking of God. He is the explanation, definition, and the content of our unlimited God.<h2 class=head1>THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE GOD</h2><p>Furthermore, Colossians 1:15 tells us that this Christ is the image of the invisible God. He is not only the definition and content of our God but also the image and expression of God. God is invisible, yet this invisible God has an image. Hebrews 1:3 says that Christ is the effulgence of God&#8217;s glory and the impress of His substance. This is the second item of the biography of Christ.<h2 class=head1>MAN CREATED IN GOD&#8217;S IMAGE TO RECEIVE THE TREE OF LIFE</h2><p>In the beginning of time and in the creation, God created man in His own image (Gen. 1:26). Since Christ is the image of God, we were created in the image of Christ, who is God&#8217;s image. A photo is the image of a person. Because we were made in the image of Christ, we are photos of Christ. This is the third point of the biography of Christ.<p>In Genesis 2 man as the photo of Christ was put before the tree of life (v. 9). Also before man was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the tree of death. Genesis 2:17 says, &#8220;But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.&#8221; There were two trees in front of man. If he ate the tree of life, surely he would get life. If he ate the other tree, he would become dead. Thus, man as the photo of Christ has two destinies-life or death. Man has these two choices.<p>When Adam and Eve heard God&#8217;s explanation about the two trees, the subtle one, the serpent, was crouching there, waiting for an opportunity to poison them. He put a doubt, a question mark, into Eve when he asked her, &#8220;Hath God said...?&#8221; (Gen. 3:1). A question mark is shaped like a snake standing upright. Every doubt and question about what God says is the snake, Satan. The woman was caught when she began to talk to the serpent, the subtle one. She should not have talked with him. Rather, she should have referred the serpent to her husband. Then she would have had protection. However, she boldly answered the serpent&#8217;s question and got caught. She did not take the fruit of the tree of life. Instead, she took the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and received death.<p>The knowledge of good and evil, right and wrong, issues in death. Whatever we do apart from Christ as life issues in death. To love people apart from Christ is death; to hate people apart from Christ is death; and to be neutral apart from Christ is death. To do anything apart from Christ is death, and not doing anything apart from Christ is also death. Then what shall we do? We should call on the name of the Lord Jesus. Only He is the tree of life.<h2 class=head1>THE SEED OF THE WOMAN</h2><p>Genesis tells us that man did not take the tree of life. Instead, he took in death and became fallen. Hence, God came in to judge the serpent. I believe that Adam and Eve regretted that they took the fruit of the tree of death. When they looked at themselves and realized that they were naked and sinful, they were afraid and covered themselves (3:7-8, 10). At that juncture God called to Adam saying, Adam, &#8220;Where art thou?&#8221; (v. 9).<p>God came in to preach the gospel, the good news, telling Adam and Eve that the seed of the woman would come to bruise the head of the serpent that damaged them (3:15). Although Satan came in through the woman, the seed of promise would also come through a woman. This seed of the woman is Christ. The New Testament speaks of a virgin named Mary who conceived a child, a seed, of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:18). Joseph, the one to whom she was engaged, wanted to put her away secretly, but an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying that that which had been begotten in his wife, Mary, was of the Holy Spirit (vv. 19-20). Thus, the fulfillment of the promise concerning the seed of the woman in Genesis 3:15 is recorded in Matthew 1 with the birth of Jesus.<h2 class=head1>THE SEED OF ABRAHAM</h2><p>The time from Adam and Eve&#8217;s partaking of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil to the time of the Christ&#8217;s conception was about four thousand years. For this period of time, God&#8217;s plan with Christ as the center was hidden and concealed within Himself as a mystery (Col. 1:26). About two thousand years after Adam, God told Abraham that in his seed all the nations of the earth would be blessed (Gen. 22:17-18). First, this seed was designated as the seed of the woman. Second, He was designated as the seed of Abraham. God&#8217;s promise to Abraham was a promise of grace, and this promise became the covenant between God and Abraham to have Christ as the seed for the blessing of the whole earth. In Galatians 3 Paul said that this was the preaching of the gospel by God directly to Abraham. Verses 8 and 9 say, &#8220;The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles out of faith, announced the gospel beforehand to Abraham: &#8216;In you shall all the nations be blessed.&#8217; So then they who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.&#8221; Thus, the gospel was preached to Abraham by God Himself about two thousand years before Christ was born.<p>Nevertheless, no one fully knew about this mystery of Christ as the seed before the New Testament age. Moses, Enoch, Noah, and David did not know. Although Isaiah prophesied concerning the incarnation of Christ (Isa. 7:14), it is doubtful that he knew that his prophecy referred to Christ as the seed of the woman and the seed of Abraham. In the Old Testament age, Christ as the seed was a mystery.<p>God sovereignly prepared the environment for the birth of Christ as the seed of the woman and of Abraham. In the history of Israel, the holy people chosen by God became captives of the Babylonian Empire. Then they became captives of the Medo-Persian Empire and eventually of the Grecian and Roman Empires. Their captivity under the Romans was under the reign of Augustus, the first formal Caesar of the Roman Empire. A decree was issued by him that brought about the proper circumstance for the birth of Christ (Luke 2:1-2 and note 21-Recovery Version). Christ was born to be the seed of the woman and the seed of Abraham for the blessing of the entire earth.<h2 class=head1>JESUS, EMMANUEL, AND CHRIST</h2><p>The incarnation of Christ brought God into man. God was begotten in a virgin. The child who came out of this virgin&#8217;s womb was a God-man. He was not an ordinary man but a perfect man who was also the complete God. The God-ordained name given to this God-man was Jesus.<p>The meaning of the name of Jesus is Jehovah the Savior or the salvation of Jehovah. Jehovah in the Old Testament was Jesus, and Jesus in the New Testament is Jehovah. Jehovah and Jesus are one person. We need to know all these wonderful items about this wonderful person. He is wonderful, and His name is &#8220;Wonderful&#8221; (Isa. 9:6). Therefore, His biography, His history, His story, is altogether wonderful. Jesus is Jehovah becoming a man to be our Savior.<p>Although His name given by God was Jesus, the people called Him Emmanuel, which means God with us (Matt. 1:23). Jesus is God with us. He is God incarnated to dwell among us (John 1:14). He is not only God but also God with us. The title for His divine commission is Christ, the Messiah, God&#8217;s anointed One.<p>Christ is the Word of God who was God in eternity past. In time man was created in His image to be His photo. After man fell, God promised that a seed of the woman would come to bruise the head of the serpent. About two thousand years later, God came to Abraham and promised him a seed, telling him that this seed would become a blessing to the whole earth. This seed was Jesus. One day He came in incarnation to be a man. He came as the Word of God and as the image of God begotten in the virgin Mary&#8217;s womb. He came out of that womb to be Jesus, Jehovah our Savior, for our salvation, and Emmanuel, God with us. He is God&#8217;s anointed One, the Christ, to accomplish God&#8217;s will, God&#8217;s desire.<h2 class=head1>THE SON BEING THE EMBODIMENT AND EXPRESSION OF THE FATHER, AND THE SPIRIT BEING THE REALIZATION OF THE SON</h2><p>This wonderful One is the Son who embodies and expresses the Father. In John 14 Philip asked the Lord to show him and the other disciples the Father. The Lord Jesus responded in this way: &#8220;Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father....Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me&#8221; (vv. 8-9, 11a). The Lord revealed to His disciples that He was the embodiment and expression of the Father. He is both the Father and the Son (Isa. 9:6).<p>He is the Word of the Father, describing and defining the Father. Since He is the embodiment and expression of the Father, when He was with His disciples, that was also the Father with the disciples. Although the Father and the Son are one, They are still distinct, as indicated by the fact that the Son prayed to the Father.<p>John 14 says that He asked the Father to send another Comforter (v. 16), indicating that He was the first Comforter from the Father. According to John 14, another Comforter was needed. The second Comforter is the Spirit of reality who is the realization of the Son. The Spirit of reality came not only to be with us but also to be in us. The Spirit of reality within us is the realization of the Son, who is the embodiment of the Father. We have the Triune God within us. The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is within us as the Son who is the embodiment of the Father.<p>The Father is the source, the Son is the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit is the realization of the Son who is the embodiment of the Father. When we have the Spirit, we have the Son. When we have the Son, we have the Father. In other words, when we have the Son, we have the Father who is the source and also the Spirit as the realization of the Son, who is the embodiment of the Father. This is all a part of the biography of Christ.<p>Our Lord Jesus Christ is the Word of God and the image of God, according to which we were made. When man became fallen, the Father promised that a seed of the woman would come. This seed of woman is the seed of Abraham to be the blessing for the whole earth. This seed came through a woman, a virgin named Mary. God came into her womb and came out of her womb as a God-man named Jesus, Jehovah the Savior to be our salvation. People called Him Emmanuel, God with us. Later, He told His disciples that He was the embodiment and the expression of the Father. He went on to tell them that He would ask the Father to give them another Comforter to come as His realization.<p>This fellowship should help us to realize how rich Christ is. He is the Word of God, the seed of woman, the seed of Abraham, a God-man, Jehovah, the Savior, Jesus, and Emmanuel. He is the embodiment and expression of the Father, and the Spirit is His realization. Now He is within us as the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>PROPHESYING TO SOW HIMSELF INTO THE DISCIPLES</h2><p>Christ lived as a God-man on this earth for thirty years in Nazareth. At thirty years of age, He came out to minister, to speak, to prophesy. Since we are His members, we all must prophesy as He did. His prophesying presents God to us. When we listen to His speaking, we see God; when we accept His speaking, we accept God. Through His speaking for three and a half years, the wonderful Triune God, who is altogether organic, was sown into all His disciples. They, however, did not have this realization. They were ignorant and unconscious of this. The disciples simply thought that He was their Teacher and their Master and that one day He would be the King in the heavenly kingdom. James and John were concerned about who would sit on His right and on His left in the kingdom (Mark 10:35-37).<h2 class=head1>DYING AN ALL-INCLUSIVE DEATH</h2><p>The disciples did not know what they were doing or where they were going, but Jesus, Jehovah the Savior, knew. He was going forward boldly to Jerusalem to hand Himself over to the chief priests and scribes to be crucified (Matt. 20:18-19). When they came to arrest Him at Gethsemane, He said, &#8220;Whom do you seek? They answered Him, Jesus the Nazarene. He said to them, I am....When therefore He said to them, I am, they drew back and fell to the ground&#8221; (John 18:4-6). They knew that &#8220;I am&#8221; was the name of Jehovah (Exo. 3:14). They did not have the capacity, the power, the strength, the might, to arrest this One who was Jehovah God. Actually, He handed Himself over to them to accomplish God&#8217;s will (Matt. 26:53-54).<p>Christ as the complete God and the perfect man went to the cross and died an all-inclusive death. On the one hand, through His death He accomplished a full and eternal redemption (Heb. 9:12). He terminated all the negative things in the universe, including Satan (Heb. 2:14; John 12:31), the world (John 12:31), the old creation (Col. 1:20), the old man (Rom. 6:6), the flesh (Gal. 5:24), the self (2:20), sin (2 Cor. 5:21; Rom. 8:3; John 1:29), sins (1 Pet. 2:24; Isa. 53:6), and religion (Gal. 6:14). On the other hand, through His death He released the divine life concealed within Him so that this life could be imparted into His believers (John 12:24).<p>When the Lord was on the cross, two substances came out of His pierced side: blood and water (John 19:34). Blood is for redemption, dealing with sins (John 1:29; Heb. 9:22) for the purchase of the church (Acts 20:28); water is for imparting life, dealing with death (John 12:24; 3:14-15) for the producing of the church (Eph. 5:29-31). The Lord&#8217;s death is, on the negative side, to take away our sins, and, on the positive side, to impart life into us. Hence, it has two aspects: the redeeming aspect and the life-imparting aspect. The death of Christ is an all-inclusive death.<h2 class=head1>BECOMING THE FIRSTBORN SON OF GOD AND THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT IN RESURRECTION</h2><p>In resurrection He became the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29; Acts 13:33). He was the only begotten Son of God in incarnation (John 3:16). However, after His death and His resurrection, He became the firstborn Son among many brothers, many sons. In resurrection He regenerated us, the sinners, to be God&#8217;s many sons and His many brethren (1 Pet. 1:3). Now in the divine sonship there are many sons. The firstborn Son is Jesus Christ, and we are the many sons.<p>In resurrection He also became the life-giving Spirit, the life-giving pneuma. He became the pneumatic Christ, the pneumatic, organic, life-giving Spirit. Whenever a person calls on the Lord&#8217;s name, He comes into this person as the regenerating One to be the indwelling Spirit. He is indwelling us and is now one spirit with us (1 Cor. 6:17). He is living within us. This is also included in the biography of Christ.<h2 class=head1>LIVING CHRIST BY GOING ALONG WITH HIM AS OUR INNER PERSON</h2><p>One day we heard the gospel, and we repented and confessed our sins. We called on the Lord&#8217;s name and received Him. When we received the Lord, we received another person into us. He changed our choices and preferences. One by one our sinful habits were dropped, and we became different persons. From the day that I received the Lord, I had the sensation that Someone was taking care of me, controlling me, and regulating me. When I was going to lose my temper, He did not agree with this. He spoke to me from within, &#8220;You have to go along with Me.&#8221; Thus, I was forced to stop my temper. Do you realize that this was to live Christ? Since the day I received Christ, when I began to criticize others, He within me as a person said, &#8220;Do not say anything like this. I do not speak in this way.&#8221; I did not speak my criticism, because He did not speak it. This is to live Christ.<p>Christ lives in us not only as our life but also as our person. We have a particular person within us, and this particular person is our unique life. Christ is now subjective and organic to us. He is our person, the better person, even the best person. He should become our daily life, our daily living, and our reality. Many times we neglect to hear Him and act too fast. Even though He says, &#8220;Do not do it,&#8221; we do not care for His speaking. At these times, we neglect Jesus within us, without caring for Him. Then we have to say, &#8220;Lord, forgive me. Lord, I rebelled against You.&#8221; When we say this to the Lord, He may tell us to confess to someone we have argued with or offended. He is always urging us from within to go along with Him, to be one with Him, and to follow Him.<p>To live Christ is to go along with Him as our inner person. Our Christian life is not merely a matter of speaking something spiritual in the meetings, but a matter of living Christ in our private life. Many times I wanted to say something or go somewhere, but Christ within me was not saying what I wanted to say or going where I wanted to go. His not going forced me to say, &#8220;Lord, since You will not go, I will not go either. I will stay home.&#8221; This is living Christ.<p>By going along with Christ as my inner person, I have been graced by Him to grow in Him. It was easy for me to lose my temper when I was young. Now, however, it is difficult for anyone to offend me so that I lose my temper. This is because the One who lives in me does not lose His temper. I exercise myself to be one with Him to live Him. When Christ is increasing in us, all things other than Christ are decreasing. This experience is another part of the biography of Christ.<p>Paul said that Christ is our life (Col. 3:4). He also said in Galatians 2:20, &#8220;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&#8221; This should not be just a doctrine or theological knowledge. This should be a living fact in our experience. It is no more I who live, but the very Christ who died for me and who died with me, lives in me. We all have to declare this, and this should be our experience in our daily life.<p>We need to live Christ in all the details of our daily life. Sometimes when I am joking, the One within me tells me to stop. I stopped joking in order to live Christ. He is not only my life but also my person. When the brothers buy a tie, they should buy a tie according to the One who lives in them. We do not wear the kind of ties many of the people in the world wear because Christ within us does not wear that kind of tie. We should also experience Christ as our person in the way that we cut our hair. We should not think that this is a small thing. If a brother&#8217;s hair is too long, do you think Christ would still speak freely through him? To live Christ means having Christ as our person and life, not just day by day but moment by moment. The living of Christ is the organic and basic foundation of the church life. The aggregate of each one of us living Christ is the church. The church is the totality of the living of Christ of all the saints.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH BEING THE ISSUE OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>Such a church is the issue, the coming out, of the organic Triune God. The Father has imparted His nature and life into our being as the basic substance. This is indicated in Ephesians 1 by His choosing us to be holy and predestinating us unto sonship (vv. 4-5). The Son in His redemption has become our element, by which we all have been made God&#8217;s divine inheritance (vv. 7-11). Do you think God would inherit sinful people? What God inherits surely must be something very precious. According to our natural, sinful, corrupt nature, our fallen being, we cannot be God&#8217;s inheritance. But Ephesians 1:11 tells us that in Christ we were made God&#8217;s inheritance. We became God&#8217;s treasure because we have the element of Christ, the element of the divine nature and the divine life, within us. This element makes us a precious treasure in the eyes of God. We become His inheritance because we have Christ as the element within us.<p>Ephesians 1 also tells us that the Spirit of God seals us (v. 13). When a piece of paper is stamped with a seal, the sealing ink saturates the paper. The essence of the sealing ink is imparted into the fiber of the paper. In the same way, the sealing of the Spirit saturates our being in a fine way. Even though I have been in Christ for over sixty years, I still feel today that the Spirit is sealing me. I am still being infused and transfused with the Spirit, making me full of the essence of Christ&#8217;s element, which is the very element of God&#8217;s holy nature and of His divine life. This sealing makes us absolutely and essentially one with the Triune God. This is the church life. We all need to live in this sealing. Then we will surely have a wonderful church life in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. This is included in the biography of Christ.<h2 class=head1>HIS BIOGRAPHY BECOMING OUR STORY</h2><p>This wonderful One, who is the embodiment of the Father, and whose realization is the Spirit, is the constituent of the church. Our living through Him, with Him, by Him, and in Him is the constitution of the practical church life. Then He within us is every part of the new man. The church as the new man is constituted with Christ as the inner constituent. Christ is every member of the new man and is within every member. In the new man Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:10-11). This is not only His history but also our story. His biography becomes our history.<p>We are awaiting the day when we will be raptured and brought fully into Christ in glory. He will then become our glory in full. Today He is within us the hope of glory. In that day when we enter into the eternal part of His biography, we will live with Him, in Him, and through Him as one spirit with Him through the millennial kingdom and into eternity in the new heaven and new earth as the New Jerusalem, which is His ultimate consummation and ultimate enlargement.<p>In the first chapter of Genesis, God made man in His image, who is Christ, the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15). In the last chapter of Revelation, Christ is &#8220;the Spirit.&#8221; Revelation 22:17 speaks of &#8220;the Spirit and the bride.&#8221; The conclusion of the holy Word reveals that the organic Triune God becomes fully mingled with us, the transformed, tripartite human beings. His name at the consummation of the divine revelation is &#8220;the Spirit.&#8221; On the first page of the Bible He was the image of God, and on the last page of the Bible He has become &#8220;the Spirit&#8221; mingled with us, the transformed, tripartite man as His bride. He as the Husband and we as the bride become a universal couple. This couple is the coming New Jerusalem, and this will be the history, the story, the biography of Him with us for eternity. This biography began in eternity past and lasts without end through eternity future. In between eternity past and future, we are regenerated, renewed, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified. We are in the process, in the way and on the way, of the biography of this wonderful One.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14; John 7:38-39; Rev. 22:1; Rom. 8:2; 2 Cor. 3:6b; 1 John 5:6b; John 14:16-20; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:18; John 17:17; Eph. 4:3; Rev. 22:17; Gal. 5:16, 25; Rom. 8:4; Acts 13:52b; 2:4a; 4:31b</h1><h2 class=head1>THE BIOGRAPHY OF CHRIST</h2><p>In this chapter we would like to continue our fellowship concerning the second emphasis in the Lord&#8217;s recovery-Christ. In particular, we want to see more concerning the biography of Christ. Then we will go on to see the truth concerning the third emphasis in the Lord&#8217;s recovery-the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>Christ Having the Preeminence, the First Place, in All Things</h2><p>According to what is revealed in the Scriptures, Christ is the centrality and universality of God in His move, especially for the completion of His redemption to produce the church. As the centrality and universality of God, Christ must have the preeminence, the first place (Col. 1:18b). He is the most preeminent One in the whole universe. In God&#8217;s creation, in God&#8217;s redemption, in the church, and in the believers, Christ has the preeminence, the very first place.<h2 class=head2>Christ Having Been Given to Be the Head over All Things to the Church</h2><p>Ephesians 1 also tells us that God has given Christ to be the Head over all things to the church (v. 22b). The preposition to indicates a kind of transmission. Whatever Christ is, is transmitted to the church. Whatever Christ, the Head, has attained and obtained is transmitted to the church, His Body. In this transmission, we enjoy the fullness of the Godhead and His headship.<h2 class=head2>God Incarnated to Be a Man</h2><p>Christ was God, and one day He became a man in incarnation. Incarnation is God coming to be a man. The almighty God became one with man according to the human principle of conception and birth. God took this way to become a man about four thousand years after He created man. Four thousand years after His creation of man, He came into the womb of a virgin named Mary. The almighty God, the Creator of heaven and earth, came into the womb of a virgin and stayed there for nine months. Then He came out of that womb to be a man with a name given by God&#8217;s ordination-Jesus. Jesus is the connection, the linking, of God with man.<p>Jesus means Jehovah the Savior. Jehovah became a man to be our Savior that we may enjoy His salvation. He is the complete God connected and mingled with the perfect man. This wonderful person is very particular. He is not merely God or merely man. He is both God and man, so He is called the God-man. Through Him God and man came together. Man was joined to God and God mingled Himself with man. This is Jesus! Many Christians do not know Jesus as such a connection, such a linking, and such a mingling of divinity with humanity. His incarnation not only made Him a man but also brought God into man. Now we can shout, &#8220;Hallelujah, God today is a man!&#8221;<p>After He lived thirty years in Nazareth, He came out to minister. When He came out, He was a great attraction, like a big magnet. While He was walking on the seashore of Galilee, Peter, Andrew, James, and John were drawn to Him (Matt. 4:18-22). They left their occupations and followed Him. They were attracted by the Lord as the great light in the darkness of death (v. 16) and followed Him for the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens in the light of life.<p>Although He was such an attraction, He did not possess any outward beauty. He was not a handsome man. Isaiah said that He had &#8220;no attracting form nor majesty that we should look upon Him, / Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him&#8221; (53:2) and that &#8220;His appearance was marred more than that of any man, / And His form more than that of the sons of men&#8221; (52:14). Even though He did not have a handsome appearance, something within Him was like a magnet. When the disciples saw Him, they were drawn, attracted. We may also say that they became &#8220;addicted&#8221; to Him. Today I can declare that I am addicted to Jesus, and many of us are the same.<h2 class=head2>Dying an All-inclusive Death</h2><p>After Jesus passed through human living for thirty years, He ministered for three and a half years. Then He went to the cross on Calvary to die an all-inclusive death. By that death He terminated the old creation (Col. 1:20), He crucified the old man (Rom. 6:6), and He took away man&#8217;s sin (John 1:29) and sins (1 Pet. 2:24). He also judged Satan and Satan&#8217;s world (John 12:31). Before His death, the entire universe had become old and was filled with all these negative items. But through His unique death He cleared up all these things.<p>On the positive side, He was broken on the cross to release the divine life that was concealed within Him (John 12:24). On the cross He was pierced, and out came blood and water (19:34). The blood symbolizes redemption, and the water symbolizes the flowing life of God. On the one hand, He cleared up the whole universe through His redemption, His redeeming death. On the other hand, He released the divine life within Him so that He might impart this life into His believers.<h2 class=head2>Accomplishing Three Main Items in Resurrection</h2><p>After His death He remained in Hades for three days. Then He walked out of death and was resurrected. In His resurrection He accomplished three things.<h2 class=head3>Becoming the Firstborn Son of God</h2><p>First, through His resurrection He became the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29). Before His resurrection He was the only begotten Son of God (John 3:16), the unique Son of God, but His humanity had not been brought into the divine sonship. Before His resurrection, He was the only begotten Son of God with divinity, but then He became a man with flesh and blood. As the Son of God in eternity past, He had only divinity. He had only the divine nature, not the human nature. Through resurrection His humanity was &#8220;sonized.&#8221; He is now the Son of God with humanity and divinity. Through His resurrection He sonized His humanity. He was the Son of God before His resurrection, but He was not yet the firstborn Son. In His resurrection He was begotten of God to be the firstborn Son of God among many sons.<h2 class=head3>Producing Many Sons of God</h2><p>In His resurrection He produced many sons of God. This is the second accomplishment of His resurrection. According to 1 Peter 1:3, God regenerated us through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead. His resurrection was a great birth, a great delivery, in which He made all of us, His believers, the many sons of God. I once read of someone who had seven children by one birth. But by the resurrection of Christ, millions and millions of children were born. In His resurrection He became the firstborn Son among many sons. According to 1 Peter 1:3 we were born again about two thousand years ago when Christ was resurrected. We were all born in the same delivery. When Jesus Christ was delivered as the firstborn Son, we were delivered as the many sons. In resurrection we all were born of God.<h2 class=head3>Becoming a Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>In His resurrection, Christ also became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). This is the third accomplishment of His resurrection. He was the unique God. Then He became a man. As a man He died on the cross, was buried, and remained in Hades for three days. Then He entered into resurrection to become a life-giving Spirit. Today He is God, He is a man, and He is the Spirit who gives life. He is such a wonderful person! The biography of Christ is marvelous. He is the life-giving Spirit, and the life-giving Spirit is the consummation of God being a man. God being a man has been consummated in the Spirit. Thus, the Spirit who gives life is the aggregate of God plus man. He became a life-giving Spirit to impart Himself into our being to be our life and to remain within us as our person.<p>We know that Jesus has come into us, but we need to realize that the story of this Jesus who has come into us is not so simple. He was God in eternity past. Then about four thousand years after the creation of man, He came into the womb of a virgin and was born of this woman to be a man. God was linked with man. He lived thirty-three and a half years, died on the cross, was buried for three days, and came out in resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, the life-giving Spirit is the aggregate of God becoming a man. Today He is the Spirit who gives life.<h2 class=head2>Training the Disciples to Enjoy His Invisible Presence</h2><p>On the evening of the day of His resurrection, He came back to His disciples. At that time the disciples were gathered together with the doors shut for fear of the Jews. Suddenly Jesus appeared to them and stood in their midst. At that time the disciples were all threatened. They were fearful and had no peace, so Jesus appeared to them as peace and said, &#8220;Peace be to you&#8221; (John 20:19). According to Luke 24:37, the disciples &#8220;were terrified and became frightened and thought they beheld a spirit.&#8221; But the Lord said, &#8220;See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself. Touch Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you behold Me having&#8221; (v. 39). The Lord came to them with a resurrected body (1 Cor. 15:44). How could He enter with bones and flesh into a closed room? Our limited mentality cannot comprehend it, but it is a fact! We have to receive it according to the divine revelation. He showed the disciples His hands and His side, and He breathed Himself into them as the Spirit (John 20:20-22). He had become the Spirit, yet He had flesh and bones.<p>After His resurrection and before His ascension, He appeared to His disciples and disappeared. Although He disappeared from their sight, He was still within them as the Spirit. Before His death, the Lord&#8217;s presence was visible in the flesh. After His resurrection, His presence was invisible in the Spirit. His manifestations or appearings after His resurrection were to train the disciples to realize, to enjoy, and to practice His invisible presence, which is more available, prevailing, precious, rich, and real. This dear presence of His is the Spirit in His resurrection, whom He breathed into them and who will be with them all the time.<p>Whether the disciples were conscious of His presence or not, He was with them all the time. For the sake of their weakness, He appeared to them in order to strengthen their faith in Him. When He disappeared from the disciples&#8217; sight, they became disappointed. Because of the trial of the need of his living, Peter went fishing, and some of the other disciples followed him. They fished the whole night, but they did not catch one fish. All of a sudden Jesus appeared again (John 21:1-14). He appeared and disappeared, but actually He was always with them.<p>The Christian life is a life of Jesus&#8217; appearing and disappearing. Maybe in the morning a brother feels that Jesus is so present with him. He may have a very intimate time with the Lord to enjoy Him in His manifestation. Afterwards, this brother&#8217;s wife may do something or say something to make him unhappy. Then to this brother&#8217;s sensation, Jesus has disappeared. Seemingly, he lost Jesus, but actually Jesus is not gone. This brother may have lost the Lord&#8217;s manifestation, but the Lord always remains within him. All of this is a part of the biography of Jesus.<h2 class=head2>Bringing Us into Glory to Consummate God&#8217;s New Creation</h2><p>Day by day the Lord is appearing and disappearing to sanctify us, to renew us, to transform us, and to conform us to His own image. Eventually, He will glorify us in His great appearing, His second coming. He will bring us all into glory, and our physical body will be glorified. According to Philippians 3:21, our body is a body of humiliation. It is damaged by sin, weakness, sickness, and death (Rom. 6:6; 7:24; 8:11). But it will eventually be conformed to Christ&#8217;s resurrected body saturated with God&#8217;s glory (Luke 24:26) and transcendent over corruption and death (Rom. 6:9). He will bring our body of humiliation into Himself as the glory. Now He is the hope of glory (Col. 1:27), and one day we will be in Him and with Him in the glory. That will consummate God&#8217;s new creation with us.<p>Before we were regenerated, we were fully in the old creation. Regeneration made us a new creation, but we are not the new creation in full. We are in the process of becoming God&#8217;s new creation just as a butterfly gradually comes out of a cocoon. When Jesus comes again, we will be transfigured in our body into His glory. That will be the consummation of God&#8217;s new creation with us. This is the biography of Christ.<h2 class=head2>Bringing God&#8217;s Kingdom to Earth</h2><p>When He comes again, He will also bring God&#8217;s kingdom to the earth. According to Daniel 2, He will come as a smiting stone to smash and destroy the entire human government on this earth. Then as the smiting stone, He will become a great mountain, the kingdom of God, filling the whole earth (vv. 34-35, 44-45). Thus, in His second coming He will consummate God&#8217;s new creation in us, and He will clear up the earth by destroying the entire human government from Nimrod to Antichrist, signified by the great human image in Daniel 2. Then He will become the kingdom of God filling the whole earth.<p>All the overcoming believers will reign with Him in the thousand-year kingdom, while the defeated believers will suffer some discipline. The defeated Christians in this age will be made mature in the millennium, and the saved Jews will also be consummated as God&#8217;s new creation. After the millennium is completed, a part of the nations, who were the citizens in the kingdom of one thousand years, will rebel (Rev. 20:7-9). That will be the last rebellion of mankind against God. Fire will come down out of heaven and consume them. Later, the old heaven and old earth will pass away to become the new heaven and new earth. All the consummated believers and chosen and redeemed Jews will be together to be the New Jerusalem for eternity.<h2 class=head2>Being the Centrality and Universality of the New Jerusalem</h2><p>Christ will be the centrality and universality of the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem will be the mingling, the blending, of the processed Triune God with the transformed, tripartite man. On the one hand, we will be God&#8217;s dwelling, and on the other hand, God will be our abode. The New Jerusalem will be a mutual abiding place for God and for us. In other words, God will dwell in us, and we will abide in Him. We will enjoy and express the Triune God forever. This is the eternal destiny of the New Jerusalem with Christ as the center and the circumference. He will become the centrality and the universality of God&#8217;s economy in full. The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate consummation of God&#8217;s economy. This is the biography of Christ without any ending.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Now we want to fellowship concerning the third emphasis in the Lord&#8217;s recovery-the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>The Divine Trinity</h2><p>When we speak concerning the Spirit, we are touching the Divine Trinity. The Divine Trinity is a great mystery. God is uniquely one, but this one God is triune. In theology, scholars of the Bible invented the word triune. This word comes from Latin. Tri means three; une means one. God is one, yet He is three. Although God is three, He is not three gods. He is the only one God, yet He is three. This is a great mystery.<p>Bible teachers and theologians have tried their best to describe the Trinity. They have used the term persons to describe the three of the Godhead. We may use this term temporarily, but if this term is pressed too far, it can lead to the heresy of tritheism. Others have used the word hypostases to describe the three of the Godhead. Hypostases refers to supporting substances or to something substantial supporting something underneath. This is like a stand having four legs to support it. God is uniquely one, but He has three supporting substances-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>The Spirit Being the Flow of the Triune God</h2><p>According to the divine revelation, the Divine Trinity has a source, a course, and a flow. The Bible says that God is the living water (John 4:10, 14). With this water there is a source, a course, and a flow. The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow. Matthew 28:19 says that we are to baptize people into the one name of three persons-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. There is one name for the Trinity. Second Corinthians 13:14 speaks of the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. In this verse we see three persons-God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit. We also see three matters-love, grace, and fellowship. The love of God is the source; the grace out of the love of God is the course; and the fellowship of the Spirit is the flow.<p>The Spirit is the Triune God&#8217;s flow. In other words, the Spirit is the Triune God flowing. The Spirit as the flowing of the Triune God may be likened to the current of electricity, the flowing of electricity. The electricity itself and its flow are not two separate matters. They are just one thing. Electricity has a flow, and that is called the current. The Triune God has a flow, and that is called the Spirit.<p>The Spirit is not only the flow of the Triune God but also the reaching of the Triune God. The current of electricity is the reaching of electricity. Electricity reaches a house from the power plant by its current. The flowing is a kind of reaching, and the reaching is a kind of &#8220;entering into.&#8221; The Spirit is the reaching of the Triune God, and this reaching enters into us. The Spirit is the Triune God entering into us as the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2).<h2 class=head2>The Spirit Being the Reality</h2><p>The Spirit is the reality (1 John 5:6b). God is very abstract but very real. It is hard to say whether electricity is abstract or solid. To say that our God is abstract may be partially right, but our God is also very real. The reality is the Spirit. The Spirit is the reality of God, the reality of Christ (John 14:16-20; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:18), the reality of the word of God (John 17:17), and the reality of the resurrection of Christ.<h2 class=head2>The Spirit Being the Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>In His economy, God passed through different stages. God was in eternity past. When He was in eternity past, He was merely and solely divine; He did not possess humanity. But one day about four thousand years after He created man, He became a man. He partook of man&#8217;s nature, man&#8217;s blood and flesh (Heb. 2:14). This is another stage of God. He became Emmanuel (Matt. 1:23). He became a God-man.<p>Our God, the God of the Christians, is very different from the God of the Jews. Because of the Jews&#8217; unbelief in Jesus, their God is merely in divinity, not in humanity. The Jews do not believe that Jesus today is their Jehovah in the Old Testament. Jehovah in the Old Testament was only God, but Jesus today is God plus man. This man Jesus, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). In the New Testament, there are two great &#8220;becames.&#8221; First, God became a man, the Word became flesh (John 1:14). Second, this God-man became a life-giving Spirit. These are the different stages of God.<p>In eternity past the Spirit of God was merely the Spirit of divinity. But God became a man, and this God-man became the life-giving Spirit. Now the Spirit of God is also the Spirit of the man Jesus. Acts 16:7 speaks of &#8220;the Spirit of Jesus.&#8221; The Spirit of Jesus is the Spirit of God with the humanity of Jesus. The Spirit of Christ is mentioned in Romans 8:9 and the Spirit of Jesus Christ in Philippians 1:19. The Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of Jesus Christ are the one Spirit, who includes both divinity and humanity.<p>In John 7 the Lord Jesus said that the Spirit would be the flow out of the innermost being of a believer (v. 38). Verse 39 says that this Spirit was not yet because Jesus was not yet glorified. At that time Jesus was not yet glorified in His resurrection. He had not yet become the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection. This life-giving Spirit, whom Jesus became, is the Spirit of God in another stage.<p>In one stage in eternity past, He was only the Spirit of divinity, without humanity. But after Jesus&#8217; resurrection, the Spirit is now the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Jesus became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, so the Spirit has become the Spirit of Jesus Christ with humanity in resurrection. Today the Spirit that is within us is not only the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of God but also the Spirit of Jesus Christ. He is divine, and He is also human. He is not only human in incarnation but also human in resurrection. Today He is such a Spirit.<h2 class=head2>The All-inclusive Compound Spirit</h2><p>God, man, the death of Jesus, and the resurrection of Christ are compounded together to be a compound Spirit. This is according to the type of the all-inclusive Spirit as the compound ointment in Exodus 30. This anointing ointment had a base of one hin of olive oil. Then this oil was compounded with four kinds of spices-myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia (vv. 23-25). A marginal note in the Newberry Bible says that the compound ointment in Exodus 30 indicates the Holy Spirit. I read this many years ago and knew that this ointment typified the Spirit, but I did not see until much later that it typifies the compound Spirit. Today the Spirit of Jesus Christ is not merely the Spirit of divinity but also the compound Spirit of divinity, of humanity, of Jesus&#8217; human death, and of Christ&#8217;s human resurrection compounded together. Today the Holy Spirit we have is such a compound Spirit.<p>When I was a young Christian, I was told that I was crucified with Christ. I did not understand how Christ&#8217;s crucifixion could involve me when He died two thousand years ago. How could I have been there? A. B. Simpson pointed out that we need to reckon that we have been crucified, based on Paul&#8217;s word in Romans 6:11. According to our view, Christ&#8217;s death was far away from us in time and space. But because God has put us into Christ, His history is our experience.<p>Actually those who are of European descent came to the United States about two hundred years ago, before they were born. They were born in America but their ancestors were not American. When their ancestors came to the United States, they came in their ancestors. Hebrews 7 speaks of the fact that the tribe of Levi offered tithes to Melchisedec through their father Abraham (v. 9), for they were in Abraham&#8217;s loins when he met Melchisedec (v. 10). Thus, the history of our ancestors is our experience, and we can reckon according to this realization.<p>God put us into Christ (1 Cor. 1:30). Christ died on Calvary two thousand years ago. Since we are in Him, we died also. This is the way we should reckon our having died together with Christ (Gal. 2:20). This is quite logical. When we come to our experience, however, reckoning ourselves to be dead does not work. The more we reckon that we are dead, the more it seems that we are alive.<p>One day Brother Watchman Nee told us that the death of Christ in Romans 6 is in the Spirit in Romans 8. Christ&#8217;s death, especially the effectiveness of His death, is compounded in the Spirit. Within the Spirit is the power and effectiveness of the death of Christ. Today drugs prescribed for certain illnesses have different essences. One essence of a drug is a nourishing essence while another essence kills the germs. Today the compound Spirit is the best and the largest dose which God has prescribed for us. He is our all-inclusive dose. If we lose our temper often, we need to take in the Spirit of Jesus often. The Spirit of Jesus has the element of Christ&#8217;s death to kill the germ of our temper.<h2 class=head2>Calling Upon the Name of the Lord to Receive the Spirit</h2><p>The Spirit we have today is the consummated Spirit, not the &#8220;raw&#8221; Spirit. The divine Spirit has been consummated with humanity, with the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ&#8217;s death, and with the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection. This consummated Spirit has become the very dose God has prescribed for us. We just have to take this dose by continually calling on the Lord&#8217;s name-&#8220;O Lord Jesus. O Lord Jesus.&#8221; Certain medicines are prescribed for high blood pressure. Within a short period of time after they are taken, a person&#8217;s blood pressure will come down. We need to take such an effective dose for our Christian life and church life. This dose is the compound Spirit.<p>We can take this dose by calling, &#8220;O Lord Jesus.&#8221; It is not necessary for us to shout. If we call on the Lord repeatedly, our temper will be gone. This is why we are told to pray unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17). To pray we have to say, &#8220;O Lord Jesus.&#8221; To call on the Lord&#8217;s name is to breathe in the Spirit. M. E. Barber wrote a hymn which says, &#8220;Just to breathe the Name of Jesus, / Is to drink of Life indeed&#8221; (Hymns, #73-verse 2). When we breathe the name of Jesus by calling on His name, we drink of the Spirit of life. To call on the Lord is to breathe in the Spirit (Lam. 3:55-56).<p>The Spirit today is the consummation of the Triune God. He is the consummated Spirit of God compounded with divinity, with humanity, with Jesus&#8217; death, and with Christ&#8217;s resurrection. In Philippians 1:19 Paul speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Spirit of Jesus Christ is bountiful. He is bountifully rich, and He has a bountiful supply. How can we touch Him and gain Him? We must call on the name of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the name, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the person. If we call a person&#8217;s name, he may respond, &#8220;Yes, I am here.&#8221; If we call, &#8220;O Lord Jesus,&#8221; the Spirit says, &#8220;Yes, I am here.&#8221; This is because the Spirit is the person.<p>We need to call on the name of the Lord in every place (1 Cor. 1:2). Some brothers and sisters may not want to call on the Lord before others in the meetings because they feel that they are too dignified. If a brother is a professor, he may feel that if he calls on the Lord, he will lose his dignity. It is easier for the young people to call on the Lord. The older saints may call on the Lord privately and secretly, but they may not call on the Lord publicly in the meetings. If we do not call on the Lord, however, we are refusing to take the Spirit as our medicine, as our dose. It is not a shame to take the best medicine. We have to call on the name of the Lord to receive the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>The Believers Needing to Be Filled Within with the Essential Spirit and Filled Without with the Economical Spirit</h2><p>The Spirit is the aggregate of the Triune God, the consummation of the Triune God. The Triune God is embodied in Christ, and Christ is realized as the Spirit. The Spirit today is the living Jesus and the reality of the Triune God. The way to enjoy Him and be filled with Him is to pray. Then we will be filled with Him inwardly as the essential Spirit for our life and living and filled with Him outwardly as the economical Spirit for power in our ministry and work (Acts 13:52; 2:4a; 4:31b).<p>Before I speak to the saints in the ministry, I have to pray. Without praying, I cannot speak. Before coming to speak, I frequently pray, &#8220;Lord, fill me within as the essence, as life, and fill me without as the power for the impact.&#8221; The Lord hears this prayer. When I speak, I have the Spirit as the essence within. I am not empty, but filled up with the Spirit. I also have the experience of the Spirit upon me as my authority for the impact. We all need to be filled inwardly with the essential Spirit for life and for the reality of our being and filled outwardly with the Spirit of power for God&#8217;s economy to carry out God&#8217;s work.<h2 class=head2>The Believers Needing to Live, Act, and Do Everything by, in, and according to the Spirit</h2><p>The believers should live, act, and do everything by, in, and according to the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25; Rom. 8:4). This is the Christian life and also the corporate life of the church.<h2 class=head2>The Church as the Bride of Christ Needing to Be One with the Spirit</h2><p>The church as the bride of Christ should be one with the Spirit (Rev. 22:17). Eventually, the whole church is one with the Spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &#8220;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&#8221; The entire church should be one spirit with the Lord. If all of us live, act, and do things with, in, by, and through the Spirit, the church will be absolutely one with the Spirit. This is the church, the Body of Christ, which the Lord desires.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:9-10; 1:9, 4-5, 10-11, 13, 19-23; 1 Cor. 10:32; Rom. 16:16b; 1 Cor. 14:33b; Acts 8:1; 13:1; 1 Cor. 1:2; Rev. 1:4, 11; 1 Cor. 14:5, 12</h1><p>We have seen the oneness of the Body of Christ, Christ, and the Spirit. In this chapter we shall consider the church. The oneness is of the church, Christ is for the church, and the Spirit is also for the church. We have seen that the Spirit is the Spirit of life and the life-giving Spirit. The Spirit is the reality-the reality of God, the reality of Christ, the reality of the word, and the reality of the resurrection of Christ. God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Spirit is the aggregate, the consummation, and the totality of the Triune God. The Father is the source of the Triune God, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow. The Son is the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit is the reality, the realization, of the Son. We have one God, but this one God has many aspects.<p>The church also has different aspects. The church is the unique, one, universal church. In practice, however, the church is expressed as the local churches. Therefore, the New Testament speaks of the church in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1), the church in Antioch (13:1), and the church in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2). Revelation 1:11 speaks of the seven churches in Asia-in Ephesus, in Smyrna, in Pergamos, in Thyatira, in Sardis, in Philadelphia, and in Laodicea. In practice these are many churches, but all the local churches are the one, unique church. The church has the local aspect, and it also has the universal aspect. Locally, the churches are many. Universally, the churches are one. The church is the unique Body of Christ, and this one Body is expressed in many localities as the local churches.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING ONE WITH THE TRIUNE GOD IN LIFE, NATURE, ELEMENT, AND ESSENCE</h2><p>Ephesians 4:4-6 says, &#8220;One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.&#8221; These verses mention four persons: one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father. They also speak of three matters: one hope, one faith, and one baptism. The three persons of the Divine Trinity-the one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father-are all one. The Father is in the Son (John 14:10), the Son is the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17), and the Spirit is the totality, the aggregate, and the consummation of the Triune God. The one Body is the mingling of the Triune God with the tripartite man.<p>We believers were born of God, and we are children of God (John 1:12-13). God is our Father in the divine life. To illustrate this, we may use the case of a father with three sons. Since the father is a person, the three children are also persons. To say that the father and his three children are the same in being persons is correct, but there is only one father. His children do not share in his fatherhood. They are all the same in being persons, but they are not all the same in the fatherhood. Among the four persons, only one is the father. The father is distinct; he is the unique father. The three children are the children of the father. They are not the father, but persons of the father.<p>In like manner, we have one God and Father, and this one God has many children. We are not God in His fatherhood; however, we are God&#8217;s children. As God&#8217;s children we were born of God. We have God&#8217;s life, God&#8217;s nature, God&#8217;s element, and God&#8217;s essence. In this way we are the same as God, but we are not the same as God in His Godhead. Since we have been born of God, we can say that we are divine in life, in nature, in element, and in essence. The church is the same as God in the divine life, in the divine nature, in the divine element, and in the divine essence.<p>This is why Paul ranks the Body with the Spirit, with the Lord, and with God the Father. All four are divine. God the Father is divine; the Lord is divine; the Spirit is divine; and the Body is divine. The Body is divinely human and humanly divine. The church is human, but it is divinely human. The church is divine, but it is humanly divine. The standing of the church, however, is not in humanity. The standing of the church is in divinity. The church is the Body of Christ because it has the divine life, nature, element, and essence. Paul said, &#8220;One Body and one Spirit.&#8221; The Body has been regenerated with the Spirit as its essence. This means that the church is humanly divine.<p>In a meeting of the church, we may have the boldness to declare that we are humanly divine. However, after the meeting, a husband may complain to his wife. When the husband complains, is that the church complaining? This complaining one, this natural person, is not part of the church. In the church there is no room for any natural person. Colossians 3:10 and 11 point out that in the new man, the church, there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, and free man, but Christ is all the members of the new man and in all the members. In the church, the new man, there is only room for Christ. He is the new man, His Body (1 Cor. 12:12). There is no Chinese, Texan, or Californian in the church. The church is not merely human but divinely human.<p>The church is the one Body of Christ with the one Spirit as its divine essence. Paul said in Ephesians 4:3, &#8220;Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit.&#8221; Then in verse 4 we see that the church is the &#8220;one Body.&#8221; The oneness of the Spirit is in the Body. The essence of the one Body is the one Spirit. This essence is of the one element, and the one element is the &#8220;one Lord&#8221; (v. 5). The one element is of the one source, who is the Father in His divine life with the divine nature. The element of this source is the one Lord, Christ, and the essence of the element is the Spirit. The essence, the extract, of Christ as the divine element, is the Spirit. The Spirit is the extract of Christ.<p>We may use watermelon as an illustration of this. In order to eat watermelon, one must cut it into slices. Then when the slices are eaten, they become juice. The juice is the extract of the slices, and that extract is the essence. Today the Spirit is the extract, the essence, of Christ as the element. Christ is the element of the source, who is the Father. The Father may be likened to the watermelon, Christ to the slices, and the Spirit to the juice. When we drink the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13) as the juice, we enjoy Christ as the element and the Father as the source.<p>The Body is the issue of the Spirit who is the essence, the Lord who is the element, and the Father who is the source. The church is the issue of the Triune God. In Ephesians 4:4-6 there are four persons-the one God and Father, the one Lord, the one Spirit, and the one Body. The church as the Body is the issue of the essence, the essence is the extract of the element, and the element is of the source. The issue of the three of the Divine Trinity is a fourth entity-the Body of Christ. The Father is divine, the Son is divine, the Spirit is divine, and Their issue is also divine. The issue of the Triune God is the church as the Body of Christ.<p>In China when I was young, I was told that the church was a physical building with a high tower and a bell. That is certainly not the church. I was corrected by the Brethren when I was with them. They taught me strongly that the church is the assembly called out by God. They taught that this was the meaning of ekklesia, the Greek word for church.<p>Later, I left the Brethren and came into the Lord&#8217;s recovery. When I was in the church in Shanghai, Brother Nee helped us to see that the church is not just a congregation called out by God and gathered together. In one message he pointed to the brothers and sisters and said, &#8220;The church is Christ in you, in you, in you, and in you. The church is Christ in the sisters, in the brothers, in me, and in all of us. The totality of this Christ is the church.&#8221; His speaking opened my eyes.<p>Without Christ, there is no church. We may be called a congregation of Christians, but if we do not have Christ within us, we are not the church. The very constituent of the church is Christ. Before we were saved, we were not the church. After we were saved, we became the church. Once we were not the church, but today we are the church. What is the difference? The difference is that in the past we did not have Christ, but today we have Christ. Regardless of how weak we may be, as long as we have Christ, we are a part of the church.<p>Therefore, the church is Christ mingled with us. Sometimes the divine essence of Christ becomes very bright and manifested in us. At other times, the human part becomes very prevailing to such an extent that we do not look like the church. When we come to a meeting, Christ may be so shining among us. After the meeting, however, the husband may complain to his wife, and the wife may complain to her husband. This is not the church.<p>The church is the issue of the Triune God: the Father embodied in the Son, the Son realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit mingled with us. Therefore, in Ephesians 4, there are the Father, the Lord, the Spirit, and us, the Body. This is not to make ourselves deified, to make ourselves God. We are divine only in life, in nature, in element, and in essence, but not in the Godhead. Only one in this universe is God in the Godhead-that one is the Triune God.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH BEING OF GOD&#8217;S ECONOMY AND OF GOD&#8217;S GOOD PLEASURE</h2><p>The church is of God&#8217;s economy (Eph. 3:9-10). The word economy is used in Ephesians 1:10 and 3:9. Verse 10 of chapter one speaks of &#8220;the economy of the fullness of the times,&#8221; and 3:9 says, &#8220;And to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is.&#8221; In Greek the word oikonomia has been anglicized to the present-day word economy. Oiko means house or household, and nomos means law. Thus, oikonomia is a kind of household law, household government, or household administration. An administration implies arrangement. Furthermore, any kind of administration is a plan.<p>The church is also of God&#8217;s good pleasure (Eph. 1:9). Our God is a living God. He is a living person who has a desire, a pleasure, and a will. He wishes to do something. What He wants to do, what He wishes to do, is His will. Based upon His desire and His wish, His will, He made a plan, and that plan is His household administration, His economy.<p>He exercises Himself in this household administration as a Father. He is the Father administrating His own household. We believers are His children. He has a big family, which Galatians 6:10 calls &#8220;the household of the faith.&#8221; In this universe there is a family of faith, including the chosen Israelites and the church. Both were chosen by God to be His folks, His household. Among these folks, the great Father has an administration.<p>In His administration God planned to have a group of human beings made in His image in order that this group of human beings might become a corporate vessel to contain Him. Therefore, this vessel must be in the same form as He is. A round container is made to contain something round. The container must be in the form, in the image, of the content. This was why God made us in His image. We are the container made in the image of God, who is to be our content.<p>In His economy, His household administration, He arranged and decided to make man not only in His image but also with a spirit as a recipient to receive Him as the Spirit. God decided that man should be in His image with a spirit to receive Him as life, signified by the tree of life (Gen. 2:7-9). Man was to eat the tree of life, to take God into him as life. However, man did not take in God. Instead, man became fallen. Eventually, in the New Testament, Jesus came and told us that He was both the life (John 14:6) and the tree, the vine tree (John 15:1). When we put these two things together, we realize that He is the life tree. The life tree is not a tall pine, which we cannot reach. The life tree is a vine spreading through the whole earth and so available to us. The tree of life in Revelation 22 is Christ, growing in the river of the water of life (vv. 1-2). The river of water of life is the Spirit. Christ grows in the Spirit and even as the Spirit.<p>We have the Spirit within us as the essence of the Body of Christ. The essence is of the element, the Son, and the element is of the source, the Father. The issue of the Father as the source, of the Son as the element, and of the Spirit as the essence is the church as the Body of Christ. Taking the Triune God into us as our life makes us the church.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH BEING CONSTITUTED OF GOD THE FATHER&#8217;S NATURE AND LIFE, GOD THE SON&#8217;S ELEMENT, AND GOD THE SPIRIT&#8217;S ESSENCE</h2><p>The church is constituted of God the Father&#8217;s nature and life, God the Son&#8217;s element, and God the Spirit&#8217;s essence (Eph. 1:4-5, 10-11, 13). Ephesians 1:4 and 5 say that God the Father chose us to be holy and predestinated us unto sonship. For us to be holy, to be sanctified, we need His nature. In the whole universe, nothing is holy except God Himself in His divine nature. Only the Father&#8217;s divine nature is sanctified, holy. God wants to make us holy, sanctified. Therefore, He has to impart His holy nature into us. The Father also has predestinated us unto sonship. For Him to make us sons to participate in His divine sonship involves His life. If He did not impart His life into us, we could not be His sons. Therefore, for us to be sanctified, to be holy, means that we have God&#8217;s holy nature; for us to be His sons means that we have His life. Ephesians 1:4 and 5 indicate that God the Father as the source imparts His nature and life into His chosen people.<p>Ephesians 1:7-12 speaks of the Son&#8217;s redemption. The Son brings us into Himself as the element and the sphere into which we have been redeemed. He redeemed us out of the &#8220;trash can,&#8221; and the destination of His redemption is Himself. He redeemed us out of sin, out of the world, and out of the tyranny of Satan into Himself as the element and sphere. By this redemption we, the fallen sinners, have been put into Christ as our element and sphere.<p>With Christ as our divine element, we have been made the inheritance of God (v. 11). We were lost, fallen, corrupt sinners. Corrupt sinners cannot be God&#8217;s inheritance. But we corrupt, sinful people have been redeemed into Christ. Christ is now our element and our sphere, in which and with which we have been made a treasure unto God to be His inheritance. Christ as the divine element has been imparted into us.<p>Ephesians 1:13 says that we were also sealed with the Holy Spirit. The Father&#8217;s nature and life, the Son&#8217;s element, and the Spirit&#8217;s essence are imparted into us by the sealing. When a seal with sealing ink is stamped on a piece of paper, the ink saturates the paper. The ink as the essence gets into the sealed material. We are the sealed material, and the Spirit brings the essence of the divine element of the divine source into us.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH BEING THE ISSUE OF THE TRIUNE GOD TO BE THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p>Eventually, the sealing Spirit makes us the issue of the Triune God to be the organic Body of Christ (Eph. 1:19-23). We are the issue of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, which is the &#8220;inking&#8221; of the Triune God into us. The Father&#8217;s life and nature, the Son&#8217;s element, and the Spirit&#8217;s essence are dispensed into our being to saturate us thoroughly. Then we become the issue of the dispensing of the Triune God. We are the issue of the essence, the element, and the source. We are the issue of the Triune God, and this issue is the church, the Body of Christ. The Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the essence of the Body. Our Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-is in the Body.<p>We, the church as the issue of the Triune God, are the same as He is in the sense that we have His life, His nature, His element, and His essence. We are absolutely the same as He is in this respect, but not in His Godhead. We do not possess any part of the Godhead, but we do possess His life, His nature, His element, and His essence. We are divine in the sense of the divine life, the divine nature, the divine essence, and the divine element, but not in the sense of the Godhead.<p>We all need to understand the church and know the church to such an extent. This knowing and understanding of the church is what keeps us in the recovery. If we see this, we will never make any division and nothing will shake us. The church as the organic issue of the organic Triune God is altogether one. This is the oneness that no one can divide. The church is of God&#8217;s economy and is of God&#8217;s good pleasure. Furthermore, the church is constituted of God the Father&#8217;s nature and life, God the Son&#8217;s element, and God the Spirit&#8217;s essence through the sealing. The church is the issue of the Triune God to be the organic Body of Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH BEING THE CHURCH OF GOD, THE CHURCH OF CHRIST, AND THE CHURCH OF THE SAINTS</h2><p>The organically divine church is the church of God (1 Cor. 10:32), the church of Christ (Rom. 16:16b), and the church of the saints (1 Cor. 14:33b). In this church there is God, so the church belongs to God. In this church there is Christ, so the church belongs to Christ. In this church there are many saints, so the church belongs to the saints.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH BEING UNIVERSAL AS THE UNIQUE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p>The church is universal as the unique Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23). The Body is not an organization but an organism constituted with all the regenerated believers for the expression and activities of the Head.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH BEING ALSO LOCAL AS THE CHURCHES IN DIFFERENT LOCALITIES FOR THE UNIVERSAL EXPRESSION OF CHRIST</h2><p>The church is also local as the churches in different localities for the universal expression of Christ (Acts 8:1; 13:1; 1 Cor. 1:2; Rev. 1:4, 11). The church is universal and also local. The local churches in different localities are not merely for a local expression, but for the universal expression of Christ. All the churches express the same person-Christ. The local churches should express Christ universally, not just locally. If the church in a locality expresses only their locality, that is terrible. That makes them a local sect, a local division. They are a local church, but they do not express a &#8220;local&#8221; Christ. Christ is not a local Christ. God, Christ, the Spirit, and the Bible are not local. Some make the Bible local, they make God local, they make Christ local, and they make the Spirit local. They make everything local. In this case they have become local divisions, local sects.<h2 class=head1>GOD MOVING IN THE CHURCH AND THROUGH THE CHURCH</h2><p>God moves in the church and through the church. We are in such a church. Today God is moving in and through the church to Eastern Europe and Russia.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S PRESENCE, BLESSING, LIGHT, GRACE, LEADING, DEALING, STRENGTHENING, ESTABLISHING, AND BUILDING BEING ALL IN THE CHURCH</h2><p>God&#8217;s presence, blessing, light, grace, leading, dealing, strengthening, establishing, and building are all in the church. God&#8217;s presence is God Himself. God&#8217;s presence is in the church. We can enjoy God&#8217;s presence in our homes when we call, &#8220;Lord Jesus,&#8221; but this cannot compare to our enjoyment of the Lord&#8217;s presence in the church. In our home our enjoyment of the Lord&#8217;s presence is a small, individual portion. However, when we come to the church, we have a feast. This feast is like a Chinese feast with twenty-four courses. In the church we enjoy the Lord&#8217;s exhaustless presence. We also enjoy the fullness of His blessing, light, grace, leading, dealing, strengthening, establishing, and building.<h2 class=head1>AS CHRIST IS THE BELIEVERS&#8217; LIFE, SO THE CHURCH SHOULD BE THE BELIEVERS&#8217; LIVING</h2><p>As Christ is the life of the believers, so the church should be the living of the believers. Christ is our life; the church is our living. We should live Christ in the church.<h2 class=head1>THE BELIEVERS NEEDING TO LIVE CHRIST, WORSHIP GOD, AND SERVE OTHERS IN THE CHURCH</h2><p>The believers should live Christ, worship God, and serve others in the church. Our living Christ is in the church, and our worship to God is in the church. Our service rendered to others is also in the church. We have to practice such a church life.<h2 class=head1>EVERYTHING OF THE BELIEVERS BEING FOR THE CHURCH AND ESPECIALLY FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>Everything of the believers should be for the church and especially for the building up of the church (1 Cor. 14:4b-5, 12). Every part of our being must be for the church. Whatever we have and whatever we are, including things such as the way we dress and cut our hair, must be for the church and its building up. We should pursue after the excelling gift of prophesying, because prophesying can build up the church, the Body of Christ. We must pursue the excelling gift of prophesying to make the church excellent.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9; John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7; 1 Pet. 2:2; Heb. 10:24-25; Eph. 4:12; 1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 12, 23-26, 31, 39a; Acts 6:4; 4:31</h1><p>In the previous chapter, we saw that the church is divine in life, nature, element, and essence. In this chapter we want to cover another three portions from the Scriptures to confirm this truth.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH BEING GOD MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH</h2><p>First Timothy 3:15 says, &#8220;But if I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.&#8221; This verse tells us that the church has two functions-to be the house or household of God and to be the pillar and base of the truth. The church is the household of God to function as the pillar and base of the truth. The pillar supports the building, and the base holds the pillar. The church is such a supporting pillar and holding base of the truth. The church functions in these two ways: to be God&#8217;s house and household for God to have a place to express Himself and to be a supporting pillar and a holding base for the truth, the reality.<p>First Timothy 3:16 says, &#8220;And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: / He who was manifested in the flesh, / Justified in the Spirit, / Seen by angels, / Preached among the nations, / Believed on in the world, / Taken up in glory.&#8221; The mystery of godliness is the manifestation of God in the flesh. The manifestation of God in the flesh has two aspects. First, the manifestation of God was by one person. This was the individual manifestation of God in the flesh by Christ Himself. No doubt, verse 16 first refers to God&#8217;s incarnation. Christ as the incarnated God manifested God in His flesh.<p>But if we read the context of 1 Timothy 3:15-16, we can see that this manifestation of God in the flesh has another aspect, that is, the corporate aspect. The corporate manifestation of God in the flesh is the church. The church as the Body of Christ is the corporate Christ, the enlargement of Christ. Christ was the manifestation of God in the flesh, and He was increased, enlarged. Thus, the manifestation of God in the flesh was enlarged. We know this because verse 15 speaks of the church as the house of the living God. The house is something corporate. The church is presented in verse 15 as a corporate entity for God. The mystery of the manifestation of God in the flesh must be something related to the church as the corporate expression of God.<p>Verse 16 says that Christ in His manifestation of God was justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, and eventually taken up in glory. His being taken up in glory refers to His ascension into glory (Mark 16:19; Acts 1:9-11; 2:33; Phil. 2:9). According to the historical sequence, Christ was taken up in glory in His ascension to the heavens before, not after, He was preached among the nations. Verse 16 puts His being taken up in ascension after He was preached among the nations. Who or what will be taken up after the preaching of Christ? No doubt, the Body of Christ, the church, will then be taken up in glory. The Head was taken up to the heavens before the preaching of the gospel, but His Body, the church, will be taken after a long period of the preaching of the gospel. Therefore, verse 16 must refer to the rapture of the church. Here the manifestation of God in the flesh must be not only the individual Christ but also the church as the corporate Body of Christ. This means that the church is God manifested in the flesh.<p>We saw in the previous chapter that the church as the Body of Christ is the issue of the Triune God. God the Father is the source, the Son is the element, the Spirit is the essence, and the church is the issue. God in Himself is three in one, but He has now become one with His chosen people, making them the members of Christ. God has a desire and a good pleasure. He desires to dispense Himself into His chosen and redeemed people. He does not want to be alone. God does not like to be a bachelor. The Bible refers to God as the Husband and to His chosen and redeemed people as His bride, His wife.<p>In Genesis 2:18 God said that it was not good for man to be alone. Man needed a counterpart. A husband and wife are a complete person. The husband is one half and the wife is the other half. God created only one man. He considered Adam and Eve as one person (Gen. 1:27; 5:1-2). Genesis tells us that God created Adam. Eve, on the other hand, was a part of Adam. God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, opened his side, took one of his ribs, and built that rib into a woman by the name of Eve. Then God brought Eve to Adam to be his counterpart (Gen. 2:21-23). Before Eve was brought to Adam, God brought all the animals before him. However, Adam did not find one that matched him. Then God put Adam to sleep and used his rib to build up a woman in the same form as Adam. When he woke up he realized that this one was his counterpart who matched him (v. 23).<p>God in eternity past was also a bachelor, needing one to match Him, and that one had to be something out of Him. In the Bible, both in the Old and New Testament, God&#8217;s chosen people, His elect, are likened to His wife. In the Old Testament, Isaiah 54:5 declares that God was Israel&#8217;s Husband. In Jeremiah 2:2 the Lord speaks of the bridal love between Him and His chosen people. In the New Testament, the church is considered as the counterpart of Christ. Ephesians 5 says that the church is the wife of Christ. Paul says in 2 Corinthians 11:2, &#8220;I betrothed you to one husband.&#8221; At the end, the conclusion, of the Bible, Revelation 22:17 speaks of the Spirit and the bride. The Spirit is the Husband, and we, His elect, are His counterpart, His bride. The Triune God in Christ as the Spirit and the church composed of His chosen and redeemed people are a universal couple. As the wife of Christ, the church comes out of her Husband and goes back to her Husband to be one entity with Him. The church has the same life, nature, element, and essence as her Husband; therefore, in this sense, the church is divine.<p>Although we were sinners, we have been redeemed out of our sinful position and sinful situation. We are now redeemed ones. God has put Himself into us, making us one with Him and also making Him one with us. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &#8220;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&#8221; This is the great mystery of godliness-God manifested in the flesh. We are the same as God in the divine life, the divine nature, the divine element, and the divine essence, but not in the Godhead.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH BEING THE CORPORATE CHRIST</h2><p>First Corinthians 12:12 reveals that the church is the corporate Christ. This verse says, &#8220;For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.&#8221; It seems that this verse should say, &#8220;...so also is the church,&#8221; because this verse is referring to the church as the Body. Instead it says &#8220;so also is the Christ.&#8221; This is not the single, individual Christ. This is the corporate Christ. All the believers of Christ are organically united with Him, are constituted with His life and element, and have thus become His Body, an organism, to express Him. Hence, He is not only the Head but also the Body. As our physical body has many members yet is one, so is this Christ. We cannot say that a head is the person and the body is not part of that person. If the Head is Christ, the Body surely is Christ. It is altogether right to say that the Body is Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH BEING THE NEW MAN WHERE CHRIST IS ALL AND IN ALL</h2><p>Colossians 3:10 and 11 say that in the new man, the church, &#8220;there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&#8221; This means that there is no room for any natural person in the church as the new man. There is only room for Christ. In the new man there cannot be any races; there can only be Christ. Christ is &#8220;all and in all&#8221; in the new man. He is all the members of the new man and in all the members. He is everything in the new man. Actually, He is the new man, His Body. The church as the new man is just Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h2><h2 class=head2>The Organic Way of Life</h2><p>Now we want to fellowship concerning the God-ordained way, the fifth emphasis in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. Today in the Lord&#8217;s recovery we are taking a new way, which is God-ordained. The God-ordained way to build up the Body of Christ is purely a matter of life. According to the record of Genesis 1, God created the plant life, the animal life, and the human life. Eventually, in Genesis 2 the highest life is revealed, and that life is God Himself as the tree of life (v. 9).<p>Genesis 1 is a record of life. It shows how the organic God of life created the earth in an organic way by producing life. First, He created the plant life, the lowest life. After creating the plant life, God created the animal life. This earth is beautiful in life, in the plant life and in the animal life. Last, God created man and told man to replenish the earth. Today the earth has been replenished by the Adamic race. That one man, Adam, eventually became a race of billions. Man&#8217;s replenishing of the earth took place in a gradual way. This is the organic way of life.<p>The artificial way is a quick way. Artificial things can be made quickly, but a child cannot be produced overnight. After a child is conceived, it takes nine months for it to be born. This is God&#8217;s way of life. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery we should not do anything in an artificial way by our art. We have to do everything in the organic way.<p>The Lord Jesus, of course, did many things in His ministry. He performed miracles and taught, but whatever He did was a kind of sowing. Sowing is organic. The Lord said that the kingdom of God was like a man who casts seed on the earth (Mark 4:26-29). After the seed is sown, it grows in a spontaneous way. Whatever the Lord did was not by His art. Whatever He did was a sowing. Mark 4 reveals that He actually sowed Himself. Eventually, Christ as the seed became a kingdom. Therefore, the kingdom is Christ. Christ sowed Himself as the seed, and this seed grows up to be the kingdom. This kingdom is still growing. When Christ comes back, He will become a great mountain (Dan. 2:35, 44). This great mountain is the eternal kingdom, which is Christ. Christ is the kingdom today, and Christ will be the enlarged, eternal kingdom in the next age. Christ has sown Himself into mankind so that He can grow up into the eternal kingdom.<p>The new way, the God-ordained way, is not to do anything by art, but to sow Christ as the seed organically. The new way is organic. The old way is artificial. The old way of gospel preaching is not organic. There are two ways to have flowers. One way is by sowing a seed; then the seed grows. It takes time for the seed to blossom into a flower. Another way to have flowers is by art. Many beautiful artificial flowers can be made within a short period of time. These artificial flowers may seem very genuine. Even some genuine flowers may not look as nice as the artificial flowers do. Today many Christians preach the gospel to sinners mostly by art with no life. Artificial things cannot produce anything. However, if we sow a seed and one flower grows up, many more seeds will fall into the ground. Then the next year there may be thirty more flowers. Organic things produce life.<p>We must take the organic way in our preaching of the gospel. When we go to people, we do not need to talk much. We need to exercise our spirit. Before going to contact people, we should have a time of prayer to call on the Lord until we are filled with the Spirit essentially within and economically without. When we are full of the Spirit, we can sow Christ as the seed into others with just a few words spoken by the Spirit. Because people have been enlivened by us, they will have the desire to enliven others. They will become a producing and begetting factor.<p>The old way of preaching the gospel is to make people Christians by our art. Then they become something artificial. We should not preach the gospel by art, but by the Spirit. Then we do not &#8220;make&#8221; a Christian, but we produce a Christian; we beget a spiritual child. They have the same life, the same Spirit, as we do, and they will go to beget others. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 4:15 that we may have a thousand teachers but not many fathers. Paul told the Corinthians that he had begotten them in Christ and by Christ. Begetting others organically in Christ and by Christ is what we have to learn to do. The God-ordained way is the organic way of life.<h2 class=head2>For the Believers to Preach the Gospel, to Serve and Worship God, to Meet, and to Build Up the Church, God Has Ordained in His Holy Word the Following Items as the Proper Way:</h2><h2 class=head3>Practicing the New Testament Priesthood for the Saving of Sinners That They May Become the Members of the Body of Christ</h2><p>To preach the gospel is to practice the New Testament priesthood for the saving of sinners that they may become the members of the Body of Christ (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9). We all are priests, but we may not be clear that the New Testament priesthood is to offer sinners to God. Without preaching the gospel, we could not gain sinners, and we would have no sacrifices to offer to God. Sinners are redeemed by receiving our preaching. When they are redeemed, they become acceptable sacrifices to God. In the Old Testament, all the priests offered sacrifices to God, and all those sacrifices typify Christ. Today in the New Testament, we offer the members of Christ to God. By receiving our preaching, the sinners become members of Christ, whom we offer as sacrifices to God.<p>If a person has been saved for a long time without having brought one person to the Lord, this is poor. This means that he is a priest without any sacrifices offered to God. Right after being saved, we should realize that we are New Testament priests who need to offer New Testament sacrifices to God. The New Testament sacrifices are the saved, redeemed sinners, who have become the members of Christ. Christ wants to have more members that He may be increased and enlarged. We need to preach the gospel in an organic way as the priests of the gospel.<p>The practice of traditional Christianity is not organic. Christianity teaches people to be so-called professional teachers and preachers. Many of them preach by their art. This is similar to making artificial flowers. Many false Christians can be produced by an artificial work. We should not do an artificial work. We should not go to serve the Lord with our art. Instead, we should go with the living Christ, the organic Christ, the Christ who is the Spirit. When we are filled with Christ as the Spirit, anyone who touches us will be enlivened because we will sow Christ into them.<p>To sow Christ into others needs much prayer. Even when we do pray, however, we may pray in an inadequate way. In order to preach the gospel effectively, we should take down the names of our relatives, cousins, in-laws, and acquaintances. We may have twenty-five cousins and in-laws. We should not pray in a general way for them by saying, &#8220;Lord, save my cousins and my in-laws.&#8221; The Lord needs to hear a definite name from us. We should pray, &#8220;Lord, in these three months, to whom should I go to enliven?&#8221; The Lord will lead us. We should not take too many names. We can concentrate on two or three, and we can pray for them day and night. Sometimes we may have to fast and pray for them with tears.<p>All mothers know the labor and toil involved in delivering a child. In order to bring forth spiritual children, we have to labor by praying and fasting with tears. Maybe after one month of praying, we would go to see someone. Our going should not be a kind of following our own thought. Our going must be a following of the Spirit. The Spirit will give us the right time to go. If we go two days too early, our cousin may not have an ear to hear us. But two days later something may happen to him. God will do something to sovereignly prepare him to be a good listener. Then we can say a few words to sow Christ as the seed into him. This is the organic way we need to learn.<p>Today we must have a turn from our skill, our art, to life. The way to turn is to pray, call on the Lord&#8217;s name, and confess our sins, our defects, and even all the mistakes we have made toward our relatives, neighbors, and all the ones whom we know and may have offended. We need to make a thorough restitution that we may enjoy the Lord as the life-giving Spirit. Then we can practice the New Testament priesthood by going to people to minister Christ.<p>We need to sow Christ into people, not just occasionally, but regularly according to a schedule. We need to make a schedule, giving the Lord at least three hours once a week for contacting sinners. We do not necessarily need to knock on &#8220;cold&#8221; doors, on the doors of people whom we do not know. We have relatives, neighbors, colleagues, classmates, and friends. We can even ask the brothers to recommend their acquaintances and make arrangements to meet them two weeks in advance. During those two weeks we need to pray every day. This is organic, not something religious. I have been speaking about the God-ordained way for about seven years, and I still have not yet seen a proper start in this way.<h2 class=head3>Feeding the Young Believers as a Nursing Mother That They May Grow in the Spiritual Life</h2><p>After someone gets saved through us, we should consider that he is our spiritual child. After a child is born, he needs to be fed in a regular way. We need to feed the young believers as a nursing mother that they may grow in the spiritual life (John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7; 1 Pet. 2:2). We can shepherd the new ones by calling them on the phone. A new one needs a lot of help. At the beginning, we should go to be with him at least three times a week to keep him, to retain him, to sustain him, to feed him, to strengthen him, and to comfort him. Then we can protect him, preserve him, and rescue him from many distractions because the devil is very busy.<p>The Bible tells us that when someone is saved, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God (Luke 15:10). Besides these positive angels, there are also the fallen angels and the demons. They surely are not happy about this person being saved, and they will work on him. The demons may cause this one to have a car accident. Then they would cause one of his friends to say, &#8220;You see, this is because you believed in Jesus. If you had not believed in this Jesus, you would never have had a car accident.&#8221; This shows how crucial it is for us to take care of the new ones, especially at the beginning of their salvation.<p>The Lord charged us in John 15 to go to bear remaining fruit (v. 16). In order to bear remaining fruit, we have to go to care for the new ones by shepherding and feeding them in a regular way. We cannot raise up a child in only three months. It requires much labor to raise up a new believer. We should exercise to always have two or three new ones under our care year-round.<p>We should not think that only some among us are full-timers. All the saints are full-timers. We should be full- timers who work for Christ, who go to our jobs for Christ, and who do everything for Christ. If we labor in the way of always having two or three new ones under our care, we can have two as remaining fruit each year. We will bring them not only to the Lord but also to the church.<h2 class=head3>Having Group Meetings for the Perfecting of the Saints</h2><p>Our group meetings also need to be carried out in an organic way. Perhaps a certain brother has been a Christian for twenty-five years and an elder for twelve years. He may go to a group meeting, considering that he is somewhat superior. Many in the meeting may be new ones. They do not know Genesis and do not understand Revelation. Since this brother considers that he is superior, he may take the opportunity to teach the Bible. However, this is not organic; this is this brother&#8217;s art.<p>This was the way of our group meetings in the past. This is wrong. A formal religious service void of life does not produce anything. When we come to the group meetings, we should just consider ourselves as living members of Christ. We may look to the new ones to get the help. We should have the attitude that we do not know anything. We only know one thing-to exercise our spirit. In the meetings we should exercise our spirit constantly. Then when the opportune time comes, we can speak something. Our speaking is the sowing, and whatever we say is the seed, Christ. We should minister Christ and sow Christ into the attendants. The Christ whom they receive will grow within them. This is the new way ordained by God.<p>Anything we do apart from Christ as the Spirit is vain religion. To go to a group meeting without any Christ, without any Spirit, is religion. We should be burdened for the group meeting. We may be so burdened that we would fast by not eating dinner. Instead, we would go to our bedroom and pray in a thorough way. Then we will go to the meeting with Christ, with the Spirit, with a living burden, and with a living word. We will not go with any pretense, and we will not try to show others that we are superior. We will go as a common member, waiting and looking for the proper time that the Lord would assign to us. When that time comes and we speak, Christ will come out, and the living word will enter into people as the seed and the Spirit. Such speaking will enliven and beget others. This is the proper group meeting.<p>Many of our group meetings today are old. We may say that we take the new way, but we walk the new way by the old steps. This does not work. To my observation, there are not many real starts of the new way in our group meetings. Some think that the group meetings are just a matter of dividing the large congregation into many groups. Although we can talk more freely in the smaller meetings, these meetings may be dead. The attendants may not have anything to say that is full of Christ as the Spirit. This is the old way.<p>We need to feed the new ones and also help them to practice the group meetings. The group meetings are for mutual fellowship, mutual intercession, mutual care, mutual shepherding, mutual asking of questions, and mutual answering for teaching. This is for the perfecting of the saints that they may participate in the work of the ministry, that is, to build up the organic Body of Christ (Heb. 10:24-25; Eph. 4:12). We need to lead the new ones into this kind of organic group meeting.<h2 class=head3>Teaching the Saints to Prophesy in the Church Meetings for the Building Up of the Church</h2><p>When we lead the new ones into the organic group meetings, they will spontaneously be educated and will be initiated into prophesying. We need to teach the saints to prophesy, that is, to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord, in the church meetings for the building up of the church (1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 12, 23-26, 31, 39a). Then the new ones will be living and functioning members in the Body of Christ.<p>In our labor with and for the Lord in His ordained way, we need to be like farmers who have the expectation of a yearly harvest. However, today many churches have very little increase. If we would receive this fellowship and practice the God-ordained way, we will definitely bring new ones to the Lord. We should not expect all the saints to take this way. This is impossible because some are too weak or unable. At least one-third of the saints can practice this way. If each gains two new ones a year, there will be a sixty percent increase.<p>In Christianity&#8217;s statistics there is not a record of a church that has a sixty percent increase every year. The most might be twenty percent. But today many churches have not had a twenty percent increase. We should pray in a desperate way for the increase of the church. Then we should practice the God-ordained way, the way the Lord has ordained for us.<h2 class=head2>The Three Means for the Success of the God-ordained Way- by Prayer, by the Spirit, and by Constant and Regular Contact with People</h2><p>I have given three means for the success of the God-ordained way: by prayer (Acts 6:4), by the Spirit (Acts 4:31), and by constant and regular contact with people. It is only by these three means that we can be prevailing. We must budget our time to contact people and pray for them. We need to pray for two or three and labor on them for about one year. Then we will gain some definite fruit.<p>We may contact people by personal visiting, by telephone, and by written correspondence. There are many ways to contact people. In principle every contact is &#8220;door-knocking.&#8221; When we contact people in the Lord, we are knocking on the door of their heart. We should not think that the practice of door-knocking is merely a physical thing. To visit people is door-knocking, to call people is door-knocking, to write a letter is door-knocking, and to send some booklets is door-knocking. Anything that reaches people to touch them with Christ, is a kind of door-knocking.<p>While we are carrying out the God-ordained way to gain the increase, we should not neglect the church meetings. To carry out this way, we must budget our time and give the Lord certain hours every week to go to contact people to save them, feed them, shepherd them, teach them, perfect them, and eventually bring them up so that they can speak for the Lord. Then the church will receive the building up.</body></html>
