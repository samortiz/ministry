This book is Malachi. In 1:2 it says, &#8220;I have loved you, says Jehovah.&#8221; This is a fact. Yet the Israelites said, &#8220;How have You loved us?&#8221; This is obsession. The word which came out of the mouth of the Israelites was different from ordinary lying. They were not afraid to say to God, &#8220;How have You loved us?&#8221; This proves that they sincerely believed in their heart that God had not loved them. They did not believe the facts, they took falsehood as truth. This is being obsessed.<p>Malachi 1:6 says, &#8220;A son honors his father, and a servant his lord. Therefore if I am a Father, where is My honor? And if I am the Lord, where is My fear? says Jehovah of hosts to you, O priests who despise My name.&#8221; This is God&#8217;s word. Yet they said, &#8220;How have we despised Your name?&#8221; They did not fear Jehovah, yet they believed that they had not despised His name. This is obsession.<p>Verse 7 says, &#8220;You offer defiled bread upon My altar.&#8221; This is God&#8217;s word. Yet they said, &#8220;How have we defiled You?&#8221; They were wrong, yet they believed that they were right. This is obsession.<p>Malachi 2:13 says, &#8220;And this second thing you do: You cover the altar of Jehovah with tears, with weeping and sighing, so that He no longer regards the sacrifice or receives it with pleasure from your hand.&#8221; These are facts. Yet they said, &#8220;For what reason?&#8221; (v. 14). They did something wrong, yet they did not believe that there was such a thing. This is obsession.<p>Verse 17 says, &#8220;You have wearied Jehovah with your words.&#8221; This is a fact. Yet they said, &#8220;How have we wearied Him?&#8221; They wearied God, yet they did not believe that they had done so. This is obsession.<p>Malachi 3:7 says, &#8220;From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statutes and have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you, says Jehovah of hosts.&#8221; This is God&#8217;s word. Yet they asked God, &#8220;How shall we return?&#8221; It seems as if they had never gone away from God&#8217;s ordinances. They believed that they did not need to turn any further. This is obsession.<p>Verse 8 says, &#8220;Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me.&#8221; This is God&#8217;s word. Yet they said, &#8220;How have we robbed You?&#8221; They robbed God, yet they believed that they had not done anything. This is obsession.<p>Verse 13 says, &#8220;Your words have been strongly against Me, says Jehovah.&#8221; This is a fact. Yet they said, &#8220;What have we spoken against You?&#8221; Their words had been strong against God, yet they believed that they had not done anything. This is obsession.<h2 class=head2>Examples of Obsession in the Gospel of John</h2><p>The New Testament also has a book which speaks a great deal about obsession. It is the Gospel of John. The following are some examples.<p>John 5:43 says, &#8220;I have come in the name of My Father, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him.&#8221; The Israelites seemed to be perfectly at peace with their conscience when they rejected the Lord Jesus. This is obsession.<p>Verse 44 says, &#8220;How can you believe when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that is from the only God?&#8221; They did not seek the real glory; they sought that which is not glory. What is this? This is obsession.<p>John 7:19 says, &#8220;Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill Me?&#8221; This is the Lord&#8217;s word. The crowd answered, &#8220;You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill You?&#8221; (v. 20). They were obsessed by their lies. Otherwise, they would not have said, &#8220;You have a demon.&#8221; They wanted to kill the Lord, yet they were so obsessed that they thought the Lord had a demon.<p>Verse 27 says, &#8220;But we know where this man is from; yet when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from.&#8221; This is again lying to the point of obsession.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Holy Spirit and Reality &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
