<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. To Express in His Humanity the Bountiful God in His Rich Attributes through His Aromatic Virtues</H2><P>In His full ministry in the first stage of His incarnation, Christ also expressed in His humanity the bountiful God in His rich attributes through His aromatic virtues. No one can deny that the human virtues of Christ were aromatic; even when non-Christians read the four Gospels, they sense that the Jesus recorded in these books was a sweet and fragrant One, whose virtues were aromatic. This is because He expressed in His humanity the bountiful God in His rich attributes.</P><P>Our attributes are the characteristics of what we are. For example, losing one's temper easily, loving to speak first, speaking carelessly and irresponsibly, and acting lightly are human attributes. On the other hand, behaving cautiously, speaking rationally, doing things purposefully, and not acting irresponsibly or carelessly are also human attributes. Our God has His attributes, and His attributes are rich because He is great and bountiful. He is love, light, holiness, and righteousness. These rich attributes were expressed by the Lord Jesus in His humanity to become the aromatic virtues in His humanity.</P><P>The record in the four Gospels shows that when some people brought their little children to Jesus that He might lay His hands on them and pray, they were rebuked by the disciples. But Jesus said, "Allow the little children and do not prevent them from coming to Me, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens" (Matt. 19:13-15). The Lord's way was different from the disciples' way. The disciples did not act in accordance with God's attributes. God has chosen the foolish, the weak, the lowborn, and the despised of the world (1 Cor. 1:27-28); throughout the generations according to His love, forbearance, and forgiving grace, He has called, one by one, those who are weak and have nothing, who are like the little children. In this way Christ expressed God's attributes in His humanity.</P><P>God is bountiful; hence, He is rich in His attributes, His characteristics. Only some of the rich attributes of the bountiful God were lived out by the Lord on the earth in His humanity and seen by men as the virtues expressed in His humanity, yet these virtues were so aromatic and sweet. In His human living Christ expressed the bountiful God mainly in His rich attributes, that is, in the unsearchable riches of what God is.</P><P>Furthermore, Christ in His humanity expressed God through His aromatic virtues by which He attracted and captivated people. The record in Matthew 4 shows us that when the Lord Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Peter, John, and James, who were either fishing or mending nets with their fathers. Then He called them, saying, "Come after Me." Immediately they followed Him, giving up their net mending, abandoning their boats, and forsaking their fathers (vv. 18-22). To this day I still do not understand why it is that when He simply said, "Come after Me," the disciples forsook everything to follow Him. I truly believe that at that time the Lord Jesus must have displayed an aromatic power in His countenance and His voice which could really attract and captivate people.</P>
