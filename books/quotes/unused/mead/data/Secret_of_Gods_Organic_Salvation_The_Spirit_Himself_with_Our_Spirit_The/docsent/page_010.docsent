   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Feeding in Shepherding</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The feeding in God s organic salvation also includes the feeding in shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 21:15 the Lord Jesus charged Peter, saying, Feed My lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 16 He said to him, Shepherd My sheep, and in verse 17 He went on to say, Feed My sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we do not know how to shepherd, we will not be able to feed others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The main purpose of the small groups and the vital groups in the church life is not merely to take care of one another but to shepherd one another.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You shepherd me, and I shepherd you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You are a sheep under my shepherding, and I am a sheep under your shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is mutual shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In shepherding others, we should first cherish them in order to make them happy, and then we should feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This kind of feeding is the real shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Shepherding implies teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is indicated in Ephesians 4:11, which says that the Head has given to the Body some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This verse does not say some as shepherds and some as teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, this verse says some as shepherds and teachers, indicating that they are the same persons in a single category.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, teaching and shepherding go together.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Good Shepherd</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ as the One who came that the believers may have life John 10:10b is the good Shepherd giving His life for redeeming the believers and rising up to feed His sheep with Himself as the green pasture that they may have life more abundantly vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>2-4, 9, 11, 14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In John 14:16 the Lord Jesus said, I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This other Comforter is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord was the first Shepherd, and the Spirit, the second Comforter as His continuation, is also a Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Shepherding All His Believers</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ shepherds all His believers and guides them to springs of waters of life Rev 7:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In eternity future Christ will be our eternal Shepherd guiding us to springs of waters of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Great Shepherd</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ as the great Shepherd shepherds God s flock in resurrection for their perfection to do God s will within them Heb 13:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The believers can do God s will within them by being perfected through the shepherding of Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today Christ is in resurrection, and He is shepherding us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When He shepherds us in this way, we do God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Shepherd of the Believers Soul</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ within the believers is the Shepherd of the believers soul to oversee them 1 Pet 2:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is our Shepherd not only outwardly but also inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He shepherds us from within, in our being, in our soul, to oversee us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our soul needs Christ s shepherding with His observation, oversight, and correction so that we may be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This kind of shepherding also involves feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our soul needs Christ s shepherding with His feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Chief Shepherd</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ is the Chief Shepherd who will reward the faithful elders, who shepherd God s flock faithfully, with the unfading crown of glory for their encouragement 1 Pet 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ Himself is the Shepherd, and He has established elders in the churches and has charged them to shepherd the flock of God v. 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The first responsibility of the elders is to shepherd God s flock, the church, not to take care of business affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The elders should leave the business affairs to the deacons, the serving ones, and devote more time to shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, in most of the churches the elders are doing the deacons work and are neglecting the matter of shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the elders do not trust the deacons to care for the business affairs, including bookkeeping, the elders will not have time to shepherd the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I would urge every elder to visit at least one saint every day.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Without the elders shepherding, the church cannot be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All the believers, regardless of their stage of spiritual growth, need shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even a brief word spoken to a saint after a meeting will comfort, encourage, and strengthen that one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I would encourage all the elders to contact the saints one by one over a period of a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the elders are faithful to do this, the church will be reconditioned.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The elders shepherding will recondition the church.</S>
