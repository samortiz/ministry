   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Bird's-eye View</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we would understand the emphasis in the Gospel of John concerning the death of Christ, we need to have a bird's-eye view of the entire Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The twenty-one chapters of this Gospel are very well arranged in sections.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the first eleven chapters we have a number of cases.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus did many miracles or signs.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John selected some of these miraculous cases and used them in his Gospel to signify that the Lord Jesus, God incarnate, is adequate to meet the need of every person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No matter what our need may be, no matter what our case may be, the Lord Jesus is able to meet our need and take care of our case.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we have pointed out, the cases selected by John begin with regeneration and end with resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first case, that of Nicodemus, is a case of regeneration, and the last case, that of Lazarus, is a case of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In principle, regeneration and resurrection are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, apart from resurrection no one can be regenerated; on the other hand, regeneration is related to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the cases found in the first eleven chapters of this Gospel are in the principle of regeneration by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, all these cases involve the problem of death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These cases reveal that the Lord Jesus is fully qualified and adequate to meet all the needs of those in death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is the unique One who can meet these needs because only He can impart the divine life into people in order to resurrect them and thereby regenerate them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The raising of Lazarus stirred up the people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They heard that a Nazarene had resurrected a man who had been in the tomb for four days.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No doubt, that was a great miracle, a miracle of miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John 12:17 and 18 say, "The crowd testified therefore, that was with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason also the crowd went and met Him, because they heard that he had done this sign."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The crowd was excited and gave the Lord Jesus an enthusiastic welcome when He came into Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even when certain Greeks heard about the Lord, they wanted to see Him 12:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Philip and Andrew came to the Lord and told Him about the desire of these Greeks to see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To Philip and Andrew, this was a golden time for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we had been in the Lord's place in chapter twelve of John, we probably would have said, "How wonderful that the people are welcoming Me. This is the golden time for Me to be exalted." However, according to verses 23 and 24 the Lord responded in a very different way: "Jesus answered them saying, The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I doubt that Philip and Andrew understood what the Lord was saying.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Perhaps they thought that when the Lord used the word "glorified" He was saying that He would be exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But then the Lord went on to tell them that He would fall into the ground and die as a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This word may have been a disappointment to these disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord indicated to them that He would not accept the welcome of the crowd.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead, He would fall into the ground and die in order that He might be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we see this, then we shall know the answer to the question concerning what aspect of Christ's death is emphasized in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Multiplication</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In John's Gospel the emphasis regarding the Lord's death is not redemption; John's emphasis is multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As we pointed out in foregoing messages, this multiplication, revealed in 12:24, is the Lord's glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord Jesus was God incarnate, God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord's divine life with His divine nature was concealed in the flesh and confined by it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As such a One, He had come for a single purpose to reproduce Himself, to have Himself multiplied, through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This multiplication can be illustrated by a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Life is confined and concealed within the grain.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How can a grain of wheat be multiplied?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How can the life within it be released in order to produce an increase of the grain?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The only way is for the grain of wheat to fall into the earth and die.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord used this illustration, taken from the realm of nature, to show the purpose of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Referring to Himself as a grain of wheat, the Lord indicated to His disciples that He came to be multiplied, to be reproduced, as a grain of wheat that falls into the ground and dies and then grows up to produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In chapter one of John's Gospel we have the Lord as the Lamb of God, and in chapter twelve we see Him as a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>John 1:29 says, "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lamb of God is for redemption, for taking away sin from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But a grain of wheat is for the releasing of life so that the one grain may be multiplied into many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now we can see that, whereas the Lamb of God is for redemption, the grain of wheat is for multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The multiplication of the grain is its glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a grain of wheat remained alone and did not fall into the earth to die, it could never be multiplied or glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But after a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it eventually will grow up to be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Through this multiplication, one grain brings forth many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This multiplication of a grain is also its glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A field of ripe wheat has a certain kind of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All the ripe ears of wheat are the glory of the grains of wheat that has been sown into the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, the multiplication of a grain of wheat is its glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord's divinity and divine life were confined within the shell of His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, it was necessary for this shell to be broken so that the divinity and the life confined and concealed within it might be released and multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For this purpose, the Lord Jesus went to the cross and died there.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The truth concerning the Lord's death for multiplication is much neglected by Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All Christians realize that the Lord's death has accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is wonderful to realize this, but this realization is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord's death was not only for redemption, but was also for multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Gospel of John is not focused on redemption; rather, this Gospel is focused on multiplication.</S>
