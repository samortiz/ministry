<p>Approximately three thousand years after man fell, God promised through Isaiah the prophet, saying, &ldquo;Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel&rdquo; (Isa. 7:14). At this point, God&rsquo;s promise of redemption, as revealed in Genesis 3, was made even clearer. It revealed that the coming Christ would not be born of a married woman but of a virgin. Furthermore, this Christ, who was to be born of a virgin to become man&rsquo;s Savior, is God with us, Immanuel. Christ&rsquo;s coming among men was God&rsquo;s coming among men; Christ&rsquo;s becoming man&rsquo;s Savior was God&rsquo;s becoming man&rsquo;s Savior. In other words, God Himself was born of a virgin to be man&rsquo;s Savior.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Child Being Born to Us,<br />
a Son Being Given to Us</h2>
<p>Although our Savior Christ is spoken of as being a child, He is called Mighty God, and although He is the Son, He is called Eternal Father (Isa. 9:6). This promise of God clearly tells us that the coming Christ is man yet God, the Son yet the Father. Christ is the union of God and man, the Father manifested in the Son. His coming joined God and man and brought God to man. His coming manifested the Father in the Son and revealed the Father to man. Although He came to be a man, He was God. Although He came to be the Son, He was the Father. Although He came to be a child on the earth, He was the Mighty God in heaven. Although He came into time to be manifested as the Son, He was the self-existing and ever-existing Father (Rev. 1:8; Exo. 3:14-15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">His Goings Forth Being from Ancient Times,<br />
from the Days of Eternity</h2>
<p>Micah 5:2 says, &ldquo;His goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity.&rdquo; Christ was born in Bethlehem (Matt. 2:1, 6), but His source was in eternity. He came forth from eternity into time. He was God in eternity, but He came to be a man in time. Although He was a man in time, He belonged to eternity. Although He belonged to eternity, He came to live in time. He is both God and man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living as a Man on the Earth</h2>
<p>The various details of the living of this God-promised Redeemer as a man on the earth are presented clearly by Isaiah the prophet. According to Isaiah 53:2, the Lord Jesus grew up like a tender plant, and He was born into a humble home, like a root out of dry ground, without an abundant supply or a comfortable living. Furthermore, according to the same verse, He had no attracting form nor majesty that people should desire Him. According to 52:14, His visage was marred more than that of any man, and His form more than that of the sons of men. He did not have a beautiful appearance.</p>
<p>He was despised and forsaken of men and was like one from whom men hid their faces, and God&rsquo;s people did not esteem Him. He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief (53:3), because He bore our sicknesses and carried our sorrows (v. 4). He did no violence, nor was there any deceit in His mouth (v. 9). He was without sin and never sinned (Heb. 4:15). However, men oppressed Him and afflicted Him, and He was cut off. He was oppressed, and He was afflicted, but He did not open His mouth. He was like a lamb that is led to the slaughter and like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers. He did not speak for Himself and did not defend Himself (Isa. 53:7-8). He was numbered with the transgressors at His death, yet He interceded for the transgressors (v. 12). Man&rsquo;s evil intention was to assign Him a grave with the wicked, yet God arranged for Him to be with the rich in His death (v. 9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Causing Him to Bear Our Sin</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus was afflicted and cut off to bear our sin; Jehovah caused the iniquity of us all to fall on Him (v. 6). Although He had done no violence, nor was there any deceit in His mouth (v. 9), Jehovah was pleased to crush Him, to afflict Him with grief. He made Himself an offering for sin (v. 10). He was stricken and cut off because He bore our sin (vv. 8, 12). He was wounded because of our transgressions, and He was crushed because of our iniquities so that by His chastening we may have peace, and by His stripes we may be healed (v. 5).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Scene and the Pain of His Death</h2>
<p>In Psalm 22 God prophesied quite vividly through David concerning the scene and the pain of Christ&rsquo;s death (vv. 1, 7-8, 12-18). In this psalm the Spirit of Christ, speaking as Christ Himself, describes His dreadful surroundings and His inward and outward pain when He was being put to death. Violent and wicked men surrounded Him, encompassing Him like mighty bulls (v. 12). They opened their mouth at Him, like a ravening and roaring lion (v. 13). A company of evildoers enclosed Him like dogs, and they pierced His hands and feet (v. 16). They divided His garments to themselves and cast lots for His clothing (v. 18). They looked, they stared at Him (v. 17). All who saw Him derided Him; they sneered at Him and shook their heads, saying, &ldquo;He committed himself to Jehovah; let Him rescue him; / Let Him deliver him since He takes pleasure in him&rdquo; (v. 8).</p>
<p>  He delivered up His life on the cross, like water poured out, and He hung on the cross for six hours with His bones being out of joint (v. 14). He counted all His bones (v. 17). His heart was like wax, and it was melted within Him because He was judged by God, burned by God&rsquo;s wrath on our behalf (v. 14). His strength was dried up like a shard, and His pain was so severe that His tongue was stuck to His jaws (v. 15). At the end of His crucifixion, God forsook Him because He bore our sins, and He cried out, saying, &ldquo;My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?&rdquo; (v. 1). Finally, God put Him in the dust of death (v. 15).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> </body></html>
