   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>DIFFERENT WAYS TO READ THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should read our Bible during two different periods of time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should have two copies of the Bible for these two occasions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One period can be in the morning and the other in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Or we can do both early in the morning by reading one way during the first half of our time and another way during the second half of our time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These two periods of time must be separate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the morning period or the first half of the early morning reading, we should meditate, praise, and pray as we read the Word, mixing our reading with meditation, praise, and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This period of reading is for receiving spiritual food and for strengthening our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not read too much during this time; three or four verses is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The afternoon time, or the second half of the early morning reading, should be longer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During this time, we should read for the purpose of learning more about God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If possible, we should have two Bibles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible used in the first period should not have any marks or notes written in it except dates, which we will mention later .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible used in the second period can contain whatever we have been touched with, either by jotting down notes or by circling or underlining words or passages.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible used in the first period can contain dates dates on which we came across a special verse, made a deal with the Lord, or had a special experience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should write down the date next to such a verse, indicating that we met God through this verse on that date.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not write down anything other than dates.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible used in the second period is for understanding, and we should write down all the spiritual facts we discover and the light we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now let us discuss the way to read the Bible during these two periods of time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A. Meditating on the Word</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>during the First Period of Time</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Concerning meditating on the Word, I think the best thing is for me to quote George M ller.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He said:</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It has recently pleased the Lord to teach me a truth, irrespective of human instrumentality, as far as I know, the benefit of which I have not lost, though now, while preparing the fifth edition for the press, more than fourteen years have since passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The point is this: I saw more clearly than ever that the first great and primary business to which I ought to attend every day was, to have my soul happy in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first thing to be concerned about was not how much I might serve the Lord, how I might glorify the Lord; but how I might get my soul into a happy state, and how my inner man might be nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For I might seek to set the truth before the unconverted, I might seek to benefit believers, I might seek to relieve the distressed, I might in other ways seek to behave myself as it becomes a child of God in this world; and yet, not being happy in the Lord, and not being nourished and strengthened in my inner man day by day, all this might not be attended to in a right spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before this time my practice had been, at least for ten years previously, as an habitual thing to give myself to in prayer, after having dressed myself in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now, I saw that the most important thing I had to do was to give myself to the reading of the word of God, and to meditation on it, that thus my heart might be comforted, encouraged, warned, reproved, instructed; and that thus, by means of the word of God, whilst meditating on it, my heart might be brought into experimental communion with the Lord.</S>
