<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Christ as the Servant of Jehovah<br>Fulfilling All That Isaiah and Israel Are<br>as the Servant of Jehovah</H2><P>In Isaiah 49 whatever is spoken concerning Isaiah and Israel is also spoken concerning Christ. This means that Christ as the Servant of Jehovah fulfills all that Isaiah and Israel are as the servant of Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. From the Womb Jehovah Forming Him<br>to Be His Servant</H2><P>From the womb Jehovah formed Him to be His Servant, to bring Jacob back to Him, so that Israel would be gathered to Him. He will be glorified in the sight of Jehovah, and His God will be His strength (v. 5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God Setting Him as a Light of the Nations</H2><P>Verse 6 is God's word to Christ as the Servant of Jehovah. In this verse, God says, "It is too small a thing that You would be My Servant/To raise up the tribes of Jacob/And bring back the preserved of Israel;/I will also set You as a light of the nations/To be My salvation unto the ends of the earth." We have seen and are continuing to see that Christ is the great light to the nations and that He is God's salvation extending to the ends of the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Jehovah's Word<br>to the Despised One,<br>the One Abhorred by the Nation,<br>the One Subjected to Tyrants</H2><P>In verse 7 we have Jehovah's word to Christ as the despised One, the One abhorred by the nation, the One subjected to tyrants. Jehovah says to Him, "Kings will see and arise,/And princes will bow down;/Because of Jehovah, who is faithful,/The Holy One of Israel, who has chosen You." Christ was subjected to tyrants when He stood before Pilate and submitted to him. He, the Creator, was thus subject to a created human being. To this One who was subjected to tyrants such as Herod and Pilate, kings will arise and princes will bow down because Jehovah, who is faithful, has chosen Him.</P>
