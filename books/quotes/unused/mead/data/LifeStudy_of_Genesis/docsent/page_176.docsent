   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To Believe in God's Word</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Enoch had lived sixty-five years, he begat a son giving him the name Methuselah 5:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The name Methuselah has a prophetic significance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It means "when he is dead it shall be sent."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That was a prophecy of the deluge.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By naming his son Methuselah, Enoch prophesied of the coming judgment of the deluge.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Undoubtedly he did this by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He received God's revelation and did not set His will aside.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was inspired with the divine will and learned of the coming judgment upon the entire ungodly generation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I believe that the prophecy recorded by Jude has a double fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Enoch might have believed that the judgment of the deluge was the Lord's coming with ten thousands of His saints to execute judgment upon the ungodly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, this prophecy of his, like others in the Old Testament, has a double fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first fulfillment by the coming of the deluge was a prefigure of the second fulfillment by the Lord's second coming as referred to in Jude.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If Enoch had not prophesied of the Lord's second coming, Jude would not have mentioned it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By Enoch's prophecy we can realize that he learned that God was going to execute His judgment upon the ungodly generation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, he named his son Methuselah, indicating thereby that when his son died, God's judgment would be sent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Enoch begat Methuselah at the age of sixty-five.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, Enoch's prophecy regarding the flood was uttered when he was sixty-five years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thereafter, day and night, Enoch was expecting the fulfillment of that prophecy, and that expectation caused him to walk with God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although the whole generation and everything in it was ungodly, he himself did not dare to be ungodly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was holy and walked with God, hoping to be saved from God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Enoch held on to this expectation for three hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, the judgment did not come during that period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was not to come until nine hundred sixty-nine years after Methuselah was born.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The flood came in the year that Methuselah died.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Methuselah begat Lamech at the age of one hundred eighty-seven 5:25 , and Lamech begat Noah when he was one hundred eighty-two 5:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Noah was six hundred years old, the deluge was sent 7:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we add these three figures together, we arrive at a total of nine hundred sixty-nine years, the age at which Methuselah died.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The deluge came nine hundred sixty-nine years after Enoch prophesied regarding it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It occurred, as was prophesied, in the year Methuselah died.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If Enoch had remained on the earth until the actual time of the deluge, he would have waited nine hundred sixty-nine years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But, he only had to wait three hundred years, for God seemed to say, "Enoch, it is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I will not leave you on earth to exhaust your patience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Come with Me and stay with Me."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And Enoch was taken up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hebrews 11:5 indicates that after he was taken, people looked for him, but could not find him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In a sense, I love Methuselah.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In another sense, I do not love him, because he lived too long.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He had the longest life of anyone recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To live such a long time would surely exhaust our patience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>So we pray, "Lord, come quickly."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although the Lord told us that He is coming quickly Rev 22:7, 12, 20 , over nineteen hundred years have passed, and He still has not come.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is a principle here and it is this: our natural patience must be exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you are awaiting the Lord's coming in your natural patience, you will be disappointed and exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Forget about the matter of time and simply walk with God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>With Him, a thousand years are as one day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you say, "Lord Jesus, it is too long," He will say, "It has not been two days yet.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To Me, a thousand years are as one day.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Why are you so impatient?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You are impatient because you don't walk with Me. If you walk with Me, if you have Me with you, you won't care for the time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The earth will be the same as heaven because when you have Me, you are in heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The most crucial matter that is revealed in Genesis 5 concerning our living is that we need to walk with God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In order to walk with God we must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We also must believe in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then we need to seek Him out, live according to His Word, follow Him, and walk with Him by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Eventually, we shall be taken up.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We shall be raptured to escape death the ultimate issue of man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The End of This Genealogy</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The genealogy of the saved ones recorded in Genesis 5 ends in a very promising way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It concludes with the name of Noah, which means "comfort" or "rest" 5:28-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>With the birth of Noah, the family of salvation finds comfort and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The family of the saved people is not a family without hope; it is a family full of comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This means that the family of Noah is full of expectation, comfort, and rest.</S>
