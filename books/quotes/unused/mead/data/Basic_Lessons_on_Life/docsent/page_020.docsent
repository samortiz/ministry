   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BECOMING ONE WITH MAN AND ALIENATING MAN FROM GOD BY DEADENING MAN'S SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Satan became one with man and alienated man from God by deadening man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here we have to use Ephesians 2:1, 12, and 4:18.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In these verses we can see man was deadened in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By this, man was alienated, cut off, from God and even cut off from the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can see that man had fallen to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The mind was poisoned, the emotion was poisoned, the will was poisoned, and the body was poisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Also man's spirit was deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The whole being of man thus became contaminated, deadened, and alienated from God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>XII.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>USURPING MAN TO FRUSTRATE GOD FROM FULFILLING HIS PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Satan usurped man to frustrate God from fulfilling His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today mankind is in the hand of Satan, and Satan uses the whole human race to do his will, to frustrate God from fulfilling God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man was made by God to fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But man fell into the usurping hand of Satan, so man is being used by Satan to fulfill Satan's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the plot of Satan to spoil man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to stress that Satan spoiled man by contaminating man's soul and deadening his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We also have to point out that man's body was ruined to become the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the flesh, man's ruined body, there is sin, and when this sin acts it is "the evil" Rom 7:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sin and evil are the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The term sin mostly denotes the nature, whereas the term the evil mostly denotes the activities.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Actually, both sin and the evil are Satan himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Satan himself in our flesh is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When sin acts, it is the evil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can see that the whole human being became utterly fallen by eating the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The soul was contaminated, the spirit was deadened, and the body was ruined.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to pray so that we can have the best utterance to present these things to the new ones and to the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I feel this is quite crucial for the coming lessons on life.</S>
