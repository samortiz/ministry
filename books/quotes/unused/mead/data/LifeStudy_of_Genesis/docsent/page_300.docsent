   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>c The Changing of Human Names</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Immediately after the divine title was revealed to Abraham, God told him that his name was to be changed 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not only must God's title be unveiled to us, but our names need to be changed, meaning that we need to be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The name Abram has to be changed to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we pointed out in the previous message, Abram means exalted father and Abraham means the father of a great multitude, that is, a multiplied father, "a father of many nations."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you had a choice between being highly exalted and being multiplied, which would you choose?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead of being highly exalted to the heavens, would you choose to be flattened out and multiplied?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to our natural concept, we would all desire to be exalted rather than multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is troublesome to be multiplied, for the more children we have, the more problems we have.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everyone likes to be exalted; however, God does not want to exalt us but to multiply us, making us a father of a great multitude.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Are you willing to be multiplied?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is impossible for an exalted father, who is only good for exhibition, to fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For the fulfillment of God's purpose, there must be a multitude.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>So we need to be multiplied, not exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today most Christians want to be spiritual giants, and religion encourages them in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I was young, I was taught and encouraged to be a spiritual giant, but I was never told that I needed to be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While our natural tendency is to be exalted, God wants to change our name from the father of exaltation to the father of multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How our concept needs to be changed!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is the multitude that God wants?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is the church, a corporate people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God needs the church, the multitude.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you remain by yourself, God has no way of fulfilling His purpose through you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For the sake of the fulfillment of His purpose, we need to forget our old name and be changed from being exalted to being multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be multiplied is for the fulfilling of God's purpose, not for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not merely for the increase or for the expansion of our work; it is for God to be expressed and represented on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To change the name is to change the person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not that originally I am a frog and that now you change my name to fish.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although you may call me a fish, I am still a frog.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The title has been changed, but the person has not.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The proper changing of the name is the changing of the person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When our person has been changed, the change of title follows.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the church life today we do not need any exalted fathers; we need many multiplied fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is why the Lord has led us to have the communal life in so many homes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not easy for a family to live together with several young people because we all like to have our privacy and stay by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the husbands are honest, sometimes even living with their wives is too much for them, and they would prefer to be left alone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But if we all stayed in private, how could we take care of the young ones?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The changing of names helps the communal life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why does the increase take place so slowly in the proper church life?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Simply because we lack the fatherhood and because there are not enough homes to take care of the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need the multiplied fathers' homes to take care of the multitude.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One of the qualifications of an elder is hospitality 1 Tim 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you are not hospitable, meaning that you are unwilling to take care of others but only care to be individually holy, you are not qualified to be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we are going to be hospitable, our name must be changed from the father of exaltation to the father of multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only a multiplied father is hospitable.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The more we take care of others, the better it is for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the real changing of names and the real changing of our person.</S>
