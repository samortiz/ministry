We frequently had large meetings with just a few people doing everything. This kind of condition made me very concerned. Therefore, I received a burden from the Lord and saw that we must overturn these things. The first thing we must do is to overturn the big meetings.<p>However, I do not have the intention of entirely stopping the big meetings. Changing the system should not be like jumping from the seventh floor straight to the ground floor, without using stairs at all; that is to commit suicide. Rather, for the past two years we have been changing the system and simultaneously building a staircase on which all the saints can walk down properly instead of lingering on the seventh floor with a wait-and-see attitude. What we have seen before the Lord is that one day in the Lord&#8217;s recovery there will be mostly home meetings and not many big meetings. Perhaps once or twice a month the whole church will come together for a meeting like the one mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14. That will be such a glorious situation!<p>In the past we had a meeting at a big stadium with ten thousand people, which was marvelous and impressive. However, if there were no home meetings as supporting pillars, that kind of big meeting would not be a glory but a deformity. We must have home meetings before we can have big meetings. Our labor is not in the big meetings but in the home meetings. It is only after we have constantly labored in the home meetings that one day we can have a big meeting as a harvest. This is the same as the children of Israel celebrating the Feast of Tabernacles after laboring throughout the entire year to obtain a harvest which they enjoyed as a feast before God when they came together. It is also like the American Thanksgiving Day which was originally celebrated after the harvest was taken in; the families gathered together to enjoy the fresh produce in their homes. Perhaps we could follow the children of Israel to have three big meetings in each year of labor and work. These would be times of joy and exultation.<p>This is why we must change our concepts. I say again that we are not jumping off a building and committing suicide; rather, we are willing to turn around and walk down the stairs. Instead of finding excuses for yourself, you should follow everyone else down the stairs. The Chinese all used to wear long gowns, but today it is difficult to find anyone in a gown, because everyone is now wearing Western clothes. This proves that people can change. Even though it is difficult to come down the stairs, as long as we are willing to walk, we will be able to slowly get down to the ground floor.<p>If we are to walk, however, we must change our concept. In the past our Lord&#8217;s Day meetings had two or three hundred people, and the speakers were all experienced and spoke every sentence well and in a touching way, so that even the gospel friends were helped. Now as we are changing the system, the big meetings have become small and the saints are scattered. Moreover, our baptisms are not what they used to be, with baptism interviews to determine if the candidates are clearly saved before we baptize them. Now we just need to preach The Mystery of Human Life to them, lead them in prayer, and baptize them in the bathtub after they have believed. It seems that the change in system is turning the church into a mess. Please do not be worried. Instead, you must wait patiently. I believe that after three to five years many homes will have been raised up as the supporting pillars of the church.<p>Things in the physical world are symbols of things in the spiritual realm. A country&#8217;s strength and a society&#8217;s health are entirely determined by the strength and health of the families. According to the Chinese tradition, the children are raised by the parents in the homes; they are taught, they live, and they grow up at home. Then after they are married, they do not need to ask an expert on &#8220;family-forming&#8221; for guidance. They know spontaneously how to form a family and build up a career. This is because they have been with their parents since they were small and therefore have a thorough understanding of what a family is all about. This is just what we have seen before the Lord. The Christian &#8220;society&#8221;-the church-is not composed of church buildings. Rather, it is constituted with households. The household is the basic unit of salvation and service, and it is the constituting element of the church.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
