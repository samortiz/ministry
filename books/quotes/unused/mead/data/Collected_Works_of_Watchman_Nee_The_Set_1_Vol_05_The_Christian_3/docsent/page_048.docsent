   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VERSE TEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 10:"Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the third promise, but its blessing is in no way less than the other promises.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It refers again to the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Because you have kept the word of My endurance."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word of endurance here means two things: 1 the word of Christ's long endurance in waiting for His own glorification, and 2 the word of the Christian's endurance in waiting for His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The two Epistles to the Thessalonians particularly cover the matter of the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We see the word "endurance" used in two ways in these two books.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The "endurance of Christ" in 2 Thessalonians 3:5 refers to the first meaning as mentioned earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the present age of grace, Christ is waiting with endurance for the day for Him to receive the power.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The "endurance of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ" in 1 Thessalonians 1:3 refers to the second meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is what the Christians hold in hoping for the Lord Jesus' return.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Formerly the Lord only said, "You...have kept My word" Rev 3:8 , but now He elaborates to say, "You have kept the word of My endurance."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not an ordinary word, but the word of endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not an ordinary kind of endurance, but an endurance that has to do with the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Father had said to the Son: "Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool" Psa 110:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For this reason He said, "But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but the Father only" Matt 24:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At present He is taking the attitude of waiting for the Father's work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If He is willing to do something, surely He can lay hold of the iron scepter and crush all opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, He is waiting for God to fulfill His plan for His people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus is waiting in order that more grace can be dispensed to the world and that more souls can be gained for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ's endurance and His power stand on equal ground.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He wants to rule, yet His days of ruling have not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is willing to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The words "the word of My endurance" speak of Christ's rejection in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From the day of His ascension to the time He will appear again is the period of Christ's endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because Christ endures in this way, there is a "word of endurance" for the saints to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is now waiting for His kingdom; He is also calling His believers to wait and to endure with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While the world rejects His rightful authority, He is waiting for another day when He will assume His position.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this reason, His saints should join with Him in His rejection on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since He has been despised and rejected by man, we should not seek to reign among men!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should disassociate ourselves from the politics of the world and should wait exclusively for the Lord who will replace the present world government with His own power and kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should submit ourselves to the God-appointed authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, we must not seek to reign in the place where Christ is rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Neither can we help Christianity secure honor in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are the dust-ridden companions of Christ and should only hope to bear His reproach in this present age.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The position that Christians take today must be the same position that Christ took when He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we go beyond this, it means that there are different natures between Christ and the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we do not understand this, we will inevitably be anxious in the present sinful and confused age.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since we know that our Lord is enduring all kinds of incessant opposition, why do we worry about it?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This kind of thought is the most noble thought for our spiritual life, for it joins us to a deeper union with Christ and a more intimate fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How wonderful it is to think that we are standing on the same ground as He is!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How our heart rejoices!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ promises His believers that they would share with Him in His future glory.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yet to share with Him in one position means that we share with Him in all positions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are joined to His power, we must also be joined to the word of His endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who will be glorified with Him must first suffer shame with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We cannot hope to have one without having the other.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even if we put the motive of being glorified aside, is it not unfaithfulness if we shrink from suffering shame for Him in the world?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Alas, Christians have tried too much to save their faces!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Why is there the need for so much self-respect?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How should our heart feel when we consider the smiting of His face and the spitting at His cheek?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May we send out more welcoming invitations for shame and ridicule!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although we do not gain any sympathy from the world or the nominal church, does not the word "I have loved you" satisfy our heart?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the love of Christ is the guide to our walk, surely we would be willing to stand on the ground that Christ is on.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Is there any lover who does not want to be where his loved one is?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we cherish Christ in our heart, we will keep the word of His endurance, because this is where He is at present.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now is the time of trial, separation, cleansing, and sifting.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For this reason we should wait.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>His attitude must be our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Since He is waiting, we should also be waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Since we are already satisfied with His present love, we should therefore wait to acquire with Him, rather than gain anything ahead of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Where there is love, there is the sharing of things between the ones loved.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If the love of Christ has not satisfied our hearts, of course, we will seek for man's honor apart from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But who can say if this is now the case?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This union with Christ is the proper position of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord does not want to see us falling from this position.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>May He cause us always to realize that we are forever joined to Him this way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Otherwise, His heart will not be happy, and our heart will not be satisfied.</S>
