   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST'S JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>UPON THREE CATEGORIES OF THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Finally, I would like to point out that in the book of Zechariah we can see Christ's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The vision of the flying scroll 5:1-4 , the vision of the ephah vessel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>5-11 , and the vision of the four chariots 6:1-8 are visions of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ's judgment will be carried out by the four chariots which come forth from between two mountains of brass v. 1 . Brass here signifies judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although the two mountains of brass do not signify Christ, they are nevertheless closely related to Christ, for He has been appointed by God to carry out the judgment upon the living and the dead John 5:22; Acts 10:42; 17:31; 2 Tim 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the one hand, Christ is the Redeemer and the Savior; on the other hand, He is the Judge.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the Judge, He will carry out God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to Zechariah, Christ's judgment over the earth will be upon three categories of negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First, He will judge stealing 5:3b, 4b .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Stealing signifies sins toward man, which are the issue of greed and covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second, Christ will judge the matter of swearing falsely by Jehovah's name vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>3c, 4c .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Swearing falsely by Jehovah's name signifies sins toward God, which are the issue of a wrong relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who swear falsely in this way do not deal with God in faithfulness and honesty.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Third, Christ will judge the entire human government signified by the great human image in Daniel 2.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He, the last Craftsman, will come as the stone cut out without hands and smash this great image from the toes to the head.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, He will clear away from the earth all stealing, all false swearing by Jehovah's name, and all of human government.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to see how Christ's judgment is related to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should be careful not to steal from others in any way, and we should also be careful to be honest and faithful with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then we will be right with man and also right with God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Finally, we need to see that Christ will come as the stone cut out without hands and will smash the entire human government and thereby bring in the eternal kingdom of God.</S>
