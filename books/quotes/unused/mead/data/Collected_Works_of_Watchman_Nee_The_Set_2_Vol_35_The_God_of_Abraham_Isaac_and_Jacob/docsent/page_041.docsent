   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>JACOB'S DISCIPLINE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God had to deal with a person like Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After he received his blessing through deception, he could no longer remain at home.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He knew that his brother would kill him, and he could only escape.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He ran away like a refugee.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Away from Home</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He cheated his brother out of the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet in the end he received God's disciplining hand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The result of his fleshly activity was discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God exercises more discipline on those who are clever, capable, shrewd, and resourceful.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, we must thank the Lord because through His discipline, Jacob received the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From this time on, God continued to discipline him so that he would be blessed through the discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was forced to leave his father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He left his parents and set out on his lonely journey to Padan-aram.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Camping at Bethel</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Genesis 28:10-11 says, "And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He camped in the wilderness with stones for his pillows.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His life of discipline had begun.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verses 12-14 say, "And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And, behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth; and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These were the words we read in Genesis 12.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God now gave Jacob the promises He gave to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When did God give these promises to Jacob?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He gave them while he was still supplanting and before his fleshly and natural life was dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God was able to say these words to him because He was confident.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He knew that Jacob could not run away from His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One day God would finish His work of making him a vessel for His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our God is a confident God; He can reach His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a man were doing this, he surely would have worried.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Jacob was such an unreliable person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What would happen if he became involved in some kind of trouble?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But God had absolute assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was able to say, "In thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God had decided.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our hope lies in God's trustworthiness, not in our trustworthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our usefulness depends on God's will, not on the strength of our will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brothers and sisters, we have to learn to know Him as the God who never fails.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At Bethel Jacob heard God speaking to him in a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God did not rebuke him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He did not say, "Look at yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What have you done at home these days?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If it were us, we would have rebuked Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But God knew Jacob; He knew that Jacob was a clever, crafty, and supplanting person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He knew that Jacob had more energy than others and a stronger disposition than others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Toward such a person, rebuke and exhortation do not work well.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God took Jacob into His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Through operating in Jacob's environment, God chipped off a corner here and a corner there; He carved a little here and a little there.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If He cannot finish His work in one year, He will do it in two years.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If He cannot finish it in ten years, He will finish it in twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God will always finish His work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When God brought Jacob back to Bethel after twenty years, he was changed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God's promise to Jacob actually exceeded the promise He gave to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It also exceeded the promise He gave to Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Jacob received something from the Lord that Abraham and Isaac did not receive.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God went on to tell Jacob, "And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of" 28:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hallelujah, praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The promise that God gave to Jacob was unconditional.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He did not say, "If you make Me your God, I will make you My people.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you keep My conditions and commandments, you will receive My promise."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>An unconditional promise means that God would always have a way to deal with Jacob whether he was good or bad, honest or cunning.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God knew that one day He would fulfill "that which I have spoken to thee of."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our God is a God who cannot fail.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We cannot stop God, and we cannot cause Him to stop halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If God has chosen us, He will definitely fulfill His promise in us.</S>
