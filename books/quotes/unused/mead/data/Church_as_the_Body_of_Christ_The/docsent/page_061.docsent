   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING ABLE TO LEAD OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ONLY BY THE GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The matter of group leaders is the same in principle as leading new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The co-workers and responsible brothers are often limited in their capacity to lead people; a person may be able to lead fifty people but not sixty.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This can be compared to schoolteachers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A teacher may be able to teach a class of fifty students yet unable to teach a class of eighty students.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If he tries to teach the eighty students, thirty will definitely be neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, anyone who desires to lead people must grow in life; only through the growth in life can our capacity to lead people be increased.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THOSE WHO LEAD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>NEEDING TO PERFECT OTHERS TO LEAD</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The responsibility to lead people should be given to others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The responsible ones should not be the only ones who can lead people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should always give others the responsibility to lead people so that they can learn to lead people as well.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all need to learn this spiritual lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From the perspective of the work, the most useful worker or responsible brother is one who can work and bring others along to do the same work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, we can lead others to be group leaders, and we can also teach others to lead people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way, if there are presently a few of us taking the lead and helping others, in a year there will be five or six people who can help others to be responsible ones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to do this we need to learn some lessons and receive the Lord s breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A person who has been broken can work by himself and can also bring others along to work with him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One who has not been broken will always think that his work is the best.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not easy for such a one to bring others along; he needs a deeper breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>CONCERNING THE SERVICE IN REGARD TO MARRIAGE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is difficult to serve the saints in regard to marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are caught between two difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One is the matter of our Chinese culture, and the other is the matter of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because of these two matters it is difficult to help the brothers and sisters concerning their marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In principle, we need to lead them in life and instruct them in truth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This requires us to have fellowship with them in order to lead them in their marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, the age we are in poses many difficulties in regard to marriage; on the other hand, we need to pay attention to the spiritual aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are situated between these two difficulties, and this is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The older brothers and sisters in the church should bear some responsibility to help young people in the matter of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In doing this, they should not put in their own feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>People with too many feelings cannot touch the matter of marriage; everything will become a big mess, and there will be no ability to clear up the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second, we must have a genuine care for people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not serve in this matter simply because we love to do this kind of thing and have a feeling for this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, it should be that we are concerned about this matter before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We care for the young people, and we desire to serve them in the matter of marriage according to our burden.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must have this kind of concern; otherwise, we cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Third, we need to have patience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some brothers and sisters expect an instant success when they introduce two young saints to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are upset and discouraged when the introduction fails.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, we need to have patience; to be patient means not to be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we desire to serve the young people, we should help them in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should observe them, look at every aspect carefully, and help them little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This cannot be rushed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, we need to have patience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Fourth, we must be honest yet wise.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Honesty and wisdom are not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some people become false in their attempt to be wise, and some people expose others through their honesty.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A wise person may try to describe a brother as being perfect and a sister as being flawless, but after the two are married, they realize that this is not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>An honest person may be honest to the point of having no discernment; he may disclose certain hidden matters related to both the brother and sister.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This honesty negates the intention of introducing the brother and sister.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is truly difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, we all need to learn some lessons; we need to be honest yet wise, and we need to be wise yet honest.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Nevertheless, we should not say, Since this is so hard, we should forget about it and not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are not men of wood how can we not have feelings?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Besides, we also need to be patient and wise, yet because this is difficult, we cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we say this, we will miss the opportunity to experience the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today we truly need a group of older saints who can rise up and care for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They should do this properly, according to the manner of the saints, the teaching of the Bible, and the real spiritual condition of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This requires them to meet these four conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we introduce the brothers and sisters in a careless way, there will not be much benefit; on the contrary, it may even cause them to suffer loss spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Concerning the time for prayer, we should use it properly and be calm before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Excited prayer may not cause people to touch spiritual matters; however, this does not mean that we are against excited prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We all know from our experience that it is mainly when we are calm that we can touch spiritual reality and the things that are of God in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we are in an excited and lively mood, we may suffer more loss than we gain.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, when we pray together, we should try our best to be calm before the Lord and seek the Lord with a calm spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Of course, sometimes the Holy Spirit may do something exceptional and stir us up to become excited, but generally speaking, we should not be overly excited when we are together.</S>
