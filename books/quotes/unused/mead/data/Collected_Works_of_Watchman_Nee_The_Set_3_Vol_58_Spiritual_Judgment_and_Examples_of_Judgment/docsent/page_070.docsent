   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 50 Date:August 31, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER G. C.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the age of thirteen I accepted the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I asked to be baptized, I was told by the brothers that I was too young and that I should wait until I was older.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Later my father apprenticed me to a shop, and I worked there for three years.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once, I was in a certain place, and I observed that only the rich were allowed to be baptized, and I became very angry.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Later, a brother baptized me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the time I was baptized, I was hoping that heaven would open to me and that a voice from heaven would witness that I am a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I confess that I am wicked and selfish like Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A brother told me that we have to leave the superficial things and seek after the deeper things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I thought I was very zealous, but there was no depth to my condition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later I realized that I had not learned that many lessons and that I was actually quite superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the age of twenty-one I prayed to the Lord and asked for a good sister.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord heard my prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At that time the brothers and sisters meeting with me asked me to give messages.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I was afraid to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I feared that some of the things I said would be beyond my own power to carry out.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the responsibility of the Lord's Day morning message was on my shoulder, and I had to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The business affairs in the church became more complicated, and I found no one to coordinate with.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There were many opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even I had many plans.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It seemed I was taking the way of the recovery, yet I found that I could not make it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I was monopolizing the work of the church, and I felt that the responsibility was too heavy for me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later I heard that there was a young peoples' meeting in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that time I was twenty-four years old, and I wanted to join it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Later there was a conference in Foochow, Fukien, and I was able to attend.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I heard that we have to exercise our spirit, I wished so much that I could be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then I heard that we have to fall down before God, and I became quite discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Afterwards, it seems that I received a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I know that it is the Lord who is doing everything and that I cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to know this brother, we have to consider him in relation to his age.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The measure of a person's spirituality can only be expected to be commensurate with his age.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Spiritual condition has much to do with age.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If there are strong peculiarities in us, we need strong breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, some people are particularly strong in their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Others are particularly strong in their mind or their will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These are not problems related to age, and they require the Lord's particular breaking, without which there can be no building.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, a cancerous tumor in man has nothing to do with his weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It grows because his body is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is a kind of cell that grows independently without restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The whole body resists other diseases, but the whole body feeds this disease.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It takes up all the nutrition in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The same is true in the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christians who are strong in certain areas require all kinds of supply to support these areas.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These strong areas are actually cancerous cells.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Anything you put into them will be used to feed such cells.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, God has to destroy them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We do not detect in our brother anything that is inordinately strong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is a clever man, and his thoughts are clear and logical.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Perhaps these elements are somewhat too active in him, but we cannot say that these are his strong spots.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They are not his problem.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is only in his twenties, and the Lord has given him only so much.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At the present time, we cannot expect him to see too much.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Young ones have to realize that older ones are more experienced in many areas.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At least the Holy Spirit has been in the older ones longer than in them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Within the constraints of your age, you should take in as much as you can.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is good for our spiritual pursuit to be compatible with our age.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In spiritual things, it does not mean that one gets more by seeing more.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Spirituality has much to do with time.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As much as you can, you should try to understand the things you have heard here.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whatever you do not understand, you should wrap up and store away in your closet.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At a certain point they may become useful to you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You have to ask the Lord to show you when they will become useful to you.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Now you know that it is not that easy and simple to be a Christian and to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This time on the mountain, I have shown you a little of the "scene behind the veil."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now you can ask the Lord to bring you into deeper depths.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The thing that worries me the most is when young people or young co-workers think that they have reached the peak.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You still have a long way to go.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you can cover this journey in twenty, thirty, or forty years, it would be exceptional grace from God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Moses saw the land of Canaan on Mount Pisgah, but he was not able to enter.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The knowledge, doctrines, and teachings that one receives in his mind, but which have never been wrought into his being, are easily erased.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They are like letters written with a pen of reed; as soon as trials come, they are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Such a person has not actually possessed these things.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord has to burn them into you before they are unerasable.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When pottery is burned in a kiln, a picture that is drawn on it will not easily be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Our brother has an advantage of still being young.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He has a straight course ahead of him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If he continues to learn and gain experience in the next twenty years, he will become very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Today he is only twenty-four years old.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We cannot ask too much of him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If he were forty-four years old, my word to him would be much stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Our brother must fall down totally at least once.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You do not have to be concerned as to how you will fall.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You have to ask the Lord to show you what He showed Moses on Mount Pisgah.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Sister M. E. Barber once said that whoever places himself in the Lord's hand will be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You have to pray that the Lord will deal with you without reservation, and you have to place yourself in His hand without reservation.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Consecration is not a light matter.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The Lord will break us according to our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If you want to be a whole piece of bread, you should not offer yourself to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Once you offer yourself to Him, you should not murmur and complain when you are broken.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Only those who are broken bring blessing to others, because they have changed; they have become rich, and they are now able to nourish many.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Peter tells us not to consider it strange when fiery ordeals come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Those who consider it strange are short of light.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>There is nothing unusual in the Lord breaking us when we place ourselves in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This should be expected.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>During these few months on the mountain, you have to see that the discipline of the Holy Spirit is a lifelong spiritual pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is the only pathway to take.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We all must go through great trials.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>None of us can avoid this.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The clay has to be burned in the furnace.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>It is useless to merely paint something on its surface.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Every person whom God has greatly used has passed through fire.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>There is no ground for boasting in the spiritual pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>You still have a long way to go.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Whether or not you will be a rich person depends on how much experience you pass through.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The more experience you pass through, the more you will learn and the more supply you will have.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is like a doctor who gains experience through seeing a multitude of patients.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>He would be ineffective and inefficient if he only saw one patient a year.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The same can be said of the Christian pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We have to go through much experience before we become rich and before we have something to minister to others.</S>
