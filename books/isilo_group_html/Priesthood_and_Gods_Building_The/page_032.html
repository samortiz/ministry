<p>The Bible also shows that those who enjoy Christ have put on Christ. Galatians 3:27 says, &ldquo;As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&rdquo; Putting on Christ means being clothed with Christ. According to the Bible, no one among God&rsquo;s people was clothed more beautifully than the priests. From top to bottom, from inside to outside, from front to back, from left to right, everything that the priests wore typifies Christ, including the garment, the ephod, the breastplate, and the turban. This shows that the priests put on Christ in a thorough way. The ephod was made of &ldquo;gold thread, of blue and purple and scarlet strands, and fine twined linen, the work of a skillful workman&rdquo; (Exo. 28:6). A plate of pure gold on their turban was engraved with the words <em>HOLINESS TO JEHOVAH</em> (vv. 36-37). Pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet strands were sewn around the hem of the garment and bells of gold were sewn to the hem (vv. 33-34). These items are rich in meaning. Pomegranates signify the fullness of life. When a pomegranate ripens and breaks open, its red seeds are an expression of life in its fullness. The golden bells, which sounded out if the priests walked too fast or carelessly, signify that the voice of warning in the church has its source in the divine nature. From the top the expression of the priest is one of glory according to divine holiness, and from the bottom the expression of the priest is related to life and the voice of warning. When the priests were ministering, there was something to see as well as to hear.</p>
<p>The breastplate of the priests was enclosed with twelve precious stones (vv. 15-21). Twelve is the number of the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem there are twelve gates, twelve pearls, twelve foundations, and the names of twelve apostles and twelve tribes (Rev. 21:12, 14, 21). The measure of the wall is one hundred forty-four cubits (v. 17), which is twelve times twelve. In the New Jerusalem twelve is a significant number. It is amazing that there were also twelve precious stones on the priests&rsquo; breastplate.</p>
<p>The breastplate included two additional items: the Urim and the Thummim (Exo. 28:30). When I was young, I read a book written by a Jewish scholar, David Baron, entitled <em>The Ancient Scriptures and the Modern Jew</em> (1901). In this book there is a section on the significance of the Urim and the Thummim. <em>Thummim</em> means &ldquo;completers.&rdquo; There are twenty-two letters in the Hebrew alphabet, but only eighteen letters were used for the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. After the names of the twelve tribes were engraved on the breastplate, the remaining four letters were engraved on the Thummim, which was enclosed in the breastplate. In such a way all twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet were included on the breastplate. This is why <em>Thummim</em> means &ldquo;completers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the aforementioned book, <em>Urim</em> means &ldquo;lights,&rdquo; so the Urim was an illuminator. Although it is hard for historians and Bible scholars to determine what kind of illumination was associated with the Urim, when the high priest wore the breastplate before God to inquire of Him or to seek answers to difficult problems, some of the letters of the alphabet would become dim. The priest could then take note of the order of the dimmed letters to spell out words that conveyed God&rsquo;s intention. This is how Joshua identified Achan as the one who had committed a sin (Josh. 7:16-21).</p>
<p>The garments of the priests are rich in spiritual significance. We can only speak about them in a simple way. All the items of the priestly clothing relate to the expression of Christ. The food that the priests ate signifies the riches of Christ, and the clothing that they wore signifies the beauty of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TABERNACLE BEING SIGNIFIED<br />
BY THE CLOTHING OF THE PRIESTS</h2>
<p>The priestly garments, which speak of the expression of Christ, were made of the same material as used for the tabernacle. The curtains, the veil, and the screen at the entrance of the tabernacle, for example, were made with blue and purple and scarlet strands and fine twined linen, and the priestly garments contained these materials as well (Exo. 26:1, 31, 36; 28:8). The tabernacle had many items made of gold, and the priestly garments were made with gold thread (v. 6). Thus, in principle, the materials of the tabernacle, the dwelling place of God, were worn by the priests.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the priests are the dwelling place of God. First Peter 2:5 speaks of the believers &ldquo;being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood.&rdquo; Those who are being built into a spiritual house are priests. Hence, the priests are the dwelling place of God. Although the Old Testament type cannot convey this thought in a clear way, we should realize that the priests were joined to the tabernacle, and the tabernacle was borne by the priests. According to the Old Testament, the priests not only served in the tabernacle but also were one with the tabernacle. Even when the children of Israel were moving, all the items of the tabernacle were carried by the priests and the Levites. Hence, the tabernacle and the priests were inseparable. In God&rsquo;s eyes, the tabernacle was one with the priests, and the priests were one with the tabernacle; furthermore, the temple was one with the priests, and the priests were one with the temple. In the New Testament God&rsquo;s spiritual house, His dwelling place, is the built-up priests, and the built-up priests are His dwelling place, the church.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Priesthood and God's Building &nbsp; pg 32</div><br></body></html>
