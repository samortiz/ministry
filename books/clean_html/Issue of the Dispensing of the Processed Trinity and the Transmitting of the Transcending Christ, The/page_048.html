<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIVINE CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br>WITH THE BELIEVERS IN CHRIST</H2><P>The Body of Christ is the divine constitution of the Triune God with the believers in Christ. Ephesians 4:4-6 shows us the constitution of the three divine persons with all His chosen people. So we have the one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father mingled together.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A MINGLING OF<br>DIVINITY WITH HUMANITY</H2><P>The Body of Christ is a mingling of the Divine Trinity with all His chosen human beings. It is a mingling of divinity with humanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AN ORGANISM, BOTH DIVINE AND<br>HUMAN, TO EXPRESS CHRIST</H2><P>The Body of Christ is an organism. On the one hand, it is divine. On the other hand, it is human to express the divine and human Christ, who is both the complete God and the perfect man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FULLNESS OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST</H2><P>The Body of Christ is the fullness of the all-inclusive Christ, the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:23). In the book of Ephesians we have these two terms&#151;the riches of Christ and the fullness of Christ. The fullness is the issue of the riches of Christ (3:8) and the expression of these inner riches. In 1962, I was invited to speak to a group of people in the Bay Area. My subject was the riches of Christ issuing in His fullness. They were surprised by this subject.</P><P>A number of Christians think that the fullness and the riches are the same thing. But the fullness is the issue and the expression of the riches. A tall, husky American brother has eaten many of the riches of America. All these American riches have been digested and assimilated by him, and he is now the fullness of America, the issue and expression of the riches of America.</P><P>We need to be the same with Christ. We should enjoy the riches of Christ until we become the fullness of Christ. When we are full of the riches, this fullness overflows. A cup may have water within it, but we cannot see the water. But if the cup is filled to the brim with water, it overflows with water. This overflow is the fullness, the expression, of the water. We need to be filled with Christ until we overflow with Him. This overflow is the fullness, and the fullness is the expression.</P>
