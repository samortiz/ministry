   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>JOSEPH HAVING THE FAITH AND THE BOLDNESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO INTERPRET THE DREAMS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF HIS TWO COMPANIONS IN PRISON</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>During his imprisonment, however, Joseph had the faith and the boldness to interpret the dreams of his two companions in prison even though his dreams were not yet fulfilled 40:8-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was just like Abraham praying for Abimelech to have children when God's promise to him about having a son had not yet been fulfilled 20:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is the same with us in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some brothers and sisters are what we may call old-time dreamers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are those who had dreams a long time ago.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although they were excited by the visions they saw and the wonderful messages they heard, they were later sold into Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead of being surrounded by sheaves, they found themselves surrounded by "Egyptian scorpions"; and instead of being in the third heaven, they found themselves in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then some latecomers joined them in prison, just as Joseph was joined in his confinement by the chief cupbearer and the baker.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Joseph might have been in prison for nine or ten years already before he was joined by them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These latecomers also had some dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They could not understand their dreams, but Joseph was able to interpret them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although Joseph's dreams had not yet been fulfilled, he had the faith and the boldness to interpret the dreams of his companions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If I had been Joseph, I would have said, "I interpreted my own dreams, but these interpretations have not been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How can I have the boldness to give others the interpretation of their dreams?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even if I did know the meaning of their dreams, I would not have the assurance to tell them, because I don't know that my interpretations will be fulfilled."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, although Joseph's interpretation of his own dreams had not been fulfilled, he still had the boldness to say to his companions, "Do not interpretations belong to God?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Tell me them, I pray you" 40:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Joseph seemed to be saying, "I had two dreams, and God gave me the interpretation of them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I still believe in these interpretations, although they have not yet been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have the faith to interpret your dreams for you."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do you have the boldness to say that the church life is wonderful, even when you are surrounded by some "Egyptians"?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Could you say this even when your dream of the church life has not yet been fulfilled and the church life is not wonderful to you?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Joseph believed not only for himself, but also for others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is easy to believe for others when your dreams have been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If your dreams have been fulfilled according to your interpretation, it is easy to interpret the dreams of others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But in Joseph's case, even after a period of about ten years, the interpretation of his own dreams had not been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was difficult for one in such a situation to interpret the dreams of others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, Joseph did so.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have been engaged in the ministry of the Word for years.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I saw certain visions in the early years and I interpreted what I saw.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But even many years later the things that I saw and interpreted had not actually happened.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When some latecomers needed my help, I wondered what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I wondered if I should say something like this: "I had some dreams many years ago, and I was given the interpretation of these dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But even until now my dreams have not been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, I don't have the heart, the assurance, or the boldness to interpret your dreams for you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You should go talk to someone else."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Joseph was not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although his dreams had not yet been fulfilled, he still had the boldness and the assurance to interpret dreams for others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I can testify that I have done the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have encouraged others to go on according to the vision they saw, even though my visions had not been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Certainly I was right in doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the old-time dreamers must suffer something for the sake of the latecomers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Andrew Murray once said a word like this: The good minister of the Word should always minister more than what he has experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means that we should speak more according to the vision than according to the fulfillment of the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even if our vision has not been fulfilled, we should still speak of it to others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The time will come when our vision will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Joseph's dreams were eventually fulfilled through his interpretation of the dream of the cupbearer.</S>
