   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When you have offended and transgressed against your brother, when he is disturbed and feels that you are unrighteous, and when you have caused him to sigh before God, your spiritual fellowship with God is interrupted; your spiritual prospects are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You may not have the slightest feeling that you are in darkness, and you may feel that you are all right, but the gift you offer at the altar has become void.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You cannot ask anything of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You cannot even give anything to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You cannot offer anything to God, much less receive any answer from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You may have offered up everything on the altar, but God is not pleased with any of it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, when you come to God's altar, you must first be reconciled to your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whatever demands he has, you must try your best to satisfy him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Learn to satisfy the righteous requirement of God as well as the righteous requirement of your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You can offer your gift to God only after you have done this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is quite serious.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not offend others easily.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In particular, we must not offend a brother or a sister lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we offend a brother or a sister, we immediately fall under God's judgment, and it is not easy to be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 25 the Lord emphasized, "Be well disposed quickly toward your opponent at law, while you are with him on the way."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here is a brother who has suffered injustice at our hand; he is not at peace before God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord's words to us are in human terms.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our brother is like a plaintiff in a court of law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The expression while you are with him on the way is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today we are all still on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our brother has not died and neither have we.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is here, and we are here.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is on the way, and we are also on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to be well disposed quickly with him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is very easy for us to not be here someday; it is very easy for us to not be on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is also very easy for our brother to not be here and to not be on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No one knows who will go first.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By then it will be too late to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While he and we are still on the way, that is, while both parties are still here, there is the opportunity to speak to one another and apologize.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should be reconciled to each other quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The door of salvation will not be open forever.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The same is true with the door of mutual confession among the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brothers have often regretted that they lost their opportunity to confess to each other; the offended party is no longer on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we have any offense toward men, we should seize whatever opportunity we have to be reconciled to them quickly while we are both still on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We do not know whether or not others will be here tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We also do not know whether or not we ourselves will be here tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we have to be well disposed with the brothers while we are still on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once one party is no longer on the way, it is impossible to settle the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to realize how serious this matter is!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You cannot be nonchalant or careless about it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While there is still today, be well disposed with your brother quickly!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you know that a brother has a complaint against you, you have to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You must try your best to apologize lest there be no opportunity to reconcile later.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Following this, the Lord speaks again in human terms, saying, "Lest the opponent deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Truly I say to you, You shall by no means come out from there until you pay the last quadrans."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We will not go into biblical interpretation concerning the paying of the last quadrans.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are only pointing out the practice of paying the last quadrans.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to see that this matter must be resolved properly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we do not resolve it properly, the case will not be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord is not speaking of a future judgment or of being thrown into and being released from an actual prison.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord's emphasis is not on these things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His concern is that we would be reconciled today, that we would pay every quadrans today, not putting the matter off until later.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must do this while we are still on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must not put off the matter today and hope that it will be resolved later.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is unwise, and it does not pay to leave the matter to the future.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God's children should learn this lesson well.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must make recompense when recompense is due and confession when confession is due.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should make recompense again and again and apologize again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not allow a brother or sister to harbor any complaint against us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If our conscience is pure, and the wrong is clearly not on our side, we can be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Otherwise, if there is any wrongdoing on our part, we must confess.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must be above reproach in our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should not always think that others are wrong and we are right.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is certainly wrong to ignore the complaints of others and to instead insist that we are right.</S>
