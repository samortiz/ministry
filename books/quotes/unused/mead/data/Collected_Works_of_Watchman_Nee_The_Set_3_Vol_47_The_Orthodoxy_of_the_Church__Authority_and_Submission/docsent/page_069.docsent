   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Learning to Deny Ourselves</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second basic requirement of a deputy authority is to deny himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before one is clear about God's will, he should not open his mouth and should not exercise any authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's deputy authority must not only know His authority on the positive side, but must learn to deny himself on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Please remember that neither God nor the brothers and sisters treasure your opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am afraid that the only one who treasures your opinion in the whole world is yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you think your opinion is the best, that God treasures your opinion, and that the brothers and sisters honor your idea, you are living in a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not be so foolish as to unilaterally impose your opinion upon others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are afraid of those with much opinion, and we are also afraid of those with many ideas, those who like to be others' counselors.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are afraid of men who are too subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many people are very subjective, and they like to be counselors to others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They make proposals and plans for others in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The minute they are given the opportunity, they put forward their proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These ones can never be a president, a chairman, or a policeman.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, even though they may not be in certain positions, they think they know what those in such positions should do.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They like to propose for others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As soon as they are given the chance, they open their mouth to express their ideas and air their opinions before others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even if they are not given the chance, they still try to barge in for a word or two.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If they cannot find an opportunity to speak in front of others, they will try to do it behind others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Please remember that God would never appoint anyone with a great deal of opinions, proposals, and views to be His deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We would not ask a person who loves to spend money to manage our bank account, because we do not want to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the same way, God does not ask a person who loves to express his opinion to be His deputy authority, because He does not want to suffer loss either.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord must first thoroughly break our self before we can become His deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to my personal observation, I have never seen God choose an opinionated person to be His deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such a one must first go through God's breaking and give up his interest in meddling in others' affairs and acting as others' counselors.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God wants us to represent His authority, not replace His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is true that we are like God in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But He remains the sovereign One in His Godhead and position.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His will belongs to Him alone; it is supreme and sovereign above everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He never seeks counsel from us, and He never wants us to be His counselor.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why God's deputy authority must not be subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Of course, in order to conduct business, there is the need for decisions and judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It does not mean that God will only use those who have no ideas, opinions, or judgments in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It means that we must be genuinely broken, our wisdom must be destroyed, and our opinions and proposals must be crushed before God can use us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The basic problem with many people is that by nature they are active in their mind; they speak a great deal and make many proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They are naturally clever and like to be others' counselors.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such ones have to pray for mercy from God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They need a basic dealing and a basic breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not an empty slogan, a teaching, or a kind of imitation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A man must receive a fundamental dealing and breaking, and there must be an open wound; his own wisdom, opinion, and ideas must be crushed and broken.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Such a person spontaneously will be free of his own thoughts and ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A man who has passed through God's chastisement is one who lives in fear before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He will no longer dare speak carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He will always be afraid of making mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As long as God's wound remains in a man, he will feel the pain the minute he moves, and no one will need to remind him of his wound.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a man only knows the teaching of brokenness and is only putting on a performance by imitating others in keeping his mouth shut, his true nature will be exposed sooner or later.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some people are by nature talkative and opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is difficult to see them shut their mouth and not express their opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Such ones may pick up some teachings on brokenness and realize that they should not talk so much or make so many proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If they begin to imitate others and follow their example, their fig leaves soon will dry up Gen 3:7 , and their underlying condition will be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot control ourselves with our will.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we try to control ourselves with our will, our true self will be exposed as soon as we are engaged in a heated discussion, and we will find ourselves confessing our sins to God again.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need nothing less than the killing of our self by God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God has to allow us to bump against the wall until our skull is cracked and our bones come apart.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must go through an experience like that of Balaam in Numbers 22:25.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God needs to inflict a wound on us so that as soon as we move again, we will feel the hurt and not dare make any more proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When a man is wounded, there is no need for others to exhort him to walk slowly; he spontaneously will slow his pace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the only way that will deliver us from our self.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is why I have often said that we need wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Others must find open wounds in us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is no other way to go on except through a thorough confession and dealing before God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Those who are the deputy authorities must learn not to propose any opinion of their own or express their own ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They must not have an addiction for meddling in others' affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some people think that they are the supreme justices; they think they know how to manage everything, whether it is things in the world, things in the church, or anything at all.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They think that they know everything, and that they have an idea and a solution for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When others come to them, they gladly give away their advice.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If others do not come to them, they still give away their advice freely like spreading the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Such opinionated ones have never been disciplined; they have never gone through any severe dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They may have experienced some minor and superficial dealings, but their opinions, ideas, and methods still abound.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They seem to be omnipotent and omniscient.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Their opinions are like open merchandise in a department store.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Such ones can never be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Every deputy authority of God must have one basic qualification they must not have an inclination for careless opinions or criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They should not even have murmuring opinions or unexpressed proposals in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Only those whose self has been dealt with in such a way are qualified to be God's deputy authority.</S>
