   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The work of the enemy begins with the need of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He first told her to eat of the fruit, something that was entirely related to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Next he took one step further to tempt her soul by telling her that if her body would take the fruit, her eyes would be opened, and she would know good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He indicated to her that such a pursuit for knowledge was legitimate.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a result her spirit rebelled against God, and she wondered whether God had forbidden her to eat because His intention was wicked.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The temptation of Satan comes first to the body, then to the soul, and last to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After she was tempted, Eve made a judgment in her will, which was: 1 "that the tree was good for food."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the "lust of the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Her flesh was touched first.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2 "It was pleasant to the eyes."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the "lust of the eyes."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Her body and soul were also deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>3 "A tree to be desired to make one wise."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is "the vainglory of life."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word "desired" means that the emotion and will in her soul were moved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now the function of the soul was motivated, and there was nothing to stop it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She was no longer a spectator, but was moved in her love and desired after the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The emotion is indeed a dangerous master to man!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why was there the desire?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not only the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes made the demands, but the curiosity in the soul urged her to pursue further.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was something that would make her wise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The activity of the soul can many times be detected in the pursuit for wisdom and knowledge, including spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To give no time to wait on God, to have no trust in the leading of the Holy Spirit, and to try to increase one's knowledge with the help of one's mind and books, these are the activities of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The result of this is damage to the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since man's fall came from the pursuit of knowledge, God used the foolishness of the cross to destroy the wisdom of the wise.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Intellectual power is the source of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, if a man desires to be saved, he has to believe in the foolishness of the cross in order that he would not trust in intellectual power.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The tree of knowledge led to man's fall, but God used the foolish tree 1 Pet 2:24 to save man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, "if anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this age, let him become foolish that he may become wise.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God" 1 Cor 3:18-19; 1:18-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After we have carefully read the story of the temptation and the fall, we can see how the rebellion of Adam and Eve led to the development of their soul, the result of which is that the spirit lost its position and fell into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The most important parts of man's soul are his mind, will, and emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The will is the master of man; it is the organ of deliberation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The mind is the thinking organ, while the emotion is the loving organ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The apostle told us that "Adam was not deceived" 1 Tim 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This shows that Adam's mind was not confused.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The one who was weak in mind and intellect was Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"But the woman, having been quite deceived, has fallen into transgression" 1 Tim 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The record of Genesis says, "The woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat" 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Adam said, "The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave not beguiled me of the tree, and I did eat" v. 12 . Adam was not beguiled; his mind was still clear.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He knew that the fruit was the forbidden fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet he ate it because of his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Adam knew that all the words of the serpent were the deceptions of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we read the word of the apostle, we find that Adam sinned purposely and was not like Eve who sinned through being beguiled.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He loved Eve more than himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He idolized her and loved her so much that he rebelled against the commandment of the Lord for her sake.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How pitiful this was.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His head was controlled by his heart, and his reason was overcome by his love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Why have men "not believed the truth"?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is because they "have taken pleasure in unrighteousness" 2 Thes 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is not because reason is lacking, but because the desire is lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, when a man truly turns to the Lord "with the heart and not with the head, there is believing unto righteousness" Rom 10:10 .</S>
