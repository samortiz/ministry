<h1 class="series">SECTION SIX<br />MESSAGES IN CANTON,<br />APRIL 1937</h1><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 11, 1937, afternoon <br />Place: Canton<br />Scripture Reading: Mark 9:1-8</h1><h2 class="head1">JESUS CHRIST AND THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST</h2><p>John 3:16 says that God gave us His Son; Revelation 1:1 says that God gave us the revelation of Jesus Christ. God has given us two great blessings: Jesus Christ and the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p><p>The word revelation in Greek is apokalypsis. Apo means "to lift," and kalypsis means "veil." Together they mean to lift the veil and to reveal what is behind the veil. If we only have Christ but do not have the revelation of Jesus Christ, we still do not know who Christ is, and it is as if Jesus Christ is still behind the veil.</p><p>Our revelation of Jesus Christ will be full only when we have put off our bodies and are face to face with the Lord. Then we will see Him clearly. However, there are some people&mdash;not all, but some&mdash;who are seeking and who draw near to God. These ones not only have Jesus Christ today but also the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">SEEING THE KINGDOM OF GOD COME IN POWER</h2><p>In Mark 9:1 the Lord said, "There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the kingdom of God having come in power." This means that Christ was about to be manifested. The Lord's promise in this verse implies that man can know Him at the present time. There is no need to wait until one's death. The kingdom of God is something abstract; one cannot touch it or lay hold of it. Yet we have to realize that the kingdom of God is the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus is the reality and content of the kingdom of God. The manifestation of the Lord Jesus is the very manifestation of the kingdom of God. Mark 9:1 presents the main subject of verses 2 through 8, which describe how Christ manifested Himself. These seven verses are a full explanation of verse 1.</p><h2 class="head1">"AND AFTER SIX DAYS"</h2><p>Verse 2 begins with the phrase "and after six days." This means that it is the seventh day. The principle of studying the Bible is that whenever you come across a certain word or phrase that you do not understand, you should refer to the first mention of it in the Bible. The six days in Genesis 1 refer to the six days of God's work. The seventh day is the day of God's rest. God spent six days to create the universe and all the things in it. The seventh day is the day of rest. Even Adam and Eve rested. The moment Adam and Eve were born, they rested; this is the proper way. They were not born to work. Adam and Eve rested in God's work. They had the best situation. If it had been up to Adam and Eve to create the universe, they would have had to spend more time to do it. They would not have been able to complete the work even if they had six thousand years.</p><p>We are saved through realizing that God is the One who accomplished everything. We must realize that we should live by resting in God's work as well. We are here to enjoy God's work. Simply put, God does a work that is both full and complete. There is no need for us to do anything. All we have to do is enjoy what God has done. Thank the Lord! All that God has accomplished is good and complete. Whatever man has done and whatever sinners have produced are just vile and incomplete. The revelation of Jesus Christ comes "after six days." This means that God has accomplished everything. Man has no part in it whatsoever. In spiritual matters our vision is based on God's work alone; we have no part in it. God's work enables us to see God's revelation.</p>
