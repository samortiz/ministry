	 <h2 class="head3">God&rsquo;s Redemption</h2>
<p>The third item of the basic truths is God&rsquo;s redemption. In Christianity there are many writings concerning God&rsquo;s redemption. Although they may be correct, they are incomplete. Hence, we need to fellowship concerning the points of God&rsquo;s redemption. Man was created by God, but he fell out of God&rsquo;s hands. God was not willing to give man up; He wanted to save man back to Himself. But God had to pay a price in order to accomplish this salvation; thus, there was a need for redemption. It was not sufficient for God merely to save man; His salvation needed to include redemption. This can be compared to an item being taken to a pawnshop. If you want the item back, you need to redeem it with money. In the fall we sold ourselves. In God&rsquo;s view, however, this sale was not final; we were redeemable. Hence, God came in to redeem us. In order for God to save us, He first had to redeem us. This is the purpose of redemption.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s redemption we must pass through seven steps for its completion. The first step is the redemption from sins (Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:14). The Lord redeemed us from our sins. Strictly speaking, this is redemption, but it is only the first step of redemption. The Lord cleared up our sins and redeemed us from the condemnation of the law. The second step is the forgiveness of sins (Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:14; Acts 2:38). Luke 24:47 says, &ldquo;That repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed.&rdquo; Hence, one aspect of the gospel is that it is the gospel of the forgiveness of sins. The third step is the cleansing from sins (1 John 1:7, 9). The Lord does not merely forgive us our sins; He also washes away every trace of our sins from us so that it is as if we never sinned at all.</p>
<p>The fourth step of redemption is sanctification (Heb. 10:29). First Corinthians 6:11 says that we were washed, we were sanctified, and we were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God. Theology mainly teaches that we are first justified and then sanctified, but some verses in the Bible say that we are first sanctified and then justified. Sanctification refers to the fact that God has separated us unto holiness. God redeemed us from our sins, forgave us our sins, and cleansed us from our sins. Then God said that we are sanctified, we are different from everything else, and we no longer belong to this world. This sanctification is objective and positional.</p>
<p>The fifth step of redemption is justification (Rom. 3:24-25). After sanctifying us, God justifies us. The sixth step is reconciliation (5:10; Eph. 2:16; Col. 1:20, 22). God causes us to be reconciled to Himself. The seventh step is acceptance (2 Cor. 6:2; Luke 15:22-24). Second Corinthians 6:2 says, &ldquo;Behold, now is the well-acceptable time.&rdquo; God is happy when He accepts us. Just as in the parable of the prodigal son, He is happy when a son returns home, because the son who was lost has been found. Being lost and found again is part of redemption. Hence, the seven steps of God&rsquo;s redemption are redemption from sins, forgiveness of sins, cleansing from sins, sanctification, justification, reconciliation, and acceptance.</p>
<p>These seven steps of God&rsquo;s redemption are completely objective. When most people in Christianity speak of God&rsquo;s salvation, they speak only of the aspect of redemption, which was accomplished by the Lord&rsquo;s blood. The Lord&rsquo;s blood redeems us; it redeems us from our sins, forgives us of our sins, cleanses us from our sins, sanctifies us, justifies us before God, reconciles us to God, and causes us to be accepted by God. This is redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head3">God&rsquo;s Dispensing</h2>
<p>The fourth item of the basic truths is God&rsquo;s dispensing. This is the theology of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The theology outside of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery does not have this item. Most believers in Christianity speak only of God&rsquo;s redemption, which is entirely objective and refers to God&rsquo;s redeeming us through the blood. God&rsquo;s dispensing, however, is very subjective. There are seven points in God&rsquo;s dispensing.</p>
<p>The first point is regeneration (John 3:3). Through regeneration God gives us His life after He has redeemed us. In other words, God plants Himself as the seed of life into us, causing us to receive His life. As soon as we obtain God&rsquo;s life, we are regenerated in our spirit. This means that we are born of God. This is the first step of the Triune God&rsquo;s dispensing of Himself into us.</p>
<p>The second point in God&rsquo;s dispensing is sanctification (1 Thes. 5:23). This sanctification is not outward; it is inward. It is subjective, not objective. It is dispositional, not positional. In this sanctification the Lord does not sanctify us with His blood; rather, He sanctifies us by dispensing His life into us.</p>
<p>The third point in God&rsquo;s dispensing is renewing (Rom. 12:2; Titus 3:5). When God sanctifies us with His divine life, His life renews us inwardly.</p>
<p>The fourth point in God&rsquo;s dispensing is transformation (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18). Transformation is not an outward change. At the most, philosophies and doctrines can change us, but they cannot transform us. Change is mainly an outward matter, just as people wear make-up on their faces. If my complexion is pale, and I put on some powder and then apply some reddish cosmetics, my face will become rosy. This is change, not transformation. What is transformation? Transformation is metabolic. My complexion is pale because my body lacks nourishment. Therefore, if I eat nourishing food every day, after one or two months my body will be transformed, and my face will exhibit a healthy, ruddy glow. This is not a matter of putting on make-up but of an inward transformation. This is a metabolic process.</p>
<p>Inorganic objects do not have metabolic processes; only living things have metabolic processes. Animals and plants all have metabolic processes, just as humans do. People with a good metabolism are always healthy; people with a poor metabolism are usually sick. The divine life in every Christian involves the highest process of metabolism. Every day the Lord supplies us with a new element, and this new element metabolically discharges the old elements within us. This is transformation.</p>
<p>We should not expect to be able to change our temper. A person with a bad temper should not try to change it, because the more he tries to suppress his temper, the worse it will become. Instead, he should constantly eat Jesus. The Lord Jesus said that He was the bread of life which came down from heaven and that those who eat Him will live because of Him (John 6:35, 51, 57). We must take the Lord as the bread of life and eat Him every day. When we eat Him, we will be supplied inwardly; we will receive a new element that will metabolically discharge our old elements. This is transformation.</p>
<p>The fifth point in God&rsquo;s dispensing is conformation. God wants us to be conformed to the image of His Son (Rom. 8:29). Transformation is a matter of essence, and conformation is a matter of image. When Adam was created, he had God&rsquo;s image, but he did not have the essence of God&rsquo;s life. However, when we are saved, we receive the essence of God&rsquo;s life. The nature of this life essence is to transform us inwardly day by day, causing us to have God&rsquo;s image.</p>
<p>Every kind of life has its own life element, life essence, life law, and life shape. When a peach tree grows and matures, it spontaneously produces peaches; this is according to its life. This also applies to animals; every kind of life has its own shape or form. The cat life produces the likeness of a cat, and the dog life produces the likeness of a dog. We have God&rsquo;s life, and this life is growing inside of us, transforming us, and conforming us to God&rsquo;s image. Since it is the life of God, it produces the image of God. This is conformation.</p>
<p>The sixth point in God&rsquo;s dispensing is glorification (v. 30). Glorification does not mean that we glorify God but that God glorifies us. According to the general concept in Christianity, we glorify God by doing good deeds; these good deeds allow people to see that we are Christians, and as a result, they praise God. This is the general concept concerning what it means to glorify God. We dare not say that this is wrong, but this is very shallow. God is glorified when He lives out from within us. God&rsquo;s dispensing is God coming to glorify us. God is constantly dispensing Himself into us, and His element of life glorifies us.</p>
<p>We are not speaking about <em>glory,</em> which is a noun; we are speaking of <em>glorifying,</em> which is a verb. God does not merely want to regenerate us, sanctify us, and renew us; He also wants to transform us, conform us, and in the end to glorify us. One day we will be in glory. It seems as though we will enter into glory. However, glory will be expressed from within us. This can be compared to a seed that is planted into the earth and grows. After the seed sprouts, it grows until it blooms. When the roses in a garden are in bloom, we see rose blossom after rose blossom. The flowers are the glory of the rose bush. We all have a &ldquo;rose seed&rdquo; within us&mdash;God Himself. On the one hand, He is growing within us, and on the other hand, He is sanctifying, renewing, and transforming us. The more we are transformed, the more we will be like Him. The more we are like Him, the more glory we express. This is the true meaning of glorification.</p>
<p>Finally, the seventh point is the ultimate manifestation of God&rsquo;s dispensing&mdash;the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2). God&rsquo;s dispensing begins with our regeneration, and it continues to its ultimate manifestation. In eternity we will become the New Jerusalem for God&rsquo;s expression and His magnification.</p>
<p>This is an outline of the theology in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. It spans from creation to the ultimate consummation in the New Jerusalem. We can say that our theology includes all sixty-six books of the Bible.</p>
