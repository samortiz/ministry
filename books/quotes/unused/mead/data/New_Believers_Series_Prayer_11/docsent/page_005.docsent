   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord's Will God is Willing</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is true that God can do everything, but how do I know that He is willing to heal me?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I do not know His will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Perhaps the Lord is not willing to heal me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let us look at another story.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Mark 1:41 says, "And He was moved with compassion, and stretching out His hand, He touched him and said to him, I am willing; be cleansed!"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whether or not God can do something is not the question here; rather, it is a question of whether or not God is willing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No matter how great His power is, what does it matter if He is unwilling to heal?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If God does not want to heal us, the greatness of His power will be of no consequence to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first question that has to be settled is whether or not God can, but the second question that also has to be settled is whether or not God will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord said to the leper, "I am willing."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Old Testament tells us that leprosy is a very filthy disease Lev 13 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whoever contacted a leper was defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the Lord's love was so great that He said, "I am willing."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus stretched out His hand and touched and cleansed the leper!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The leper entreated the Lord, and the Lord was willing to cleanse him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Can it be that the Lord will not heal our illness?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Can it be that the Lord will not answer our prayers?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can all say, "God can" and "God is willing."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord's Act God Has Done</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not enough for us to know that God can and God will.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to know one more thing God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to go back to Mark 11:24, which we quoted earlier: "All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This tells us that God has done something already.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Faith is not just believing that God can and will do something but also believing that God has done something already.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has accomplished it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you believe that you have received it, you will have it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you believe and are confident that God can and will do a certain thing because He has given you a word concerning it, you should thank Him, saying, "God has done it!"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many people's prayers are not answered because they are not clear about this point; they still hope that they will receive something.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, to hope means to expect something in the future, whereas to believe means to consider something as being done.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Genuine faith says, "Thank God, He has healed me!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thank God, I have received it!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thank God, I am cleansed!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thank God, I have recovered!"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When faith is perfect, it will not only say "God can" and "God wills," but also "God has done."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has listened to our prayers!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has accomplished everything!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we believe that we have received it, we will receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Very often, our faith is a faith that believes in what we will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As a result, we never receive anything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should have the faith that we have already received.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Faith is always a matter of "having been done" rather than of "will be done."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Consider a simple illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A person has just heard the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you ask him, "Have you believed in the Lord Jesus?", he may answer, "I have."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You may then ask, "Are you saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If he says, "I will be saved," you know that he is not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Suppose you ask him again, "Do you really believe that you are saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If he says, "I will surely be saved," you know that he is still not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You may want to ask him again, "Are you really sure that you will be saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If he answers, "I think I will," his words do not sound like someone who is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If one says, "I will be saved," "I will surely be saved," or "I think I will surely be saved," there is no guarantee that he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the person says, "I am saved," he has the right tone.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once a man believes, he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Any faith, if it is faith at all, believes in what has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For example, once a person possesses faith at the time of his salvation, he immediately says, "Thank God, I have received."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Let us lay hold of these three things God can, God wills, and God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Faith is not a psychological exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Faith is receiving God's word and believing with much assurance that God can, God wills, and God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you have not received His word, do not take the spiritual risk of trying to tempt God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The exercise of psychology is not faith.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Take illness as an example: All who are healed through genuine faith are not afraid of a medical checkup Mark 1:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The result of a medical checkup for those who have experienced a genuine divine healing will prove that it was a genuine healing rather than something psychological.</S>
