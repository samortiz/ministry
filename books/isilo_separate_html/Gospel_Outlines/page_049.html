<h1 class="title">THERE IS NO PEACE TO THE WICKED</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Isa. 57:20-21<br />
When we preach the gospel, we have to be careful in choosing words and topics. Try not to close people&rsquo;s hearts the moment you open your mouth.</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Everything in the universe has a law
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Use enough examples to let people see that everything in the universe has a law. Not only do the stars have their laws, but in the existence of all living creatures there are laws. Try not to give too many examples, but use just enough to prove that everything in the universe has a law.</li>
	<li>If any kind of living thing that exists in the universe follows its own law, then it will be at peace. If it goes against the law, then it will have no rest.<br />
	What we have said so far is to lay the foundation.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The law of human life
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The law of human life is based upon the relationship between God and man.<br />
	No doubt when we preach the gospel we must rely upon the Holy Spirit, but we also have to catch people&rsquo;s thought. Because there are many in the meeting with well-trained minds, the thoughts of the one who preaches should not be lacking in refinement.</li>
	<li>God is very orderly. Therefore the human life planned by God is also very orderly. Expound this point.</li>
	<li>The order which God has set up for man&rsquo;s life is good, bright, righteous, kind, and upright. These five points should be explained in detail, from both the positive and the negative sides. For example, the opposite of good is evil, and everything which is not orderly is evil.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The abnormality of human life
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The order which God has set up for man&rsquo;s life is almost entirely contradicted by man. God ordered that man&rsquo;s life should be good, bright, righteous, kind, and upright. But in reality man is evil, dark, jealous, hateful, unrighteous, and crooked. Describe the negative side.</li>
	<li>Because man&rsquo;s life is so abnormal and contrary to the order set up by God, his life is full of evil.</li>
	<li>The evil of man&rsquo;s life is his rebellion against God&rsquo;s law. Take for example: stealing, not loving his wife, having envy against his classmates, disrespect toward his parents, not loving his colleagues, not helping a person who is suffering, and having no sympathy toward a poor beggar. All of these are against God&rsquo;s law.<br />
	<em>When we preach, we must touch people&rsquo;s feeling. If you want to hit someone, you should hit him hard. Hit him all over until he is very sensitive; then he will be saved.</em></li>
	<li>The evil in human life causes life to be out of balance. Therefore, the human life becomes a life without peace. Since it is out of balance, the human life is restless.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Life&rsquo;s restlessness
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The restlessness of life is manifested in man&rsquo;s conscience. When man goes against the good laws of God, there is the restless feeling of condemnation in his conscience. When a man steals, his conscience jumps up and down. If you have done something wrong or have lied, you would tremble, if someone should point at you. This is why a lie detector can test the inner situation of a person. The Chinese have a saying in the same principle, &ldquo;discern a person according to his expressions.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>The restlessness of a person&rsquo;s heart. If you spend money which you earned by your own labor and hard work, you feel an inner calm and a sweet sense within. But if you spend money which has been stolen from others, you will feel uneasy. Another example: if you use your money to support and honor your parents, your heart feels peaceful. But if you keep the money for your own luxury or to spend on other women behind your wife&rsquo;s back, then your heart will be uneasy. The whole reason men feel uneasy and have a sense of fear is that they have contradicted God&rsquo;s laws.</li>
	<li>The restlessness in the environment. After a short time, anything stolen may be exposed. Even if they are not exposed, a few days later you may have a car accident, or you may meet a pickpocket, or you may hit someone riding a bicycle. For three months you have tried your best to embezzle in your office or business to get two thousand dollars. Then you fell down and had to stay in the hospital, and the hospital bill was three thousand dollars. These are examples of the restlessness in the environment.</li>
	<li>These three points of restlessness are all caused by man&rsquo;s disobedience of God&rsquo;s law. The restlessness is God&rsquo;s reprimand. It is like a train. If it is derailed, something is out of order. God&rsquo;s laws are like the rails. If the conscience is restless that is your warning telling you to repent.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s laws are meant to bring you to repentance. If you do not obey, in the future you will fall into the lake of everlasting fire. You will have no peace forever. Therefore God said, &ldquo;There is no peace to the wicked.&rdquo; The life of the wicked is like the tossing sea. Its waters toss up mire and dirt.<br />
	Use some examples to describe how peaceful it is whenever anyone honors his parents or gets along well with his neighbors, and how restless it is otherwise. Explain from both the negative and the positive sides.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The way of peace for man&rsquo;s life
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Explain that in our life, the source of peace is God. Just as God is the source of good and light, He is also the source of peace. When a man has God, he has peace. If he does not have God, he has no peace. Therefore, if you want to have peace, you must turn back to God and receive God, because God is the way to have peace.</li>
	<li>Repent and forsake evil. Evil makes a man restless. But God gives men peace. Therefore, to obtain peace we must forsake evil and turn back to God.</li>
	<li>Receive the Lord Jesus as your Savior of peace. The Lord Jesus shed His blood on the cross to solve the problem of man&rsquo;s sin before God, to accomplish eternal peace, and to reconcile men to God. The salvation and redemption of the Lord Jesus will give men peace. For this reason you must receive this Savior as your Savior.</li>
	<li>Many people have accepted the Savior. They not only have the peace within, but also have a peaceful environment without.</li>
