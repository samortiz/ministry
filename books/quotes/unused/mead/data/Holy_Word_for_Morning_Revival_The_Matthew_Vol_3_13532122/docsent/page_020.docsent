   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 13 DAY 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 17:24-26</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>24 And when they came to Capernaum, those who take up the 1 temple tax came to Peter and said, Does not your Teacher pay the 1 temple tax?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>25 He said, 1 Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And when he came into the house, Jesus 2 anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>26 And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said to him, So then the sons are free.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Unless we receive light from the Lord, it is difficult to see the connection between verses 1 through 23 and verses 24 through 27.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 17:24-27 we have the matter of paying the temple tax to the poll tax gatherers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a test to determine whether or not we know how to apply the revelation and vision concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In chapter sixteen Peter received a clear revelation from the heavenly Father regarding Christ as the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From that time onward, Peter was certain that Christ was the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Following this, on the mountaintop he saw a vision of Christ manifested as the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, he both received the revelation and saw the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is possible to have a revelation without having a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What Peter received from the heavenly Father in chapter sixteen was merely the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In chapter seventeen he saw the Son of God manifested and expressed through the man Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nothing could have been more clear than this revelation and vision.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Peter, however, had to be tested regarding the application of the revelation and the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To receive the revelation and to see the vision is one thing, but to apply them in a practical way is another.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, we probably all have received the revelation from Galatians 2:20 that we have been crucified with Christ and that Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps even the weakest one among us has received this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, when your wife or husband gives you a difficult time, can you still say, "It is not I, but Christ"?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When you are with your wife or husband, the revelation of having been crucified with Christ and of Christ living in you may vanish.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Very few who have received this revelation apply it to the practical matters in their daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Peter might have been like this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He might have said, "I have received the revelation that Jesus is the Son of the living God, and I saw Him transfigured on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is very clear to me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Perhaps you have not seen this vision, but I have."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For Peter to receive the revelation and see the vision was wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But now he had to be tested by those who collected the poll tax.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 24 says, "And when they came to Capernaum, those who take up the temple tax came to Peter and said, Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Peter was asked this question, he immediately said, "Yes."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Peter did not know how to apply the revelation and the vision, and he was exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After a conference or training, we may proclaim that we will never be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But I assure you that after you return home, you will be exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, do not let this disappoint you.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>24 1 A Jewish poll tax for the temple, equal to a half-shekel Exo 30:12-16; 38:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>25 1 On the Mount of Transfiguration Peter heard the voice from heaven, which charged him to hear Christ 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If he had still remembered that word, he would have referred the poll tax gatherers' question to Christ to hear what He would say.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But he answered instead of listening to what Christ would say.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>25 2 Peter had spoken presumptuously.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, the Lord stopped him and corrected him before he began to speak to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
