<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">WINE MINGLED WITH GALL</h1><h1 class="scripture">Place: Unrecorded<br />Scripture Reading: Matt. 5:39-41, 44; 27:33-35; Luke 23:33-34; Acts 7:54-60; Rom. 12:14, 20; 1 Cor. 4:8-16; 11:16-29</h1><p>Before the Lord was crucified on the cross and the soldiers divided his garments, He was scourged before the Jews and Gentiles and judged by the rulers. Then He took up the cross  and went to Golgotha to suffer punishment, and the executioners nailed Him to the cross. At this point two things occurred. The first was recorded in Matthew 27:34: "They gave Him wine to drink, mingled with gall. And when He tasted it, He would not drink." The second was recorded in Luke 23:34, where the Lord prayed, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."</p><h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTION OF WINE MINGLED WITH GALL</h2><p>What is the purpose of wine mingled with gall? Crucifixion is very painful, and the law allowed soldiers to give wine mingled with gall to the crucified man in order to relieve some of the pain of crucifixion. It functioned like the anesthetics we have today. Others would take it, but our Lord Jesus would not drink it. Human crosses have wine mingled with gall, because with human crosses there is always the sense of pain.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD'S CROSS BEING<br />WITHOUT WINE MINGLED WITH GALL</h2><p>The cross of Christ shows us that if there is the cross there is no need of wine mingled with gall and that if there is wine mingled with gall there is no cross. These two things cannot exist together. The Lord's cross did not have any wine mingled with gall, and there was no need for it. It was not used, but not because it was unavailable. It was available and indeed very convenient. If one used it, he would be relieved of some of his pain. It was not used, but not because it was useless; it was not used because He refused it. Why did the Lord reject it? It was rejected because even though the cross could generate much feeling in others, it could not produce any feeling in Christ. (This, of course, does not refer to His physical feelings.) If there is a genuine bearing of the cross, there should not be any feeling or reaction. If there is any feeling or reaction, it means that it is only an act of a martyr, not a genuine bearing of the cross.</p><h2 class="head1">"MARTYRDOM" AND THE BEARING OF THE CROSS</h2><p>Today there are many Christian "martyrs," but there are very few cross-bearing Christians. Many people go through this and that kind of suffering. Although they do not say anything, their faces tell others that they are suffering. It would be better for these Christians not to suffer at all! The kind of cross they are bearing is a cross of wine mingled with gall.</p><p>When the Lord was crucified, He refused the wine mingled with gall. Luke tells us that He prayed for those who crucified Him and asked the Father to forgive them. This is the cross that has no wine mingled with gall. The Lord suffered all kinds of pain on the cross, but He did not feel mistreated. He did not murmur in His heart, saying, "Look at you people! You are too evil! Do you know that one day I will judge you for these things?" The cross the Lord went to was a cross without wine mingled with gall. Wine mingled with gall may not be a complete anesthetic, but those who are conscious of their own suffering have the need to drink of it.</p><p>My burden is not to expound the Bible here. There are many Christians today who are telling others by their words and attitude that they are "martyrs"; they give no impression that they are rejecting the wine mingled with gall. They may have been rebuked by their wives at home. They may have received a cold shoulder in return for hard work at the office. They may have been mistreated in the church and by the brothers and sisters. Their faces tell others that they are martyrs. If a person is truly bearing the cross, there is no feeling of pain. Those who need wine mingled with gall are saying that they are suffering in heart. But a true bearer of the cross has no need of wine mingled with gall.</p>
