<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Rom. 5:20</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Sin abounded
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man is sinful and commits sins.</li>
	<li>Man&rsquo;s sin is abounding.</li>
	<li>Give a real example to prove how man&rsquo;s sin has abounded. The older a man is, the easier it is for him to sin.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Grace abounded
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God not only has grace, but He has abundant grace.</li>
	<li>The more our sin abounds, the more God&rsquo;s grace abounds.</li>
	<li>All of man&rsquo;s abundant sin needs to be resolved by God&rsquo;s abundant grace.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to receive grace and escape sin
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Although sin caused grace to abound, we should not continue to be in sin that grace may abound.</li>
	<li>We have to confess that we have sinned and should be punished for our sin, and that we need grace to save us. We should confess that we are bound by the power of sin and need grace to deliver us.</li>
	<li>We need to receive Jesus Christ and His salvation.</li>
	</ol></li>
