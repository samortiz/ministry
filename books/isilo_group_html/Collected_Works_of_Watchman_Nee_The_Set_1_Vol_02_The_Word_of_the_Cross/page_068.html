This word is very hard to translate, and "church" can hardly express the meaning of the word. Its original meaning is the called-out congregation or the called-out ones gathered together. Hence, "church" is the name given to those who are called out of the world by the grace of God to meet together. Therefore, those who are not called out of the world do not belong in the church.</P>	<ol class="upper-roman">	<li>Who belongs in the church?		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"All those who believed" (Acts 2:44)</li>		<li>"Those who were being saved" (Acts 2:47)</li>		<li>"Those who had believed" (Acts 4:32)</li>		<li>"The church...apostles" (Acts 8:1)</li>		<li>"The church...disciples" (Acts 11:26)</li>		<li>"Those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints" (1 Cor. 1:2)</li>		<li>"The saints" (2 Cor. 1:1)</li>		<li>"His Body" (Eph. 1:23)</li>		<li>"His Body" (Col. 1:24)</li>		</ol></li>	</ol><P>Both the tares and the wheat grow together in the world, but they do not co-exist in the church.
