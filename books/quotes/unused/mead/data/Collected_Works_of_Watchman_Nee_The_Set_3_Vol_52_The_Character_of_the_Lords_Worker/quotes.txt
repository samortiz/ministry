[2]  Volume 52 of The Collected Works contains ten messages by Watchman Nee on the subject of the character of the Lord's worker.
[3]  The personal life of a worker of the Lord is intimately related to his work.
[4]  Therefore, we have to consider matters of character, habit, and conduct when considering the qualifications necessary to be in God's employment.
[5]  A man must have not only a certain amount of spiritual experience, but a certain constitution in his disposition; the Lord must constitute a certain kind of disposition within him.
[6]  If a Christian turns to a servant of the Lord for help, the worker should be able to discern three aspects of his brother's words while he is listening: the words that are being uttered, the words that are being held back, and the words that are lying in the depth of the brother's spirit.
[7]  Second, we have to hear and understand what others are not saying.
[8]  We have to discern before the Lord what others have refrained from saying.
[9]  We have to know what a person has not said, that is, the things he should tell us but which have been kept back.
[10]  When a brother comes and says something to us, we must not only be clear about what he is saying, but also about what he is not saying.
[11]  If we are not sure of anything within ourselves and cannot hear what others are saying, always waiting instead for a chance to speak, we will only be burdened to say what we have to say.
[12]  How can we acquire the ability to listen and understand?
[13]  If we have our own subjective concepts and ideas about people, it will be difficult for us to hear what others are saying because our mind is already full.
[14]  If we have not been dealt with by God, we will not be able to sing "hallelujah" when others express their joy, and we will not be able to share their grief when they express their sorrow.
[15]  The first thing a worker of the Lord has to learn is to listen to others.
[16]  When a brother or a sister is speaking or when an unbeliever is speaking, we have to learn to listen.
[17]  We must be in perfect stillness, void of our own thoughts, our own subjective opinions, and our own feelings, before we can listen quietly to others and understand what they are saying.
[18]  Every worker of the Lord must have not only a love for the brothers but also a love for all men.
[19]  A servant or worker of the Lord is not fit to serve Him if he is lacking in brotherly love or if he only has brotherly love but is lacking in love for all men.
[20]  When we really come to understand the Word of God, we will realize that the term children of God is not so weighty as the term man, and we also will realize that God's plan, selection, and predestination have a glorified man as their objective.
[21]  When we see the place that man occupies in the purpose of God, when we see man as the focus of all His plans, and when we see how the Lord humbled Himself to become a man, we will learn to appreciate all men.
[22]  The Lord Jesus said, "The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve" Mark 10:45 .
[23]  In other words, the Lord never asked for anything from men.
[24]  Brothers and sisters, years of instruction have accustomed us to address all men as our "fellow men"; however, this is not a matter of words but a matter of feeling.
[25]  If we have no interest in man and do not find him precious, and if we have no awareness that we are all fellow creatures of God, we cannot preach about sacrifice.
[26]  If God opens our heart to see that we are fellow men among all men, our attitude towards them will drastically change.
[27]  Brothers and sisters, it needs to dawn on us that man is precious in God's eyes because He created man in His likeness.
[28]  When we talk with those who have less education than we have and we stand aloof from them, we are telling them that we are not one of them.
[29]  In remembering that every servant of God has his own special characteristic and function to God, we should not forget that, no matter how different one's function may be, all true servants of God are alike in this respect: They are interested, intensely interested, in men.
[30]  If a brother has an enlarged heart and is interested in men, his usefulness in the hand of God will be greatly enhanced.
[31]  If we are indifferent to and disinterested in men, how can we preach the gospel to them?
[32]  If we do this, we will find a boundless field of service opening up to us, and under the mercy of God we will become servants who are of some account to Him.
[33]  If we see how the Lord has died for men, we will echo that very character that led Him to suffer such a death for men; we will feel what the Lord feels and conclude that man does deserve all of our love and interest.
[34]  Unless we can do this, we will not be able to identify with the Lord's feeling, and we will not be able to work for the Lord.
[35]  In addition to the character traits already mentioned, every Christian worker should have a mind to suffer 1 Pet 4:1 .
[36]  We have to realize that suffering and having a mind to suffer are two different things.
[37]  Having a mind to suffer implies that we have a desire to willingly suffer for Christ's sake; it means that we have a heart and a willingness to endure affliction on His behalf.
[38]  The Lord may not arrange for you to suffer every day, but every worker of the Lord must not be short of a mind to suffer, not even for a single day.
[39]  If we can only accept the good provisions of the Lord, but cannot take any trial, instead backsliding at any change and ceasing from our work, we do not have a mind to suffer.
[40]  If we have a mind to suffer, the Lord may not necessarily give us sufferings, but when we do encounter sufferings, we will be inwardly prepared, and we will not draw back.
[41]  Now we have to consider some common problems we encounter in the Lord's work.
[42]  What should we do when God puts us through a trial of material shortage?
[43]  If the shortage in provision halts our work, the Lord surely would put a question mark on what we are doing.
[44]  Brothers and sisters, whether or not we will perform well in our work depends a great deal on whether we have a mind to suffer.
[45]  If we have a mind to suffer, we will defy difficulties; we will defy hardship; we will defy physical infirmity; and we will even defy death.
[46]  If we say, "I am not afraid of hunger!", Satan will not be able to do anything to us when he sends us hunger; he will have to flee.
[47]  If we say, "I am not afraid of the cold!", Satan will not be able to do anything to us when he sends us cold weather; he will have to flee once again.
[48]  If we do not have a mind to suffer, Satan will use whatever we are afraid of to attack us, and we will be defeated.
[49]  If we have this attitude within us, Satan will not be able to do anything to us because we will have a mind to suffer.
[50]  A question naturally arises: To what extent should we be prepared to suffer?
[51]  If there is any compromise, we would rather let the Lord do the compromising; we would rather let the church or the more mature brothers balance us.
[52]  If we want to take this way, we have to say to the Lord, "Your ordained way for me may or may not be a way of suffering, but I am ready to meet any sufferings."
[53]  If our conscience does not condemn us, if we declare our testimony of victory in the face of Satan, and if we love not our soul-life even unto death, his assaults against us will be futile.
[54]  The Lord may not want us to give up our life, but we should have the conviction that we will love not our soul-life even unto death.
[55]  First Corinthians 9:23-27 says, "And I do all things for the sake of the gospel that I may become a fellow partaker of it.
[56]  I therefore run in this way, not as though without a clear aim; I box in this way, not as though beating the air; but I buffet my body and make it my slave, lest perhaps having preached to others, I myself may become disapproved."
[57]  Verse 24 says, "Do you not know that those who run on a racecourse all run?"
[58]  What does it mean for our body to become our slave?
[59]  In order to understand this, we must first understand what the demands of the body are.
[60]  Making the body our slave means that, through long periods of buffeting our body during ordinary times, we are able to put it under our control at the time of a race.
[61]  If we are easy with our body at ordinary times, our legs, feet, lungs, and every other organ will not come under our control at the time of the race, and we will not be able to meet the demand of the race.
[62]  If we lack such training at ordinary times, and if we have never buffeted our body or dealt with it, it will not submit to us at a time of need.
[63]  When we set out for our work, we will find that our body does not obey us.
[64]  When the Lord was on earth, Nicodemus came to Him by night.
[65]  If we have never exercised in this way and our body is never put under control, sleep will become our first priority when we set out for our work.
[66]  To make our body our slave means that when the Lord has a need and a demand, and when circumstances call for it, we can put aside the demands of our body temporarily.
[67]  While we should eat well and clothe ourselves, we should not give undue attention to the matter of clothing.
[68]  The Lord Jesus said of him that if anyone wanted to see an elegantly attired person there was no need to look in his direction; the place to look was the royal palace.
[69]  We hold that it does not glorify the Lord for us to wear ragged garments; they are not a glory to the Lord.
[70]  If a servant of the Lord is seriously sick and the Lord has not imposed a special burden upon him, it is right for him to take care of his sickness; the church should know what to do with him, and the other co-workers should also know what to do with him.
[71]  Brothers and sisters, do not think for a moment that you can relax your rein on the demands of the body.
[72]  If we cannot put our body under strict control, as soon as we face any trial in our work, we will grumble, complain, or run away.
[73]  If we have never exercised ourselves and our body has never been under our control, we will fail and not be able to run when God puts extra demands on us.
[74]  The daily life of a Christian worker often determines whether he is qualified for the Lord's work.
[75]  A young man may hold great promise in many areas, but if fundamental features are lacking, he cannot work for the Lord, even though his desire to serve the Lord is genuine and even though he has prepared himself for it.
[76]  I do not know what these ones make of themselves in other professions, but I have never seen a person who is unable to control and rule over his body prove to be a useful servant of the Lord, nor have I seen a man who does not have a mind to suffer who can serve the Lord.
[77]  If we have not looked to God for work, prayed for work, and found work, we are lazy, and we will not be able to accomplish much work.
[78]  The word in Greek for diligence is spoude or spoudazo.
[79]  It is also translated as zeal, earnestness, eager, and haste Rom 12:8, 11; 2 Cor 7:11-12; 8:7-8, 16; Heb 4:11; 6:11; 2 Pet 1:5, 10; 3:14; Gal 2:10; 2 Tim 2:15; 4:9, 21; Titus 3:12; Jude 3; 1 Thes 2:17; Eph 4:3; 2 Pet 1:15; Mark 6:25; Luke 1:39 .
[80]  If we are slothful, and ten of us are needed to do the work of one man, how can we meet the need of the work?
[81]  We should be diligent, and this means that we should not be afraid of responsibility, that we should serve the Lord with zeal, and that we should be burning in spirit.
[82]  We should always feel that we do not have enough, that we will not settle for what we have, and that we will not stop until we abound and are no longer idle or unfruitful unto the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[83]  Please read verse 15: "Moreover I will also be diligent that you may be able, after my exodus, to bring these things to mind at all times."
[84]  If we drag our feet and fail to see the needs around us, the responsibility that we bear, and the little time that we have, we will not get much of the Lord's work done.
[85]  Let us return to the passage in Matthew 25:18-30.
[86]  If we work one day when we are up and rest the next day when we are down, or work when the weather is fair and rest when the weather is foul, we will never see any result to our work.
[87]  Many people could be very useful in the hand of God; they could be a powerful vessel to the Lord.
[88]  Yet they remain useless to God, or they are used by Him in only a limited way.
[89]  Brothers and sisters, before the Lord we should realize that once we consecrate our mouth to be God's oracle, we have a great responsibility upon our shoulders.
[90]  There are several points connected with the matter of speaking, and we should take note of them.
[91]  First, let us note before the Lord the kind of talk we hear all the time.
[92]  Many people will not tell you some things because they know that you are not like them, and it would be useless to say that thing to you.
[93]  If a person readily shares certain things with you, he does it because he knows that you are of the same kind, and that such things will produce a certain effect on you.
[94]  One may hear and believe a certain kind of words, but if he decides to pass them on to others, this indicates that he is not only the kind of person being portrayed by the words, that is, a person in darkness, but he is also willing to make others just like himself.
[95]  Brothers and sisters, if we cannot bridle our tongue, how can we control ourselves and how can we serve the Lord?
[96]  Sixth, we must deal with the very way we listen.
[97]  But as long as he is inaccurate with his words, there is a gaping hole in his character.
[98]  Brothers and sisters, as the Lord's workers we come into constant contact with people and have therefore many opportunities to hear others speak as well as to speak to others ourselves.
[99]  If we are not disciplined and restricted in our words, it is very possible that while we are speaking God's word, we are spreading rumors and gossip at the same time.
[100]  Ninth, we should pay special attention to another point, which is to "not strive nor cry out."
[101]  The Bible prophesied of the Lord: "He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets" Matt 12:19; Isa 42:2 .
[102]  Paul said, "A slave of the Lord ought not to contend" 2 Tim 2:24 .
[103]  Some brothers and sisters pay much attention to their words, yet we cannot trust them, because even though we have never found a mistake in their words, we know that they are only concerned about the correctness of their words; they are not concerned about the correctness of their facts.
[104]  When we speak to others, we should not just pay attention to correctness in procedure and assume that we are telling the truth; we should instead pay attention to our motive before the Lord.
[105]  A worker of the Lord must speak accurate words; he must not be careless with his tongue.
[106]  The brothers and sisters may be entertained by our gossip and interesting tales, but we will fail to command their respect when we speak for the Lord.
[107]  There may be much fun in the joking and jesting, but when we turn around to speak God's word, they will consider our words to be of the same value as our stories, and our words will lose their weight.
[108]  If we are used to loose words and always indulge ourselves in unrestrained conversations, the impact of our words on those who listen will be the same when we speak for the Lord as it is when we speak in a loose way.
[109]  He has his own special portion before the Lord, and God uses him by bringing out his special portion.
[110]  We can confess our sins to the Lord and to the brothers, and both the Lord and the brothers can forgive us, but the words that we have spoken will remain and continue to spread.
[111]  Stability is another character trait that must be found in the life of every Christian worker.
[112]  First John 5:1 says, "Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God," and verse 13 says, "I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God."
[113]  The Bible tells us that after Peter recognized the Lord as the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord said, "Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens" Matt 16:17 .
[114]  Peter did not deserve any merit, but the Father's revelation enabled him to see the Lord as the Christ and the Son of God.
[115]  But we must remember that we do not know anything about many of the things that we say to the Lord at the time of our consecration and revival.
[116]  If another brother says, "You may think that you are loving the Lord, but actually you are not," they will argue, "If I do not love the Lord, who does?"
[117]  Brothers and sisters, the church of God has the nature of a stone.
[118]  A lazy man can be changed into a diligent man; a talkative man can be changed into a man of few words; an insensitive man can be changed into a man who listens; a man who is afraid of sufferings can be changed into one who is fearless in the face of sufferings; a man who cannot control his body can be changed into one who is a master of his body.
[119]  Subjectivity is another defect in the character of some of God's children, and in particular, of some workers for the Lord.
[120]  If a person is subjective, he cannot do a good work.
[121]  When we meet some brothers, we cannot help but sigh in our heart, "My brother, how many things can a person like you learn from the Lord?"
[122]  Another big problem of a subjective person is that he cannot receive any guidance from God.
[123]  He has no way to know God's guidance, and he is completely ignorant of His leading.
[124]  A person who has learned to listen to God is not subjective in any way: He will go forward when God commands him to go forward, and stop when God tells him to stop.
[125]  In regard to subjectivity, a further point should be noted: Our subjectivity must be dealt with by God before we will be fit to deal with others.
[126]  God will lead us to deal with other men only when we ourselves are first dealt with.
[127]  If a subjective person is put into God's work to instruct others in the way of God, his own will comes out ten times stronger than does the Lord's. A subjective person wants everyone to listen to him.
[128]  If a man has never been broken by the Lord, if he secretly cherishes his own ideas, demands, and hobbies, God cannot use him because he is untrustworthy.
[129]  Subjectivity can be expressed through the smallest things in our life.
[130]  If a man's subjectivity is dealt with by the Lord, he will show a marked difference in the numerous small actions of his daily life.
[131]  When a young worker of the Lord is put together with a few other brothers, you will immediately know whether or not he is a subjective person.
[132]  We can speak when there is a need, but we do not have to make a rule that we must speak all the time, nor do we have to make a habit of speaking.
[133]  What should be the attitude of a Christian worker, a servant of God, towards money?
[134]  This is quite a serious question, and unless a worker has a definite breakthrough in this matter, he cannot work for the Lord.
[135]  In the New Testament Peter spoke of the way of Balaam.
[136]  He showed us what it is: "Having eyes full of adultery and not ceasing from sin; enticing unstable souls, having a heart exercised for covetousness, children of curse" 2 Pet 2:14 .
[137]  "Forsaking the straight way, they have gone astray, following the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness" v. 15 . What happens when a person falls into habitual covetousness? He forsakes the straight way, goes astray, and follows the way of Balaam, the son of Beor! Brothers and sisters, God has set before us "the straight way." Which way should we go? Some have forsaken the straight way, gone astray, and followed the way of Balaam.
[138]  Please remember that as long as money occupies a place in our heart and covetousness becomes a habit, we can pray all we want for God to stop us from going to a certain place, but money will eventually direct our footsteps.
[139]  Let us now consider how the Lord Jesus trained His disciples.
[140]  In Matthew 15, we see another occasion with four thousand people, excluding women and children.
[141]  The Lord told them, "I am moved with compassion for the crowd, because for three days now they have remained with Me and they do not have anything to eat" v. 32 . The word "and" means that the Lord Himself was also without food for those three days.
[142]  He said, "For the poor you have with you always, but you do not always have Me" v. 11 . The Lord was saying that there is nothing wrong about caring for the poor, but we cannot hold back anything when it comes to sacrificing for the Lord.
[143]  Let us come to the third point Paul's attitude towards money.
[144]  If we keep money in our hands, no matter how little it may be, and if, at the same time, we expect God to constantly work on the other brothers and sisters, we will find that God does just the opposite; He will not entrust His money to our hands.
[145]  Paul's words in 2 Corinthians 6:10 are wonderful: "As poor yet enriching many."
[146]  When we work in a place and the brothers and sisters there have something to say about us, or if they have a wrong attitude towards us, we should maintain our dignity as workers.
[147]  Finally, let us consider Paul's attitude in relation to funds that the church passed through his hands and which others wanted him to manage.
[148]  In 2 Corinthians 8:1-4 he wrote, "Furthermore we make known to you, brothers, the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia, that in much proving of affliction the abundance of their joy and the depth of their poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality; that according to their power, I testify, and beyond their power, of their own accord, with much entreaty they besought of us the grace and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints."
[149]  When a worker goes to a place to work for the Lord, this must be his attitude whenever he touches money.
[150]  And we sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel is throughout all the churches, and not only this, but who has also been selected by the churches as our fellow traveler in this grace which is being ministered by us, to the glory of the Lord Himself and to demonstrate our eagerness; avoiding this, that anyone should find fault with us in this abundance which is being ministered by us.
[151]  In this chapter we will speak of a few other matters, namely: 1 upholding the absoluteness of the truth, 2 taking care of our physical health, 3 daily habits, and 4 marriage and virginity.
[152]  If a man is not absolute to the truth, he will, in the course of his work, sacrifice God's truth for man, himself, or his own desires.
[153]  We have to see the glory of God's truth.
[154]  We cannot project our own feelings into His truth.
[155]  When we stand beside God's truth, we should not just consider ourselves to be smaller than it; we should consider ourselves to be non-existent.
[156]  If we involve the self even a little, we will end up with trouble immediately.
[157]  He felt that he had been unjustly criticized where he had been, but he did not really touch the truth before the Lord.
[158]  All judgments are based on truth, not on individuals.
[159]  Whenever the basis of judgment is shifted to an individual, we have compromised God's way and His truth.
[160]  When we confront a situation, we should ask what God's truth is, not what our feelings are.
[161]  If truth tells us that we should totally separate ourselves, we should sever ties with even our best friends.
[162]  If truth dictates that we should not separate, we cannot separate even if we are arguing with each other and irritating each other every day.
[163]  If we are together merely because of personal reasons, we do not know what the truth is, and we cannot go on.
[164]  If we are able to take the absolute way of truth among the co-workers, we will be able to say what we should say and do what we should do.
[165]  A worker of the Lord also has to pay attention to his own body.
[166]  We know that Paul was a very gifted brother, and he prayed many times for others' healings.
[167]  Brothers and sisters, we should not have the concept that we should neglect our body.
[168]  It is true that we need a mind to suffer and that we need to reign over our body and put it under subjection.
[169]  But we also should take care of our health if at all possible.
[170]  When the Lord has a commission and there is a need in the work, we have to sacrifice ourselves.
[171]  If we want to serve the Lord properly, we have to maintain one principle: We do everything according to the Scripture and in a way that will not stumble anyone.
[172]  A worker of the Lord must also have a proper view and suitable resolution concerning the matter of virginity and marriage.
[173]  But this is an important issue with the Lord's worker, and we have to say something about it based on the teaching of the Bible.
[174]  Paul had a clear word about the matter of virginity in 1 Corinthians 7:25-35: "Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who has been shown mercy by the Lord to be faithful.
[175]  Henceforth both those who have wives should be as though they had none, and those who weep as though they did not weep, and those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, and those who buy as though they did not possess, and those who use the world as though they did not abuse it; for the fashion of this world is passing away.
[176]  Paul made this very clear in 1 Corinthians 7:1-9: "Now concerning the things of which you wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
[177]  But because of fornication, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.
[178]  The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise the husband also does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.
[179]  Do not deprive each other, except by agreement for a time that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and then be together again, that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
