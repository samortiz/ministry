   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Bearing Fruit to God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As a wife we bear fruit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What does this mean, and why does Paul mention it in Romans 7:4?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we were in the flesh that is, when we were the old husband everything related to us was death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All we could produce was death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everything we brought forth was a fruit of death and to death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now as a regenerated person that is, as the wife we bear fruit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This simply means that everything we do now is related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Formerly, whatever we were and whatever we did was death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, in these verses we see a vivid contrast between death and God, between bearing fruit to death and bearing fruit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This proves that when we were the old man and the old husband, held under the law, everything we were and did was death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The result was fruit to death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a new man and the wife, married to a new husband, whatever we are and do is related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We bear fruit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What does the phrase bear fruit to God mean?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It means that God comes forth, that God is brought forth as fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, all we are and do must be the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must bring forth God as an overflow of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this way we have the living God as our fruit and we bear fruit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Serving the Lord in Newness of Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As a wife we must also serve the Lord in newness of spirit, not in oldness of the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word spirit in this verse denotes our regenerated human spirit in which the Lord as the Spirit dwells 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may serve in newness of spirit because God has renewed our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our regenerated, renewed, human spirit is a source of newness for our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With our regenerated spirit everything is new, and everything that comes out of it is new.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Oldness is not with our regenerated spirit; it is with the old law, the old regulations, and the old letters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, we do not serve the Lord in the oldness of the letter, but in the newness of our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all must learn how to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you come to the meetings of the church, do not exercise your memory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Exercise your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you exercise your spirit, you will have something new to offer the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is also true in giving a message.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If I retain a great deal of information in my memory and try to give a message according to this memorized material, that message will be old, filled with the oldness of dead knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, if I forget my memory and exercise my spirit as I give the message, something new will burst forth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I had this kind of experience during the Erie conference in 1969.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In one meeting I stood up to speak, but was not clear concerning the content of the message.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I stood by faith, exercising my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Immediately, the matter of the seven Spirits in the book of Revelation came forth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everyone who heard that message can testify that it was new, fresh, powerful, and living.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That was the first day the seven-fold, intensified Spirit came forth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After that, I returned to Los Angeles to hold the 1969 summer conference on that very subject.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the Lord s recovery in this country that summer was crucial and witnessed a major turn.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to exercise our spirit continually because our regenerated spirit is a source of newness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord, the divine life, and the Holy Spirit are all in our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everything in our regenerated spirit is new.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not remember the law, for with the law there is nothing but oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In our regenerated spirit there is nothing but newness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As regenerated people who have been married to Christ as the new husband, we must bear fruit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whatever we do, are, and have must be God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God overflows from our being to become our fruit to God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must also serve the Lord in newness of spirit, not in oldness of letter, not in oldness of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have nothing to do with the law any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have been freed from it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now we are under grace, living with and by our new husband, who is Christ.</S>
