   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Indwelling of Christ the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him v. 9 . Many verses in the epistles begin with the wonderful word but.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hallelujah for but !</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In our history we need many buts such as this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should be able to say, Oh, I was down this morning, but.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am so weak in myself, but.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am absolutely hopeless, but.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul says, But you are not in the flesh .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Never say that you have a good flesh and that you are in your good flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not remain in our flesh, for our flesh has been condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a house has been condemned by the government, it is illegal for you to stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, the flesh has been thoroughly condemned by God, and we should not remain there, arguing that our flesh has improved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not be in the flesh, but in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This spirit denotes the human spirit mingled with the Divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Indwelling of the Spirit of God</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is a condition for us to be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The condition is that the Spirit of God dwell in us v. 9 . The word dwells really means makes home.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are in the spirit if the Spirit of God dwells, makes His home, in us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although you are saved, perhaps the Spirit of God does not yet make His home in you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This explains why you are still not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although the Spirit of God is in you, He has been unable to make His home in you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He does not dwell in you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I may be invited to your home, but I am unable to make my home in your home.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am there as a guest, unable to settle myself there.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Likewise, the Spirit of God is in us, yet He may be unable to dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is the guest, not the dweller.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the Spirit of God can make His home in us, settling Himself in us with adequate room, then we will be in spirit and not in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, if the Spirit of God does not have this room in which to lodge, we will remain in the flesh, not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Indwelling of the Spirit of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 9 says, But if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Immediately the Spirit of God is changed to the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No one can deny that this indicates that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ and that the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul says, if any one has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you have realized that the Spirit of God does not yet make His home in you, do not be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do not say, Since the Spirit of God doesn t have a home in me, I give up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although the Spirit of God does not dwell in you, you do have the Spirit of God which is the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As long as you have the Spirit of Christ, you are of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Are you not of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all must declare, Hallelujah, I am of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have the Spirit of Christ in us and we are of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, it is a conditional matter whether or not the Spirit of God, which is the Spirit of Christ, dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Spirit of Christ has to make His home in us, has to take possession of our inner being, that we may be in the spirit</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Indwelling of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 10 says, And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Here it says that Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In verse 9 it is the Spirit of God and then the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now in verse 10 it is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This surely proves that Christ is the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all must admit this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ as the Spirit is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is a tremendous matter.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Where was Christ in Romans 3?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He was on the cross, shedding His blood for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Where was Christ in chapter four?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He was in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But in chapter eight Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In chapter six we are in Christ, but in chapter eight Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To be in Christ is one aspect; to have Christ in us is another.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>First, we abide in Christ, then Christ abides in us John 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our abiding in Him brings His abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Being in Christ is the condition for Christ to be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Praise the Lord that Christ is in us!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ has wrought Himself into us; He has been processed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This Christ has to dwell and make His home in us.</S>
