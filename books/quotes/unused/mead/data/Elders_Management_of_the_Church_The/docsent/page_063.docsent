   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE NEED TO BE CAPABLE IN EVERYTHING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is not enough for an elder to be capable on one point, in one area, or with one part only; elders have to be capable in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The elders must be able to think, to endeavor, to oversee, to foresee, and to achieve.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They must be able to protect, to resist, and to build.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is the need for them to be all-inclusive in their ability.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many of the brothers sitting here have the experience of being an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Surely, many times they feel that they cannot meet the many needs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are many things we should see that we have not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are many things we should think of that we have not thought of.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are many things we should guard against that we have foolishly not guarded against.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are many things we should have brought up, but we have neglected them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are many things we should have done, but we have missed the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are many things we should have said but did not say.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are some things we should deal with but do not know how to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are many things we should solve, take the lead in, or help with, but we do not have the way to do what we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We know we need to study the Bible, but we do not know how to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Surely we know that we should preach the gospel, but we do not know how to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From our experience, we have found that the elders have to be capable in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet, in many areas we have fallen short.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For this reason, we have to see that the elders must be coordinated, because no one person is capable in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A member cannot be capable in everything; only the body is capable in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The eyes can only see.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The ears can only hear.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The hands can only work, and the feet can only walk.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no way for a member to be capable in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Any brother or sister can only have that little bit of gift that he or she has; he or she cannot be capable in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even the apostle Paul had to admit that he could not do Peter's work, or James' work, or John's. Although Paul was a multi-talented apostle, and although he was gifted in many ways, he was very weak in areas other than his specialties.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He could not replace the specialty of Peter, nor that of John.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the elders in the church see the need to be capable in everything, immediately they will realize the need of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is impossible for you alone to meet the many needs in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Perhaps you are skillful in planning, yet you may not be able to carry out your plans practically.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Perhaps you are good in working, but you are very weak in planning.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You may be especially good in shepherding, but you may be very weak in handling business affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You may be very good in handling business affairs, but you may come short in the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, you can see that no elder can meet all the needs.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To meet all the needs, the elders must be coordinated.</S>
