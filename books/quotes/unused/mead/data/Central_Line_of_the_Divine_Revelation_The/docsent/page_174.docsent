   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today our body is a body of humiliation with no glory, honor, or dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are very mean and low, mainly because of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, one day this body of humiliation will be transfigured into the body of Christ's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today our body is like the bud of a flower.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But in the day of our transfiguration, our body will be transfigured from a bud to a blossoming flower.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The glorification of God's conformed sons is initiated by the Spirit's sealing unto the day of the redemption of the believers' body Eph 1:13-14; 4:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today the Spirit is sealing us, and this sealing is not once for all but will continue for our whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From the day of our regeneration, the sealing of the Spirit began to saturate and permeate us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This saturation and permeation will continue unto the day of the redemption of our body, until the sealing reaches its fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even at that time the sealing of the Spirit will not cease.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Being Their Full Sonship</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The redemption of the believers' body is their full sonship Rom 8:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Full sonship means that we are of full age.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the United States, a person is not considered to be of full legal age until he is eighteen.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Being of full age is a matter of maturity.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But I have seen that those who married as teen-agers always suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The reason they suffered is that they lacked maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God predestinated us unto sonship Eph 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His intention is to make us His sons, but we need to grow until we reach maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we reach maturity, our sonship will become full.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today God cannot glorify us because we are not yet mature.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We cannot blossom because we have not yet grown to maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we must grow.</S>
