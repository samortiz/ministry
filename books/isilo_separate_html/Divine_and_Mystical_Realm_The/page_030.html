The Overcoming Saints Living in Their Spirit</h2><p>The overcoming of the degradation is by the participation of the overcoming saints who are living in their spirit (Rev. 1:10; 4:2; 17:3; 21:10). On the one hand, our overcoming is by Christ&#8217;s speaking becoming the Spirit&#8217;s speaking. On the other hand, it is by our living in our spirit all the time. In Revelation 1:10 John said that on the Lord&#8217;s Day he was in spirit. This shows that John the apostle was a man in the spirit, always living in the spirit.<h2 class=head2>C. For:</h2><h2 class=head3>1. The Complete Preparation of the Bride for Christ</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry is for the complete preparation of the bride for Christ the Bridegroom to have His triumphant wedding in the millennium for His satisfaction according to His good pleasure (Rev. 19:7-9).<h2 class=head3>2. The Formation of the Bridal Army</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry is also for the formation of the bridal army for Christ to defeat and destroy His top enemies in humanity, the Antichrist and his false prophet (Rev. 19:11-21; 17:14). The coming Antichrist and his false prophet will be human enemies of Christ, attacking Christ to the uttermost. They will fight face to face with an army against Christ. But Christ and His bride will destroy them and throw them into the lake of fire.<h2 class=head3>3. The Binding of Satan</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry is for the binding of Satan and the casting of him into the abyss for one thousand years (Rev. 20:1-3).<h2 class=head3>4. The Kingdom of Christ and of God</h2><p>His sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry is also for the bringing in of the kingdom of Christ and of God, which will be the millennium (Rev. 20:4-6).<h2 class=head3>5. The Consummation of the New Jerusalem</h2><p>Ultimately, Christ&#8217;s sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry is for the initial consummation of the New Jerusalem in the millennium (Rev. 2:7) and its full consummation in the new heaven and new earth (21:2). In other words, the New Jerusalem will be consummated by the overcomers first in the initial part in the thousand years on a small scale and then in eternity on a full scale. All the believers, through the discipline of the one thousand years, will be matured, transformed, and conformed, to participate in the New Jerusalem in eternity.<h2 class=head2>D. The Final Outcome</h2><p>The final outcome is that the ultimately consummated Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God becomes the Bridegroom and the aggregate of the overcoming saints becomes the bride of the universal romance between the redeeming God and His redeemed man as the conclusion of the entire Scriptures (Rev. 22:17). The conclusion of the entire Bible is a couple, which is the consummation of the universal romance of the redeeming God and His redeemed man. The Bridegroom is God as the consummated Spirit, and the bride is the aggregate of all the overcomers. This is all accomplished by the additional section of the sevenfold intensified organic salvation of God.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> </body></html>
