   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD'S VICTORY IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This Psalm begins with the moving of God and continues with the victory which Christ has gained.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All God's enemies have been defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When God moves with the tabernacle and with the ark, the enemies will always be vanquished.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Wherever He goes, He always wins the victory; wherever He moves, He conquers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He has never been defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many times in reading the Old Testament we are impressed only with the failures of God's people, the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But we must read their history in Exodus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy from a different perspective.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must see that whenever in God's move He confronted the enemy, the enemy was defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not once was God ever defeated by His enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As long as God's people had the tabernacle of God with the ark as its center, they were victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They may fail, but God could never be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Have you ever found a single instance in the Bible of God being defeated?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God has never been defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the main concept of this Psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God is moving, and with His move is constant victory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Oh, if we are in God's house with Christ as the center, we can never be defeated!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may sometimes delay God a little, just as the children of Israel delayed Him for forty years in the wilderness, but what do forty years mean to God?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a thousand years is but one day in God's eyes, forty years is only equivalent to about fifty-five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to divine reckoning, the children of Israel delayed God about fifty-five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, with God there is no concept of time; time is something with which we are concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To God, yesterday, today and tomorrow are all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In a human sense, God has been delayed many times, but He has never been defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To Him, a delay in time means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is moving on, and wherever He goes He defeats the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Regardless of how poor the situation of the church may be, we should not be distracted.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must look at the glory of God's move and His eternal victory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him" v. 1 . "The Lord sendeth the news of victory the kings of the armies, they flee, they flee!" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"The Almighty scattered kings" v. 14 . "Thou has led captive a train of vanquished foes" v. 18 . "God will smite the head of the enemies" v. 21 . God's victory is the second point of this Psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 11: "The Lord sendeth the news of victory: great is the host of women that publish the tidings."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are all just a group of women, a host of females, publishing the good news.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are not so strong and able; we are not, in a sense, the warriors of battle; we are the women publishers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We just publish the good tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And what are the good tidings?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 12: "The kings of the armies, they flee, they flee!"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These are the glad tidings the victory of Christ, the defeat of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I could testify that when I was in the denominations, I was continually sighing, groaning, and begging, "O Lord, merciful Lord, have mercy on me."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The meetings of the group with which I met were filled with this kind of cry.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I never heard praising or rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I never heard a song like, "Victory, victory, hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In these days in the local churches I am forever hearing, "Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All the enemies flee!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They flee!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They flee!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The publishers of the glad tidings are women, and those who divide the spoil are also women.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The women tarry at home; they do not go out to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yet they divide the spoil.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have never gone out to the battle; I am just a woman, abiding at home, enjoying the victory and dividing the spoil.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should all do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Praise the Lord, we are qualified, we are entitled to divide the spoil.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All the meetings in the local churches are just the dividing of the spoil.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What are the spoils?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 13 tells us: "The wings of a dove covered with silver and its pinions with glittering gold."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The dove is the Spirit, and the wings are the soaring power; so the spoils are the soaring power of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These wings are covered with silver, covered with Christ in His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Her pinions are covered with glittering gold, God's divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the spoil the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have the Spirit as the dove, Christ the Son as the silver, and God the Father as the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All three Persons of the Godhead together constitute the spoil.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The spoil is our strength as two wings, not to walk or to run, but to fly and to soar.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When you come to the local church and join in the Hallelujahs, you are enjoying the spoil.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Eventually, after every meeting, you will have the sense that you are soaring.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We do have wings, and we are on the wings of the dove.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our spoil is the Triune God as our soaring strength, and all the spoil issues from the victory of Christ.</S>
