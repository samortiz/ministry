 <h2 class="head3">Walking on the Way of the Divine Nature</h2>
<p>Verse 21b says, &ldquo;And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.&rdquo; After entering through the gates, we begin to walk on the street. After we are regenerated, we have the divine life and nature within us as our way. To walk on the street of gold after being regenerated is to walk on the way of the divine life and nature. We know this from our own experience. Whenever we have a revival, we renew our experience of Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection, and we begin again to walk on the street of gold, on the way of God&rsquo;s divine life and nature.</p>
<p>What is the Lord&rsquo;s way? The Lord Himself is the gate, the door, and He is the way (John 10:7; 14:6). By His death and resurrection, we enter into the spiritual realm, into God Himself, and into His kingdom, the realm and sphere of God. By this we have the life and nature of God which becomes a way for us. After entering into the spiritual realm, we walk on the way of the divine nature and live, act, and behave according to the divine life. We may apply this in the following way. A brother may ask us what kind of shirt he should buy. If we truly know how to walk on the street of gold, we will not tell him what to buy. We should simply say, &ldquo;Do not come to me; I am not your way. The street of pure gold, the divine life and nature within you, is your way. Now you must walk on that way.&rdquo; There is only one way, and no one can get lost on this way.</p>
<p>Our way is the Lord Himself as the divine life and nature within us, and this way is our leading. If we have the way, we have the leading. In America today there are freeways and expressways. Wherever we want to go, we simply get on a freeway, and it takes us there. This illustrates that the way is the leading itself. The Lord Himself must be life to us, and He must be our nature within. Then He will be our way, and if He is our way, He will be our leading, and it will be easy for us to go on. In the New Jerusalem, in the church, in the spiritual realm, there is only one way.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Walking on the One Way toward the One Goal</h2>
<p>There are three gates on each of the four sides of the wall of the New Jerusalem, and at the center of the city there is the throne. When we were young, we spent much time to study how twelve gates could have only one street which leads to the throne of God. First we must point out that the wall of the New Jerusalem is a hundred and forty-four cubits high, but the city proper is twelve thousand stadia in height (Rev. 21:16-17). That the wall is lower and the city is higher indicates that the city proper is like a mountain, like the city situated upon a mountain in Matthew 5:14. Moreover, the throne of God is in the center on the top of this mountain. Therefore, the one street must be a spiral that reaches all twelve gates.</p>
<p>Regardless through which gate we enter, we are on the same street. On this street there is no left lane, right lane, or multiple lanes. We are all in one lane, following one after another as we march to Zion. Whether we come from America, Africa, Australia, Europe, Asia, or any other direction, we are all on the same street. In this way we become one army, one church, one people, marching in the same lane toward the same goal. This lane is God Himself in His divine life and nature as the way of pure gold.</p>
<h2 class="head3">A Real and True Picture of the Church</h2>
<p>The entire city of New Jerusalem is nothing other than God Himself wrought into and mingled with humanity. This is a full and true picture of what the church must be today. The more we experience God in Christ as our life and nature, the more we are on the way. On this way there is the flow of living water, and in the flow of living water there is the tree of life.</p>
<p>From our experiences we can testify that all the things we have said here are true. We have experienced these things, and we are still experiencing them. When we passed through the pearl gates, the death and resurrection of Christ, we received the divine nature, and we began to walk in and live by this nature. At the same time the Holy Spirit is working within us to transform us into precious stones for the building up of the wall. Through the work of the Son and the Holy Spirit with the nature of God the Father, the Triune God dispenses Himself into us to transform us into His image.</p>
<p>No human words can exhaust the telling of these wonderful matters. I have ministered from Revelation 21 and 22 many times, but I have never once finished. If you would give me more time, I would still not be able to finish. What is in these two chapters is too rich.</p>
