<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. By His Organic Salvation</H2><P>Then Christ carries out His organic salvation by Himself as the life-giving Spirit in His stage of inclusion (1 Cor. 15:45b). He was God, and then He became the flesh. As the flesh, through His death and resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit includes all the elements of Christ's person and work. Divinity, humanity, Christ's death with its effectiveness, and His resurrection with its power are all included in the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. By the Intensified Work<br>of His Organic Salvation</H2><P>The intensified work of Christ's organic salvation is carried out by Him as the sevenfold intensified Spirit in His intensification (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6). Incarnation, inclusion, and intensification are the three stages of Christ for Him to consummate His complete salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE BRIDE, THE WIFE, OF CHRIST</H2><P>The bride, the wife, of Christ will be prepared in full by Him for His wedding as His pleasure and satisfaction at the opening of the kingdom age. The preparation of the bride is by Christ's redemption, organic salvation, and the intensified work of His organic salvation. Revelation 19 says the bride is prepared fully by being properly adorned. Christ is now adorning us to make us His bride. Christ's pleasure and satisfaction is His bride prepared, adorned, in full. Revelation 19:7-9 says, "Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready. And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints. And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they who are called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true words of God." This takes place at the opening of the kingdom age.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Wedding Day</H2><P>The kingdom age will be one thousand years as one wedding day to celebrate the exultant wedding of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The New Jerusalem in Its Initial Consummation</H2><P>This excellent consummation, the bride, the wife, of Christ, of His complete salvation will be the New Jerusalem in its initial consummation for the celebration of Christ's wedding for one thousand years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Its Ultimate Consummation</H2><P>The New Jerusalem will be for Christ's eternal enjoyment in its ultimate consummation in the new heaven and new earth for eternity.</P><P>I hope this clear word will really reach us and be received by us with full willingness. Then we will be blessed to be invited to participate in Christ's wedding as His bride, and eventually we will all be a part of the wife of Christ.</P>
