   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE PURSUIT, CHARACTER,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND SERVICE OF THE FULL-TIMERS NEEDING A SPIRIT OF PRAYER AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>PAYING ATTENTION TO LIFE AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A group of young saints recently consecrated themselves to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Seventy to eighty of them are from the church in Taipei, and the remaining one hundred twenty are from other places.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The majority of these saints are between twenty-five and thirty-five years old, and they need to be trained in all aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the atmosphere of prayer for such a training is lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot depend merely on a certain person to train them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must increase our prayer, and we must have a spirit of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These days are for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should even fast and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only the Lord is the Spirit, and only the Lord can train us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should never think that we are establishing a theological seminary.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today s Christianity depends on theology, which is of no profit in accomplishing God s economy; hence, we cannot take the way of theology.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Theology emphasizes neither life nor the Spirit, but we emphasize both life and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The natural man tends to care for knowledge and organization, not for life and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot walk according to the tendency of the natural man; neither can we be without knowledge, because even though the writing of the Bible is according to the Spirit of life, the written word is through knowledge and is knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If there were no written word, God could not put forth the revelation concerning life and concerning the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, we need to have knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is regrettable that Christianity leans toward knowledge and does not stress life and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Lord s recovery we need to have proper knowledge of the Bible; however, we must not focus on knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must focus on life and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The brothers and sisters who desire to be in the training full time must have a new beginning with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This requires much prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How the training should be conducted requires our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should pray by ourself, when we come together in small numbers, and in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a rule, we should pray unceasingly in the training meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should pray and pray and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When our prayer is thorough, we will be clear concerning how to lead the training.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Without sufficient prayer we will not know how the training should proceed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we merely listen to messages to gain knowledge, we are taking a way that is not according to the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, we should have a spirit of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>DILIGENTLY STUDYING THE RECOVERY VERSION</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>AND THE LIFE-STUDY MESSAGES</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The full-time trainees who are twenty-one years old should continue with their education and not consider full-time service until after they finish their college education.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every morning, from Monday to Friday, all the trainees must study the Recovery Version and the Life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They should study the text, the footnotes, the Life-studies, and the cross references.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How much they study the cross references depends on their time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, they must read through and understand the text of the Recovery Version and study the footnotes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In addition, they must read and understand the Life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we study, we first need to read the text according to the outlines.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Once we understand the text, we can read the footnotes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After we understand the text and the footnotes, we should find the corresponding portion in the Life-study messages and go over the Life-studies with the text and the footnotes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I hope that the trainees will study five days every week, from eight o clock in the morning to twelve noon.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After studying for an hour, they can take a fifteen-minute break.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is better to study in groups of three or five.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Saturdays should be set aside for service.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are willing to practice this, after four years we will finish the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>CARING ONLY FOR THE BIBLE,</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>NOT THE CREEDS</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should pursue the truth by studying the Recovery Version and the Life-studies, but we should never consider this as our theology.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The term theology is misleading.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have only the Bible; we do not have theology.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The problems in Christianity began around the second or third century when the church fathers developed a theology from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325, the so-called Nicene Creed was instituted to determine the important doctrines and theology.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the one hand, the creed was written according to the New Testament, but not all of the books in the New Testament were recognized at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the other hand, the creed was written according to the teachings of the church fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For some, the creed is now more authoritative than the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even though some people advocate the creed and consider it to be according to the Bible, the creed is not as complete as the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For example, Revelation, the last book of the Bible, speaks of the seven Spirits, but this is not in the Nicene creed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Moreover, the items in the Bible that are included in the creed are not covered in a detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Furthermore, the Bible is different from all other books.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although scholars spend much effort to study the writing style of the Bible, rarely can one describe the style clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For example, it is difficult to define the style of writing in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It differs from the style of writing commonly used by writers, and the topics, central line, emphases, and structure of the sections in this book are not immediately obvious to a reader.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is as if the points in this book are scattered like stars in the sky with here a little and there a little.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hence, we cannot systematize the Bible by applying systematic theology.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In 1983 I released a series of messages in Stuttgart, Germany, concerning the central view of the divine dispensing see chapters 1 through 10 of The Divine Dispensing of the Divine Trinity .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I have since studied the relationship between the Father and the Son, the Son and the Spirit, and the Spirit and the Father and found many important points.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>One point is that the Son comes with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is a crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, the theology in Christianity does not emphasize the Son coming with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Not even the creeds point out that when the Son was on the earth, the Father was with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Christian theology is even general in the way it says that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexist simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Unless a person studies this subject, he will not notice that the Son came with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Due to the incompleteness of the creeds, the British Brethren declared that they wanted the Bible, not the creeds.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Later the Southern Baptist Church, one of the largest denominations in America, also declared that they wanted the Bible, not the creeds.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Church of Christ made the same declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>More than sixty years ago, when we were raised up by the Lord in China, we also declared that we do not care for the creeds; we care only for the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The creeds are not wrong, but because they are incomplete, they unavoidably cause people to err in their understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In 1984 the Southern Baptist Church put out a publication with a list of all orthodox Christian groups, and we were included in this list.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They also commented on several of our books, including The Economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Their conclusion was that even though Witness Lee s exposition of the Bible may not be considered wrong, he adheres too closely to the lexical meaning of the Scriptures; hence, theologians who follow the creeds or base their beliefs on the various Councils find my exposition difficult to accept.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>After I read their conclusion, I said Hallelujah, because in America our slogan has always been Return to the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The theology in various denominations in Christianity is not pure, but the truths in the Lord s recovery are entirely based on the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Our interpretation of the Bible is based on the Bible, not on our own views.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Since the time of Brother Nee, the light that we have received has been progressing and increasing because we follow the Bible in our exposition.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>For example, before 1939, when Brother Nee spoke of our co-death with Christ, he stressed reckoning, based on the writings of A. B. Simpson, the founder of Christian and Missionary Alliance.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>One of Simpson s hymns says, There s a little word that the Lord has giv n...</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>/ Let us reckon ourselves to be dead to sin Hymns, #692 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>According to this hymn, the word that the Lord has given us is reckon.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Brother Nee translated this hymn into Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>From 1938 to 1939 Brother Nee gave the messages in The Normal Christian Life in which he emphasized reckoning.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>However, after 1939 Brother Nee saw that the fact of our co-death with Christ in Romans 6 can only be experienced in the Spirit revealed in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Therefore, mere reckoning does not avail; we must be in the Spirit, because the fact of our co-death with Christ is only in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In this matter Brother Nee had a great advancement.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Another example is concerning church practice.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In 1934 Brother Nee conducted a Bible study with the co-workers in Shanghai to study the church.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The messages were published in The Assembly Life.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>After He completed the draft, Brother Nee asked me to write a preface to the book.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In this book Brother Nee said that we did not have official apostles who establish churches; hence, no elders can be officially appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Hence, at best we were unofficial apostles establishing unofficial churches and appointing unofficial elders.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Three years later, in 1937, Brother Nee gathered the co-workers in Shanghai and gave messages that were later published as The Normal Christian Church Life.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In these messages he said that there are still apostles today and that an apostle is one who is sent out by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Since there are apostles, there are churches that are established by the apostles and elders who are appointed by them.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This shows that Brother Nee had a change in his understanding concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In 1948 several co-workers and I went to Brother Nee s home in Foochow, and we stayed with him for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>While he was speaking with us, he said that in 1937 we clearly saw the line of Antioch, but we neglected the line of Jerusalem; however, we should stress the line of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This does not mean that he had a different view, but it shows that his view became more complete.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>These examples show that we care only for the Bible, not the creeds.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If a person cares for the creeds, it is not possible for him to change, and neither is it possible for him to advance.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>In a few years we may see more than what we have already seen.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Our expounding of the Bible progresses and advances whenever we receive light.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We cannot set up a creed to replace the Bible; this is evil before God.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Although many denominations stress the creeds over the Bible, they cannot deny the fact that the Bible is a higher authority.</S>
