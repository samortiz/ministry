   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. CHRIST BEING THE REALITY OF THE LAW,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SIGNIFIED BY: A. The Testimony of God, Signifying Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>as the Living Portrait of What God Is</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is the reality of the law as the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The testimony of God signifies Christ as the living portrait of what God is Col 2:9; 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Ten Commandments are brief, but they give us a portrait of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They show us that God is a jealous God, that He cannot tolerate other gods.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this matter, He is like a husband who is jealous concerning his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Also, God is a God of love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here we have five crucial words jealous, love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Ten Commandments were written on two tablets, with each tablet containing five commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way, the Ten Commandments were divided into two groups of five.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first three commandments are concerned with God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first commandment says that the Lord is God and that we should not have any gods before Him Exo 20:2-3 ; the second commandment, that we should not make idols or worship idols vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>4-6 ; and the third commandment, that we should not take the name of God in vain v. 7 . The fourth commandment requires that we keep the Sabbath vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This commandment indicates that God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because He loves us, He wants us to have a day of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fifth commandment is the commandment to honor our parents v. 12 . This commandment is ranked with the first four commandments, which are related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The reason for this ranking involves our source as human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Luke 3 the human generations are traced all the way back to Adam, and then to God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that when we honor our parents, we honor our source, which, ultimately, is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we honor our parents, we recognize the fact that, through them, we can trace our source back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who do not respect their parents do not respect God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The five commandments in the second group are all related to humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These are the commandments about not killing, not committing adultery, not stealing, not lying, and not coveting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may use five words to summarize these five commandments: murder, adultery, stealing, lying, and covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Anyone who does not murder, commit fornication, steal, lie, or covet is a perfect person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have pointed out that the Ten Commandments portray God as the One who is a God of jealousy, love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The last five commandments are related to God's holiness and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, a person who steals or lies is not righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The God who is jealous, who is love and light, and who is holy and righteous is embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For this reason, Christ is God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ is jealous, loving, and full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is also holy and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is the reality of the law, which is a portrait of God.</S>
