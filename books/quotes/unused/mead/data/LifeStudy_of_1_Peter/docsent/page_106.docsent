   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Peter says that God has called us into His eternal glory in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Christ indicates that the God of all grace has gone through all the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to accomplish the complete and full redemption so that He may bring His redeemed people into an organic union with Himself.</S>

   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the steps of the divine operation are in Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God becoming the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the bountiful life supply to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is in this Christ, through His all-inclusive redemption and based on all His achievements, that God can be the God of all grace to call us into His eternal glory and to perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us in the Triune God 1:1-2 as the solid foundation, thus enabling us to attain unto His glorious goal.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to what Peter says in 5:10, our sufferings are only for a little while, but God s glory is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After we have suffered a little while, the God of all grace will personally perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The word Himself indicates God s personal activity in the work of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Greek word rendered perfect literally means restore.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It implies repairing, adjusting, putting in order again, mending, perfectly joining together, thoroughly equipping, well furnishing, and, thus, perfecting, completing, educating.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Greek the word establish literally means to set fast, to confirm.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The meaning of strengthen is very close to that of establish.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Literally, the Greek word rendered ground means to lay a basis for.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is a derivation of the word that means foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, it is to ground solidly, as in Matthew 7:25, Ephesians 3:17, and Hebrews 1:10.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is a progress in the four divine acts of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perfecting leads to establishing, establishing to strengthening, and strengthening to grounding in the God of all grace the Triune God in His dispensation 1:1-2 as the solid foundation.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through the suffering of persecution we are perfected.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we are established, we no longer wander, and we are no longer changeable.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After God establishes us, He strengthens us, empowers us, and eventually, He grounds us in Himself as the Triune God.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First Peter 5:12 says, Through Silvanus, the faithful brother, as I account him, I wrote to you briefly, entreating and fully testifying that this is the true grace of God; in which stand.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>That they may pass through those sufferings, God will supply them with all the multiplied, varied, and true grace 5:10; 1:2; 4:10 , which is sufficient to enable them to participate in the sufferings of Christ and for Christ 2:21; 3:14-17; 4:12-16 , and will perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground them in the Triune God and bring them into His eternal glory.</S>
