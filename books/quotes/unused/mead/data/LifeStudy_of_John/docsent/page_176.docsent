   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>COMING AS THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO BE BREATHED INTO THE BELIEVERS A. With the Resurrected Body</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ ascended to the heavens with a resurrected body, and now, in John 20, He comes back to the disciples also with a resurrected body Luke 24:37-40; 1 Cor 15:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With a resurrected body, the Lord came into the room where the disciples were with the doors shut 20:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since the doors were shut, how could He enter with a body of bones and flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our limited mentality cannot comprehend it, but it is a fact, and we must receive it according to the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to Luke 24:37-40, the Lord showed His disciples His physical body, and according to 1 Corinthians 15:44, this body was a resurrected body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Consider the illustration of a carnation seed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A carnation seed has a tiny, round body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But when it has been planted and has grown out of the ground, it has a stem and a blossom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Is this not also a body?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before the carnation seed was sown into the ground, it had a little body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After growing out of the ground, it had a different body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is exactly what Paul mentions in 1 Corinthians 15:44: It is sown a soulish body, it is raised a spiritual body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The body is sown in one form and raised up from the ground in another form.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The one sown is the original, natural body, and the one grown up is the resurrected body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After His resurrection, Christ had a resurrected body; yet it was physical and could still be touched.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even though the doors were shut, Christ entered into the room with this body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although the Lord had a resurrected body, the prints of the nails were still in His hands and feet 20:20, 27; Luke 24:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why did the resurrection not heal the prints, and why was His side still open?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not understand it, but we know that it is so.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not try to know so many things by your mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not trust in your limited ability to know, for there are a great many mysteries in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even we ourselves are a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Tell me, where are your conscience and your soul?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Are you able to locate your spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many scientists refuse to believe in anything which they cannot see or understand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I would ask those scientists if they have ever seen their conscience or their physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although we have a physical life, we have never seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we cannot understand ourselves, then how about the Triune God, the Divine Being?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>B. Fulfilling the Promise to Meet</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>with the Disciples for Their Joy</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After the Lord showed them both His hands and His side, the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord 20:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This was a fulfillment of the Lord s promise in 16:19 and 22, where He said, You therefore now indeed have sorrow; but I shall see you again and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now the disciples saw the newborn child 16:21 , who was the resurrected Lord born in His resurrection as the Son of God Acts 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we shall now see, this fulfillment by His coming back to His disciples brought them five blessings: His presence, His peace, His commission, the Holy Spirit, and the authority to represent Him v. 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>C. Bringing Peace to the Disciples</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In both 20:19 and 21 the Lord said to His disciples, Peace be to you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This took place in the first meeting of the Lord with His disciples after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Peace is something which is often brought to us in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many times we need to come to the meetings before we can have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord brought peace to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, we must attend the meetings, for it is in the meetings that we enjoy peace.</S>
