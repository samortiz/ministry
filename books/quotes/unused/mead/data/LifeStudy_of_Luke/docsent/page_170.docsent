   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE FIFTY-SEVEN THE MAN-SAVIOR S INCARNATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FULFILLING THE PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF GOD S CREATION OF MAN 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:4b; Gen 1:26a, 27a; Phil 2:7b; Gen 2:8-9; John 1:1, 14; Heb 2:16-17; 1 Tim 3:16</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall continue to consider the Man-Savior s incarnation fulfilling the purpose of God s creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>GOD S INTENTION IN THE CREATION OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that God designed man to be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because God designed man this way, He created man in His image and after His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Image refers to the inward being, and likeness, to the outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, God created man in His own image with the intention that man would be His duplication.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, for man to become a duplication of God, he must have the capacity to contain what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, man was made in God s image to be His duplication and after His likeness to be His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s purpose in creating man was that man would be His duplication in order to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order for this purpose to be carried out, it is necessary for man to receive God and contain Him as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, Adam, the man created by God, failed in God s purpose and damaged God s design.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thousands of years later, the Man-Savior came to fulfill God s purpose in creating man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE SECOND MAN</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through the incarnation of Christ God in the Son became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What a great matter this is!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God had created man with a purpose according to His design, but man failed Him in His purpose and destroyed His design.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead of creating another man, God Himself came to be the second Man 1 Cor 15:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God came to be the second Man not in the Father nor in the Spirit but in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The New Testament way of speaking about the incarnation is to say that the Word, which is God, became flesh John 1:1, 14 and that God was manifest in the flesh 1 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since the first man failed God in His purpose and ruined His design, God Himself came to be the second Man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hallelujah for the second Man!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Conceived of the Holy Spirit and</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Born of a Human Virgin</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Man-Savior as the second Man was not created; rather, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of a human virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was conceived of the Holy Spirit in order to have the essence of God, and He was born of a human virgin in order to have the human essence.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, this Man was a composition of two essences, a composition of the divine essence and the human essence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, He was the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because this wonderful One was a composition of two essences, the mingling of God with man, He was a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Living a Human Life</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Filled with the Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A crucial matter concerning the God-man is that He lived a human life filled with the divine life as its content.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Contrary to what some may think, the Gospel of Luke is not merely a book of stories.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This Gospel is a revelation of the God-man who lived a human life filled with the divine life as its content.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the One who lived such a life, the Man-Savior had the divine nature with the divine attributes, that is, with the divine love, light, righteousness, and holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The divine nature with its attributes was expressed in the Man-Savior s human nature with all the human virtues.</S>
