But it is not that wonderful. In this world and in this age, there are no wonderful things. The only wonderful thing is the Lord Himself. He is wonderful. As long as you go with Him and have Him, that is wonderful. We need to forget about ourselves, about our feelings, and even about our considerations of who we are. Some of us may think we are &#8220;small potatoes&#8221; who do not have a big gift or a big function. We may feel that it is better not to take action, that it is better to go back to sleep and rest. But this fits in with Satan&#8217;s desire. We have to rise up and take action.<p>You may say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know whom the Lord wants me to contact; I prayed about some people, but it seems not one is ready for me to contact.&#8221; Eventually, the Lord will say, &#8220;Just go! Go by Me, go in Me, and go with Me, not by yourself, not in yourself, and not with yourself.&#8221; If you go by yourself, that is not in faith. You are not trusting in the Lord but in yourself. We have to learn to take action in faith, believing in the Lord.<p>Sometimes you may be very excited and feel that you are in the heavens. The Lord may give you two or three good contacts who are very promising. But eventually, there may be no positive result with these ones. Often, when you contact people, when you would speak for the Lord, you will not feel so high. Rather, you may feel down. You may meet a person who does not seem promising. But later you may find out that he is a wonderful person. Through your contact with him when you felt down, you gained a very promising result. Thus, your labor and the result you gain do not depend upon your feeling.<p>I was burdened by the Lord to come to the United States. On the one hand, it was good. But on the other hand, some feelings were there which were not so encouraging. I wondered, &#8220;If I go to America, whom shall I contact and what shall I do?&#8221; There was also the question of how I would be supported financially. Today thirty-two years have passed since I came to the United States, and there has been a positive result. Forty years ago there was no arrangement among us to take care of the workers&#8217; material supply. So a worker went out empty-handed. Actually, though, when I came to the United States I was not empty-handed, because in my two hands I had the Lord. If you have everything, you do not need to exercise your faith. But if you have only the Lord, you surely need to exercise your faith. When we touch the Lord&#8217;s work, we should not do anything by our feeling. We should simply take action by faith.<p>We have been instructed and advised to repent, to confess, and to have intimate fellowship with the Lord and with our companions. Most of us have done this. But now we would hesitate, we would consider what to do, and we would wonder about whom we should contact. Dear saints, I would say this: &#8220;Go like Abraham, not knowing where to go.&#8221; You are ready. You are qualified. Just go to contact people. I can testify that eventually the Lord will send people to you.<p>Recently about seventeen districts on this globe have contacted me by either writing me or calling me. These districts are Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Western Europe, Russia, Poland, Africa, Central America, South America, Puerto Rico and the islands in the Caribbean Sea, and the United States. This shows how the Lord&#8217;s recovery has spread within the thirty-two years I have been in the United States. When the Lord&#8217;s recovery was brought into the English language, it spread to all the continents. Thirty-two years ago I never thought that such a thing would happen. But if I had stayed in Taiwan and would not have taken action, what would have happened? If all of us in the Lord&#8217;s recovery would rise up to take action, the world would be turned upside down (cf. Acts 17:6-KJV). We are so limited, but He is not limited. We are not serving ourselves. We are surely not worthy of being served. We are serving Him. We made a great resolution with Him for His sake, not for our sake. We are taking the way of the vital groups not for ourselves, but for His sake, for Him.<p>Since you have repented, you have confessed, you have fellowshipped and still remain in the fellowship, you are qualified to go. You should simply take action by faith. Dear saints, today your action means a lot. If you are still hesitating, still lingering, still considering, still feeling that you are not qualified, you are wrong. Just take action. We have shared previously how the Lord honored D. L. Moody&#8217;s vow to preach the gospel to at least one person each day. He did this regardless of his feeling, and the Lord saved people through him.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> </body></html>
