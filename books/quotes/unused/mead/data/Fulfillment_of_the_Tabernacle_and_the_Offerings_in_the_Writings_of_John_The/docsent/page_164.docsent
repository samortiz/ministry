   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>To Overflow from within the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 7:38-39 reveals that the Spirit will overflow from within the believers: "He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In John 4:14 the Lord says that whoever drinks of the water that He gives will have in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In chapter seven the Lord goes further and says that anyone who drinks of Him will have the flow of the rivers of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 38 the Lord Jesus does not speak of one flow; He speaks of rivers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The unique river of living water is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Out of this unique river many rivers will flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These rivers of living water are the many flowings of the different aspects of life, of the one river of water of life Rev 22:1 , which is God's Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the Spirit overflowing from within the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Seven Spirits before the Throne of God as the Seven Eyes of the Lamb, the Son</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the book of Revelation we have the seven Spirits before the throne of God as the seven eyes of the Lamb, the Son Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fact that the seven Spirits of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb, the Son, proves that the Son and the Spirit are not separate.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the traditional concept, the Spirit is separate from the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But according to the book of Revelation, the Spirit is the eyes of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Are, then, the Spirit and the Son one or two?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The book of Revelation indicates clearly that the seven Spirits are the eyes of Christ, the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that the so-called Third of the Trinity is the eyes of the Second.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then how could the eyes of the Second be regarded as a separate person from the Second?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Can a person's eyes be regarded as a separate person apart from him?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is impossible!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In resurrection Christ has become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, the two, Christ and the Spirit are one 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may say that Christ and the Spirit are distinct, but we may not say that They are separate.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Concerning this matter, we simply teach what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the wonderful Lamb!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One with the Bride, God's Redeemed</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Spirit is one with the bride, God's redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Revelation 22:17a indicates this: "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come!"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The fact that the Spirit and the bride speak together reveals that the Spirit is one with the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God, and the bride is the consummation of God's redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Revelation the consummation of the Triune God marries the consummation of God's redeemed people to form a universal couple.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Revelation 22:17 we see a divine-human marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Spirit, as the consummation of the Triune God, is the Husband, and the consummation of God's redeemed people is the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because the Spirit and the bride are one, they speak as one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit Being the One God, and the Entire God Being the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Regarding the divine Trinity, we would also point out that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the one God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First Peter 1:2 reveals that the Father is God; Hebrews 1:8, that the Son is God; and Acts 5:3-4, that the Spirit is God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Moreover, according to John 4:24, the entire God is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To say that God is Spirit means that Spirit is the nature, the substance, of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For example, just as the substance of a wooden table is wood, the substance of God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hallelujah, our God, the Triune God, is Spirit!</S>
