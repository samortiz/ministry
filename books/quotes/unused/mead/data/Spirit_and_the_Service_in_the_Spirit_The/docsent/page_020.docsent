   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONTENT OF THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The soul is our personality, our ego; therefore, the soul is our self.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That which is included in our soul, analytically speaking, is the mind, the emotion, and the will these three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The mind is the organ of man s thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is what we usually speak of as the brain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Physiologically it is the brain, and psychologically it is the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is the major part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man s thinking, meditating, considering, and remembering are all functions of the mind in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man after the fall, especially today s man, lives largely in the mind and is directed by the thoughts of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As man thinks, so man behaves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man s action is always tied to man s thought.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is hardly one person who does not live according to his thought.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, regardless of who or what we are considering, we must begin with man s thought in order to win man s mind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nowadays there are so many theories, schools, and educational methods, and they all have one aim: dealing with man s thought to win man s mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you can win a man s mind by his thought, you can then gain him, because man lives in the mind, which is the intellect, and is directed by the thought of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The emotion in the soul is the organ of man s love, anger, sorrow, and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man loves, detests, rejoices, mourns, and is excited or depressed these are all functions of the emotion in man s soul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are many who are emotional.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are rich in emotion and very easily stirred.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They often deal with matters by their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>With such people, when you reason with them in thought, it is often difficult to get through, but you can very easily move their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The will in the soul is the organ of man s decision making.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Man decides, determines, judges, chooses, receives, and refuses these are all functions of the will in man s soul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some people are in the mind, some are in the emotion, and there are some who are in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Just as those who are in the mind or emotion live in their mind or emotion, so those who are in the will likewise live in their will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the mind or emotion respectively is the strongest part of those who are in them, so is the will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One who is in the will is strong in his decision and determination.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once he has determined upon some course of action, you have no way to change him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You may reason with him, but he does not care for reason.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You may appeal to him with emotion, but he has no regard for emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is one who acts by his will and is in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The soul is comprised of these three parts mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These three parts are simultaneously present in everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everyone has a mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, some are more in the mind, some are rich in emotion, and others are strong in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some are very clear in their thinking and very quick in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whenever something comes up, they think carefully before acting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If they have not thought things through, no matter how you try to move them with emotion, it is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you want to win them, you must use reason.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are living in the mind, or the intellect; they are the intellectual ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some especially abound in emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It seems as if they do not have a mind and do not think, but have only emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such people often make a mess of things by their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you reason with them, they frequently neither care nor understand and are not moved in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you deal with them with emotion, it is very easy to touch their inward part.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A thousand or ten thousand reasons are not as powerful toward them as one or two tears.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes, no matter how you reason with them, you cannot win them over, but if you shed a few tears, you can win them over.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They only care for emotion, not for reason.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is because they are not in the intellect, but in the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some people s will is especially strong.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In everything they have some proposal or idea.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>And once they make a decision, they are very firm and cannot be easily changed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Such people usually are quite stable and stubborn, caring neither for emotion nor for reason.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They decide and plan everything by their obstinate will.</S>
