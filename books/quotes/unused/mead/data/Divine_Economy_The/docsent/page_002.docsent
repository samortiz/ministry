   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although the divine economy is the central topic in the New Testament, it has not been touched that much among the Christians in past centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The matter of God's economy is greatly developed in Paul's writings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians is a book on God's eternal purpose to have the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In such a book, Paul uses the word "economy" 1:10; 3:2, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Ephesians the Apostle Paul wants to show us that the church as the Body of Christ is something of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul uses the word economy in relationship with other words such as good pleasure, will, and purpose 1:9, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has a good pleasure which is His heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God also has a will which is according to His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The reason why I visit a certain place is because I first have a desire.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then I make a decision to go to that place.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the exercise of my will according to my desire, my good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's will came out of His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Ephesians the word purpose is used as a noun and as a verb 3:11; 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The purpose comes out of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In God's heart there was a desire, and out of this desire God made a will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to God's will, He made a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>GOD'S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because God has a purpose, He needs an economy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Greek word for economy is oikonomia.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This Greek word is composed of two words oikos meaning house or household and nomos meaning law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Economy is a "house law," a household administration.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's economy is God's planned administration to carry out His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all need to realize what God's eternal purpose is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Bible scholars have discovered that in God's planned administration there are different ages.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible unveils to us the age before the law, the age of the law, the age of grace, and the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These are the four main ages revealed in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The age before the law was from Adam to Moses Rom 5:13-14 .</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The age of grace is from Christ's first coming to His second coming John 1:17; Titus 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fourth age will be the age of the kingdom, the age of the millennium, the thousand years of Christ's reign Rev 20:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In these four different ages, God has different ways to deal with His people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the age before the law, God dealt with the patriarchs mainly according to His mercy and grace based upon His promise.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the age of the law, from Moses to Christ's first coming, God dealt with His people according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From Christ's first coming to His second coming, the age of grace, God deals with us according to His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After Christ's second coming, for one thousand years God will deal with His people according to His kingdom.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although these Bible teachers saw these four different ages, they did not tell us the purpose for which God deals with people in these four major ways.</S>
