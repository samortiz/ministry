BEING THE FOURTH PRINCIPLE<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The fourth principle for the building up of the church is that we must see that there is only one church, not two. Just as there is only one Christ, so also there is only one church. In the previous chapter we spoke of one hybrid produced through the mingling of God and man; there are not two hybrids. The nature of the church is one, and the principle of the church is oneness. Whenever the church is no longer one, she loses her nature and her principle. If we want to build up the church, we should not allow any division in the church. I hope that God&rsquo;s children can understand the Lord&rsquo;s heart and realize that anything that causes the church to be divided, no matter how justified, is wrong.</p>
<p>The outward situation of today&rsquo;s church is entirely divided. It grieves us to realize that people regard the division of the church as something ordinary and even acceptable. It is so easy for believers to establish a congregation according to their own ideas. Whenever there is a difference of opinion, believers separate themselves and form another congregation. Throughout the world, we can see various small meetings under different names in the same locality. None of these build up the church; rather, they divide and tear down the church.</p>
<p>We all must know the unique nature, the unique principle, and the unique ground of the church, and we must keep it diligently. The church has the ground of oneness, the principle of oneness, and the nature of oneness. We should keep this oneness carefully and not give any ground for divisions. We must see that God is building one unique church in the universe and that there is only one church in a locality. We cannot divide the church of God, and there is no basis for dividing the church of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Being Carried About<br />
by Every Wind of Teaching</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:13 says, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&rdquo; This indicates that building up the church is related to building Christ into the saints. In other words, to build up the Body of Christ is to cause the measure of the stature of Christ to grow into its fullness. Hence, we should never have anything other than Christ as the center, the goal, of the building up of the church. Verse 14 continues, saying, &ldquo;That we may be no longer little children...carried about by every wind of teaching.&rdquo; Christians often are carried away by every wind of teaching, even the teachings in Christianity. For the building up of the church, we cannot afford to pay attention to teachings that carry us away from Christ Himself.</p>
<p>In 1952 a wind of teaching related to divine healing was blowing in Hong Kong, and brothers and sisters in Hong Kong were carried about by this wind. At that time we were speaking concerning the cross, the breaking of the natural man, and Christ, but the saints could not hear or receive it. However, as soon as some incidents of divine healing were reported, it became sensational news among the saints. For example, after someone received the laying on of hands, his fever receded, and his sickness was healed. Even if the healing was genuine and even if the doctrine related to divine healing was correct, this teaching became a wind that carried the saints away from Christ.</p>
<p>It is easy to test whether a teaching such as divine healing is a wind of teaching. Whether or not the teaching corresponds to the truth in the Bible is not enough; we also need to see whether the incidents of healing cause the element of Christ to increase or to decrease within the saints. We must take Christ as the base of testing in every situation in the church. Without this, even messages on healing can carry the saints away from Christ. The &ldquo;wind of teaching&rdquo; in Ephesians 4:14 refers to teachings that are like the wind. Such a teaching may not be wrong as far as the truth is concerned; however, such a teaching can separate the saints from Christ and cause them to deviate from the central goal, Christ.</p>
<p>I know of some saints who have been carried away by the teaching of foot-washing; they even do not come to break bread. When we ask them why they do not come to the meetings, they reply, &ldquo;You do not have love, because you do not practice foot-washing. If you washed one another&rsquo;s feet, I would come back to the meeting.&rdquo; Even though the teaching of foot-washing corresponds to the Bible, this kind of teaching can draw us away from the center, Christ, and thereby become a wind, which carries the saints away from Christ. In addition, there are also brothers who emphasize holy kissing, and there are indeed verses in the Bible that speak of greeting one another with a holy kiss (Rom. 16:16; 1 Cor. 16:20; 2 Cor. 13:12). Thus, we cannot say that such a teaching does not correspond to the Bible. Nevertheless, this teaching can become a wind that carries us away from Christ.</p>
<p>When people are carried about by the wind of teaching, the result is division and sectarianism. The teaching of foot-washing can carry people into a practice of washing one another&rsquo;s feet, and the teaching of holy kissing can carry people into a practice of kissing one another. Both practices can cause the saints to be separated from Christ and to be divided because of differences in practice. There are so many divisions in Christianity today due to the wind of teaching. People are carried about by the wind of teaching because they do not hold fast to Christ and take Christ as their center. Ephesians 4:13-14 says, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we may be no longer little children...carried about by every wind of teaching.&rdquo; The saints can be kept from being carried about by the wind of teaching only by growing in life according to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Even though foot-washing corresponds to the Bible, we do not have to practice it if the environment is not appropriate and if there is no need. In this way, we will never be carried about by the wind of foot-washing. Even though there is nothing wrong with greeting each other with a holy kiss, we do not have to practice it if the environment is not appropriate. The same principle can be applied to practices related to baptism. In any case, we should not be carried about by the wind of teaching.</p>
<p>In short, everything should be centered on Christ. We are not here to build with anything other than Christ. This building is not individualistic, much less divisive. We cannot allow the wind of teaching to carry the saints about to the point of becoming sectarian and producing divisions. What we do and what we are must be for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>May the Lord open our eyes, and may we see that the church is the enlargement of the hybrid of God mingled with man, that the Body comes out of the fullness of Christ, and that we should not be individualistic or divisive. If we see these principles related to the building up of the church and learn to serve according to these principles, we can build up the church. These principles are related not just to doctrines, but to our practical service. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>Service for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
