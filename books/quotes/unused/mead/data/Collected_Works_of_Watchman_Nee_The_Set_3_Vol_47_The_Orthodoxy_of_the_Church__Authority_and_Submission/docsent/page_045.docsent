   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Authority Being God's Selection</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Rather than Man's Attainment</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God called all three to come out to the entrance of the tent of meeting v. 4 . Aaron and Miriam came out boldly, presuming that they would be vindicated.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They thought that God had finally called them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They thought, "You, Moses, have married an Ethiopian woman and have caused unhappiness in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have many things to say to God."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But God said, "Moses is My servant.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is faithful in all My house.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why are you so bold as to speak against My servant?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Spiritual authority does not come through man's attainment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, it comes through God's selection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Spiritual matters are entirely different from worldly principles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Authority is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It cannot be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whoever speaks against Moses speaks against God's selection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We cannot despise God's selection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Manifestation of Rebellion Being Leprosy</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the anger of God was kindled, the cloud removed from over the tent, and the presence of God was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Immediately, Miriam became leprous v. 10 . This was not from infection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was inflicted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Being leprous is not any better than marrying an Ethiopian woman.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As soon as inward rebellion is manifested, it becomes leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Lepers have to be shut out.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man cannot approach them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They lose all fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Aaron saw that Miriam became leprous, he besought Moses to be a mediator so that God would heal her.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God instructed Miriam to be shut out from the camp seven days before she could be received again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She bore shame for seven days as if her father had spit in her face.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only after seven days did the tent of meeting journey on.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever there is rebellion and reviling among us, God's presence is gone, and the tent will not move.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The pillar of cloud will not come until reviling words have been judged.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the matter of authority is not settled, all other matters will remain unsettled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Submitting to God's Direct Authority</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>and Also Submitting to His Deputy Authority</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many think that they have submitted themselves to God already.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They do not know that they still need to submit to God's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who are truly submissive see God's authority in all environments in their homes and in all institutions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God said, "Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant, against Moses?" v. 8 . Every time reviling words come, we have to pay much attention to them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We cannot be careless, thinking that we can say things rashly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When there is reviling, it proves that there is the spirit of rebellion within.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The reviling is the sprouting of this rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to fear God and must not speak in a rash way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many today speak against those ahead of them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They speak against the responsible brothers in the church, but they do not realize the seriousness of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If one day the church receives grace from God, she will separate herself from those who revile the servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She will not talk to them because they are leprous.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May God be merciful to us that we would see that this is not a matter with our brother, but a matter of God's appointed authority.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we have met authority, we will realize that there are too many incidents where we sin against God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thereafter, our concept concerning sin will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We will see sin from God's point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The sin that God condemns is man's rebellion.</S>
