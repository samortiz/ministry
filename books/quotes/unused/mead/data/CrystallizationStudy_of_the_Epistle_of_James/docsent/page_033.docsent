   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>But what the Lord's recovery has seen and picked up from the New Testament is so high, concerning God's eternal economy, the all-inclusive God processed and consummated, the all-inclusive Christ, the life-giving compound Spirit, the divine eternal life, and the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This mystical Body of Christ consummates in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In today's fundamental teaching of Christianity, not one of these items is fully, adequately touched.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They say that God never changed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible tells us God never changed in His nature, but He did become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Was that not a change?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The procedure for Him to become a man was a process, the process of conception.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He entered into a virgin's womb and stayed there for nine months to be born as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was God, but after being processed, He became a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No longer was He merely God, but He was God plus man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He passed through the process of human life as God living on this earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He went to the cross and was buried in the tomb for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Was that not a process?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then He entered into resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Surely this is also a process.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By this we can see that today's teaching in Christianity is inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Who today sees the intrinsic significance of God's incarnation, Christ's death, and Christ's resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many say God came to be a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That is not wrong, but the Lord has shown us that God's incarnation indicates that God became one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God brought Himself into man and joined Himself with man, even mingled Himself with man that man may become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the items in the Bible have their intrinsic significance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not eat the skin of an orange, but the intrinsic content of the orange.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The inner content is the real significance of the orange.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One wrong teaching today is that the believers in Christ go to heaven when they die.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible shows that God has prepared two Paradises for His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first Paradise is for today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a believer dies, his body is buried in the earth, but his spirit and soul go to the first Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus told the criminal on the cross, "Today you shall be with Me in Paradise" Luke 23:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This Paradise is the pleasant section of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hades is divided into two sections: the section of torment for the perished unbelievers, and the pleasant section called Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That is the place where the Lord Jesus went after He died Acts 2:27, 31 , and the place where Abraham and the poor man Lazarus are, as described in Luke 16:19-31.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They remain in Paradise, a place of comfort, waiting for the Lord's coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the Lord comes back, they will be resurrected from Paradise and from the earth with a body, soul, and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then they will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ 2 Cor 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If they are overcomers, they will go into the New Jerusalem in the thousand years of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That initial stage of the New Jerusalem is called the Paradise of God in Revelation 2:7.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But if you are a defeated genuine believer, you will be condemned at the Lord's judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then what you did as wood, grass, and stubble will be burned 1 Cor 3:12-15 , and you will be disciplined in the thousand years of the kingdom to get yourself matured, perfected, and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the end of the thousand-year kingdom, you will enter into the New Jerusalem in its consummate stage in the new heaven and new earth to meet together with all the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I share this to show again that the teaching of today's Christianity is like that of James right to a certain degree but devoid of the highest peak of God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord's recovery is absolutely different.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For over seventy years, we have dived into the intrinsic significance of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have read the different interpretations of the Bible throughout the church's history, and the Lord has given us the discernment to see what is according to His eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to see the difference between the Lord's recovery and today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord's recovery is up to the standard of the divine revelation, but Christianity is devoid of it.</S>
