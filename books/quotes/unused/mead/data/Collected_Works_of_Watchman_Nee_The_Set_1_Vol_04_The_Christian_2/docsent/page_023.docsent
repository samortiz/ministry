   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse Sixteen</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 16: "And He had in His right hand seven stars; and out of His mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword; and His face shone as the sun shines in its power."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The above is a declaration of the person of the One who became the Son of Man in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His lovingkindness and holiness never change.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We love to meditate on His lovingkindness, but we also need to know that He is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God has given all judgment to this Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We will now look at His position: "He had in His right hand seven stars."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches Rev 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whoever these messengers are, Christ holds them in His right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This signifies the total authority of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He has total authority in God's work, in God's government, and in the church because the right hand in the Bible signifies authority and exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Please read Psalms 16:11, 17:7, and 18:35, and Acts 7:55-56.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These messengers are all in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They love the Lord faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their function is to shine as stars.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Being in the hand of the Lord, they are most secure.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, they also bear the greatest responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We who love the Lord faithfully must not consider the work we are doing as being very great.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must remember that our coming in and going out are all in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Another point is that these messengers are in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are not on the Lord's head as His crown.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is because the time for them to receive glory has not come; they are still in trials.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They must be faithful in order to shine eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Otherwise, they will become "wandering stars" Jude 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"And out of His mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus is the God-appointed avenger.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Isaiah 11:4 says that the Lord Jesus will "strike the land with the rod of His mouth, / And with the breath of His lips He will slay the wicked."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 49:2 the Lord Jesus says of Himself, that God "has made my mouth like a sharp sword."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This shows the power of the words of the Lord Jesus, not only in the awakening of men's conscience to sin, but in the sharpness of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"He who rejects Me and does not receive My words has one who judges him; the word which I have spoken, that will judge him in the last day" John 12:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He will not only judge the world, but also the church because judgment must begin from the house of God 1 Pet 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first three chapters of Revelation prove that the church will be judged before the world is Rev 4 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This "sharp two-edged sword" in His mouth has two uses.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is used to punish the rebellious church, the unfaithful branches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Revelation 2:12 and 16 speak on this point: "And to the messenger of the church in Pergamos write: These things says He who has the sharp two-edged sword...Repent therefore; but if not, I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword of My mouth."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is also to be used to punish the stubborn, worldly people, that is, those who do not obey His gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This point is mentioned in Revelation 19:15 and 21: "And out of His mouth proceeds a sharp sword, that with it He might smite the nations....And the rest were killed with the sword which proceeds out of the mouth of Him who sits on the horse."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to understand that the Lord does not battle with the sword in His hand but with the sword in His mouth, which is His Word John 12:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every sentence of the Lord's Word is full of power Luke 1:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not only in creation or in salvation, but also in war, whatever He says is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the way with the coming war.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today we should battle with our spiritual enemies in the same way, by the Word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, in our daily life we should let the Word of God dwell in our heart richly, so that the Holy Spirit can cause us to recall these words in times of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can then use these words to resist our enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a pity that many do not understand the meaning of spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some think that spiritual warfare is wrestling against crime and people in society.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Others think that spiritual warfare is to resist and fight against the lusts in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, the Word of God does not speak in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul says, "For our wrestling is not against blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies" Eph 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Spiritual warfare is the warfare between the people of God and Satan with the evil spirits under him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This kind of warfare is to prevent Satan from being victorious over us inwardly or outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whether the wrestling is with ourselves or with the world, we are fighting against anything that would allow Satan to boast.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To wrestle in this warfare we must have the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In times of trouble the Holy Spirit will give us one or two verses of the Scripture in order that through these few words of God we may overcome Satan's attack and temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord Jesus' victory when He was tested in the wilderness is an example of the relying on the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>"His face was as the sun shines in its power."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christ is the Sun of righteousness Mal 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He once revealed His glory when He was on the mount of transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At that time, His "face shone as the sun" Matt 17:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When Peter mentioned this incident, he considered this as a revelation of "the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ" in His kingdom 2 Pet 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What happened on the mount of transfiguration is a type of the coming millennial kingdom Matt 16:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, the meaning here is that the Lord Jesus will come again quickly to His own kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He will be King on the earth, and He will cause the summer of the world to come Matt 24:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Here we see that the emphasis of the Holy Spirit is no longer on the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>His emphasis is on Christ obtaining His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The sun is the highest thing in God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God called it the greater light to rule the day.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The meaning here of "the sun shines in its power" is that of a sun in the sky with no fog or cloud or shade.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is a proper illustration of the glory and power of our Lord Jesus in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the Bible there are two kinds of appearing of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They are typified by the morning star and the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>His appearing as the sun is to the world, and His appearing as the morning star is to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The morning star appears right before dawn.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Only those who are watchful at night can see it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the position of the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The sun appears during the daytime, and everyone in the world can see it.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>First there is the appearance of the morning star, and then comes the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Before our Lord Jesus appears to the people in the world, He will first appear to those who love His appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What a hope this is!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must distinguish between these two appearances.</S>
