   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PREPARATION OF THE MESSAGES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A message needs to be prepared for all the different kinds of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is your cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This does not mean that you pick up the thought, the idea, with the terminology from the Life-study Messages and our other publications and recompose them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you do this, you will spoil them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You need to get into the Life-studies and the other publications.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This could never be done only by one person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are too many groceries.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You need a group of elders, helpers, or co-workers, including some knowledgeable sisters, to help you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some sisters have a very good knowledge of our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Select the portions which you consider are suitable to your church s present situation, and put them together exactly as they are into one message.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Train the saints not to simply read it but to use it as a message given by themselves and to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They must take it as a message firstly to themselves and then to others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, they should do this in a mutual way by mutual speaking with a little defining.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such a speaking for about thirty to forty minutes will become a rich, living, and uplifting message.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone will get the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Also take care of all the points I have fellowshipped with you in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Train the saints to exercise their spirit and train them how to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This requires time for the elders to labor in the Word to select portions for the messages.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You also must train some promising ones as full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Train them to go into the home meetings to be the basic elements of that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are no leaders, but you need one or two to be the basic elements, not simply the common members.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The eight or ten are common members, but you need one or two basic elements, not leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Within a growing tree there are some basic elements by which the tree grows.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Likewise, the entire weight of the meeting hall in Anaheim rests on some large steel columns concealed within the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Within the red stone is the cement, and under the cement are the steel columns.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Neither the stone on the outside or the cement is the basic element.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The basic element is the steel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The entire building is very solid and strong because within it is the solid element.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Within every home meeting the elders should put in the basic element.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then every gathering will be strong, but the source of the strength will be a secret.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The ones not so knowledgeable may attribute the strength of the column to the red stone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually the strength is the steel within.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You must train some to be the steel in the home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This requires much labor.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not sufficient to merely set up some homes and make a schedule and an announcement concerning the home gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This will never work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You need much labor.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The new way needs the elders, the co-workers, and the full-timers to labor to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Without this you have no way to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For the truth lesson classes you do not need to prepare any messages.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Still you must learn how to charge the teacher to teach the truth lessons as I have pointed out earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For the rest of the meetings, including the general meeting, you should not trust in one person to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For the general meeting you must cook a message and charge one among you who is able to present this message in an adequate way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Actually it will not be his own message, but a message prepared by a group of you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This way is altogether new.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then you must prepare some kind of message for the gospel preaching in case you will need it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If there are no new ones present, then forget about it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If there are some new ones, then right away there will be something on hand to use in every home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is according to the principle of 1 Corinthians 14:26.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You do have something.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the need arises, you may use it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You also need to prepare the messages for all the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is a hard job.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every week there must be one good message.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then you need to prepare a message for the Lord s table and another one for the prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In principle, for the Lord s table you need a message on life for the nourishment, and for the prayer meeting you need a message on the service, but it is hard for us to separate these two matters.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Matthew 24 and 25 there is the parable of the ten virgins, denoting life, and the parable of the talents, denoting service.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These are two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, in order to encourage people to serve properly you sometimes need life messages.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Likewise, to encourage people to grow in life you sometimes need some messages on service.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It all depends upon your learning and your discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You should learn, you should labor, and you should practice not only to speak but to prepare some good messages.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have the storage of so many riches.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is doubtful that anyone could give a new message richer or more living than what we have stored up.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The wisest way is to use the existing riches and skillfully present them as a prevailing message with which to serve the saints in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the top way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>These will be not only my messages, but they will be yours because you will have digested them and put them together as one message to nourish the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>These are the riches of the Lord s house.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We all need to use them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the parable of Matthew 24:45-51 the servant knew how to serve food to the household at the appointed time.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We do have much food.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Now we need the diligence, the faithfulness, and the skill to use all these materials as proper meals to serve the Lord s people, including the sinners, at the appointed time.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>THE CHURCH MEETINGS AND THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The church meetings are not only the big meetings in the halls.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The church meetings are mainly the home gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Only in a little sense are the big meetings the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The tradition still remains in our unconscious concept.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When you speak of the big meetings, you refer to them as the church meeting, indicating that subconsciously you do not consider the home gatherings to be the church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is our problem.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We need to have a purifying change, a purification of our thought and idea which has been with us for so many years.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The new way is constituted with these five things: the home gatherings, the functioning of all the members, the knowledge and spread of the truth, the growth in life, and the preaching of the gospel in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Brother Nee in his ministry stressed these five points very strongly.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Chapter nine of The Normal Christian Church Life has a long section concerning the home meetings, the small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He was very much disappointed by the failure to carry this out.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He stressed this very much.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He even suggested annulling the Lord s Day morning meeting, and asked all the saints to preach the gospel on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>However, that did not work out.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He stressed very much that everyone needs to function.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In his writings concerning the parable of the talents he said that the most dangerous one is the one-talented member.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He warned us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Of course, he also stressed very much the knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>For this he invented the way of training.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He initiated the way of training which I have been carrying out.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>His way was by training, not by a seminary or a school.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He also stressed life very much and planned to evangelize all of China within twenty years by five routes.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The new way we are now considering to take is altogether constituted with the same basic points which he stressed.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We should not merely say that if Brother Nee were here he would be willing to be one with this new way.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Actually, he was stressing this new way years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>But due to our foolishness and dullness, we did not go along with him.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He was very much disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He did not carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He could not have the way.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>I knew this quite well.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>To me this is not something new.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We knew of this way years ago, but we were always held back and frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>I beg you young ones to take the new way absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>I beg the old generation to also take the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If you do not feel capable to take the new way, then please keep silent.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Do not say anything in a dissenting way.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Rather, try your best to encourage the young ones to take the new way and you pray for it.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The majority of the old generation there in Taiwan all encouraged the young ones to take this new way.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>They are all happy to see the young ones take this new way.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>This is what I expect and what I would beg you all to do.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The young ones must take this way and the old generation also must take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If not, please do not be dissenting, but encourage the young ones to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The new generation are all our children.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We are the parents.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We would like to see our children take the new way and have a great success.</S>
