   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Reconciliation to God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the fall men became enemies of God Rom 5:10a .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Men are in enmity against God and are not subject to the law of God Rom 8:7 ; they do not approve of holding God in their full knowledge Rom 1:28 ; they have no fear of God before their eyes Rom 3:18 ; they hate God Rom 1:30 and blaspheme God 1 Tim 1:13 ; and they even say that there is no God Psa 14:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, they are sons of disobedience and children of wrath Eph 2:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, through His death and the shedding of His blood on the cross, Christ has made peace between God and man Rom 5:10; Col 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, when a person believes in the Lord, he can be reconciled to God and also accepted by God through all that the Lord Jesus has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>F. Regeneration</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through the aforementioned items forgiveness of sins, washing, sanctification, justification, and reconciliation to God the outward problems between man and God have been solved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, besides having problems with God outwardly, man also has problems inwardly in his life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, when a person believes in the Lord, God not only solves his problems without but also regenerates him within that he may receive His life and partake of His nature 1 John 5:12; 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Based on what is revealed in the Bible, man is regenerated, that is, he is begotten of God, at the moment he believes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>G. Eternal Life</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The life a person receives at regeneration is the eternal life John 6:47 , the life of God 1 John 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since a person is regenerated at the moment he believes, by this believing he receives the eternal life of God and has passed out of death into life John 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>H. The Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once a person believes in the Lord and is thus regenerated and possesses God s life, God gives to him His Holy Spirit, the One who regenerates man Eph 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Holy Spirit is God Himself entering into man to be the divine life and essence in man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I. Freedom</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once a person believes in the Lord and receives forgiveness of sins, he is freed from God s judgment and condemnation John 3:18; 5:24 , from the curse of the law Gal 3:13 , from the wrath of God Rom 5:9; John 3:36; 1 Thes 1:10 , and from the fear and slavery of death Heb 2:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, because he is begotten of God and has received the eternal life of God and the Holy Spirit of God, he is freed from sins Matt 1:21 and the power of sin John 8:34, 36; Rom 6:6 as well as from the law Gal 4:4-5; Rom 7:6 and the bondage of the law Gal 5:1; 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, He is released from the flesh Col 2:11 , the old man Col 3:9 , Satan s oppression Luke 4:18; Acts 10:38 , the religious world and its ordinances Gal 1:4; 6:14-15; Col 2:20 , and his vain manner of life handed down from his fathers 1 Pet 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is therefore completely set free John 8:36 and is no longer under any kind of bondage or confinement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>J. Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once a person believes in the Lord, he is saved Eph 2:8; Acts 16:31; Luke 7:50 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Salvation includes God s calling, the Spirit s sanctification, the union between the Triune God and man, and the aforementioned items, namely, forgiveness of sins, washing, sanctification, justification, reconciliation to God, regeneration, eternal life, the Holy Spirit, and freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the grace God has bestowed upon man is included in this salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once man believes, he receives this full salvation with all its riches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After believing, he does not receive anything additional, but rather experiences continually what he has already received.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Immediately following the Spirit s sanctification and man s repentance is man s faith, or man s believing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To believe is to receive; it is also to believe into.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The believers receive Christ into them that He may be mingled with them; on the other hand, they believe into Him that they may be joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once a person believes, he receives Christ, who is the Word, the very God, and the light, into him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He also believes into His name, into the Son of God, and into the Son of Man, who died and was resurrected, to be joined to the Lord Himself and receive the eternal life.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moreover, once a person believes in the Lord Jesus, he immediately receives the blessings of forgiveness of sins, washing, sanctification, justification, reconciliation to God, regeneration, eternal life, the Holy Spirit, freedom, and salvation.</S>
