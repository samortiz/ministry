   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN IN HIM THE SECRET</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF EXPERIENCING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have pointed out, in the book of Philippians Paul uses a number of unusual expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One of these expressions is found in chapter four, verse 12.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here Paul says, "In everything and in all things I have learned the secret" ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The phrase "learned the secret" indicates that Paul had come into a new situation, a new environment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever we are put in a new environment, we need to learn the secret of living in that environment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For someone from the West to go to the Far East is for him to go into a new environment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to live, he must learn the secret of life there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, when brothers and sisters from the United States visit the Far East, they need to learn the secret of eating with chopsticks.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If they do not learn the secret, they will not be able to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>PAUL'S SECRET BEING IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Philippians 4:12 Paul says, "I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I have learned the secret both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here Paul seems to be saying, "In all things I have been instructed with the secret so that I know how to be in want and how to abound.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have been initiated with a type of secret knowledge."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What is the secret Paul learned?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because Paul had been instructed with the particular secret, he could handle any situation, whether he was rich or poor, filled or hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The secret is in Philippians 4:13: "I can do all things in Him who empowers me" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>. The secret is not that Christ is in us; it is that we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Most of us do not know how to apply the fact that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Take riding in a car to the meeting as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>My secret in coming to the meeting is simply to sit in the car and to let someone else drive.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What a problem it would be if I refused to get into the car or did not like being in the car and did certain foolish things to get out of the car!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the day we were saved, God put us into the heavenly car, the best car in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The name of this car is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the day we were saved, we were put into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we would exercise to be in Him in a practical way, we would not be active to do so many things on our own.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, we would simply rest and be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are in Christ, we shall be at rest and not endeavor to overcome negative things such as our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although we were put into Christ on the day we were saved, to the feeling of many Christians they are not yet in Christ.</S>
