   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>XIL.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE BROTHERS AND THE SISTERS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is another boundary that needs to be strictly kept.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That is the boundary between the brothers and the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is also a great boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is one thing we must admit: while Christians live on earth today, the place where they have the most opportunity to contact the opposite sex is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Between the brothers and sisters, they meet in the meetings, in the service, in the gospel preaching, and in their witnessing work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For this reason, in their administration of the church, the elders must draw a boundary between the brothers and the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is not a boundary of separation, but a boundary of distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This boundary must never be removed or annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whenever you annul this boundary, you will involve yourselves in immense trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Christianity there are some zealous ones with little spiritual experience who suggest: "We are all brothers and sisters in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since we are all spiritual, we do not need to distinguish the brothers from the sisters."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I want to tell the brothers and sisters that I have seen the fruit from such a concept.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have heard even more about such things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They bring untold problems to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In some places, it is the elders who are reaping and eating their own fruit because the elders themselves have led the church this way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Their way of administration is to cause the brothers and sisters not to have any boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is altogether wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>While we live on this earth and in our flesh, in no way can you believe that the boundary between men and women can be abolished; there is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the devil's teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In some places, some teach that we are all spiritual, and that to talk about the boundary between male and female is to have defiled thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some almost condemn me by saying that it is because my thoughts are filthy and unclean that I am talking about the boundary between the brothers and the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No. Even if thousands of people would rise up to say that my thoughts are unclean, I will still stand up to tell you that you need a boundary between the brothers and the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The elders in every locality must set up a firm boundary between the brothers and the sisters; they should never remove it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Galatians 3 says that in Christ there is no more distinction between male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But in 1 Corinthian 11 and 14, it says that in the church we must still distinguish the boundary between male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is no distinction between male and female in Christ, but there is still the distinction between male and female in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If in the church we make no distinction between male and female, then Paul is actually contradicting himself in 1 Corinthians 11 and 14, because there he clearly says that brothers do not have to cover their heads when they pray, but that the sisters do.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In addition, the sisters should not speak in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You can see that there is still a distinction between male and female in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some have checked with me in a serious way: "Brother Lee, why does the church not come up to the standard of the age?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In most social gatherings today, men and women sit together.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why do the men and women sit separately in the church meetings?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Dear brothers and sisters, you cannot deny that David loved the Lord more than you do and was more spiritual than you are.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But even David could fall.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How much more can we fall also?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today, we are still in the old creation, and it is still possible for us to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has not removed the boundary between male and female in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you and I administrate the church, we must not give the impression that we are all in the Lord and that it makes no difference whether we are brothers or sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This indifference is detrimental and must never be permitted.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must learn to draw a boundary here.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now I have presented to you these twelve boundaries.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the elders know how to draw these boundaries, their administration of the church will be stable, clear, and proper.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You will be able to bring all kinds of people and things onto the right track.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this way, the church will have the real administration and building.</S>
