   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A NOBLE DEED Scripture Reading: Mark 14:1-9</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Mark 14:9 says, "And truly I say to you, Wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done shall also be told as a memorial of her."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the Lord's word here, wherever the gospel is preached, this story should be told immediately afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the gospel is preached, but this story is not told, there is a great lack.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, we have to speak of this story today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is what the Lord told me as I was praying yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When did this story take place?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us read verse 1: "Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were two days away.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking a way to seize Him by craftiness and kill Him."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The cross was in sight!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The shadow of the cross was in sight!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is the most significant point of this story?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can express it with the words of 1 Peter 3:15.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is to "sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word sanctify is a verb.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This story shows a practical way for the carrying out of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This story only invokes men to do one thing to sanctify Christ as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord's word, "Wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done shall also be told as a memorial of her," is an instruction to us that, after the preaching of the gospel, there must be this kind of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This story unfolds to us the meaning of this kind of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"A woman came Mary John 12:3 , having an alabaster flask of ointment, of very costly pure nard."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Pure nard is precious enough, whereas a very costly, pure nard is unmatched in excellence.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This very costly, pure nard was inside an alabaster flask.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The alabaster flask was also very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not only was Mary offering to the Lord a costly ointment, but the flask that contained the ointment was also very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can offer to the Lord only what is most precious.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"She broke the alabaster flask."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why did she do this?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This kind of pure nard came from Persia, and there was no way for the ointment to come out except by breaking the flask.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way, there could be no counterfeit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"And poured it over His head."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When she did this, the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment John 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Not only was the house filled with the fragrance then; even now as we read this passage, we can sense the fragrance!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even the house we are meeting in right now seems to be filled with fragrance!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This love to the Lord and this consecration to Him indeed is a fragrance that has lasted until now and will last until eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John 12:3 said that she "anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She placed her glory at the feet of the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For a woman, her hair is her glory 1 Cor 11:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At first she was only seen; now she could be smelled.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She drew not only men's criticism, but men's indignation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, she ignored all of them and did not care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It did not cross her mind that this was the house of a leper.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>She did not consider her present family condition nor her future hardships.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She did not care for the criticism and the indignation of others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>She simply did what she did.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She offered to the Lord in the way of "risking all"!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should be just as bold and willing as she was.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"And the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is absolute consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are two meanings to consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One is to offer something to the Lord, and the other is to be separated solely unto the Lord in a dedicated way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The ointment is for sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The tabernacle with all its utensils was anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The word Christ means the "Messiah," which is the Anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should sanctify this anointed Christ as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should anoint Him and own Him as Lord, even as our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should offer up everything to Him and should heap everything upon Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not be afraid of following Him too foolishly or loving Him too fervently.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When a young Christian bade farewell to an older man, the latter said, "I have only one wish, that you be a fervent lover of Christ!"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There cannot be a limit to our loving the Lord, our serving Him, obeying Him, and our allegiance to Him; we can never overdo these things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord loves to see us loving Him in a reckless way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He loves to see us loving Him beyond reason and against human affection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To Him, the gospel should result in men's being constrained by His death to love Him, consecrate to Him, and fully obey Him to the point that others would consider them extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The degree that we offer ourselves to Him is dependent on the worth of the Lord to us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To those who believe, the Lord is precious 1 Pet 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Peter knew what this word meant.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is why in his Epistles, he mentioned the word precious many times.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He added the word precious to the blood, the faith, the stone, the virtues, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What did the disciples do when Mary acted this way?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>"But there were some who were indignantly commenting among themselves: Why has this waste of the ointment been made?"</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Mark 14:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They thought that this was a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But on whom was the ointment poured?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Was the One being anointed not worthy of the ointment?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This ointment was poured on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If this was a waste, it would mean that the Lord was not worthy of it.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Was the Lord indeed not worthy of this ointment?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Can anything be called a waste when it is applied to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Those who have never loved the Lord with a single heart think that too much consecration and obedience is a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In man's eyes, obeying the Lord, loving Him, and giving up everything for Him may sometimes be too much and may be a waste, but such criticism only shows the degree of love that the criticizing ones have.</S>
