   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. As God Becoming the Unique Male</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Universe</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Adam was the only male in God s creation at that time, typifying Christ as God becoming the unique male in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Old Testament many times God likened Himself to a husband and His people to a wife Isa 54:5; 62:5; Jer 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The New Testament many times also reveals Christ as the Bridegroom who marries the bride Matt 9:15; Mark 2:19; Luke 5:34; John 3:29; 2 Cor 11:2; Rev 19:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is the unique male in the universe; He is the unique object of our pursuit and the One to whom we eternally belong.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>G. As the One Whom None among God s Creation</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Can Match as a Counterpart</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After Adam was created, God said, It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper as his counterpart Gen 2:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then God brought to Adam every beast and every bird that He had created.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And Adam gave names to all of them, but he did not find a complement, a counterpart, to help him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This typifies that none among God s creation can match Christ as His counterpart, for none was out of Christ, and none had the same character, life, or nature as Christ to be a perfect match to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>H. As the One Who Slept in Death</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>and Whose Side Was Opened</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because none among the creation could match Adam to be his complement, his counterpart, God caused him to fall into a deep sleep and opened his side Gen 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a type of Christ sleeping in death and being pierced in His side John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the end of the crucifixion of Christ, a soldier pierced His side with a spear, causing His side to be opened and to flow out blood and water John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Blood is the negative aspect of Christ s death; it is for redemption, which is for the purchasing of the church Acts 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Water is the positive aspect of Christ s death; it is for imparting life, which is for the producing of the church Eph 5:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I. As the One Who Flowed Out the Water of Life</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>to Produce the Church as His Counterpart</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With the rib which was taken out of Adam, God built a woman as Adam s counterpart Gen 2:22-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The rib taken out of Adam signifies the flowing water and the unbroken bone mentioned in John 19:34 and 36.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Christ died on the cross, His side was pierced and the water of life came out, strong as an unbreakable bone, to produce the church as His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, the sinner whom God created and who became fallen, after being redeemed and transformed by Christ s death and resurrection, becomes the woman in the universe to be married to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>EVE TYPIFYING THE CHURCH A. Which Came Out of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just as Adam is a type of Christ, Eve is a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eve was built by God with a rib taken out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, Adam said that Eve was bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh Gen 2:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eve s coming out of Adam in this way typifies that the church comes out of Christ in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church is produced by the life-dispensing water which flows out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, the church has the essence of Christ and comes out of Christ.</S>
