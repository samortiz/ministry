<h2 class=head3>c. Blessed Are the Overcoming Saints, Who Are Invited to the Marriage Feast of the Lamb as His Bride</h2><p>Revelation 19:9 says, “Blessed are they who are invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb.” The marriage dinner of the Lamb is the marriage feast in Matthew 22:2. It will be a reward to the overcoming believers. Only the overcomers, not all the saved ones, will be invited to it. The foolish virgins in Matthew 25:8-13 will miss it. However, after being dealt with by the Lord in the kingdom age, they will participate in the New Jerusalem for eternity. Hence, to be invited to the marriage feast of Christ, which will usher the overcoming believers into the enjoyment of the millennium, is to be blessed. The overcoming believers invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb will also be the bride of the Lamb. This means that the bride and the guests will be the same persons. Therefore, at His coming back Christ will marry the overcoming believers as His bride.<h2 class=head2>6. To Be the Heavenly Armies Following the Faithful and True, The Word of God, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords</h2><p>In the completing stage of God’s full salvation, the overcoming believers will also be the heavenly armies following Christ as the Faithful and True, The Word of God, King of kings, and Lord of lords (Rev. 19:11-21). Verse 11 says, “I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sits on it called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war.” Verse 14 goes on to speak of the overcoming believers as the armies: “The armies which are in heaven followed Him on white horses, dressed in fine linen, white and pure.”<p>The overcoming believers follow Christ as “Faithful and True.” Christ will be faithful in destroying Antichrist and true in carrying out God’s economy.<p>As the One who defeats Antichrist, Christ is called “The Word of God” (v. 13). The Word of God is the definition, explanation, and expression of God. As the Word of God, Christ speaks for God not only by imparting life as grace to God’s chosen people but also by executing God’s judgment upon Antichrist and his followers. Even as the Lord fights, He speaks for God and expresses God. God is righteous and sovereign; He is also a God of order and cannot tolerate disorder and rebellion. As Christ fights against Antichrist, He will declare that God is sovereign, righteous, and orderly, that God is over everyone and that He does not tolerate rebellion against His authority. Therefore, Christ’s fighting against Antichrist will be a powerful speaking.<p>Revelation 19:16 says, “He has on His garment and on His thigh a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.” The fact that this name will be written upon Christ’s garment and thigh indicates that it will be openly revealed and known to all. The garment signifies Christ’s attributes, especially His righteousness in His humanity, and the thigh signifies His standing strength, His stability. His title “King of kings and Lord of lords” is exhibited in His righteousness and stability.<h2 class=head3>a. As His Called, Chosen, and Faithful Ones and as His Bride Invited to His Marriage Feast</h2><p>Revelation 19:14 speaks of the Lord’s armies following Him. These armies are His called, chosen, and faithful ones. Revelation 17:14 says, “He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and they who are with Him are called and chosen and faithful.” Here we see that those with the Lamb are called, chosen, and faithful. Notice that “chosen” is mentioned after “called.” To be called is to be saved, but to be chosen is to be approved by the Lord on the basis of an overcoming life. Many are called today, but few will be chosen in the future (Matt. 22:14). We all have been called. In order to be among the chosen in the future, we need to live an overcoming life today. In Revelation 17:14 the chosen ones are those faithful to the Lord who will become His army.<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that to be called is one thing and to be chosen is another. Those who will follow the Lord as the King of kings and Lord of lords will not only be called but also chosen. Although we have the assurance that we have been called, we do not yet have the assurance that we have been chosen. This will be decided at the judgment seat of Christ. After we have been raptured, we shall stand before the Lord at the judgment seat, and He will decide whether or not we are qualified to be chosen. Only those who are chosen will be His armies to fight against Antichrist.<p>According to Revelation 19, the armies consist of those who are both the bride and the guests invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb. The guests invited to the wedding feast and the bride are the same. The bride consists of the invited guests, and the invited guests make up the bride. After the wedding, all the guests will become the army.<p>Revelation 19:14 tells us that those in the Lord’s armies are “dressed in fine linen, white and pure.” This fine linen is the garment of the overcoming believers that qualifies them both to attend the marriage dinner of the Lamb and to fight with the Lord against His enemy. This fine linen is the second garment of the overcomers. Thus, the wedding garment becomes the fighting garment. The second garment qualifies us not only to attend the wedding but also to be in the army. The overcomers who follow Christ to fight against His enemy will be a properly formed heavenly army.
