   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Hence, we have to say to the Lord, "I can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Lord, I cannot do anything with Your word unless I first prostrate myself before You and move beyond the pressing of the ordinary crowd."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today many people do not realize how helpless they are as far as God's word is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many people are like professional preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They can say anything; they can preach doctrines, teachings, truths, and the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They can speak whenever they feel to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is too easy, far too easy!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The ministry of God's word is totally beyond our power.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must remember that the only way to regenerate others is to do it through the operation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can pass on doctrines to others, but in order to be a minister of the word, we have to have the revelation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must realize that this task is beyond our power.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the Lord's task; it is not our business.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this realm a man is not free to speak whenever he pleases.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God wants to have ministers of the word on earth; He wants to see men speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, today is the time for us to seek His face.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to say to the Lord, "I can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I cannot speak."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man is totally helpless in this regard.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only a foolish person is proud.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A foolish man does not realize that spiritual things have nothing to do with man; he does not know that man cannot handle spiritual things by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No eloquence, natural talent, or method can help a man touch the ministry of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The ministry of the word is something that belongs to a different realm, a realm that has nothing to do with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brothers, God must bring us on to the point where we see the uselessness of man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We cannot beget or regenerate anyone by our own resolve.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Parents can beget children in the flesh, but they cannot beget anything in the way of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the same principle, we can pass on doctrines to others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can tell others what the Bible says, but this does not make us ministers of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A minister of God's word is produced through God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If God does not speak, it is useless for us to present the Bible to others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God must first speak to us before we can convey this word to others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If God does not give His word to us, we can never convey any word to others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is not our business.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many people can tell stories, and they can preach doctrines, but they may not be able to tell you what God's word is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If God grants us mercy, we can tell others what God's word is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If God does not grant us mercy, we cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have the word only as God gives us the word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is something totally beyond our control; we can do nothing about it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet this is something that God wants to do.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God wants to have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He has chosen us to be ministers of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet we cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In fact, we cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is God's mercy and revelation that give us the word to speak to others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, we have to receive a basic revelation from God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the same time, our spirit has to be disciplined by the Lord and come under His control.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It must be so disciplined that it can open to Him all the time for fresh revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord has to deal with us and with our work to such an extent that we bow down and say, "Lord, do Your own work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If You do not have mercy on me, I can do nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must see that ministry is based on the revelation of the word, and the revelation of the word is based on the revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When it comes to spiritual things, things related to God's word and His ministry of the word, we must remember that there is no such thing as a long-term deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No one can boast about what he has, and no one should imagine that he can keep on working with what he has in his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every time we come to God we should be emptied so that we can be filled and pour out once more.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whoever is self-satisfied is not qualified to be a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Ministry of the word results in a state in which a man becomes as empty as a newborn babe as soon as the word is released.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He knows nothing before God, and he looks to God for another filling and another infusion of the word and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then he pours out God's word and revelation once again upon others and becomes empty once again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must be continually emptied.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Only by being continually emptied will we have the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the spiritual realm, God is the One who accomplishes everything; man can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should never think that anyone can open his mouth and speak God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To take up God's word and to serve as a minister of this word is a task that is beyond any human power to achieve.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This work belongs to another realm.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Holy Spirit has to work on us specifically every time.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Human beings can do nothing about this.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>May the Lord be merciful to us, and may we see before the Lord how useless man is.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>May we not be foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once a man becomes proud, he becomes foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When he does not see the basic spiritual things, he becomes foolish.</S>
