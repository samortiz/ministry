 <h2 class="head2">Being Strengthened to Apprehend with<br />
All the Saints the Vast Dimensions of Christ</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:8-10 shows that Paul preached the riches of Christ, from which the church is produced. Eventually, in verse 17 Paul prayed, &ldquo;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.&rdquo; This verse mentions many hearts but only one home. This is the Body.</p>
<p>Verses 17 through 18 continue, &ldquo;That you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are.&rdquo; By ourselves we do not have sufficient strength. We need to be with all the saints to be strengthened with power to apprehend the dimensions of Christ. The dimensions of Christ&mdash;the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth&mdash;are immeasurable and unsearchable. The universe is immeasurable, and the immeasurable dimensions of the universe are the dimensions of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Filled unto All the Fullness of God</h2>
<p>Verse 19 goes on to say, &ldquo;To know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; We need to be strengthened to apprehend with all the saints the dimensions of Christ so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God. Being filled unto all the fullness of God is the experience of the Body-Christ. It is impossible for us to be filled unto all the fullness of God individually. For this we need the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Recovery Today Being<br />
the Recovery of the Body-Christ</h2>
<p>Before the Lord comes back, He will recover the Body-Christ. To participate in all the riches of Christ, we need the Body. To drink of the all-inclusive Spirit, we also need the Body. For this reason, it is wonderful that we are in the church. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery today is absolutely and altogether the recovery of the Body-Christ in the church life. The Body-Christ is all-inclusive. Our experience confirms this. When we come to the church and participate in the church life, we sense that we are home and are satisfied. We are satisfied in the church life because here we have a foretaste of the New Jerusalem.</p>
