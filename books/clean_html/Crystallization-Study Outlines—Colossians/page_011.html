<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 3:10-11; 4:7-17; Philem. 1-2, 10-22</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In Colossians 4:7-17 we have an illustration of the revelation of the new man given in 3:10-11 and a record of the fellowship of the new man:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s purpose in 4:7-17 is to present an illustration, a detailed portrait, of the living of the new man:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In spite of all the differences among nationalities, races, and classes, there was on earth in a practical way the living of the one new man created in Christ Jesus&mdash;Eph. 2:10, 15.</li>
		<li>There were not merely local churches in various cities&mdash;there was one new man in a real and practical way&mdash;Col. 3:10-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The apostle&rsquo;s fellowship shows us that the new man as practiced at the apostle&rsquo;s time was an issue of the apostle&rsquo;s work, which encouraged the believers to seek after Christ, the constituent of the new man, as their enjoyment&mdash;1:12-13, 27; 3:4, 10-11.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Within Paul there was the sense, the consciousness, of the new man&mdash;4:7-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Both the saints in Colossae and Paul and those with him were members of the new man in actuality and had the consciousness of the new man:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The fact that Paul mentioned many names indicates that he had the consciousness of the new man&mdash;vv. 9-17.</li>
		<li>Because Paul had the consciousness of the new man, he charged Tychicus to make known to the Colossians all that concerned him&mdash;v. 7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s word regarding the reading of letters proves that there was no difference between the church in Laodicea and the church in Colossae; his word implies fellowship, oneness, harmony, and intimate contact&mdash;v. 16.</li>
	<li>We need to be conscious of the church, of the Body, and of the new man:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The record in the book of Acts regarding the church reveals that the believers were church-conscious&mdash;5:11; 8:1, 3; 9:31; 11:22, 26; 12:1, 5; 13:1; 14:23, 27; 15:3-4, 22, 41; 16:5; 18:22; 20:17, 28:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In their concept there was nothing of individualism; they did everything with a consciousness of the church&mdash;2:44; 4:23, 32.</li>
			<li>Based upon the record in Acts, we have the principle that whatever we do and whenever and wherever we meet, we must be church-conscious.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In the church life we should learn to have the consciousness of the Body, a Body-consciousness&mdash;1 Cor. 12:12-27:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In order to live and move with other members of the Body, we need to have the consciousness of the Body.</li>
			<li>Wherever there is Body-consciousness, individual thought and action are ruled out&mdash;Acts 9:1-19.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Like Paul, we should have the consciousness of the new man, realizing that all the saints in all the churches are the new man&mdash;Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10-11:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Any church that isolates itself from other churches has a consciousness only of itself, not a consciousness of the totality of the new man.</li>
			<li>If we are conscious of the new man, we will not think that the churches in our country have nothing to do with the churches in other nations; instead, we will realize that all the churches are the one new man today&mdash;Eph. 2:15; Rev. 1:11; 2:1a.</li>
			<li>By means of the traffic among the churches, we experience in a practical way the living of the new man; such a living has Christ as its reality&mdash;Col. 1:12; 2:16-17; 3:4.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The subject of the book of Philemon is an illustration of the believers&rsquo; equal status in the new man:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The case of Onesimus and Philemon illustrates that in the new man all the believers have an equal status.</li>
	<li>This Epistle serves the special purpose of showing us the equality in eternal life and divine love of all the members of the Body of Christ&mdash;vv. 1, 9.</li>
	<li>The equal status of the believers is a matter of love, which comes out of faith; in the new man the believers love one another in faith&mdash;v. 5; Titus 3:15.</li>
	<li>Because of the divine birth and living by the divine life, all the believers in Christ have an equal status in the new man; this is based on three facts:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s death has abolished the ordinances of the different ways of living for the creation of the one new man&mdash;Eph. 2:15.</li>
		<li>We have all been baptized into Christ and made one in Him&mdash;Gal. 3:27-28.</li>
		<li>In the new man Christ is all and in all&mdash;Col. 3:11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Epistle to Philemon should be regarded as a continuation of Colossians 4 and considered an illustration of how in the new man all social rank is put aside&mdash;Philem. 1-2, 10-22:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The distinction of social rank and status among the believers has been nullified because the believers have been constituted with the all-inclusive Christ, who is their life&mdash;Col. 3:4.</li>
		<li>In the Epistle to Philemon Paul gives the churches an illustration of how slaves and masters have been reconstituted with Christ; as a result, they are all part of the new man and have an equal status in the new man&mdash;vv. 10-11.</li>
		<li>In the practice of the economy of God, it is crucial that all social ranks and differences among races and nations be swallowed up&mdash;Col. 3:10-11:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In the new man distinctions on the basis of color have been nullified; Paul strongly taught this, and we must consider it part of the full knowledge of the truth&mdash;1 Tim. 2:4; 2 Tim. 2:25; Titus 1:1.</li>
			<li>If we see that the believers have an equal status in the new man, there will be no problems among us concerning social rank, nationality, or race&mdash;1 Cor. 12:13; Gal. 3:28; Col. 3:10-11.</li>
			</ol></li>
