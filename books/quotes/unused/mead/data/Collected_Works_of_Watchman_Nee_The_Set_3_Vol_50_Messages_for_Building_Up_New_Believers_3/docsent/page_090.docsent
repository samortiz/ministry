   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Laodicea Being the Result of</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Philadelphia's Degradation</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is where the issue lies today.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once Philadelphia fails, it becomes Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do not think that Protestantism is Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is altogether wrong to think this way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Protestantism is Sardis, not Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Protestantism can only be Sardis today; it cannot be Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No Bible reader should be so foolish as to think that Protestantism is Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No, Protestantism is Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After Philadelphia has fallen, it becomes Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sardis came out of Thyatira, and it was one step beyond Thyatira.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Philadelphia came out of Sardis, and it was one step beyond Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Laodicea, however, comes out of Philadelphia, but it is one step behind Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These four churches will remain until the Lord Jesus comes again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Laodicea is a distorted Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When brotherly love is gone, Philadelphia immediately turns into the opinions of many.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the meaning of the word Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Laodicea was a city whose name came from a Roman prince, Entiochus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He had a wife whose name was Laodios.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He took his wife's name, dropped the os and added sea or cea to become Laodisea or Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Lao in Greek means "many people" and sea or cea means "opinion."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As soon as Philadelphia becomes degraded, the "brothers" become the "many people," and its "brotherly love" becomes "the opinions of the many."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Love has degenerated into opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brotherly love is something living, but the opinion of many people is something dead.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When brotherly love is lost, the Body relationship is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fellowship of life is cut off as well, leaving only the opinion of men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The opinion of the Lord is lost, and the only things left are the vote of the majority, ballots, and the show of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once Philadelphia falls, it becomes Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Lukewarmness and Spiritual Pride</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Revelation 3:15 says, "I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the characteristic of Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 17 says, "Because you say, I am wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing, and do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These are the characteristics of Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the eyes of the Lord, the characteristics of Laodicea are lukewarmness and spiritual pride.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is bad enough for it to say, "I am wealthy," but it continues, saying, "and have become rich."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The two statements are evil enough, yet it goes on to say that it has "need of nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the eyes of the Lord it is "wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Where does spiritual pride come from?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It comes from history.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some were once rich and they think that they are still rich.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord was once merciful to them, and they remember their history.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But now they have lost that reality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Life That Was Present Being Lost Today</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is hardly any person in Protestantism today who boasts of his own spiritual riches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have met many Protestant leaders overseas as well as Protestant pastors in China.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They all say, "We are poor!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are poor!"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is hard to find a proud person in Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is only one group of proud people those who were Philadelphia and who had once kept God's word and not denied His name.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yet the life which they once had is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They still remember their history, but they have lost their former life!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They remember that they were once wealthy and had become rich and had need of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But they are now poor and blind!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is only one group of people who can boast of their riches fallen Philadelphia, the Philadelphia which has lost its power and life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Learning to Humble Ourselves before God</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Brothers and sisters, if you want to continue in the way of Philadelphia, remember to humble yourselves before God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Sometimes I hear some brothers say, "God's blessing is with us."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God's blessing is with us, but we must be careful when we say this.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As soon as we are not careful, we have the flavor of Laodicea: "We are wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Let me say that the day we take this position, we have become Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Please bear in mind that we have nothing that we have not received.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Those around us may be full of death, but we do not need to be conscious of the fact that we are full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Those around us may be poor, but we do not need to be conscious of the fact that we are rich.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Those who live before the Lord will not be conscious of their own riches.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>May the Lord be merciful to us that we may learn to live before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>May we be rich and yet not know that we are rich.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It was better for Moses not to know that his face was shining, even though it did shine!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Once a person knows himself, he becomes Laodicea, and the result is lukewarmness.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Laodicea means to know everything, but in reality to be fervent about nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In name it has everything, but it cannot sacrifice its life for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It remembers its former glory but forgets its present condition before God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Formerly, it was Philadelphia; today it is Laodicea.</S>
