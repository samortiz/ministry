<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO ADJUST THE MEETING</h2>
<p>Furthermore, we should lead the saints to take part in the activities in the meetings. This requires a certain amount of study. For example, when should we select a hymn? When and how should the announcements be given? When should everyone stand to sing, and when should they kneel down to sing? These matters require careful consideration. Sometimes our kneeling down to sing can uplift a meeting, or our standing to sing can revive the spirit. This is a mysterious matter.</p>
<p>We should not be legal regarding standing or sitting. Sometimes the way a person stands in the meeting can become monotonous, but if we criticize him, he might not be willing to stand in the meeting for another six months. We should not be rigid. Sometimes our body needs to sit, stand, walk, or lie down. For this reason, there should be some who can appropriately lead and adjust the meetings. However, those who adjust are not replacing the brothers and sisters; rather, they are helping them. The Holy Spirit often moves through people. If there is no one to adjust the meeting, it may be difficult for the spirit of the brothers and sisters to be uplifted. If the spirit is adjusted, the spirit can be enlivened. Hence, we should learn to follow the spirit.</p>
<p>We need to learn how to adjust and uplift the prayer meeting and the bread-breaking meeting. This applies to the fellowship meeting and other meetings as well. We are responsible to supply brothers and sisters with the word. In other words, there should always be someone who follows the Holy Spirit to adjust the meeting. There should also be a short ministering of the word to render help to the saints. After attending such a meeting, the saints will be willing to come again. As long as they desire to gain the Lord and are able to receive the spiritual supply in the meetings, they will want to come to the meetings. I hope that the brothers and sisters will pay attention to this matter.</p>
