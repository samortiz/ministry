The stumbling, killing, and hatred are inevitable results of the persecution (see John 16:1-2; Matt. 10:36; Mark 13:12-13; Luke 21:16).</P><P>Verse 11:"And many false prophets will arise and will lead many astray." Among the Jews there are false prophets (Hosea 9:7-17). There are such false prophets in the church also (1 Tim. 4:1; 2 Tim. 3:13; 2 Pet. 2:1). Their purpose is to deceive.</P><P>Verse 12:"And because lawlessness will be multiplied, the love of the many will grow cold." The result of being led astray is (a) the multiplication of lawlessness, and (b) love growing cold. This creates the environment for the coming of Antichrist (see Dan. 8:11-12, 23; 11:30-31; Isa. 65:11-15; 66:3-4; 2 Thes. 2:11-12).</P><P>Verse 13:"But he who has endured to the end, this one shall be saved." To endure to the end means to wait continually and to look continually to the Lord. To be saved, as mentioned here, is different from the salvation of eternal life that one receives. (Compare Isa. 30:18; Heb. 2:3; Dan. 12:12-13; Jer. 14:22 and Rev. 21:6.) The salvation here refers to the escaping of the tribulation and the entering into the kingdom (Psa. 80:3, 7, 19; Jer. 23:6; 30:7).</P><P>Verse 14:"And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come." The "gospel of the kingdom" is mentioned three times in Matthew (4:23; 9:35; 24:14). Paul, in the book of Galatians, says that there is only one kind of gospel (Gal. 1:6-9). Regardless of the difference in the names of the gospel, the gospel is still one. Acts 20:24 speaks of the gospel of grace, which, according to many, differs from the gospel of the kingdom. However, this is not so. The gospel is the same; only the viewpoint is different. Therefore, there is the difference in names. The gospel of the kingdom is the gospel that the Lord preached on earth; it includes the coming of the kingdom, the fall of the image in Daniel, the Lord's imminent return and reign, etc. When this gospel was preached, there were the signs of healing and casting out of demons. The gospel of grace emphasizes the matter of sin and the way of God's redemption. The gospel of the kingdom stresses the authority of the Lord. This kind of gospel of the kingdom must be preached in the whole earth before the coming of the end of this age.</P><P>In chapter twenty-four, "nation" in verse 7 and "all the nations" in verse 9 both refer to the Gentiles. Here "all the nations" also refers to the Gentiles. Those preaching the gospel of the kingdom must be the Jews and not the church. If it were the church, then in verse 14 it would have to be "for a testimony to all the sinners," because the church is of the Gentiles. The biblical basis for the Jews testifying to the Gentiles is in Isaiah 40:5-9; the "all flesh" there refers to the Gentiles. Isaiah 42:9-10 refers to Jacob, which means the house of Israel (41:8; 42:1). "You who go down to the sea and all that fills it, / You coastlands and their inhabitants" refer to the Gentiles. Isaiah 44:2-3, and 8 all indicate that Jacob will testify. What will Jacob testify? See Psalms 145:10-13; 96:3-4, 10 (in verse 3, "among the heathen" refers to the Gentiles; "all people" refers to the Jews); 68:9, 11. The purpose of preaching the gospel of the kingdom is to testify to the Gentiles. Not every Gentile will be saved or will receive repentance. Revelation 3:10 speaks of the great tribulation that is coming upon the whole inhabited earth, so the Lord first gives them the opportunity to escape. "And then the end will come." Matthew 24:15-31 mentions the things concerning the end of the age. Today we are in verses 7 and 8. We have not seen His person (because we have not arrived at the end of the age yet), but we have heard His voice. No one knows how long a period of time will pass before verse 14 comes to pass, but between verses 15 and 31, there is a definite period of three and a half years.</P><P>Verse 15:"Therefore when you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him who reads understand)." "The holy place" refers to the holy of holies in the temple in Jerusalem of Judea. The abomination of desolation refers to an idol, to the image that Antichrist will set up in the temple of God. That is the beginning of the great tribulation. In Matthew 24:16, 19, and 21 there are the words "then," "in those days," and "at that time." Since it is "then," there is not a difference of even one second. Concerning the end of the great tribulation, see verses 29 and 30. Immediately after the tribulation, the Lord will come again. The tribulation will begin when the idol is put into the temple and will end when Christ comes again. How long is the tribulation? Revelation 11:2 says that it will last for forty-two months. Revelation 11:3 and 12:6 say that the duration is a thousand two hundred and sixty days. This is "a time and times and half a time" in Revelation 12:14, which is three and a half years. Revelation 13:5 again says forty-two months. Revelation 11:2 says that for forty-two months the holy city will be trampled. The destruction of the temple in Matthew is the same as the trampling of the holy city in Revelation 11:2. From Luke 21:20, 23 and Matthew 24:15-21 we can see that the destruction of the city and the destruction of the temple take place at the same time. Therefore, the end of the age is the great tribulation, which begins from the time the idol is brought into the temple and continues until the Lord's coming. This period is forty-two months.</P><P>In the Old Testament there are prophecies concerning the end of the age. Nahum 1:9 refers to "a full end," which means to bring in the end of the age. Lamentations 4:18-19 says, "Our end had come"; therefore, we must escape. This also is the end of the age. Ezekiel 7:2-4 and 15-24 refer to an end, which is the end of the age, as do Daniel 8:17, 19; 11:27, 35, 40; 12:4, 6-7, 9.</P><P>Abomination is a Jewish idiomatic expression for idols. It is similar with the village people in China who call idols Buddha or fathers. See Deuteronomy 29:17; 1 Kings 11:5-7; Jeremiah 4:1; 13:27.</P><P>The abomination of desolation has two meanings: (1) Since God must bring in destruction wherever there is an idol, the idol becomes the main cause of destruction. Therefore, we say that the abomination brings in desolation. (2) Antichrist is called "the desolator" (Dan. 9:27), the one who makes abominable desolation. In Revelation 9:11 Antichrist is called Abaddon (Gk. Apollyon), which means "the destroyer."</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_089.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_091.html">Next</a> </body></html>
