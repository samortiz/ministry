M.</h2><p>I was born into a Buddhist family. My mother was a vegetarian for over thirty years. Later a Western missionary invited her to hear the gospel, and both she and I were saved. Afterwards I became an elder in a denomination. Still later I went to Shanghai and heard Brother Nee, who said that when we come to meetings, we should not only come for sermons, but we should come to pray as well. I listened to the brothers praying, but I dared not pray myself, and I did not know anything about prayer. I was not even that clear about my salvation. Three brothers in northern Kiangsu left the denominations. Later they disagreed on the matter of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. I saw that I am a witness of the Lord, and I prayed for the gift of healing. The Lord gave me the gift. By the Lord's mercy, I received the gift outwardly, but I was still very dry inwardly. Later I read the book In His Presence and other books by Madame Guyon and turned from the pursuit of gifts to the pursuit of the inner life. When the war broke out, I was not able to fellowship with spiritual brothers, and I was short of spiritual books. As a result, I did not receive any supply from others but had to struggle in myself. During this period of spiritual pursuit, I often found myself grieved in spirit and losing my peace. I did not enter into rest until I heard Brother Nee release the messages of life on May 25, 1948 at Customs Lane in Foochow. I realized that the discipline of the Spirit comes before our conduct, while the condemnation of the conscience comes after it. I also learned something concerning spiritual feelings. I am willing to start all over again in learning to subject my mind, emotion, and will to spiritual discipline.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>I want to speak two things in particular to Brother Wu. First, in spiritual matters, we should not seek to understand too much knowledge. It is better to be a little foolish and ignorant in spiritual things. We have to learn to commit everything to the Lord. In spiritual matters, we should not say too quickly, "I have understood." Nor should we analyze too much with our mind. We only have to be clear about the principles; we do not have to insist on knowing the fine details. With many spiritual matters, we touch death as soon as we begin to analyze. The more we know about our inward condition, the more we die. Once I asked a doctor in Shanghai, "What do you touch when you operate on a human body, a living body or a dead corpse?" He answered, "I only operate on living persons." I responded, "But the parts that you operate on have been visited by death." Wherever a surgeon's scalpel goes, death is present. The same principle applies in spiritual matters. We cannot analyze, understand, and clarify too much. If we try to analyze, understand, and clarify our inward condition too much, we will touch death. We can only understand our inward condition to a certain degree. We cannot go beyond a certain line. Once we cross that line, we cross into death. My speaking here on the mountain is spoken with reservation. Many spiritual things cannot be discussed or analyzed. Even if one can analyze some things, he can only do so in a limited way. But I myself do not know the extent of it. Once a man crosses a certain boundary, he touches death. If a child cuts open a man's heart because he wants to know what the heart is like, he will kill the man. I wrote The Spiritual Man under duress in sickness. It was bad enough that I wrote it, but it hurts me more to see brothers and sisters discussing, studying, and analyzing it. My delving into the subjects of that book was a taunting of the boundary line (like a frontier line between two nations at war). If anyone tries to study or analyze these subjects, he has crossed the boundary line, and the result will be nothing but death.</p><p>Our emphasis now is on the breaking of the outer man for the release of the inner man. This has to do with facts. Therefore, we do not have to analyze too much, and we do not need to be too clear about it. We should not be too meticulous about the details. If we are, we will be led into death. If an organ is dead, the doctor can handle it and examine it, but anything living cannot be easily touched. When the Lord grants us mercy and gives us the light, everything will be clear to us. Today we can only stop here. If we analyze and study too much, we will end up in death. All we need to do is trust in the Lord positively and obey Him. There is no need to study or analyze too much.</p><p>What we really need is to experience the positive wound of the cross. Only those who have such wounds will afford the Lord a free way. Whatever we do, we have to have the wound of the cross. This is the only way for life to flow out in our service.</p>
