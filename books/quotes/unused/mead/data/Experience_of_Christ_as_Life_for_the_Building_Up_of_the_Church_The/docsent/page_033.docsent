   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN SECOND CORINTHIANS Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:19; 2:14-15; 3:3, 18; 4:4-7, 10-11; 5:14-17, 21; 8:9; 10:1, 5; 11:2-3, 10; 12:9; 13:3-5, 14</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous chapter, we saw the four lines in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we want to compare what has been spoken concerning Christ in 1 Corinthians with what Paul said in 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second Corinthians gives us a real picture of Christ in our experience in an improved way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the first Epistle, the aspects concerning Christ are mentioned more or less in a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But we need all these aspects in order to go on to the deeper experience of Christ seen in Paul's second Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, we have the doctrinal aspects of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we have the Christ in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>CHRIST AS THE YES</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 2 Corinthians 1:19 Paul said, "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you through us, through me and Silvanus and Timothy, did not become yes and no, but our word has become yes in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can realize that Paul has turned from the doctrinal side to the experiential side.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is not yes and no. Christ is yes in your experience, not in your understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can say that Christ is the Yes only by our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A CAPTIVE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 2:14 Paul said, "But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ and manifests the savor of the knowledge of Him through us in every place."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you are going to enjoy and experience Christ, you have to be a captive.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You have to be captured.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may say that Christ is the power and wisdom of God 1 Cor 1:24 , but if you are going to experience Christ as God's power and wisdom, you have to be a captive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do you like to be captured?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You have to be led by Christ in His train of vanquished foes Eph 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this universe God is celebrating Christ's victory with a triumphal procession of vanquished foes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You must be one of these defeated and captured foes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Saul of Tarsus was a strong, ambitious young man who was against Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Lord met him on the road to Damascus, He said to Saul, "It is hard for you to kick against the goads" Acts 26:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A goad on a plow is a sharp-pointed stick used to subdue and prod an ox yoked to the plow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While Saul was kicking against the goads, the Lord was laughing at him in the heavens Psa 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, Saul was under the Lord's control.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This rebel was made an apostle by being captured by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God led him from city to city as a captive to celebrate the victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul could tell people, "I once was a rebel, but now I am a captive!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a celebration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Saul was a rebel against Christ, but he became captured by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He went from city to city to preach Christ as one in the train of vanquished foes to celebrate the victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to apply this experience to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before we preach Christ to others, we have to be captured by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>While we are preaching, others should have the impression that we are captives in the celebrating train of vanquished foes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can tell people how we used to be rebellious against Christ, but now we are the captives of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This will become a sweet savor, a sweet odor of Christ, which can be smelled by others 2 Cor 2:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The real preaching is not a matter of mere speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is a matter of showing forth that we are being led as captives in Christ's train of vanquished foes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we are such captives, we can experience Christ in a deeper way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the pure experience of Christ to make us a fragrance of Christ to God v. 15 .</S>
