   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE FUNCTIONING IN LIFE BY USING OUR TALENT Scripture Reading: Matt 25:14-30</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With life there is always growth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every kind of life grows.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If something does not grow, it does not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moreover, the growth of life is always for function.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every kind of life whether animal life or vegetable life grows for function.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a tree grows to a certain extent, it bears fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This bearing of fruit is the function of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Animals also have their functions when they grow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even when a small baby begins to grow, he has the function of life, and the more growth he has, the more function he has.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Growth is for function.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE NEED FOR ALL THE MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>OF THE BODY TO FUNCTION</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible tells us clearly that the church is the Body of Christ with many members, and all the members must function Rom 12:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, we must realize that function depends on the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If there is no life and no growth of life, there is no function.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Function comes from growth, and growth is something of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why Christianity has to have the system of clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Any kind of social body in the human community needs to hire someone to do certain duties.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They also have to organize and form a board or committee from among its members, and they need to elect a leader, a secretary, and a treasurer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is the same in principle in the so-called Christian churches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because too many are dead in their spirit, they form an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no life and no function of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For many years my family was in such a place.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, I came out from that background, and so have many of you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Still, we do not know how much we have been influenced by that background.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not only so, but the Christianity that surrounds us still unconsciously influences us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not have the sense that if we do not practice the function of life as members of the Body, there is something seriously wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do not function in the Body, we need to take this seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is no need for me to preach to you, but I would ask you to be aware that if you are a brother or a sister, a member in the Body, but do not function, that is seriously wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>OUR FUNCTION DEPENDING</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>ON THE GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to function, but function depends on growth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why do many Christians today not function?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is because many Christians today do not grow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the so-called churches today, it is hard to receive real nourishment, and there is no rich nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yes, there are some persons who have truly been saved and have life, but they do not have the adequate food.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today s Christianity is mostly a religion of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church, however, has to generate people and save people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why in the seven parables in Matthew 13 the Lord came not to teach people but to sow Himself as a seed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He came not to teach our mind but to sow Himself as the seed of life to grow in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is not to teach but to generate.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord put Himself as the life-seed into us in order that we may grow, not into a great tree but as small wheat v. 3 . The purpose of wheat is to feed people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When wheat grows, it produces grains which can be used as food.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The enemy s subtlety is first to snatch away the life-seed vv.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>4, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Second, he causes the heart to be hardened and stony so that the seed cannot grow, and third, he chokes the growth of the seed vv.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>5-7, 20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Eventually, though, the church must be like a little herb, like mustard.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Mustard is good only for feeding people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The enemy, however, makes it into a great tree bearing no food vv.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the situation of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It has become a big tree without food but with many places of lodging for the birds of heaven, many evil persons and things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The church must be a little herb good for people to eat, but the enemy has changed the feeding nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It has become a great tree and has lost its function.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today the Lord is going to recover the whole earth, but we are not here trying to be a big tree.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not have that kind of thought.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must be delivered from degraded Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The church on this earth is not for anything else but to grow as wheat to produce grains, or a little mustard herb, to feed people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A little herb can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is good only for people to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the church there is nothing but a wheat field, growing to produce not Ph.D. s and professors but little grains to feed people.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is of basic importance.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I hope that we all can see this.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I thank the Lord that right away after I was saved, He opened my eyes to see all these things, and He delivered me from the big tree.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have to realize that the Lord s recovery is the recovery of life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord imparted Himself to us, and He feeds us day by day; as a result, we grow, and we function.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have received life; now we have to feed and feast on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then we will grow, and we will function.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Function comes from the growth of life.</S>
