   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>6 ONE BAPTISM.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Is it by immersion or by sprinkling?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Is it single or triune?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are various forms of baptism accepted by the children of God, so if we make the form of baptism the dividing line between those who belong to the church and those who do not, we shall exclude many true believers from our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are children of God who even believe that a material baptism is not necessary, but since they are the children of God, we dare not on that account exclude them from our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What then is the significance of the one baptism mentioned in this passage?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul throws light on the subject in his first letter to the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"Is Christ divided?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Was Paul crucified for you?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The emphasis is not on the form of baptism, but on the name into which we are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first question is not whether you are sprinkled or immersed, dipped once or three times, baptized literally or spiritually; the important point is this: Into whose name have you been baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you are baptized into the name of the Lord, that is your qualification for church membership.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If anyone is baptized into the name of the Lord, I welcome him as my brother, whatever the manner of his baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By this we do not imply that it is of no consequence whether we are sprinkled or immersed, or whether our baptism is spiritual or literal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Word of God teaches that baptism is literal, and is by immersion, but the point here is that the manner of baptism is not the ground of our fellowship, but the name into which we are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All who are baptized into the name of the Lord are one in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>7 ONE GOD.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do we believe in the same personal, supernatural God as our Father?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If so, then we belong to one family, and there is no adequate reason for our being divided.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The above seven points are the seven factors in that divine oneness which is the possession of all the members of the divine family, and they constitute the only test of Christian profession.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are the possession of every true Christian, no matter to what place or period he belongs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Like a sevenfold cord the oneness of the Spirit binds all the believers throughout the world; and however diverse their character or circumstances, provided they have these seven expressions of an inner oneness, then nothing can possibly separate them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we impose any conditions of fellowship beyond these seven which are but the outcome of the one spiritual life, then we are guilty of sectarianism, for we are making a division between those who are manifestly children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we apply any test but these seven, such as baptism by immersion, or certain interpretations of prophecy, or a special line of holiness teaching, or a so-called Pentecostal experience, or the resigning from any denominational church then we are imposing conditions other than those stipulated in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All who have these seven points in common with us are our brothers, whatever their spiritual experience, or doctrinal views, or so-called church relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our oneness is not based on our appreciation of the truth of our oneness, nor on our coming out from all that would contradict our oneness, but upon the actual fact of our oneness, which is made real in our experience by the indwelling Spirit of Christ.</S>
