The Shoot of David</H2><P>Christ as the Shoot of David (Zech. 3:8; Jer. 23:5; 33:15; cf. Isa. 4:2), as a man in His humanity, will build the temple of God, bear majesty, sit and rule on His throne, and be a priest on His throne, being the counsel of peace between the two (Zech. 6:12-13; Rev. 20:4, 6). Between the two means between the priesthood and kingship. In the Old Testament no king could be a priest. But in the millennium both Christ and the overcomers will be kings to reign and priests to serve God. These two responsibilities will be reconciled in both Christ and the overcomers. The overcomers will be priests, drawing near to God and Christ, and kings, reigning over the nations with Christ in the millennium (Rev. 2:26-27; 12:5). As priests they satisfy God and Christ with the enjoyment of their service, and as kings they reign for God and represent God, shepherding man for man's enjoyment and satisfaction. This is a reward to the overcomers. The believers who are defeated in this age will forfeit this reward. However, after being dealt with by the Lord in the millennium, these defeated ones will participate in the blessing of this reward, which will be to serve God and represent God in the priesthood and kingship in the new heaven and new earth for eternity (22:3, 5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE SON OF MAN</H2><P>In the prophecy concerning the eternal economy of God, Christ is a man and He is also the Son of Man. Of course, the Son of Man is a man, but there is a difference between the Son of Man and man. Christ as a man is simple, without any relationships or involvements. But as the Son of Man coming to seek and to save sinners (Luke 19:10), He is full of relationships and involvements.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Oneness of Christ,<br>as the Son of Man in His Humanity,<br>with the Children of Israel</H2><P>Psalm 80:15 and 17 say, "Even the stock which Your right hand has planted/And the son which You have strengthened for Yourself....Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand,/Upon the son of man whom You have strengthened for Yourself." These two verses refer to the oneness of Christ, as the Son of Man in His humanity, with the children of Israel. Matthew 2:15 quotes Hosea 11:1, saying, "Out of Egypt I called My Son." The Son here refers to both Christ and Israel. Christ, as the Son of Man in His humanity, was the stock of Israel planted by God's right hand and strengthened for God Himself; God exalted Him in His ascension by seating Him at His right hand (Psa. 110:1), the highest place in the universe, with the first place, the highest position, the preeminence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Coming Son of Man</H2><P>Daniel 7:13-14 says, "Behold, with the clouds of heaven,/One like a Son of Man was coming;/And He came to the Ancient of Days [the eternal God]....And to Him was given dominion,/Glory, and a kingdom,/That all the peoples, nations, and languages might serve Him./His dominion is an eternal dominion, which will not pass away;/And His kingdom is one that will not be destroyed." Christ, as the Son of Man in His humanity, after He was cut off (Dan. 9:26), after He finished His earthly ministry through His crucifixion, went to God in His ascension to receive the kingdom (Luke 19:12, 15; Rev. 11:15).</P><P>He, as the Son of Man in His humanity, will be a stone cut out, not by human hands, to crush (Matt. 21:44) all the kingdoms of the world and become a great mountain, filling the whole earth in His kingdom for the carrying out of the eternal economy of God (Dan. 2:34-35, 44-45). The entire Bible reveals that Christ is a stone in three aspects. First, He is the stone for His temple (Psa. 118:22; 1 Pet. 2:4-5). Second, He is the stone for us to trust and rely upon (Isa. 28:16). Third, He is the stone crushing the enemies. All these aspects of Christ are for the carrying out of the eternal economy of God.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
