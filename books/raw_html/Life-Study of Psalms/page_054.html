<P>We need to notice that in this whole psalm, Psalm 16, nothing concerning good and evil is mentioned. The revelation in Psalm 16 is far beyond our natural understanding.</P><P>From the day we were born, we were always taught to take care of good and evil. We were taught that we need to do good and abandon evil. In every culture on all the continents, this same thing is taught. We may be people of different colors, but in our thought concerning good and evil, we are absolutely the same. We are "birds of the same feather" in our natural, human concept of good and evil. Psalm 15 is full of the concept of good and evil. In Psalm 16, however, there is no good and evil. Instead what replaces good and evil is the Lord Himself, the very person.</P><P>In the following message, I will fellowship concerning the lines, the principles, and the spirit of the Bible. For us to read and study the Bible properly, we have to know the two lines in the Bible, the principles in the Bible, and the spirit of the Bible.</P><P>In the Bible there are two lines. Right after God created man, God brought man into the garden and put him in front of two trees. These two trees were not a tree of good and a tree of evil. Good and evil are of one tree. We should not forget this. In the eyes of God, good is the same as evil. They are considered as one unit, as one tree. The other tree is the tree of life. Thus, there are the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life (Gen. 2:8-9).</P><P>With the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, there are knowledge, good, evil, and death. Thus, knowledge, good, evil, and death are all one family. If you are in the family of good, you are in the family of evil. Where good is, evil is there; where good and evil are, knowledge is there; and where knowledge is, death is there. This family is very complicated and terrible. It includes the good teachings of Confucius and the evil deeds of bank robbers. What family is this? It is the family of good and evil. But in the family of the tree of life, there is only one thing: life, life, life, life! There is no good, but life; no evil, but life; no knowledge, but life; and no death, but life. This is the tree of life.</P><P>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life are two sources, which produce two lines. These two lines start from Genesis 2 and go through the entire Old and New Testaments to reach two ends. The one end for the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is the lake of fire, and the other end for the tree of life is the New Jerusalem. The lake is full of burning fire, but the holy city is full of water, flowing and quenching and watering and saturating. If you are of the source of good and evil and are always going along in the line of good and evil, you will arrive at the lake of fire. There are only two ends in the entire universe: the lake of fire and the city of water.</P><P>The divine revelation of the Bible shows us two starts, two sources, two lines, and two ends, two results. If we can see these two lines, they will become governing principles to us in our understanding of the Bible. We will be governed and kept from making any mistakes. Throughout the years, in all the messages we have given, we have been governed by these two principles as the two main lines in the holy Scriptures.</P>
