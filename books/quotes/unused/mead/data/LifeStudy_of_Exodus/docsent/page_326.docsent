   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ACACIA WOOD OVERLAID WITH GOLD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After I was saved, I knew I had been regenerated, but I had no understanding of what had taken place within me.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I did not know that I had become a board of acacia wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I realized simply that I had been saved and that henceforth I should do my best to glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This concept, of course, is positive.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is wonderful to know that we have been saved and to desire to bring glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, this knowledge is natural; it does not contain any divine light.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is merely to know that once we were sinners bound for hell, but now, as saved ones destined for heaven, we should behave ourselves properly for the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is crucial to realize that when we were saved and regenerated, a change took place in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We were fallen and were sinking lower and lower.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But when we believed in Christ, He came into us, and we became buoyant.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We experienced a change in nature, for a new element was added into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This element is nothing less than Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, through regeneration we have become acacia wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have the uplifted humanity of Jesus and His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now our new being is part of the enlargement of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As Christians, we have been not only saved, but also changed in our nature and being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Within us we have the uplifted human nature signified by acacia wood and the overlaying divine nature signified by the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Anyone who does not possess such a new being is not our brother or sister in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All those who have been chosen by God and regenerated by Him have these two natures acacia wood and gold.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through regeneration our humanity has been renewed and reinforced.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, regeneration causes us to be wiser and more prudent and understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If I had never been saved and regenerated, I would not have the understanding I possess today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, many believers were like jellyfish before they were regenerated they seemed to be people without a backbone.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They could easily be defeated by anyone or anything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But now, through regeneration, they have become acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Their will is very strong to resist sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to 2 Timothy 1:7, God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, love, and a sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Power is related to the will, and love to the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God s salvation has indeed changed us; it has made us a new being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through regeneration we have the uplifted humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One of our hymns speaks of being Jesusly human.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because we have the uplifted humanity of Jesus, others may find it difficult to understand us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the one hand, we seem to be ordinary human beings; on the other hand, we are different from others because we have the divine life and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The divine nature is expressed in our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is typified by the gold overlaying the acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I appreciate the three words God, good, and gold.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>True gold and true goodness are both God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that if we would be a good man or a gold-man, we must first be a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The acacia wood should express the gold which covers it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are not gold-men, we cannot express God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As boards of acacia wood, we should express not ourselves, but the gold which overlays us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that what others see in us should be the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When you hear about acacia wood overlaid with gold, you may find it difficult to believe that, as a Christian, you are such a board.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You may be tempted to say that you are still weak.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you think you are weak and then proclaim that you are weak, you will in fact be weak.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In experience what you are will be according to what you think and say.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, it is crucial for you to change your thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No longer should you consider yourself a jellyfish.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In faith you should proclaim that you are a board of acacia wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not speak according to what you are by nature, but speak according to your faith.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you say that you are weak, you will be weak.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you say that you have no way to handle a particular situation, you will not have a way to handle it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But if you declare that you are strong and have the best way to handle a difficult situation, you will be strong and you will also have the way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To speak in this way is to fan into flame the gift of God we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Recently we have seen in the Life-study of 1 Corinthians that all believers in Christ have received the initial gifts, the gifts of the divine life and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now we must fan these gifts into flame, realizing that God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but a spirit of power, of love, and of a sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must see what we are through regeneration and then declare this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not look at yourself, but stand on the Lord s word and act on it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When the Lord Jesus told Peter to step out of the boat and come to Him on the water, Peter did so Matt 14:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He walked on the water according to the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But when he looked at the environment, his faith disappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should be like Peter in the first matter, but not in the second.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>According to the Lord s word, we should say in faith that we are boards of acacia wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Acacia wood signifies the regenerated and uplifted humanity of the new creation in Christ as the basic material, strong for standing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Acacia wood is thus the basic material of the standing boards.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The ability to stand does not depend on the gold; it depends on the acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Although gold is precious, it is too soft to have the necessary standing power.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As boards, our standing power is the acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We stand because we have a regenerated and uplifted humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, we do not express this humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Instead, we express divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Thus, gold is the church s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The fact that the acacia wood was overlaid with gold signifies that the divine nature of Christ has become one with our human nature to be the expression of God.</S>
