   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CLERGY-LAITY SYSTEM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The second category of Satan's work is found in the system of the clergy and the laity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Read the history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After Satan began by using so many substitutes to usurp the place of Christ, he invented the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What was his intention in doing that?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was to kill all the functions of the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Originally, all the members without exception were normal, functioning members.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But gradually the enemy set up the clergy-laity system to limit the function to just a small number of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since the majority have been put out of function, the Body has been paralyzed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Oh, the subtlety of the enemy!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His first step is to replace the life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He does this with anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His second step is to kill the function.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He has done this by installing the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brothers and sisters, we must see the evil strategy of the enemy, Satan, behind these moves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have taken the clergy-laity system so much for granted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have been so influenced by our background in Christianity, so steeped in it, that this evil system is in our very bloodstream.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There should be no clergy in the church, and neither should there be any laity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are against the clergy, and we are even more against the laity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every believer must be a functioning member in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Satan has moved to choke and kill the normal functioning of all the members by the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>DIVISIONS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do you think that Satan is satisfied with these two items?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No. He has taken another step by creating all the sects, denominations, and divisions in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He has not only replaced the life and killed the function of the members, but he has cut the Body into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He has moved to utterly wipe out the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The life has been replaced, the functions have been severely damaged, to say the least, and the whole Body has been divided.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is his master stroke.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is really clever.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I believe that there are at least fifty thousand real Christians in the city of Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suppose that these fifty thousand were not divided but all together as the one church in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What an impact that would be!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Just consider it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If there were such a testimony, it would be easy to conquer the whole earth for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do you see what the enemy has done and how successful he has been?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Oh, the ruin, the desolation, he has wrought!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is by these three categories of things that Satan has wrecked the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Where in this country has the church not been damaged by the influence of these three categories?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This country is an old Christian nation, founded by its forefathers for the sake of the Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But, today, where is the real expression of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is almost nonexistent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Regrettably, the church has been dominated by the substitutes of Christ, the clergy-laity system, and the divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why we stress so much that Christ must be our life, our content, and everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why we are always helping and encouraging all the brothers and sisters to realize their responsibility and function together as normal members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And this is why we pay so much attention to the matter of the ground of unity it is the only way to deal with the divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have seen the black side, the chaotic side, the disastrous results of Satan's work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But praise the Lord, there is another side.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God is moving in these days to recover.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What is the way of His recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I believe many of us would like to be in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is just in these three things: 1 the recovery of Christ as life and everything to us, 2 the recovery of the functions of all the members, and 3 the recovery of the proper unity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Not until these three things are recovered among us will we have a proper and adequate church life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There must be a group of believers who realize and experience Christ as their life and content and will take no substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Not one member of this group would be a clergyman or a layman.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They are all living, functioning members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>And all of them have abandoned the denominations, sects, and divisions and come to meet on the ground of oneness to practice the proper unity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If there is such a group, there is the Lord's recovery, there is a real expression of the Body of Christ, and there the enemy and all his work are put to shame.</S>
