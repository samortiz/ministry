   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LIBERATING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Corinthians 3:17 tells us that the Lord is the Spirit and "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that the Spirit is the liberating Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Where life is, there is always liberation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The more we grow in life, the more we become liberated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more mature we become in life, the more we are freed from all kinds of bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many of the young saints are still under much bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Seemingly they are more free than the saints who are more mature in the divine life, but actually they are more bound.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many of us are bound by religion and religious practices, so we need to experience more of the liberating Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we grow in life, we are released from our bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The many habits that we have according to our flesh and our natural constitution are bondages.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The liberating Spirit can free us from the bondage of our habits.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some brothers have the habit of being silent while other brothers have the habit of talking all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You may want to say something to a brother who has the habit of talking, but you may not get the chance because of his habit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all need to be liberated from our habits.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Another brother may have the habit of speaking softly in a large meeting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He may be bound by his natural habit and not experience the boldness in the Lord and the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He needs to be liberated from this habit; otherwise, he will not be able to minister adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He needs the liberating Spirit to grant him the boldness and the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we pray-read the word, we must be liberated from our habit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to pray-read according to the need and the atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If four or five brothers come together to pray-read the word in someone's apartment, there is no need for them to shout.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If one of the brothers does shout, this is according to his habit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should shout, not according to our habit but according to the situation, the condition, the environment, and the atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need the release of our spirit, not the release of our habit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Another brother may have the habit of being quiet all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His "exercise of the spirit" fits in the homes of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But when he comes to a meeting of three or four hundred people, he needs the boldness to release his spirit in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In a larger meeting, it will be easier for this brother to remain in his habit and to pray-read with the release of his habit of being quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need the liberation of the Spirit so that we may fit in any kind of environment or situation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With a small number, we need to experience the Spirit to pray-read in a low voice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With a large number of saints, we need to pray-read with a loud voice in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are enjoying the liberating Spirit, we will speak when there is a need to speak and be quiet when we need to be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What we do should not be according to our habit but according to the liberation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To enjoy the liberation of the Spirit to the uttermost, we need the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Outward regulations will not work to deliver us from our habits.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more we grow in life, the more we will be liberated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE TRANSFORMING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, "And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this verse the Spirit is the transforming Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Transformation is a change in life, a metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more life supply we enjoy, the more we will be changed, or transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Transformation is not an outward change by some method but an inward change by life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The transformation mentioned in 2 Corinthians 3:18 is not something of teaching but something of the changing life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all need to be changed, not by outward teachings and outward regulations but by the inward growing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When little children grow in their human life, they change in appearance from year to year.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>With the growth in life, there is a change.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all need to pursue the real growth in life, and we all need to have a real change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are not practicing religion, but as the church, we are God's farm.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to take care of the growth in life that we may have the transformation in life by the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE LORD SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Verse 17 of 2 Corinthians 3 tells us that the Lord is the Spirit, and then it refers to the Spirit of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To say "the Spirit of the Lord" is similar to saying "the current of electricity."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The current and the electricity are not two things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In like manner, the Spirit and the Lord are not two different items.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The current of electricity is the electricity itself, and the Spirit of the Lord is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The current of electricity is the electricity itself in motion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Spirit is the Triune God in motion, the reaching of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Triune God reaches the tripartite man as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In verse 18 there is the term "the Lord Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is a compound title like the Father God and the Lord Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The compound title "the Father God" refers to the Father who is God or to the very God who is our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord Spirit refers to the Lord who is the Spirit and to the Spirit who is our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord and the Spirit are not two, but they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In 2 Corinthians 3:17-18 the Spirit is mentioned in three aspects: 1 the Lord is the Spirit; 2 the Spirit of the Lord; 3 the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have to realize that the Lord is the Spirit to us, and we should call Him the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To call Him the Lord Spirit is according to the subjective experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we do not know the divine life, it will be difficult for us to call our Lord Jesus the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As we are experiencing the divine life in our daily life, we will spontaneously have the sense that the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The more we experience the Lord in life, the more we will realize that the Lord is the Spirit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we experience the divine life in the Spirit and come to the Bible with this experience, we will be able to receive the proper, enlightened understanding from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we do not have the knowledge or experience of a certain piece of machinery, we will not be able to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If you gave me a part from a car, I would not know what part it is or where to put it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But if you gave the same part to a mechanic, he would know what the part is and know where it belongs.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Because he has the knowledge and experience of an automobile, it is easy for him to understand its parts.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the same way, in order to understand the Bible, especially concerning life and the Spirit, we need the real experiences of life and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We may learn doctrines, teachings, and theology, but to understand the things concerning life and the Spirit, we need to enjoy and experience Christ as the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We need to enjoy the liberating Spirit and the transforming Spirit, who transforms us from one degree of glory to another degree.</S>
