We have published a book recording solely the messages given by Brother Nee during the resumption of his ministry (see Messages Given during the Resumption of Watchman Nee&#8217;s Ministry, published by Living Stream Ministry). The resumption of his ministry is very deeply related to me. In that book some of the messages were his and some of the messages were mine, and eventually it is difficult to distinguish between them. What was Brother Nee&#8217;s emphasis in those messages? Brother Nee&#8217;s messages, one after another, were on the Body of Christ. The problem among us lay in our not having seen the Body. In those messages Brother Nee was forced even to speak some very unpleasant words. He said that some churches were &#8220;native&#8221; churches; he also said that some churches were little kingdoms. This is what he said in the resumption of his ministry in June 1948. In March of that year I went especially to Foochow with several co-workers, including Brother K. H. Weigh, to fellowship with him. More than forty co-workers around us also desired to participate in the fellowship, but he refused all of them. Only two brothers, Brother Weigh and I, and two sisters, Peace Wang and Rachel Lee, were given permission to be with him. All the forty-odd co-workers waited in Foochow, and they asked me, saying, &#8220;Brother Lee, no matter what, please put in a word for us. We want to hear Brother Nee speak. We want to have a part.&#8221; Brother Nee said, &#8220;No.&#8221; It was as if I was asking for mercy before him. I said, &#8220;Look at all these brothers and sisters. Don&#8217;t you care about them?&#8221; We were very sorrowful in our conversation. I asked for mercy again and again. Eventually he said, &#8220;Okay, Brother Witness, tell them to come.&#8221; His house was quite large with a living room in two sections, an inner room and an outer room. At that time he gave his consent, not very willingly, saying, &#8220;Okay, ask them to come. Only the four of you will fellowship with me here in the inner room, and the rest of them must sit and listen in the outer room.&#8221;<p>Brother Nee began to fellowship with us. At that time I was the only one who spoke; the others would not speak. I said, &#8220;Brother Nee, look at the few dozens of churches here in Fukien Province. They are in confusion and are scattered. What shall we do?&#8221; So he began to speak, and that message touched every one of us. Then Sister Wang, who was in the outer room, said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we practice what you have told us?&#8221; After some consideration Brother Nee said, &#8220;If you want to practice it, every one of you must hand over himself. You must hand over everything: hand over yourself, hand over your family, hand over your riches, hand over your church, hand over everything.&#8221; It was from that time that the practice of handing over began. This was three months before he resumed his ministry and spoke concerning the &#8220;native&#8221; churches and little kingdoms. Not too long after these things, he was put into prison. He was kept in prison for twenty years, from 1952 to 1972, and eventually he became a martyr.<p>After the resumption of his ministry, he still came to take the lead in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. Then at the end of 1948 the political situation changed. So he called an urgent meeting in Shanghai with a dozen or so leading co-workers. He said, &#8220;Today I asked you to come here. You all know the world situation is changing. When facing the world situation, how should we handle it?&#8221; Before anyone said anything, he said, &#8220;First, I would like to make a statement. We will send Brother Witness abroad.&#8221; Afterward, at the conclusion of the meeting, Brother Nee said, &#8220;We all will remain here to seek the Lord&#8217;s leading. May the Lord lead us one by one.&#8221; I did not say anything. He charged me to quickly finish building the big meeting hall in Shanghai. At that time we had bought a piece of land for the building of the meeting hall; that was in November. After another three months Brother Nee called another meeting and gave the same opening word, saying, &#8220;I will say this first: We will ask Brother Witness to go abroad.&#8221; This time he said that we did not need to seek guidance but should all stay to be sacrificed for the Lord. He said that of course we should look to the Lord to preserve us. But he was afraid that one day when we would go on and risk our lives, we would all be &#8220;captured in one net.&#8221; Both of the co-workers&#8217; meetings were very short and both took place at dusk. While the sisters were preparing dinner for us, I took the opportunity to take a little walk with Brother Nee outside the house. I said to him sorrowfully, &#8220;Brother Nee, why is it that you want only me to go abroad, yet you all are staying here to risk your lives for the Lord? Is it because I am not worthy?&#8221; He turned around and looked at me, saying, &#8220;Brother Witness, you have to know that we will risk our lives for the Lord, but I am afraid that one day Satan will capture us in one net. If you go out, and if one day this thing really happens, we will still have something remaining.&#8221; I can never forget that word.<p>After two months he asked me to hand over everything of the church in Shanghai to the elders and he told me to leave the country. So I left. I first went to Taiwan. Then he was imprisoned for twenty years. There was a person who was his prison mate and much younger than he and who was led to salvation in the prison through Brother Nee. He could be considered a spiritual son of Brother Nee, and he also treated Brother Nee as his father. This brother, whose family name is Wu, got out of the prison first. Not too long before his death, Brother Nee had told this brother, &#8220;After you go out, you should try to find a brother by the name of Witness Lee. Tell him that I have not abandoned my faith. When you see him, you see me. What he speaks to you, that is my speaking to you.&#8221; This is what the niece of Brother Nee and her husband, Dr. Kung, heard when they met this Brother Wu in Shanghai. I can never forget Brother Nee&#8217;s word to me that &#8220;if you go out, we will still have something remaining.&#8221; Therefore, today if you go to my bedroom, you will notice that there is no other picture in my bedroom except the picture of Brother Nee. Furthermore, there is also a writing by Brother Nee on &#8220;Let me love and not be appreciated&#8221; hanging on one side of my bedroom. I miss him and I will always miss him.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
