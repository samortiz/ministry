   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. IN THE INCARNATION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Incarnation is the top, universal conception.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 1:20 says, "But while he pondered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Joseph and Mary had not come together as man and wife, yet Mary was pregnant.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This caused Joseph to doubt concerning their marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At this juncture an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and told him not to be afraid to take Mary as his wife, because "that which has been begotten born in her is of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The One who was born in the womb of Mary was not man but the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the beginning of Mary's conception, God was born into Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the end of that conception, nine months later, God came out with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is Jesus, the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before this conception, Mary did not have God in her.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But at the conception God came into her by dispensing Himself into her.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A. The Incarnation of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Being through the Conception</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>by the Holy Spirit in a Human Virgin,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Dispensing the Holy Nature of God</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>into Humanity</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first step in the accomplishment of God's full redemption and salvation in Christ was the incarnation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The incarnation of Christ was through the conception by the Holy Spirit in a human virgin, dispensing the holy nature of God into humanity Luke 1:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What Was Born of This Conception</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Being a Holy Thing Bearing</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>the Holy Nature of Divinity</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From the first day of Mary's conception, God was dispensed into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God was in Mary's womb for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's divinity and Mary's humanity came together and were mingled together for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>During those nine months, the divine dispensing increased.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This increase of the dispensing of divinity into humanity caused the growth of that conception.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, the entire process of Mary's conception was a process of the divine dispensing into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When this divine dispensing was "ripe," when nine months were consummated, a child came out.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That child was the mingling, the blending, of the divine dispensing into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His name was called Emmanuel God with us Matt 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was a little child, yet He was God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the one hand, He was the complete God, and on the other hand, He was a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was the complete God mingled with a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In human history, there had never been such a One.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was a child who possessed skin and bones and blood and flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was a real man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet within Him was the complete Triune God Col 1:19; 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was not merely the Son of God, but the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit Isa 9:6; Luke 1:35; Matt 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As such a One, He eventually became the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Acts 2:34-36 indicates that in Christ's ascension, He was made both Lord and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At the time of His birth He was called Christ Matt 1:16-18 ; but thirty-three and a half years later, when He ascended to the heavens, He was made Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Through resurrection Christ was consummated to be the perfect, complete Christ, the One who is the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
