<h2 class=head2>C. Confess Regarding the Point of the Purpose to Be Dealt With</h2><p>Once we ascertain that the purpose of the discipline of the Holy Spirit in dealing with us is a certain problem, we should confess it seriously before the Lord with regard to that particular problem. Were it not for that problem and difficulty we would have no need for the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Since the Holy Spirit arranges the environment to discipline us concerning a specific point, we must realize that it is in that specific point that we have a problem before God, either because we are stubborn or proud, stiff-necked or disobedient, not willing to pay the price, or not willing to deny self; it is either one thing or the other which must be removed or broken, dealt with or torn down. At any rate, there exists a problem. We must remember that the discipline of the Holy Spirit never causes us to suffer without a reason; rather it is always because there are areas within us which require dealing. The Holy Spirit had already anointed us many times, perhaps, yet we disobeyed; therefore, He has arranged such a discipline to assist His inward anointing. Hence, once we discover the purpose of the discipline of the Holy Spirit, we should have a thorough confession regarding the point in view.<h2 class=head2>D. Submit</h2><p>After we confess our sin, we must submit through the Holy Spirit. This submission implies acceptance. After we see that the purpose of this discipline is to deal with a specific point, we must submit ourselves in that particular point. It is only then that we accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head2>E. Worship</h2><p>After we accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit, we need to worship God. Worship is the highest form of gratitude. We have to worship God for His work in us and His way regarding us. For His dealing with us, for His way in our life, and for breaking us in such a way, we should not only give thanks before Him, but also worship Him.<p>The clearest picture in the Bible of man worshipping God is seen in Jacob. When he was dying, he worshipped God, leaning upon the top of his staff. This staff, which he carried throughout his lifetime depicts on one hand the whole experience of his life, and on the other hand his life as a sojourner. We place more emphasis upon the aspect of his entire life’s experience, because it includes his life of sojourning. Therefore, when Jacob worshipped God by leaning on the top of his staff, it means that he worshipped God according to his experience. When a person has the experience of being led by God, he is then able to render worship before Him. However, if one has never had the experience of being dealt with by God, it is difficult for him to render worship before God. All the worship of man to God is based upon man’s experience before God. Therefore, after being disciplined before God, we need to have a very clear, sure, and solemn worship. At this time, we are really accepting the discipline from God in a solid way.<p>Sometimes it seems that we have accepted a discipline before God, yet we have neither confessed to Him thoroughly nor accepted the discipline and worshipped Him solemnly. It seems that we have accepted the discipline, but we have not accepted it fully; therefore, that acceptance is not solid. Henceforth, when we accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit, may we first discover the purpose thereof, acknowledge our shortcomings and weaknesses, submit from within, and, finally, worship God. In this way our acceptance is very solid.
