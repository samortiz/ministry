<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Jeremiah's Genuine Prophecy<br>concerning Those Who Did Not Go into Exile</H2><P>In verses 16 through 18 Jeremiah prophesied concerning the king who sat on the throne of David and concerning all the people who dwelt in Jerusalem and who did not go into exile. He told them that Jehovah was sending upon them sword, famine, and pestilence, with which He would pursue them. He would make them like vile figs, which cannot be eaten because of rottenness. He would also make them a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth to be a curse, an astonishment, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where He had driven them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The False Prophecy of Ahab, the Son of Kolaiah,<br>and Zedekiah, the Son of Maaseiah</H2><P>In verses 21 through 23 we have a word about the false prophecy of Ahab, the son of Kolaiah, and Zedekiah, the son of Maaseiah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. In the Name of Jehovah</H2><P>Ahab and Zedekiah prophesied falsehood in the name of Jehovah (vv. 21a, 23b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Jehovah Delivering Them<br>into the Hand of Nebuchadnezzar</H2><P>The result of their false prophecy was that Jehovah would deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and he would strike them by roasting them in the fire (vv. 21b-22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Their Folly in Israel</H2><P>Ahab and Zedekiah committed folly in Israel and committed adultery with their neighbors' wives (v. 23a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The False Prophecy of Shemaiah the Nehelamite</H2><P>Verses 24 through 29 speak of the false prophecy of Shemaiah the Nehelamite.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Sending Letters</H2><P>Shemaiah had sent letters in his own name to all the people who were in Jerusalem, to Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests (v. 25).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Saying That Jehovah Had Made<br>Zephaniah a Priest<br>instead of Jehoiada the Priest</H2><P>Shemaiah said that Jehovah had made Zephaniah a priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, that there should be officers in the house of Jehovah over every madman who prophesies so that he might put that man in stocks and in the iron collar (v. 26). Then Shemaiah asked, "Now why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who prophesies to you? For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, It will be long; build houses and dwell in them, and plant gardens and eat their produce" (vv. 27-28). Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet (v. 29).</P>
