   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Sword of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Ephesians 6:17 Paul also told us to receive "the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In God's armor, the sword is the one item that is used for attacking the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After we put on the girdle of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, and the shoes of the gospel of peace, and we take up the shield of faith and receive the helmet of salvation, we are entirely protected, and we may then receive the sword of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit is the sword itself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, the Spirit is the word of God; hence, the word of God is also a sword.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, in our Christian experience, these three the sword, the Spirit, and the word are one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without the word, we have neither the Spirit nor the sword.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we contact the word of God in a living way, the word becomes the Spirit to us, and the Spirit is the sword for our offensive attack against the enemy that we may kill him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we have the whole armor mentioned above, we are able to stand against the stratagems of the devil, and having done all, to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>SUMMARY</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is also the armor that we put on, enabling us to stand against the stratagems of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This armor comprises the girdle of truth for the strengthening of our entire being, the breastplate of righteousness for the covering of our conscience to protect us from the accusation of the enemy, the shoes of the gospel of peace as our firm foundation for us to stand, the shield of faith that protects our will against the attacks of the enemy's fiery darts, the helmet of salvation that covers our mind against the negative thoughts injected into us by the evil one, and the sword of the Spirit for us to kill the enemy.</S>
