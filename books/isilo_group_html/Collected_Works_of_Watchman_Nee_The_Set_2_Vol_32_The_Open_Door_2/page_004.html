This town is ninety Chinese miles from K'un-ming. Most of the people are Buddhists. Previously, they were very antagonistic towards Christianity. One preacher was driven out of the town by them. At the beginning of March, while we were preaching the gospel in K'un-ming, an older lady received the Lord. She had been a Buddhist for over thirty years. After she received the Lord, she dropped her vegetarian diet as well as her opium. She begged Sister Yu and I to visit her hometown of Tang-Chi to preach the gospel there. We knew that God wanted us to go, and we went. Originally, we intended to go only for a day. But after we arrived, the Lord had sovereignly arranged everything. Her oldest son was the district chief of the town, and her third son was the principal of the elementary school. They prepared a classroom in the school (which could hold over three hundred people) for us to preach the gospel. Thank the Lord, most of the people in the town eventually heard the gospel. (The whole town has about five hundred households.) Many received the Lord. Sister Yu and I are very busy, and the work is hectic. We have gospel meetings in the sisters' homes. Every Monday we have a Bible study and prayer meeting in one sister's house, and every Saturday we preach to some young believers in another sister's house to help them know the Lord more and to pray. Thank and praise the Lord, He has granted us an open door even in this place. The Lord willing, Sister Yu and I will go to Tang-Chi again soon. Perhaps we will also go to Luh-Liang. After we become clear in our prayer, we will proceed. (We heard that Brother Chou Hung-bao has arrived in Luh-Liang and has started open air evangelistic meetings.)</p><p>A sister in the Lord,<br />Rachel Lee<br />June 4, in K'un-ming, Yunnan</p><h2 class="head2">Letter from Sister Liu Hwei-fen, Tientsin</h2><p>As to my future, I realize before the Lord that I have to stay in Tientsin for a longer period of time. I do not know whether I have understood God's will correctly. The Lord has been leading me to see that His humility and submission are beyond understanding. If there is anything wrong, I pray that God would be merciful and correct me, and I ask also that you instruct me. As for the sisters, I have concentrated on their spiritual condition and have not stopped them from their former activities. I do this so that they may develop something by themselves. Once a week I pray with a few sisters. During the week I also study the Bible with some sisters and unbelievers. In addition, I have been making some personal contacts. Brother Lee Bih has returned to Tientsin. I heard that Brother Witness Lee will come to Tientsin soon. We are waiting for him to come and help us. A few sisters from the Evangelistic Band have come to join us in the Lord's table at No. 82.</p><p>Sister Liu Hwei-fen<br />May 10, in Tientsin</p><h2 class="head2">Northern Kiangsu</h2><p>Before the turmoil, my father, Brothers Chi and Chiu, and I went to Dah-Chiao, Ma-Bao, Chu-Jia-Kou, Ke-Jia-Juang, Ma-Chang, Lian-Shui, Chang-Jia-Wah, etc., to visit the churches and to relate to them the principles of the work and also some of the news concerning the churches in northern Kiangsu. In particular we thank the Lord that the church in Dah-Chiao was revived and that the men He uses were also revived. That meeting is held in a remote village with over thirty people meeting. The Lord is the Savior and worthy to be exalted. Presently, seven people have been baptized. The meeting in Chien-Ji in north Lian-Shui has also seen the Lord's blessings. There are over twenty new believers at present.</p><p>Wu Ming-hui</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 32: The Open Door (2) &nbsp; pg 4</div><br></body></html>
