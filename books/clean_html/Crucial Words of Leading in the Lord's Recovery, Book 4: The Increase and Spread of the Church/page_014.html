<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S CREATION BEING ACCORDING TO A SCHEDULE</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s creation is based on a schedule. The phrase <em>there was evening and there was morning</em> is used repeatedly in the record of God&rsquo;s creation (Gen. 1:5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31). This refers to a schedule in God&rsquo;s creation. God did not use His almighty power as an excuse to not keep a schedule. God did not create the heavens and the earth and then relax and wait for a good mood to create the animals. If God&rsquo;s creation occurred in such a casual manner, how many days would it have taken Him to create all things?</p>
<p>If we read the Bible carefully, we will acknowledge that the first One who kept a schedule was our God. He is the almighty One, but He is not loose or careless in regard to time. He created according to a precise schedule of six days; moreover, these days were evenly divided into evening and morning. Every evening includes twelve hours, and every morning includes twelve hours. God&rsquo;s work of creation was done according to a schedule.</p>
<p>Our efforts to keep a schedule cannot match God&rsquo;s ability, because He is able to &ldquo;redeem&rdquo; every second. One of the primary requirements of the training is that people would be in their seats five minutes prior to the scheduled time of a meeting. This speaks of our need to keep a scheduled time. Some people think that it is easy to arrive on time, but this is not the case. Although we desire to arrive five minutes early for the meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, we often arrive late. The training surely has helped because often fewer than twenty, and sometimes no one, arrive late to a meeting now. The trainees are not late because they must follow the training&rsquo;s schedule, not their own schedule. If a trainee was able to set his own schedule, he would change the meeting time from nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning to ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning so that he could sleep longer. The training also set a rule that whoever arrives late three times will be dismissed automatically. Therefore, all the participants in the training dare not arrive late; they come to meetings in fear and trembling. Even traffic conditions are not an excuse for arriving late. Even though it takes thirty minutes to get to the meeting under normal traffic conditions, there is always the possibility of encountering a traffic jam. Thus, the trainees learn to leave their homes earlier in case they encounter a traffic jam. There is a need for guidelines and limitations because our human nature is so degraded. A schedule provides us with some of these needed guidelines.</p>
<p>God relied upon a schedule in His creation, and even the things He created follow a schedule. For example, human beings are born after nine months of pregnancy according to a schedule, and the harvesting of fruit is according to a schedule. These schedules are set by God. He does not allow freedom to produce chaos. The universe exists because God&rsquo;s creation operates according to a schedule. If the earth did not orbit the sun according to a set schedule, it would be impossible to sustain life on earth. The universe has order because God has set a schedule. We are God&rsquo;s children, and as imitators of God (Eph. 5:1), we should have a schedule related to all matters. Without a schedule, time slips away. In order to redeem the time, we must have a schedule.</p>
<p>Young people often work unceasingly without rest, but when they are finished with their work, they want to sleep unceasingly. Such a pattern of work will not lead to success. People who are successful schedule their time for working, eating, exercising, and resting. It is the same with spiritual matters. We need to read a set number of chapters or verses in the Bible at a set time in order to maintain this necessary spiritual practice. We should not read a large number of chapters when we are happy but nothing at all when we are unhappy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN ILLUSTRATION OF BEARING FRUIT<br />
ACCORDING TO A SET TIME&mdash;THE VINE</h2>
<p>Since we love the Lord, we should keep His laws. In the Gospel of John, the Lord likened Himself to a vine and us to branches (15:1, 5). According to God&rsquo;s law, a vine bears fruit according to a schedule. When I was small, the courtyard of our house contained a small vineyard, and I was able to watch the grapes grow throughout the year. After several years I realized that the vine produced fruit according to a schedule. In spring the vine would sprout, flower, and produce grapes at nearly the same time every year.</p>
<p>Today we are branches in the vine, the Lord. Therefore, our ability to bear fruit is unrelated to our mood. We should bear fruit according to a set time. It is a mistake to rely on mood, and it is not enough to know about truth and life if we do not have a schedule for bearing fruit. We must repent of this and pray.</p>
