Far in these messages on the conclusion of the New Testament we have covered five persons God Christ the Spirit the believers and the church
According to chapter two of Daniel, Christ, the heavenly stone, will eventually become a great mountain filling the entire earth
The second circle, signifying the dispensation before law, includes two items- the paradise of Adam and the chosen patriarchs
The third circle, signifying the dispensation of law, corresponds to the fourth item, that is, to the nation of Israel in the Old Testament
Finally, the last circle corresponds to the seventh item, the new heaven and new earth without end for eternity
For this reason, the circle of the church is bigger than the dotted circle of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
After the dispensation of grace, there will be the dispensation of the kingdom, the millennium, as represented by the fifth circle
The heavenly part will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, which will include Christ and the overcoming saints
Whoever is in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today will be in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the millennium
According to Matthew 13, that which constitutes the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens will be thrown into the lake of fire and burned
The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, composed of the overcoming saints, will actually be the New Jerusalem during the millennium
In the center of this part we have the saved Israelites as the priests teaching the restored nations to serve God
In this center there will be all God's chosen, called, redeemed, sanctified, transformed, conformed, perfected, and glorified saints
On the one hand, these saints will be kings ruling over the purified nations; on the other hand, they will be priests serving God and Christ
Regeneration means to have the divine life, the life of God, in addition to the human life which we already possess
The plants in the plant kingdom have the plant life, and the animals in the animal kingdom have the animal life
The kingdom of God as the reign of God is a divine realm to be entered into, a realm which requires the divine life
The fourth chapter of the Gospel of Mark reveals that the kingdom of God in the sense of life is with Christ as the seed of life
In verse 27 the Lord continues, 'And sleep and rise night and day, and the seed sprouts and lengthens-how, he does not know'
In verses 28 and 29 the Lord goes on to say, 'The earth bears fruit by itself: first the blade, then an ear, then full grain in the ear
Eventually, this growth will bring us to the harvest, and that harvest will be the full manifestation of the kingdom
The kingdom of God as God's reign in a particular way in the sense of life is with Christ as its reality in life
In the Lord's answer to the Pharisees, there is the strong indication that the kingdom of God is actually Christ Himself
The Lord was actually telling the Pharisees that they could not see the kingdom of God, even though it was among them
The Lord's word that the kingdom of God 'does not come with observation' indicates that the kingdom of God is not material but spiritual
By the Lord's word here we see that the battle fought for the kingdom is not fought by a man himself but by a man with the Spirit of God
Wherever the Spirit of God exercises His authority over the opposing situation, that is the kingdom of God coming in reality
Finally, in 28:23 Paul 'expounded and solemnly testified the kingdom of God' to those who came to him in his lodging
Romans 14:17 says, 'The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
According to the context of Romans 14, which speaks of receiving the believers, the kingdom is today's church life
In verse 5 He goes on to say, 'Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God'
These verses are a clear revelation of the fact that regeneration is the unique entrance into the kingdom of God
Because through regeneration we received the divine life, regeneration was our initial entrance into the kingdom of God
Although John was on the isle of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus , he was there living the kingdom life
That kingdom life was the incentive that encouraged him to suffer persecution and tribulation with all endurance
He could still be happy and work for the Lord, for within him he had the kingdom of God in life as an incentive
In Acts 14:22 we see that Paul and Barnabas told the disciples that 'through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God'
Our going on in the way to enter into the final entrance of the kingdom of God is the developing of the kingdom of God
According to Matthew, the manifestation of the kingdom will be a reward to the overcoming saints as their enjoyment with the Lord
To inherit the kingdom therefore is not simply to enter the kingdom but to receive the kingdom as a reward as a blessing for our enjoyment
He has entered into the heavens , He has passed through the heavens , and He has become higher than the heavens
In John 3:3 the Lord Jesus is actually referring to heaven when He says, 'Unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God'
As is the earthy, such also are they that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly'
The Savior we have received and the divine life we have received are of the same origin, the same source, which is the heavens
Heavenlies' here indicates not only the heavenly place but also the heavenly nature, state, characteristic, atmosphere, and element
In Philippians 3:20 Paul says, 'Our citizenship is in the heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ'
Before we were saved, our situation was like that of the prodigal son in Luke 15-rebellion against the heavens
After we received the call from the heavens, we became another kind of people, people no longer of this earth but of the heavens
As we shall see this rule is in our spirit for this rule is nothing other than the living One Christ consummated as the lifegiving Spirit
With the patriarchs and children of Israel the kingdom of God was present in a general way but not in a particular way
It was necessary for the people to prepare themselves to enter into this new start that is to enter into Gods kingdom by being regenerated
Matthew 4:17 says, 'From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near'
In Matthew 13:11 the Lord Jesus said, 'To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens'
The kingdom of the heavens is the kingdom of God just as Texas, as a part of the United States, is the United States
The kingdom of the heavens drew near at John the Baptist's preaching and at the preachings of Christ and His disciples
Even after his appearance, during his preaching, the kingdom of the heavens was still not there; it had only drawn near
It was from that time, after the church was founded , that the tares, the false believers, were sown amidst the true believers, the wheat
The Lord's word in Matthew 16:18 and 19 indicates that the kingdom of the heavens is wrapped up with the church
According to the Gospel of Matthew there are three aspects of the kingdom of the heavens the reality the appearance and the manifestation
The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is the outward condition of the kingdom of the heavens in name, as revealed in chapter thirteen
The record of Matthew 5-7 gives us a view of a certain kind of reality, the reality of the high standard of the divine life
A number of verses in Matthew indicate that the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is an exercise to the seeking believers
We need to be poor, emptied, unloaded, in this part of our being so that we may realize and possess the kingdom of the heavens
Anyone who is not poor in spirit but instead is proud and full in his spirit is not under the exercise of the kingdom of the heavens
Matthew 5:10 says, 'Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens'
In 510 the Lord tells us that those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness are blessed for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens
If we stay in righteousness, we are in the kingdom because the kingdom is absolutely a matter of righteousness
If we are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, we are truly under the exercise of the kingdom of the heavens
The surpassing righteousness is the condition of entering into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the millennium
To enter into the kingdom of the heavens means to live in its reality today and to participate in its manifestation in the future
Both the tares and the wheat grow in the field; that is, the false believers and the true ones live in the world
In 13:31 and 32 we have a parable telling of the abnormal development of the outward appearance of the kingdom
The church, according to its heavenly and spiritual nature, should be like the mustard herb, sojourning on the earth
The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened'
The church, as the practical kingdom of the heavens, with Christ-the unleavened fine flour-as its contents, should be unleavened bread
The outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens exists along with the church in the church age, but it does not exist within the church
The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will be the manifestation of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
The Lord's angels will bind the tares into bundles and cast them into the fire because the tares have done much damage to the Lord's kingdom
If the kingdom of the heavens is our incentive and exercise today, then in the coming age it will be a reward to us
Paul tells us that the Father has 'delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love'
To be delivered out of the authority of darkness is to be delivered from the Devil, who has the might of death
We have been delivered from the Devil, Satan, by the death of Christ and by the life of Christ in resurrection
We have not only been delivered out of the authority of darkness but also transferred into the kingdom of the Son of God's love
The object of the divine love becomes to us the embodiment of life in the divine love with the authority in resurrection
To be transferred into the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love is to be transferred into the Son who is life to us
When we live by the Son as our life in resurrection, we are living in His kingdom, enjoying Him in the Father's love
Under the heavenly ruling and restriction, we have genuine freedom, the proper freedom in love, with life, and under light
These three aspects of the kingdom are considered by Paul in Colossians 1:13 as the kingdom of the Son of God's love
Because the Father delights in His Son, the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love is a pleasant thing, a matter of delight
The Father, by His mercy and grace, has transferred us out of the darkness of Satan into this pleasant part of the kingdom
The stress in Colossians 1:13 is the kingdom of the Son of God's love in this age, which is the reality of the church
The church life today is the kingdom of the Son of God's love which is as delightful to God the Father as the Son of God is
John 3:5 indicates that it is through regeneration that all the believers have been transferred into the kingdom of the Son of God's love
Through regeneration we have been brought out of the darkness of Satan into this delightful aspect of the kingdom
Through God's salvation and regeneration, all the believers of His Son have been transferred into this section of the kingdom
The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God and are, in the church life, living in the kingdom of God today
Revelation 11:15 says, 'The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever'
That the Lord 'shall reign forever and ever' refers to the Lord's reign for eternity in the new heaven and new earth
The eternal kingdom here refers to the kingdom of God given to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ which will be manifested at His coming back
To enter thus into the eternal kingdom of the Lord is related to the entrance into God's eternal glory, to which He has called us in Christ
The kingdom referred to in all these verses is the kingdom where Christ will exercise the authority given to Him by the Father
It is also the kingdom of God because Christ receives the kingdom from God to be exercised on earth for God's authority
In Matthew 13:43a the Lord says, 'Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father'
In the millennium the overcomers in the heavenly part of the kingdom will reign with Christ over the earthly part
The overcomers as the righteous, the sons of the kingdom , will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father
When in the millennium the overcoming believers enjoy the Father as light, they will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father
The requirements of the kingdom of the heavens are the highest requirements, requirements that need the highest life, the life of the Father
That manifestation will be the Father's kingdom, that section of the kingdom which is most pleasant to the Father
The kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world is for the restored nations to dwell in to be the people in the millennial kingdom
After the Lord Jesus deals with the believers, the Jews, and the nations, He will bring in the millennial kingdom
The millennium, then, refers to the time after Christ comes again as King to rule the world and before the new heaven and new earth
In the New Testament the millennium is referred to in Revelation 204 and 6 verses that speak of those who reign with Christ a thousand years
Today the sun and the moon are not normal because they have been cursed through the rebellion of Satan and the fall of man
The second period of the universe is the period of accomplishment, the time during which God accomplishes His eternal purpose
No matter how wonderful the millennium will be, during that time the old heaven and the old earth will remain in existence
The old heaven and old earth will be restored during the millennium, but they will not yet be changed from the old to the new
At the end of the millennium he will be loosed from his prison he will deceive the nations and he will lead them in battle against the Lord
Death, the last enemy , will not be cast into the lake of fire at the second coming of Christ but at the end of the millennium
Three evil things-Satan, the rebellious nature of man, and death-will still exist even at the end of the millennium
All these dispensations, including that of the millennium, belong not to God's new creation but to His old creation
After they have been purified, they will be qualified to become God's people, but not His sons, in the new earth
Luke 19:12 and 15a indicate that the millennial kingdom will be the kingdom received by Christ from God the Father
The heavenly section of the millennial kingdom will be composed of all the Old Testament and New Testament overcomers
As the overcomers participate in the feast of the kingdom of the heavens, they will drink the cup of the new covenant anew with their Lord
All the Old Testament and New Testament overcomers will be gathered together to be the New Jerusalem on a smaller scale in the millennium
The heavenly section of the millennial kingdom will be a reward to all the Old Testament and New Testament overcomers
Whether or not we shall receive this reward depends on our enjoyment, experience, and expression of the processed and consummated Triune God
Revelation 20:6b says that the overcomers 'shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with Him a thousand years'
The overcomers, therefore, will be priests to contact God and co-kings with Christ to reign over the nations in the millennium
The heavenly section of the millennial kingdom will be the realm for the exercise of this priesthood and kingship
The Lord will sit on the throne of David and reign over the house of Jacob , ruling over the nations of the earth during the millennium
The earthly section of the millennial kingdom will be the realm for the saved Jews to be God's priests to teach the nations
During the millennium, the Gentiles will be the nations and the converted Jews will be the priests, teaching them to worship God
Around the Jews within the earthly section of the millennium will be the preserved, restored, and restituted nations
Eventually, at the end of the millennium, the last age of the old creation, every enemy will have been put under the feet of Christ
When sin is done away with at the end of the old creation and when its source, Satan, is cast into the lake of fire, death will be abolished
It also will be cast into the lake of fire with Hades, its power, after the last and final judgment at the white throne
Before we go on to see the new heaven and the new earth, we shall consider God's governmental judgment upon His rebellious creatures
As an insertion between these aspects, we need to consider a negative aspect-God's governmental judgment upon His rebellious creatures
Eventually, after God's governmental judgment has been completed, there will be a new heaven and new earth wherein righteousness dwells
Eventually, all negative things, that is, all the things that have been judged by God, will be swept into the lake of fire
Those that are regarded as goats will go with their leader, Antichrist, 'into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his angels'
If any man follows the Devil to oppose the Lord, he will share the lake of fire with the Devil and the fallen angels
In Message Two of the Life-study of Genesis we pointed out that in the pre-Adamic age there were some living beings with spirits
All that the unbelievers have said and done is written in the books, and the unbelievers will be judged according to the things written
Revelation 20:15 tells us, 'If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire'
Since the unbelievers follow the Devil, they share the Devil's judgment and will become joint-partakers of the Devil's eternal torment
As a result of this judgment, they will all be cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death as the final settlement
Those who worship the beast and his image and receive the mark of his name will be eternally tormented and have no rest day and night
At the end of the church age, Antichrist will rise up to be the last Caesar of the kingdom of the restored Roman Empire
He will pretend to be kind toward the Jews and will make a covenant with them for seven years , promising them the freedom to worship God
The eternal gospel, which will be preached by an angel, is different from the gospel of grace, which we are preaching today
They will not worship Antichrist or his image, and they will help the persecuted Jews and Christians, the Lord's brothers
The 'sheep,' those who obeyed the eternal gospel, will enter into the millennial kingdom to be the nations as its people
The 'goats,' those who did not obey the eternal gospel but followed Antichrist, will perish in the lake of fire
God's governmental judgment upon all His rebellious creatures will be for eternal perdition to be tormented in fire and brimstone forever
When sin is done away at the end of the old creation and when its source, Satan, is cast into the lake of fire, death will then be abolished
It will be cast into the lake of fire with Hades, its power, after the last and final judgment at the great white throne
The Greek word translated 'Hades' means 'not to be seen,' the invisible, and refers to the subterranean abode of the dead
Hades, the equivalent of Sheol in the Old Testament, has two sections: the section of torment and the section of comfort
Since death, Hades, and the lake of fire are of the same category, they will be put together by the almighty Lord
God's governmental judgment upon all His rebellious creatures will clear up the universe for the new heaven and new earth to come in
Revelation 21:1 says, 'I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and the sea is no more'
Peter 3:13 says, 'According to His promise we are expecting new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells'
The work of God's re-creation was to recover the land by restricting the waters which were the result of His judgment
The living creatures of the pre-Adamic world, after being judged by the waters, became the inhabitants of the sea
From the time of God's work of re-creation, God has intended to abolish the sea by dealing with Satan and his demons
Whereas we are renewed by the Lord's life, the old heaven and old earth will be renewed by the Lord's judgment with fire
Peter says that 'the heavens, being set on fire, will be dissolved, and the elements burning with intense heat are melted'
God's other kind of work related to the new heaven and new earth is His work of restoration in the old creation
God's life and nature are not wrought into the old creation, but the new creation does possess the divine life and the divine nature
We can receive the divine life and nature only by believing in the Lord Jesus Christ and being regenerated by the Spirit
We are a new creation , not according to the old nature of the flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life
The work of restoration will not include us, because by that time we shall have already become the new creation
The remnant of these living ones will be transferred into the new earth and will be the nations, the people of God, around the New Jerusalem
In the new heaven and new earth, God will have both the new creation and the restored part of the old creation
After the coming forth of the new heaven and new earth, the holy city, New Jerusalem, will descend to the new earth
In the new universe, the new heaven and new earth, God's focus will be on the new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center
Because the Epistle of 2 Peter is on the government of God, it tells us that there will be a new universe where righteousness will dwell
Righteousness is the main factor based upon which God's governmental judgment is meted out to all creatures in His creation
The new heaven and new earth as the new realm for God's eternal administration will exist for eternity as God Himself is eternal
The word 'month' in Revelation 22:2 indicates that in the new heaven and new earth the moon will still be there to divide the twelve months
There will also be a third category-the people who are neither in the New Jerusalem nor in the lake of fire but outside the city
At the end of this age a great part of the inhabitants of the earth will be killed by the sixth and seventh trumpets
After the millennium, a part of these nations, deceived by the Devil, will rebel against the Lord and will be consumed by fire from heaven
The rest will be transferred to the new earth as the nations, living around the New Jerusalem and walking by its light
We need to emphasize the fact that the nations on the new earth in eternity will be restored but not regenerated
The nations will consist of those restored to the original state of man in Gods creation and they will enjoy the blessing of the restoration
To be regenerated is to be born again with God's life, but to be restored is to be brought back to the original state of God's creation
We need to have a clear understanding of the difference between the nations as the people of God and the sons of God
In the new heaven and new earth there will be full satisfaction and rest; there will be no more cause of tears
Since death will be wholly swallowed up by life and cast into the lake of fire , in the new heaven and new earth there will be no more death
Not only will death itself be cast into the lake of fire, but the elements of death-sorrow, crying, and pain-will be abolished
When the sons of God are in the New Jerusalem, they will not have tears and therefore will not experience the wiping away of tears
The restored nations, who will not have the full enjoyment of eternal life, will have their tears wiped away by God
They will enjoy the shining of the divine glory and of the divine light through the redeemed and regenerated saints in eternity
For this reason, the city will have no need of the light of a lamp nor of the light of the sun, for the Lord God will illumine it
The glory of God as the light and the Lamb as the lamp signify that God in Christ will be the light of the New Jerusalem in eternity
In the millennium the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold
The nations will not need to walk in the sunlight or in the moonlight, for they will walk in the light of the New Jerusalem
The fact that the kings will bring their glory into the New Jerusalem indicates that they will be subordinate to the New Jerusalem
The nations on the new earth will be preserved by the leaves of the tree of life to exist in the created and restored human life forever
For this reason, there will be a difference between the perfected Christians and the saved but unperfected Jews
By the end of the millennium all the saved Jews will have been perfected and will be the same as the perfected Christians
In the new heaven and new earth, there will be no distinction between the Christian believers and the saved Jews
The New Jerusalem in the millennium will include neither the unperfected believers nor the saved but unperfected Jews
Those believers who have not been perfected in this age will be perfected during the millennium, perhaps in the outer darkness
After the millennium all the perfected Christians and the perfected Jews will be a single entity-the New Jerusalem
Because the influence of the traditional concept is so strong, it is crucial for us to see what biblical eschatology is
During the millennium the earth will not be altogether lovable, for it will not yet have been thoroughly cleared up
The old heaven and earth will need purification, and this purification, this purging, will be accomplished by fire
The New Jerusalem will be a city of water, and outside this city, and in contrast to it, will be the lake of fire
In the consummation of the eschatology revealed in the Bible, that is, in the new heaven and new earth, there will be a threefold issue
During the millennium, certain of the nations will inherit the kingdom prepared 'from the foundation of the world'
From the time God created the earth, He had the intention to prepare a kingdom for His created people to enjoy His blessing
These people, although fallen, will be purified and restored to the original condition of God's creation to enjoy the new earth
Let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in the heavens'
The nations on the new earth will enjoy the shining of the light of life from the Triune God in the New Jerusalem
They will enter into eternal life and they will be under the shining of eternal life, but they will not have eternal life in them
As the nations enjoy the shining of eternal life, they will bring their glory and honor to the shining New Jerusalem
Whereas the nations will enjoy the shining of eternal life all the negative rebellious ones will suffer eternal torment in the lake of fire
The New Jerusalem is produced by God's redemption, regeneration, sanctification, transformation, perfection, and glorification
Those who are in the New Jerusalem will constitute the first category of beings in the new heaven and new earth
Through God's working, all of God's rebellious creatures and all negative things will be swept into the lake of fire
Christ, the One who is life, has sown Himself as the seed of life into God's chosen ones, who are the soil for growing Him
The kingdom in its reality is a matter of Christ as the seed of life sown into us and growing in us unto maturity
John, the writer of the book of Revelation, was in the kingdom , and all redeemed and reborn believers are also part of this kingdom
In particular, the kingdom cannot be observed by our natural thinking, which is completely useless in apprehending the kingdom of God
In eternity the New Jerusalem will be the totality of all the believers shining forth the processed Triune God
We shall use six adjectives to describe the kingdom in its nature: divine, heavenly, spiritual, human, pure, and eternal
The word 'divine' means being of God, having the nature of God, or being transcendent and distinct from all others
The kingdom is also heavenly in nature, for it is the kingdom of the heavens , with the transcendency of the heavens
Since the Spirit has a bountiful supply, the kingdom, which is of the Spirit in our spirit, is full of the bountiful supply
Because the kingdom is human in its nature, having the human virtues, the Lord charged us not to cancel any commandment related to morality
We should keep all commandments related to morality in order to have the human virtues to match the divine attributes
In this message we shall consider the kingdom in its expression in the divine attributes and with human virtues
The expression of the kingdom involves three matters: the divine attributes, the human virtues, and our shining as the light
As love, the nature of God's essence, is the source of grace, so light, the nature of God's expression, is the source of truth
The word 'holy' not only means sanctified, separated, but also distinct, different, from everything that is common
For us to be holy, therefore, is to partake of God's nature and to have our whole being permeated with God Himself
Whereas holiness is related to God's inward nature, righteousness is related to God's outward acts, ways, actions, and activities
If you have known that He is righteous, you know also that everyone who practices righteousness has been begotten of Him'
His righteous act on the cross fulfilled the righteous requirement of the righteous God for us and all sinners
The divine love, the divine light, the divine holiness, and the divine righteousness are the main factors of the Ten Commandments
Love, light, holiness, and righteousness, God's attributes, are the characteristics of the picture of God portrayed in the Ten Commandments
In Matthew 5:6 the Lord Jesus says, 'Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied'
It is the surpassing righteousness , the righteousness on the highest plane, that can be attained only by Christ
Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens'
Matthew 5:10 tells us that those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness are blessed, 'for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens'
In Matthew 5:20 the Lord Jesus speaks of the surpassing righteousness we need to enter into the kingdom of the heavens
To enter into the kingdom of the heavens means to live in its reality today and to participate in its manifestation in the future
To be righteous is to give one what he deserves, but to be merciful is to give someone better than what he deserves
To be righteous is to deal with ourselves, to be merciful is to deal with others, and to be pure in heart is to deal with God
We gain this reward by being righteous with ourselves, by being merciful toward others, and by being pure in heart toward God
To be pure in heart is to be single in purpose, to have the single goal of accomplishing God's will for God's glory
Our spirit is the organ to receive Christ , whereas our heart is the ground where Christ as the seed of life grows
As those born of Him, if we would be peacemakers, we must conduct ourselves in the divine life and according to the divine nature
We all have broken, transgressed, the law, but our transgressions have been dealt with through the Lord's substitutionary death
Now as children of the Father we only need to fulfill the new higher law by the resurrection life which is the eternal life of the Father
The law of the old dispensation deals with the act of murder, but the new law of the kingdom deals with anger, the motive of murder
The requirement of the new law of the kingdom is higher than the requirement of the law of the old dispensation
The law of the old dispensation deals with adultery, whereas the new law of the kingdom deals with the inward motive of the heart
In order to have the highest standard of morality for the kingdom in its expression, we need to overcome our anger and lust
We shall experience and enjoy the divine life, the life that can fulfill the highest standard and overcome our anger and lust
In Matthew 5:40 and 41 the Lord continues, 'To him who would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak also
In Matthew 5:43-45 the Lord Jesus says, 'You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy
In Matthew 5:48 the Lord Jesus concludes, 'You, therefore, shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect'
Because the believers have the divine life and the divine nature, they can be perfect as the Father is perfect
If we intend to live in the kingdom, we need to practice the high standard of morality revealed by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 5
The requirements of this high standard of morality can be met only by the Father's life, not by our natural life
The kingdom of the heavens is the highest demand, and the life of the Father is the highest supply to meet this demand
These requirements are actually a revelation showing us that the Father's life can even make us perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect
As believers in Christ, we are not only God's creatures; we are also His regenerated children with the divine life and nature
We became children of God when the Spirit of God came into our spirit to regenerate us and to make our spirit the habitation of God
If the saints in the church in your locality are not built up but instead are scattered, divided, and separated, there is no city there
The light is not an individual believer; it is a corporate city built up as one entity to shine over the people surrounding it
Matthew 515 says Neither do men light a lamp and place it under the bushel but on the lampstand and it shines to all who are in the house
The light as a city on a mountain shines over the outsiders whereas the lighted lamp on the lampstand shines over those who are in the house
The kingdom people as the lighted lamp should not be covered by a bushel, an item pertaining to eating, a matter which causes anxiety
These good works are the behavior of the kingdom people through which others may see God and be brought to Him
In 1 Thessalonians 2:12 Paul indicates that we enter into the kingdom of God and into the glory of God simultaneously
Contrary to what many Christians think, God has not called us to a heavenly mansion but to His kingdom and glory
In the coming age, the entering into the kingdom of God and the entering into the glory of God will take place simultaneously
When we live by the divine life, the life of God, we surely will express God, and the expressed God is the divine glory
To enter into the kingdom of God and to enter into the expressed glory of God transpire at the same time as one thing
These verses indicate that the stone, which is Christ, will eventually become a great mountain filling the whole earth
Finally, the kingdom is unshakable in its expression, which is the glory of the Triune God, the very God Himself expressed in His glory
