<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In the church meetings we first need our spirit exercised. Although the word exercise is not used in 1 Corinthians 14, verse 32 of this chapter indicates very much that we need to exercise our spirit&mdash;&ldquo;the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.&rdquo; This indicates that when the believers in Corinth came together to meet, their spirits were exercised too much, like wild horses without bridles. That forced the apostle to tell them that they had to bridle their spirit. To ride a horse without a bridle means that the horse is not under your control. Today, however, in most Christian meetings there is no &ldquo;horse.&rdquo; I do not think that the Apostle Paul would need to come to tell us that the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. Many Christians do not even know that they have a spirit. They do not know what Paul meant when he used the word &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; in 1 Corinthians 14:32. They have only heard of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>When I was with some Pentecostal groups, I must admit that I saw &ldquo;the wild horses&rdquo; there. I saw people who were jumpers, laughers, rollers, and shouters. To some extent they were all wild horses with no control, no bridle. In a positive sense, the Pentecostal movement has a good point&mdash;the exercise of their spirit. They have such a good point, but they do not realize that what they are doing is the exercise of their own spirit. In order to encourage all of us to exercise our spirit, to some extent we had better adopt the Pentecostal way. The Pentecostal way has a good point in that it forces people to forget about their mind, to forget about their thinking, to forget their consideration, and to really exercise their spirit. On the island of Taiwan there are a group of Christians who are &ldquo;chair shakers.&rdquo; This is their way to get themselves out of their considerations and into their spirit. Both the Pentecostals and the chair shakers have the same principle&mdash;to &ldquo;shake away&rdquo; your considerations and your thinking and to &ldquo;shake up&rdquo; your spirit.</p>
<p>To speak an intelligible language, you have to exercise your mind, but to speak in tongues, you do not need to exercise your mind (1 Cor. 14:14). There is a part of our being created by God&mdash;the human spirit (Zech. 12:1). God, who is Spirit, is not directly related to our body nor to our mind, to our soul. But those who worship God must worship Him in spirit (John 4:24). Therefore, in a positive sense we have to &ldquo;shake the chairs.&rdquo; The playing of sports is an enjoyment in the physical body. To sing may be an enjoyment in the soul. But to shake the chairs and to speak in tongues may be an enjoyment in your spirit.</p>
<p>These chair-shakers and tongue-speakers became addicted to what they were doing. Many of them realized that what they were doing was false, but the effect is that they stir up the main part of their being. Although there is a certain kind of enjoyment, they deceive themselves and deceive others. They do not have the term &ldquo;the spirit&rdquo; nor do they talk about the exercise of the spirit, but they have some enjoyment. We have the term &ldquo;the spirit&rdquo; and we talk about the exercise of the spirit, but mostly we do not have the enjoyment. All the tongue-speakers in Corinth did not have a bridle on their spirit. This is why Paul had to tell them that the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. When they came together, they did not care for each other. Each one cared for his own enjoyment and for his own building up.</p>
<p>The first time I attended a Pentecostal meeting was in July of 1932 with Brother Nee. Brother Nee nearly had no chance to speak. The people in the congregation were shouting, laughing, rolling, and jumping. The pastor had to ring a bell a number of times in order to get them to stop to give Brother Nee a chance to speak. Brother Nee stepped up to the platform and he spoke concerning the prodigal son coming back to the Father in Luke 15. He preached the gospel, talking about how the Father loves the prodigal son. That was a good message from which I learned much. I had never heard many of the wonderful points that Brother Nee shared concerning the Father and concerning the prodigal son. I do not think that Brother Nee&rsquo;s audience had any heart for hearing the truths that he presented to them. They had become addicted to their enjoyment. Some of the ladies there were addicted to jumping and to rolling. The more they rolled, the happier they felt. Sometimes they shouted and yelled while they rolled on the floor. This was their way to release their spirit.</p>
<p>The way of much of today&rsquo;s Christianity suffocates the spirit. They quench the spirit. When you go to many of their meeting places, there is an atmosphere of keeping everything quiet. The congregation sits quietly and listens to music. Some big cathedrals are dark inside. The windows may all be stained glass and the music is played on a great pipe organ. No one can be wild in a place like that. When you walk in, your spirit is killed. Who exercises their spirit in such a worship service? What is needed for the church meetings is for us to exercise our spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
