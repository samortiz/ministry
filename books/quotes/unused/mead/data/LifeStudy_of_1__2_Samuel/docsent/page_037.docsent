   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE NINE THE HISTORY CONCERNING SAUL 2 SAUL'S CONQUEST OF THE AMMONITES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>SAMUEL'S REMINDER TO ISRAEL Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 11 12</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we read the history recorded in 1 and 2 Samuel, we need to realize that, no matter what was happening, God was behind the scene directing everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We see this in a particular way in the history concerning Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Saul, who was very tall and handsome, matched Israel's human concept of a king, and they immediately recognized him as the king.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But God sees through all things from beginning to end and knew what was within Saul's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the sight of God, Saul was useful at a certain juncture for carrying out God's temporary purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was needed by God to discipline and train Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Israel needed an education under a king who was apparently good but who actually was very selfish.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, Saul was qualified and capable and had the capacity, humanly speaking, to rule Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the other hand, he was evil in the sight of God and also a pretender who could put on many different masks.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the time of his inauguration, Saul put on a mask of humility, but near the end of his life, he was exposed as actually being an evil person before God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After Saul's forty years of reigning, Israel surely learned not to follow the nations in a human way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a peculiar people, a particular possession belonging to God, their way should be according to God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the kind of person Samuel was.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was absolutely according to the heart of God, not according to the customs of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although Israel had been delivered from tyranny in Egypt and had been brought into the promised land to be a particular treasure in the sight of God, they were not willing to be such a treasure but instead followed the customs of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, God used Saul to discipline them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because Samuel, a Nazarite, was fully in submission to God as the Head, he was willing to do whatever God wanted him to do, without expressing his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For this reason, when God told Samuel to anoint Saul to be the king over Israel, Samuel was obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With this in mind, let us now go on to consider the history concerning Saul in chapters eleven and twelve.</S>
