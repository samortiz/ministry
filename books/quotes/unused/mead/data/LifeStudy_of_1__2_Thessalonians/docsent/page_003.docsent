   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ORGANIC UNION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Thessalonians 1:1 says, "Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This Epistle and the second were both addressed to the local church in Thessalonica, composed of all the believers in Christ in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such a local church is of the believers and is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that such a local church is born of God the Father with His life and nature and is united with the Lord Jesus Christ organically in all He is and has done.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, it is of men such as the Thessalonians , yet in God and in the Lord organically.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such an organic union in the divine life and nature is the vital base for the believers to live a holy life for the church life, which is the theme of the two Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In his opening word to the Thessalonians Paul speaks in a plain manner.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He does not say, as in Romans 1:1, that he is "a slave of Christ Jesus, a called apostle, separated to the gospel of God"; neither does he say, as in Ephesians 1:1, that he is an "apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The opening of Romans and Ephesians is more complicated than that of 1 Thessalonians.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because this Epistle was written to young believers, in 1:1 Paul simply says, "Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is a particular characteristic of Paul's writing to emphasize the organic union of the believers with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In fact, the emphasis on the organic union with Christ is an outstanding feature of Paul's writings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In his Epistles Paul again and again speaks of being in Christ, in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although 1:1 is written in a simple way, it nevertheless includes Paul's characteristic reference to the organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this verse Paul speaks of the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The preposition "in" here is very important; it indicates that the church is in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church is composed of human beings, but they, the believers, are in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the one hand, the church in Thessalonica was of the Thessalonians; on the other hand, this church was in God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A LIFE RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul does not merely say that the church is in God; he says that the church is in God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Unless God is our Father, we cannot be in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We were not created in God; however, we were regenerated, born again, in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We were created outside of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that in creation we did not have any organic union with God or any life relationship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead, there was only the relationship between the creature and the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a result of creation, we are God's creatures, and He is our Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, there is a relationship of creation, but no relationship in life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God's life was not created into our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As God's creatures, we did not have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We had only our created life, our natural human life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we were regenerated, born of God, our life relationship with God began.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This rebirth brought us into the organic union with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the time of our regeneration, our rebirth, we obtained God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now God is not merely our Creator, our God; He is our Father, the One who has begotten us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is no longer merely our Creator He is also our Begetter, for He has begotten us with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, He is God our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Through regeneration the Thessalonian believers had become sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the book of Romans, the church is a composition of sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is impossible for sinners to be components of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sinners can be members of a secular organization, but they cannot be components of the church of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Such a church is composed only of sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have been predestinated by the Father to be His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As Ephesians 1:5 says, we have been predestinated unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At a certain time, God called us and moved us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then we repented, believed in the Son of God, Jesus Christ, and received Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By receiving Christ, we were reborn and became sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now that we are sons of God, we are the components of the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because we, as sons of God, are the members of Christ, 1:1 says not only that the church is in God the Father, but also that the church is in the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
