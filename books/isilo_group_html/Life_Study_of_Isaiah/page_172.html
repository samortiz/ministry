This Son, this gift, is the Wonderful Counselor, the Mighty God, the Eternal Father, and the Prince of Peace. When we received Christ, we received Him as so many marvelous items. He is Jehovah our Savior, to save us from sin into Himself, and He is Immanuel, God with us. We enjoy this One as grace, which is God Himself as our portion for our enjoyment. The issue of our enjoyment of Him as our portion is that He becomes our reality. We then become real men. Nothing with us now is false, unreal.</P><P>We also enjoy Christ as our Counselor every day. Sometimes when we go to our wives or husbands to ask them something, they will say that they do not have the time at that moment to answer us. But whenever we go to Jesus, He never tells us that He is busy. He immediately gives us the counsel. In all of our relationships with others, He is our Counselor to give us the best counsel. Our Counselor is the Mighty God. Without Him, we do not have the power or the strength to carry out His counsel. He gives us counsel, and then He is our power and strength for carrying out this counsel.</P><P>We also enjoy Him as the Eternal Father and as the Prince of Peace, reigning and ruling within us in peace. When we have Him, we have His ruling, His government, His peace. When a husband is angry with his wife, he is not under any ruling, so there is no peace. If he would silently receive the cross and receive Christ as the Prince ruling over him, he would immediately have peace within. This peace comes from Christ's inner ruling.</P><P>The wonderful One we possess and enjoy today is Jesus, Jehovah the Savior, and Immanuel, God with us. He is grace, reality, the Wonderful Counselor, the Mighty God, the Eternal Father, and the Prince of Peace. Jesus is everything! We have only one God, but our God is an all-inclusive God. Whatever we need and whatever we lack, He is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Government to Be upon His Shoulders</H2><P>The government is upon the shoulders of Christ, the wonderful One (Isa. 9:6). The government which is upon His shoulders will be increased with His peace without end. He will be upon the throne of David to rule over His kingdom, to establish and uphold His kingdom in justice and righteousness firstly in the millennium and then in the new heaven and new earth unto eternity (Isa. 9:7).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_171.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_173.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 172</div><br></body></html>
