   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Need for a Room to Receive People</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since there is such a need, there is a place, which we temporarily call the service office.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At least in this place we can put a few tables and a few shelves.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The place needs to be large enough to accommodate those who are looking for others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should be able to receive people and handle all the affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This place can be either near the meeting place or within the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Need for People to Work in the Office</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second, there is a need for people to be in the office, especially a group of deacons, to learn to take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Of course, it is good for some brothers and sisters to come and help, but it is best to let the deacons bear the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brothers and Sisters Taking Turns to Work</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It would be very easy for the church to use the funds from the offering box to hire people to work for the whole day, but I feel that this is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the church can spend money to hire Levites, it can also spend money to hire priests.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This would restore the system of salaries.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I hope that the work of the Levites and the priests would be done without pay and by brothers and sisters who take turns.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, it is the same with the work in the business office.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Forgive me for using the word business, which is a secular term.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I would like for the brothers and sisters to separate some time during the week to put themselves into this kind of Levitical work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One brother may be willing to give one day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Another brother may be willing to give two days, an hour, or two hours.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this way there will be brothers and sisters taking care of the practical affairs in the office.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For Notification and Inquiry</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One brother may want to notify us that another brother is sick.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He only needs to come to the service office, and the deacons can immediately notify the responsible brothers or other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Perhaps after a short time, the service office can send out this information.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The service office should always have a set of pre-addressed envelopes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever something happens, they can prepare copies of the information either by mimeograph or by hand and immediately mail them out.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As soon as something occurs, the brothers and sisters throughout the whole city could be informed within one or two hours.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whenever they have time in the service office, they should address the envelopes and prepare them for later use.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are not copying the methods of the world, but we have to take care of affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, during the past ten years or more in Shanghai, if you did not know where a brother resided, you could telephone the service office.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All that is needed is to check the card file.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Perhaps that brother went to Nanking and would not return for one or two days.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If there had been no service office, it would not have been easy for you to find him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are not copying the ways of the world; we want God's children to know how to handle affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In another case someone may go to another locality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church in that locality may write to ask if that person was baptized in our midst as he has claimed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the elder says that he does not know, or that this person seems to have been there before, what can we do?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the number of brothers and sisters increases and the number of baptized ones also increases, there is the need for records.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you have the records, once you look them up, you will find out.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This one was baptized on a certain date and met with us for more than two years, but since then we have not seen him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today this one has been found in another city.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We know what his situation was during those two years, but not since then.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we can ask him: "Since those two years, where have you been?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whom have you met with?''</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then there is a way to take care of him and to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Things of this sort require records.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today in a large city like Shanghai or in a place like Foochow, there are district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When anyone comes to ask about the location of the meeting place or about the time when the responsible brothers can be found, someone needs to be available to answer these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, everyone who serves in the business office should know these answers and be able to reply immediately and render help.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If there is something the serving one cannot handle, he should refer the matter to the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If the serving one can handle the matter, there is no need to look for the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Otherwise, the responsible brothers would need to receive people all day long, and they would not have any way to get anything done.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many things need to pass through the hands of the deacons, and from the hands of the deacons to the hands of the responsible brothers or to their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I thank God that during the time of the apostles, they handled their affairs well.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can see this because the apostles heard the murmurings concerning the Hellenist widows.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It was the duty of the brothers and sisters who were deacons and deaconesses to have their eyes open.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Once something happened, they notified the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then, as you can see, Peter immediately took action.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, in order to take good care of a church, it is not as complicated before God as we think, like Protestantism is.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Neither is it as simple as we think.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Protestantism has too much organization, but we have overthrown the biblical organization.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Both are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, we need to have a place to conduct business.</S>
