<h2 class=head2>B. After the New Testament Time</h2><p>The church further degraded after the completion of the New Testament. Satan tried his best to destroy the church because he knew that the builded church would destroy him. He used the Roman emperors to persecute the church in an attempt to terminate her. [Persecution, as we know, did not terminate the Christians; it rather helped them. Then Satan changed his strategy. Under the rule of Constantine the Great the Roman Empire made Christianity legal, and Christians had the full freedom of worship. Because of the favors he granted the Christians, thousands of pagans were baptized and became Christians in name. These were the tares spoken of in Matthew 13:24-30. That ruined Christianity.] Constantine [acted openly as head of the church, which in his reign was first called Catholic; at the same time he kept his title of high priest of the heathen.]<p>[This ruin progressed from the fourth to the sixth centuries, by which time the papal system was fully established. With this the Roman Catholic Church reached its full development; it claimed to be the one, universal church (catholic means universal) and exercised worldly power over people and nations. No protest or dissent was tolerated. Over the centuries when it held sway, the Roman Catholic Church killed more genuine Christians than the pagan Roman Empire had killed. Under such a dark church, the so-called Dark Ages were produced, lasting about ten centuries, from about A.D. 500 to 1500.] Shortly thereafter, the Lord began to recover the church. Hallelujah!<h2 class=head1>III. THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>[When we speak of the recovery of the church, we mean that something was there originally, that it became lost or damaged, and that now there is the need to bring that thing back to its original state. Because the church has become degraded through the many centuries of its history, it needs to be restored according to God’s original intention. Concerning the church, our vision should be governed not by the present situation nor by traditional practice but by God’s original intention and standard as revealed in the Scriptures.]<p>[First, God purposed and then He came in to accomplish His purpose. Furthermore, the New Testament also gives us a clear record of how God’s enemy came in to destroy what God had accomplished.] [Nevertheless, God is a God with an eternal purpose. He is a purposeful God, and once He has made up His mind to do something, nothing can change His mind or stop Him. Therefore, after Satan’s destruction, God comes in to redo the things that He had done before. This redoing is His recovery. This is to bring back whatever has been lost and destroyed by God’s enemy, Satan.]<h2 class=head2>A. Typified by the Return of the Children of Israel from Their Captivity</h2><p>[The recovery of the church is typified by the return of the children of Israel from their captivity (Ezra 1:3-11). In order to understand the recovery of the church, we need to consider the history of the people of Israel in the Old Testament.]<p>[The entire history of the nation of Israel is a full type, an all-inclusive type, of the church. The nation of Israel began with the exodus. The children of Israel were in slavery in Egypt, but through the lamb of the Passover they were redeemed out from Pharaoh’s usurpation. They made their exodus from Egypt, crossed the Red Sea, entered the wilderness, and came to Mount Sinai, and there they built the tabernacle as God’s dwelling place on earth. Eventually, the people of Israel crossed the Jordan and entered into Canaan, the good land. After conquering the people and gaining the land, they built the temple. The time immediately after the building of the temple was a golden time. However, that golden time did not last very long. Mainly due to the failure of Solomon, the temple was destroyed, and the children of Israel were taken to Babylon as captives. The Babylonian army not only destroyed Jerusalem with its temple but also brought the utensils of the temple to Babylon and put them into idol temples. What a shame! The people of Israel remained in Babylon for seventy years.]<p>[As typified by the latter part of the history of the children of Israel, the recovery is from Babylon—the capturing and divisive ground (Ezra 1:11). For the children of Israel to be recovered meant for them to be brought back to Jerusalem from Babylon. Negatively, to be recovered means to be brought out of Babylon; positively, it means to be brought up to Jerusalem,] [the God-ordained unique ground. Jerusalem was the place the Lord had chosen (Deut. 12:5). Jerusalem, therefore, was the center for God’s people to worship Him, and this unique center preserved the unity of the people of God. Without such a center, after the children of Israel had entered the good land, they would have been divided.] [The recovery of the church is also typified by the rebuilding of the temple of God, the house of God, in Jerusalem after the return of God’s people from Babylon] (Ezra 1:3). [Finally, the recovery of the church is typified in the Old Testament by the rebuilding of the city of Jerusalem (Neh. 2:11, 17). After the recovery of the building of the temple, there was still the need to build up the city. Without the city, there would have been no protection for the temple. The temple, the place of the Lord’s presence, needed protection. The wall of the city was the defense to the temple.]<p>[Spiritually speaking, the church, due to its degradation, has been in captivity. God’s people have been divided, scattered, and carried away from the proper ground of unity to a wrong ground. In the Old Testament type, the children of Israel were centered around Jerusalem, but later they were scattered and carried away to many places, in particular, to Babylon. This portrays the situation among many of today’s Christians. In a very real sense, the believers today are more scattered than the children of Israel were. Therefore, we need to be recovered. We need not only revival but also recovery.]
