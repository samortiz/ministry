<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p> This book is composed of a series of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Boston, Massachusetts, on August 23 through 28, 1978. From July through September 1978 Brother Lee visited many localities in the United States and Canada, giving a series of conferences to meet a timely need in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. His two main burdens in these conferences were the believers&rsquo; personal contact with the Lord as branches abiding in the vine, and the vision and practice of the proper church life.</p>
