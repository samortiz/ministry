<h2 class=head3>SUMMARY</h2><p>The Spirit works in us to supply us with His bountiful supply. In this bountiful supply are the rich items such as the Lord’s divinity, His humanity, His human living, His death and its effectiveness, and His resurrection and its power. The bountiful supply of the Spirit is upon the Body of Christ. Therefore, we must be joined to the Body of Christ that we may enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit. The Spirit also works in us by leading us to live a life as sons of God. This leading is not outward but inward, and is composed of the law of the Spirit of life, the Spirit, and life. As long as we live under this leading, we will walk and behave in a way that proves that we are God’s sons. The Spirit also sanctifies us. He not only separates us from all old and negative things, making us holy unto God, but also sanctifies us, making us a new creation that is full of the Lord’s essence and element, that we may obtain His glory. The Spirit transforms us, causing us to have a metabolic, organic change in every aspect of our being, by dispensing the divine life, nature, element, and essence into us. The Spirit also dwells in us for God’s multifaceted purpose in us that we may be saturated and transformed by Him, become His dwelling place, guard the Lord’s deposit in us, and love God in singleness with our whole being.<h2 class=head3>QUESTIONS</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly explain the Spirit’s supplying us with His bountiful supply.</li><li>Briefly explain how the Spirit is leading us.</li><li>Briefly state the difference between children of God and sons of God.</li><li>Briefly state the three stages of the Spirit’s sanctifying work in the believers.</li><li>Briefly explain how the Spirit is transforming us.</li><li>Briefly state the purpose of the Spirit’s indwelling us.</li></ol>
