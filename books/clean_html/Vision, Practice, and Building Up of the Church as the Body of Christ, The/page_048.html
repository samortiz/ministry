<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING INVOLVEMENT IN PROBLEMS<br />
BY TURNING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Throughout all the years in the past and in all the places I have been, I have learned this lesson. We all have a heart for the Lord, we have seen the vision of the church, and we desire to practice the genuine church life. However, in our real situation there are still troubles. The unique source of all the troubles is that often we are not in the spirit. When we are in the spirit, even when there are problems in the church, we are not bothered and we do not get involved with them. When we are not in the spirit, though, we only add more fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>I believe that this is what was in the spirit of Paul as he wrote the book of Ephesians. As he wrote this Epistle, he was clear that the church life can be realized only in spirit and in love. As we have seen, the phrase <em>in spirit</em> is mentioned several times in this book. Paul also uses another phrase, <em>in love</em> (3:17; 4:2, 15-16; 5:2). We should bring all the problems to the Lord and turn to our spirit. Then we will view the problems from the spirit. It is not that the situation will change. The situation will be the same, but our view will be different, because we will look at it from another angle. Moreover, we will be kept from involvement in the problems. We will not need others to rescue us from the problems, but we will be in the position to rescue others.</p>
<p>If we see a problem between brothers or sisters, we may have the good intention to help the situation. However, we need to realize that if we are in the soul and not in the spirit, there is the danger that we may get involved with the problem. Originally the problem may have involved only two persons, but if we get involved in our soul, more people will be added to the problem. We will only add more fuel to the fire. As long as we are in our soul, we will only get involved negatively. It is in this way that Satan, the subtle one, takes the ground to increase and enlarge the problems in the church. Rather, we should be quiet and cool down our mind and emotion. Then we must go to the Lord in the spirit to wait on Him in prayer. We should not exercise the mind or the emotion; we should simply contact the Lord in the spirit for a certain amount of time. Then we will see the difference. The situation may not change, but our view will change, and with this view we will be kept away from negative involvement. We will be in a position to help and even rescue the situation. This comes by our not being in the soul but being in the spirit.</p>
<p>If we look at matters with our mind, we will have a certain point of view, but if we look at them with a spirit of wisdom and revelation, we will have a different view. We always need to turn to the spirit, and we need to have a spirit that is full of wisdom and revelation. In addition, we need our spirit to be strengthened. We must be stronger in the spirit than in the mind. We also need our mind to be subdued under the control of the spirit. For our spirit to be the spirit of our mind is genuine transformation.</p>
<p>If we consider a certain brother with our mind, we may be disgusted with him and think he is hopeless. We must learn the lesson to realize that our poor, troublesome mind needs to be subdued by our spirit. We need to turn to the spirit, look to the Lord, and have our mind subdued by the spirit. If we do this, then we will look at the same brother from our spirit and be full of hope. The brother may still be the same, and his situation may not have changed, but our view will change because we will look at him from our spirit. This is not a mere doctrine. It is something we can put into practice in our daily life. Sometimes after exercising my mind I have asked the Lord, &ldquo;Be merciful to me. I do not want to be in the outer court or even in the Holy Place. I want to be in the Holiest Place in Your presence.&rdquo; By being in the presence of the Lord in this way, my view was changed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR HUMAN SPIRIT<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 1 our spirit is enlightened and filled with wisdom and revelation. In chapter 3 our spirit is strengthened, and in chapter 4 our spirit subdues and takes over our mind. Then in chapter 5 our spirit is filled with Christ, who is the fullness of God. We are filled not with something for the body, but even the more we are filled with God in our spirit. Finally in chapter 6 we pray at every time in spirit. If we are in the mind it is impossible to pray at every time. The more a brother considers his wife with his mind, the more he is unable to pray. This kind of exercise of the mind keeps him from praying. However, if he turns back to the spirit and considers things from the spirit, he will pray at every time in spirit with all prayer and petition.</p>
<p>I am so grateful for the Word of God. Ephesians presents a proper order, a sequence. First, our spirit is enlightened to be a spirit of wisdom and revelation. Then it is strengthened, and it brings the mind under its control. Following this it is filled with Christ as the fullness of God, and it becomes a praying spirit. If this is our condition, we will have no problems. The real building up of the church can be realized only in this kind of spirit. Eventually, we will be the habitation of God in spirit.</p>
<p>How much we always need to turn to our spirit! We should not receive this merely as a doctrine. We need to practice this. Whenever there is a problem in the church with the brothers and sisters, we must practice to turn to the spirit. We should never try to reason. Reasoning gets us nowhere. Likewise, we should not try to debate, for debating only brings in more confusion. Rather, we must learn to quiet our mind, cool down our emotion, and turn to our spirit to stay in the presence of the Lord for a certain time concerning all the problems before us. Then to be sure, we will have another view of the situation, and we will be kept from negative involvements. We will be in a position to rescue those who are involved and be a real help to the situation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING RESTRICTED BY OUR SPIRIT<br />
TO HAVE A BALANCED RELATEDNESS IN THE BODY</h2>
<p>On the positive side, we will be very related to all the others who are also in the spirit. Our real relatedness is in the spirit, and this relatedness in the spirit is the true building up of the Body. Sometimes we see in the church that certain ones are too related to one another. This is not the genuine relatedness but something natural. It simply indicates that the persons involved are not in the spirit. If we are in the spirit, we will not be overly related. Rather, we will be related to a proper extent, because whenever we are in the spirit, there is always the proper restriction. We will realize that we can love and deal with a brother only to a certain extent.</p>
<p>In our spirit there is both a release and a restriction. In this way we are kept from being overly related with anyone. If we do not have this balance in the spirit, we will eventually have divided and divisive parties among the brothers. One group of brothers will be overly related; another group will be related among themselves but not to the first group. We all must reject both being unrelated and being overly related. We must have a balanced relatedness. Whether or not we like a certain brother, we need to have the proper relatedness in our spirit, and at the same time this relatedness must be restricted by the spirit. Then we will have the proper and genuine relatedness with all the brothers. Whether or not we like someone, we still need to keep the balanced relatedness in our spirit. Then whether we are happy with the brothers or not happy, there will be no parties. Rather, the relatedness among us will always be balanced. Through this kind of balanced relatedness we will have the genuine building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
