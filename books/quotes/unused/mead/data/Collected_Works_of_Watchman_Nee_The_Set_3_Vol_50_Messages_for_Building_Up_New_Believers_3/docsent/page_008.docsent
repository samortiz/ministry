   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. Not Doing What the Gentiles</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Consider to Be Improper</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ninth, we should not take up any recreation that is improper in the eyes of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This does not mean that we can do anything that the Gentiles consider to be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These are the two principles in dealing with the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may not necessarily do what they approve of, but we certainly will not do anything that they do not approve of.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Are you clear?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are many kinds of entertainment which the Gentiles approve of, but we cannot be involved in them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They approve of movie-going, gambling, and dancing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These are their basic kinds of entertainment, but we do not approve of them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of course, we would never do any of the things which the Gentiles themselves disapprove of.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not worthwhile for us to argue with people about our recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some people in certain places think that ball games are not permissible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our testimony is for the Lord, not for a ball game.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our preaching does not testify of a ball game.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not necessary for us to bear witness for a ball game.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our standard must not be lower than the Gentiles' standard.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Unbelievers in some places may think that chess is improper.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In principle, both the game of chess and the game of "Go" a board game are proper, but these things are not our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not need to waste our time giving a sermon on chess.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can play it, and we can give it up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our testimony is for the Lord, not for upholding these minor things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not argue with the unbelievers over these minor things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may do many of the things which they approve of, and we will not do any of the things they do not approve of.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, in certain places fishing may be considered improper.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must accept their view and stop fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our testimony is Christ, not fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have sacrificed everything for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is this little recreation to us?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must not give anyone any uneasy feeling because of our recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Wherever we are, we should not do what others consider to be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our standard must not be lower than the Gentiles' standard, especially when it comes to the matter of recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is foolish for some to argue with others over their recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I know of Western missionaries who had bad relationships with the natives just because they wanted to have their own kind of recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is foolish to damage the Lord's work for the sake of a little recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must pay attention to the major issues and be liberal about the other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some brothers have to work among the Muslims, who do not eat pork.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When they are among them, they may want to eat pork openly because they think that it is all right for Christians to eat pork.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But pork is forbidden in that place.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If they eat pork, they will not be able to work among the people at all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to take care of the work, we must not come into conflict with others over these small matters.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today some may want to go to the province of Sikang.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Fishing is unheard of in Sikang.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The people there have never fished in their whole lives.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is wrong for you to insist on fishing and thus develop friction with the local brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some British missionaries went to India and irritated the Indians over matters of recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not worthwhile to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have laid these nine principles before you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must deal with them carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The usual kinds of entertainment that the Gentiles commonly speak of are out of the question here.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These kinds of recreation include three main categories: dancing, gambling, and movie-going.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They are entirely out of the question for us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are burdened to only present these nine principles on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must not sacrifice these nine principles.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>PROPER RECREATION</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>NOT AFFECTING SPIRITUALITY A. Hopkins's Rabbits and Small Prints</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Finally, let me tell you a simple story.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Keswick Convention is a big gathering in England, a somewhat international conference.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Every year approximately five or six thousand people from all over the world gather there for a week.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I think that God has greatly used these conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Andrew Murray and F. B. Meyer, both of whom had a deep knowledge of the Lord, have been among the speakers at these conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>During this period of time, Stock Meyer was in Germany, Melton was in France, Andrew Murray was in Holland, and Evan Hopkins was in England.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hopkins was known as the Theologian of Keswick.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He was the first person to see the truth of the believers' crucifixion with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He was the husband of Hannah Whitall Smith, the author of The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Mrs. Penn-Lewis would not have been able to propagate the truth of crucifixion with Christ without the help of Hopkins, because Britain could not quite accept a female preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hopkins was a very proper person before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Yet he had a hobby; he loved to draw whenever he was free.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>At first he drew serious subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Later when he had a granddaughter, he began to draw rabbits for her.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When he came back from giving a sermon, he would draw rabbits for his granddaughter.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>During his lifetime, he drew thousands of rabbits.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Later some publishers put out a book on Hopkins's rabbits.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Hopkins was an intelligent man.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He made the face of every rabbit look different.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He also liked to print fine calligraphy.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He wrote the whole of the Lord's prayer on a shilling note.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I am not saying that you should imitate him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I am merely saying this to show you that recreation does not affect one's spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>On the contrary, one touches the human element of a person through his hobbies.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Please remember that God's servants are not staid people; that is Catholicism, not Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Christians are plain, simple, and natural people.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>B. George M ller Praying for Woolen Yarn</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>on Behalf of a Little Girl</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>George M ller was a person who was experienced in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Once a girl named Abigail asked him to pray for colored woolen yarn.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He prayed about this and she received the yarn.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The girl grew up to become one of the best Christians in England.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In reading her biography, one is impressed by the lessons she learned in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Recreation will not drag a person down if it is done properly.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If you keep the proper principle of recreation before the Lord, recreation will uplift you and restore your body and mind to proper health.</S>
