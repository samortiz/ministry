   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE THREEFOLD DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How could we, the created human beings, become the sons of God?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We do not become His sons by adoption but by His begetting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God begot us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order for a person to beget a child, his life needs to be imparted into that child.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This impartation is what we call dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must stress the word dispensing when we speak about the intrinsic significance of Ephesians 1.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Ephesians 1 there is not such a word, but there is such a strong fact.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need the proper terminology to describe the divine facts in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the entire Bible there is not the word Trinity or the title the Triune God, but there is such a fact in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is why the early church fathers came up with these expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have discovered something extraordinary in Ephesians 1.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have seen that the Triune God, for the fulfillment of His intention so that He can be satisfied in His desire, did something wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He dispensed Himself, imparted Himself, into His chosen people, making them all His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John 1 says that Christ gives the believing ones, those who receive Him, the right, the authority, to be the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These children of God are born not of man nor of man's will, but they are born of God directly vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These children born of God are surely God's sons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is God's desire, of which God made an intention, and this intention became His purpose, His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What the New Testament teaches is this economy 1 Tim 1:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is triune to carry out His economy in His threefold dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He carries out His economy in a threefold way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Luke 15 the Lord Jesus gives us three parables to show how a sinner gets saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, there is the parable of a shepherd seeking for a lost sheep; then there is the parable of a woman seeking for a lost coin; and finally there is the parable of a loving father receiving his returned prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These parables depict the threefold grace of the Triune God for a sinner to be received back into the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the New Testament, there are many portions showing us the threefold doing of our Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 2 Corinthians 13:14 Paul speaks of the grace of Christ the Son, the love of God the Father, and the fellowship of God the Spirit being with us all.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, God's presence is with His believers in a threefold way in the way of love, in the way of grace, and in the way of fellowship by His Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ephesians 1 shows that God has blessed the believers with a threefold dispensing first by the Father, second by the Son, and third by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, this dispensing will be carried out by the transmitting of the transcending Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Father's dispensing in His choosing and predestinating issues in many sons to form God's household in sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Son's dispensing in His redeeming and His saving issues in a heritage to God, a treasure to God, as God's private possession.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That means all the many sons who issued from the Father's dispensing will become a treasure to God as His heritage.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God gains us as His possession, His treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then the Spirit's dispensing in His sealing and pledging issues in God as the believers' inheritance unto their perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The issue of God's triune dispensing is the many sons, God's possession, and our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But there is no church until the transcending Christ comes in to transmit the totality of God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The many sons, God's heritage, our inheritance, and the transmitting of the transcending Christ culminate in the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
