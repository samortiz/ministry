   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TRAINING THE SAINTS TO MEET IN THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND TO SUSTAIN THE HOME MEETINGS REGULARLY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My burden is that all the elders and the co-workers would endeavor to do one thing to train our people to take the way of meeting around a table before a tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because the saints are not used to meeting in such a way, we need to train them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I first came to the United States, I was not used to speaking English, but I was eventually forced to.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is always hard for human beings to have a change, and it is easy for them to do things according to their habit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the saints are used to meeting in the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When they are suddenly put into the homes, they do not know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Just by one meeting, they may have immediately become discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They may not like to have the home meetings and want to go back to the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some weaker ones may even think about going back to a denomination for the Sunday service.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, we must endeavor to train the saints to have a change, a transfer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not so easy, but this is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need a lot of practice to do something properly and adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I recently composed a Chinese hymn for a big gospel campaign in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The meeting in which we used that hymn had over fourteen thousand attendants.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I made approximately seventeen changes on my original version before it was printed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a result, it would be hard for anyone to improve this hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not expect that we can change the way from big gatherings to home meetings immediately or easily.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But we have to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must be transferred from one way to another way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many children of Chinese parents in the United States have been transferred out of the old Chinese way of speaking into the new English way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to have a similar transfer in our meeting life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Otherwise, there is no way for the long run to have the church built up properly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You can never have a proper church life built up by big gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Home gatherings are the only way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For the long run, to have the proper church life and to get the proper increase and building up in the churches within the Lord s recovery, we must take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Otherwise, we will be practicing Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever we want to have only big meetings, we are practicing Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Big gatherings are only good for some gifted ones to pass on a word as a message to God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is good, but for the building up of the church in a locality, the only way is to have home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The way of home meetings annuls clergy, swallows up and gives no opening to any ambition, and kills the hierarchy to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The home meetings grind the hierarchy into powder.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more big gatherings you would have, the easier it is to build up hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If there were home meetings in all the Catholic churches, the pope would be brought down and all the bishops, archbishops, and cardinals would be jobless.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some of the elders may be afraid of this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They may wonder how they could control the small groups once the church has been divided into them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They may be afraid that they would lose control.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some of the elders would consider that the way of home meetings gives them a great and hard job to do.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They may wonder how they are going to take care of all the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These elders are experienced, very spiritual, scriptural, honest, and faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They have been faithful to the church life, the church s standing, and they have even sacrificed many things, but suddenly a new way comes in. They may think that with the way of home meetings, the impact is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To come together with three hundred and pray together is to them full of impact, and the amens and hallelujahs are like thunder.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But in the new way each small group does not have more than ten saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Five weaker ones may be meeting in one small group.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When they come together, what could they do or present?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some of the elders may feel that I am forcing them to quit and that they cannot do their job or fulfill their duty.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After we started the home meetings in Taipei, I went to attend a home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When Sister Lee and I arrived, a brother over eighty greeted us and ushered us in. No one else was there for the home meeting except us and the older brother s granddaughter who was arranging the chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At that point, my heart for the home meeting was cooled down.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then the older brother s daughter-in-law came out of the room to play the piano and I was somewhat comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But I wondered where everyone else was.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The meeting was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. and it was already past that time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Later on, a good number of saints came.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They were late because they went out to hunt people.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Gradually one came in and then another with new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I was encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One brother who had come into the church life about thirty years ago told me that he was once backslidden, but he came back through that home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This brother became the leader in this home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He directed the meeting and started the reading of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There were about twenty people there including a brother from a denomination and some new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I considered that meeting as a gospel preaching meeting, an edifying meeting, and a Bible-teaching meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>While Sister Lee and I were leaving after the meeting, another new one came to attend the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The meeting could not end yet because another new one had just arrived.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you want to have a show or something formal, you cannot have the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But if you want the reality for the building up and increase of the church, to catch and recover people in all kinds of conditions, you must have the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The crucial point is that we must train our brothers and sisters to pay the price, to spend everything, to have the home meetings sustained all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Advise them that if they do not have time, it is better to miss some big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But they should never miss the home gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The home gatherings should be held regularly at least once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Do not change the time.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Have the home meeting on the same day every week in a certain home.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then that home could let all their relatives, friends, neighbors, classmates, and colleagues know that in their home on a certain evening every week there is a Christian gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Something will be built up and different people will all come.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I say again, we must train the saints to spend everything to sustain such a meeting regularly, all year round.</S>
