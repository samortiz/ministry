<p>Different teachings produce questionings, but the teachings that minister Christ do not cause questionings. The teaching of the law was according to the Old Testament and was therefore scriptural, yet it was different from God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, which is to dispense Christ as the life supply to God&rsquo;s children that the church might be built up. Although teaching the law is according to the Scriptures, it is different from God&rsquo;s economy, and it therefore produces questionings rather than building up the church. When the law is taught, questions may be stirred up regarding matters such as the keeping of the Sabbath, circumcision, and diet. However, when we minister only Christ to God&rsquo;s people, there are no questions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Recent Questionings in the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery<br />
Being Produced by Different Teachings</h2>
<p>The Lord brought His recovery to the United States in 1962. For more than ten years, nothing but Christ for the church was ministered here, and there were no questionings. In the past few years the enemy has crept in with dissenting, distracting talk of different ways, producing questions. Certain churches have been in confusion as a result of different teachings and the questionings they produce. For example, some have taught that the saints do not need to go to the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meetings. They say that whoever goes to the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meetings is religious.</p>
<p>Life is mysterious and profound, but the experience of life is always simple. The most crucial matters of life are the simplest. For example, nothing is as simple as breathing. Christ is mysterious and profound, but to experience Christ is simple. We do not need to be complicated by considerations of whether or not we should do certain things or go to certain places. We need to forget about teachings that are different from God&rsquo;s economy and experience Christ in a simple way. We should care only for God&rsquo;s economy, that is, for Christ being ministered and dispensed into our being. We should not care for any other thought, concept, idea, or opinion. We should reject any teaching other than God&rsquo;s economy. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we do not care for anything other than Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not the recovery of certain concepts or of so-called good meetings. Also, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not the recovery of excitement. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the recovery of Christ. Our meetings should minister Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Economy Being Christ as the Vine</h2>
<p>We need to experience Christ in our daily life. We need to live by Him, live Him, and live Him out. Every day we need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, You are one with me. You are my life and my person. I am one with You. Lord, You are God&rsquo;s economy. You are the vine, and we are the branches.&rdquo; The branches in the vine simply live. But they do not live themselves; they live the vine, grow the vine, and produce the vine. This is God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>In John 15:1 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman.&rdquo; God the Father is a farmer, and His economy is to grow a universal vine that includes Christ and all the believers. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is for God&rsquo;s economy. Christians today are divided according to different teachings, concepts, ways, activities, and organizations. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we reject these things. We have nothing but Christ. Our &ldquo;dictionary&rdquo; has only one word&mdash;<em>Christ.</em> To this word we would add a footnote&mdash;<em>and the church.</em> We care only for Christ and the church.</p>
<p>We need to come back to Christ and take the simple way of life. God&rsquo;s economy is Christ for the church. Christ is within us. As branches in the vine, we simply need to be one with Him and live Him. Christ is our life, our person, and our everything. He is our life necessity. We do not need to care for any concept. We need to care only for Christ and to live Him. Whatever He does, we do. Wherever He goes, we go. This is to live Christ. As the unique life necessity, Christ is the One we need to experience for the church life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Healthy Word &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
