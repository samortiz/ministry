   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE NINETY-SIX THE SHIFTINGS OF THE BIRTHRIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE SCRIPTURE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Genesis is a book of seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message, a parenthesis in our life-study, we shall consider another one of these seeds the seed of the shifting of the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Perhaps you have never imagined that the birthright could be shifted.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The birthright is the special portion of the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In nearly every race of people, especially in ancient times, the firstborn in a family inherited a special portion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Among the ancient Jews, this portion was usually a double portion of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the Bible as a whole, the birthright includes the double portion of the land, the kingship, and the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The priesthood brings people to God, and the kingship brings God to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The book of Genesis reveals that this birthright can be shifted from the firstborn son to the second son.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this book there are at least four cases of the shifting of the birthright: from Esau to Jacob 25:22-26, 29-34 ; from Zarah to Pharez 38:27-30 ; from Reuben to Joseph 49:3-4; 1 Chron 5:1 ; and from Manasseh to Ephraim 48:12-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, in the New Testament the birthright is shifted from Israel to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Luke chapter fifteen the Lord Jesus indicates by means of the parable of the prodigal son that the publicans and sinners are like the second son, and that the self-righteous Pharisees are like the first son Luke 15:1-2, 11, 25-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, in Matthew 21:28-32 the Lord shifts the birthright from the Jews to the publicans and harlots.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here the Lord reveals that the publicans and harlots are like the firstborn son who at first did not obey his father's word but later repented and obeyed it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then the Lord likened the Pharisees to the second son who said that he would fulfill his father's word, but who actually did not obey it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Originally, the Jews were the first son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the beginning of the Lord's ministry, they were still first.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But at the end of His ministry, the Lord Jesus shifted the birthright from the Jews to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His word in Matthew 21:28-32 was spoken at the end of His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In these verses the Lord likened the publicans and the harlots to the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church is composed of redeemed and regenerated sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In God's economy they are the ones who have received the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, Hebrews 12:23 speaks of the church of the firstborn.</S>
