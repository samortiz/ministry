   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE 15 Scripture Reading: Phil 4:8 THE REST OF THE APOSTLE'S TEACHING CONCERNING LIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul's teaching in the book of Philippians is concerning our living of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After much teaching concerning the main aspect of his subject, in 4:8 he says, "For the rest, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is righteous, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is well spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The phrase "for the rest" indicates that, though Paul has already written nearly four chapters, he still has more to say.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is still burdened to speak something further, but he does not have the time or the convenient way to finish his speaking, so he says, "For the rest."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The other items he mentions in verse 8 are simply the outline of his further word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He does not give very many details, but he gives an outline comprising eight points.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These points include: whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is righteous, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is well spoken of, any virtue, and any praise.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>BEING TRUE, HONORABLE, RIGHTEOUS, PURE, AND LOVELY</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, you must be a true person involved with true things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then, you must be a person who deals with honorable things, not touching anything dishonorable.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You also must be a person who is right in every way with God and with man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You also must be a person who is pure, only touching pure things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With the people of God, purity means much more than it does to the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To the unbelievers, whether something is pure or not is of little concern.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But God's people must be pure in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As a child of God, you also must be lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This does not mean that you must be beautiful in outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, it means that all the things you touch should be lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a person you may be lovely, but the things you touch daily may not be so lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the world, there are many lovely persons, but the clothing they wear and the places they go are absolutely not lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>BEING WELL SPOKEN OF</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As Christians we also must be well spoken of.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Ephesians 1:3 the word "blessed" means to be well spoken of.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God speaks well of us having blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the Devil, Satan, would never speak well of us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>So, we must realize that to be well-spoken of is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Matthew 5:11 the Lord Jesus said that the persecutors would say every evil thing against the believers, lying.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These evil things that are spoken about the believers are fabricated things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These fabricated things always have a little bit of truth in them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Though we may not have a good name because we are evil spoken of by our opposers and persecutors, we must try our best to touch only the things which can be well spoken of.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>VIRTUE AND PRAISE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the end of Philippians 4:8, Paul concludes with two items that sum up the points mentioned in the earlier part of the verse.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These two items are virtue and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The phrase "if there is any virtue and if any praise" is difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The word "praise" here does not refer to our praise of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, it refers to others' praise toward us concerning the things we do which are worthy of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The word "virtue" in English usage denotes the inner energy to do good things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Luke 8:44-46 KJV when the woman touched the border of the Lord's garment, virtue went out from Him to heal her.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This virtue was the power or strength to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But in Philippians 4:8, the meaning of virtue is different.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Virtue here means excellent behavior or conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You may have good conduct, but unless it is the best, it cannot be considered virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Virtue is conduct on the highest level.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you have this kind of excellent conduct, whatever you do will be praised by others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First, there is excellent conduct or virtue, then there is praise by others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you are a person with all of these eight items, you are a person with good character, a person with excellent characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Each of the items mentioned here is a characteristic, and these characteristics are your very expression.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Your expression to people is your character.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Character is your disposition expressed in an outward form.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Inwardly, you have your disposition, and outwardly, you have your character.</S>
