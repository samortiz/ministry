<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Preeminent One in Both<br>God's Old Creation and God's New Creation</H2><P>Christ is the preeminent One in both God's old creation and God's new creation (Col. 1:15-18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Head and All the Members of the Body<br>and the One Who Is in All the Members of the Body</H2><P>Colossians 1:18a and 3:10-11 reveal that Christ is the Head of the Body, all the members of the Body, and the One who is in all the members of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Life of the Believers</H2><P>Christ is the life of the believers (Col. 3:4), who is revealed into the believers (Gal. 1:16), who lives in and with the believers (Gal. 2:20), who is formed in the believers (Gal. 4:19), who makes His home in the believers (Eph. 3:17), to the glorious image of whom as the firstborn Son of God the believers as the many sons of God are transformed (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29), and whom the believers live and magnify through the bountiful supply of His Spirit (Phil. 1:19-21). There is no comparison between Paul's word and James's word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. The Need to Experience<br>Such a Marvelous Christ</H2><P>Without experiencing such a Christ, how can a believer have the genuine Christian perfection, which is the issue of a life lived not by the natural life of the believer but by such a marvelous Christ who lives in him?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. The Defect in James's Presentation of Christ</H2><P>The above portrait of Christ also shows the defect in James's presentation of Christ.</P>
