<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE REALITY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>When we touch the Spirit, we touch Christ; when we contact the Spirit, we contact Christ. The Spirit is the reality of Christ. Christ is joy, peace, comfort, rest, life, and light, and the reality of joy, peace, comfort, rest, life, and light is the Spirit. The Spirit is the reality of all that Christ is; hence, the Spirit is the Spirit of reality. We can enjoy all that Christ is in a real way only by touching the Spirit.</p>
<p>John 16:13-15 says, &ldquo;When He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming. He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you. All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you.&rdquo; The Bible reveals at least two hundred items of the riches of Christ, but if these riches were not in the Spirit, they would be merely empty doctrines. We must touch the Spirit in order to enjoy Christ, because all of Christ is in the Spirit. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ (Col. 2:9). All that the Father has is the Son&rsquo;s, and all that the Son has is received by the Spirit. Now the Spirit declares and reveals these riches to us by guiding us into all of Christ&rsquo;s reality. Therefore, the Spirit is the reality of Christ. We can touch the reality of all that Christ is only through the Spirit. Without the Spirit, we have no way to touch the reality of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Since the Spirit is the transfiguration of Christ and the reality of Christ, the Spirit is the Spirit of Christ. Romans 8:9 says, &ldquo;You are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.&rdquo; In this verse <em>the Spirit of God</em> and <em>the Spirit of Christ</em> are used interchangeably, indicating that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ. The Spirit of God who dwells in us is the Spirit of Christ, the transfiguration of Christ. When we have the Spirit of Christ, we have Christ, because the Spirit is Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE LORD SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:17-18 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit...But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; Verse 17 says that the Lord is the Spirit, meaning that the Lord and the Spirit are one; thus, the Spirit is also called the Lord Spirit. The Lord Spirit transforms the believers into the same image as the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING LIVING WATER</h2>
<p>John 7:38-39 says, &ldquo;Out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive.&rdquo; The Spirit who is within the believers is not only the reality of Christ. The Spirit is also living water for the believers to drink in order to quench their thirst. First Corinthians 12:13 says that we were all given to drink one Spirit. We can drink the Spirit. According to verse 4 of chapter 10, in the wilderness the Israelites drank the same spiritual drink, which is the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE ANOINTING OINTMENT</h2>
<p>The Spirit within us is living water and also the anointing ointment (1 John 2:27). On the one hand, the Spirit quenches our thirst because He is living water, and on the other hand, He soothes and refreshes us because He is the anointing.</p>
