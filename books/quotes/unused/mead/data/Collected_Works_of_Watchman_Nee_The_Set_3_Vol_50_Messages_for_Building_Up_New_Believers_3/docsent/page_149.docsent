   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Others Feeling Indignant</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord did not preach to him at all.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He simply said, "Hurry and come down, for today I must stay in your house."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Zaccheus heard this, he received the Lord with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When some of the people around saw this, they were indignant.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"How could Jesus of Nazareth go to this man's house?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He could have gone to any house but this one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even if He were ignorant about this man, His disciples should have investigated and found out that Zaccheus is not an upright man and does not have a good reputation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why would they not tell their teacher this?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everyone knew what kind of person Zaccheus was.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everyone knew his background.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When they heard the Lord's word, they all murmured in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>D. Wherever the Lord Goes, Money Is Released</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our point here is that the Lord did not preach to Zaccheus at all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He only said one word, "Today I must stay in your house."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One word was good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even though He was not yet in Zaccheus's house, His word was powerful enough.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Wherever the Lord goes, money is released.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Wherever He goes, wealth is released.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Wherever He goes, the love of money goes away.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It seems as if the Lord was saying, "As long as I can visit this house, everything will be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For Me just saying that I must stay in this house is as powerful as Me actually being in the house."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The words took effect.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The few words "I must stay" took effect, and something happened.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>E. One Word Stripped Zaccheus's House</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How can we prove that something happened?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When Zaccheus heard these words, immediately he stood and said, "Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much" Luke 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This word means that his whole house was stripped.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One word from the Lord Jesus stripped Zaccheus's house of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>V. WHAT IS IMPOSSIBLE WITH MEN</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>BEING POSSIBLE WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord exhorted the young ruler, yet the young ruler did not make it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord did not exhort Zaccheus, yet he made it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Both were rich men.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The rich man in Luke 18 was young, while the one in chapter nineteen was old.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to common sense, an old man should be stingy with money while a young man should be generous with it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But what we have here is something very different.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One case points to the impossibility with men, while the other case points to the possibility with God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not skip over this matter lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not easy to sell everything and to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Who can give up all of his possessions?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A man has to be crazy to give up everything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But Zaccheus's story tells us that what is impossible with men is possible with God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Zaccheus did this without any teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord did not tell him what to do, yet he did it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What we have here is a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It shows us how easy this thing can be done.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE CAMEL GOING THROUGH</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As soon as God does something, the camel will go through the eye of the needle.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You should tell new believers that in Luke 18 there was a camel who hesitated before the eye of a needle and who turned around after looking at it for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Yet in Luke 19 there was another camel who went through the eye of the needle.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Please remember that what is impossible with men is possible with God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Chapter eighteen tells us that with men it is impossible, while chapter nineteen tells us that with God it is possible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you turn to the Lord, things will happen in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Your problems will be solved in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Humanly speaking, selling all that one has is madness, but this matter was settled in an instant.</S>
