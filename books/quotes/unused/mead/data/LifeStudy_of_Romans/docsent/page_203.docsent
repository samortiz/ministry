   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There may be differences not only among believers in a local church but also between local churches themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, the church in one locality may practice pray-reading, but the church in another locality may not practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you visit a church that differs in practice from the church in your locality, do not try to correct it or to change anything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Wherever you are, you should simply be one with the church in that place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As long as it is a local church, you need to go along with it without imposing or opposing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I admit that it is easy to talk about this but that it is difficult to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nevertheless, we all must be willing to learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we shall have not only the doctrine of the Body in Romans 12, but also the practice of the Body life in Romans 14.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A MATTER OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Romans 14:17 says, For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to this verse, the kingdom of God is a matter of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As long as we have righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit, we should not be concerned about differences in doctrine or practice.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE LOCALITY OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Romans 16:1 says, I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a deaconess of the church which is at Cenchrea.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This verse discloses a second aspect of the practicality of the Body life: the matter of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we would have the Body life in a practical way, we must not only receive the believers, but also pay attention to the church in the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to Romans 16, the practicality of the Body life consists in the locality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This chapter speaks not only of the local church, the church at Cenchrea, but also of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verse 4 Paul makes mention of the churches of the nations and in verse 16, of the churches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>SHOWING HOSPITALITY TO THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 23 Paul says, Gaius, my host, and of the whole church, greets you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here Paul names a brother who provided hospitality to the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Obviously, Paul is speaking of the local church, not of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is important that Paul points out that Gaius was the host of the whole church, not of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is a difference between showing hospitality to the church and showing hospitality to the saints, for we may care for the saints without caring for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But Paul s concept in this book is related not mainly to the saints, but to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In our giving of hospitality, the church must be in our consciousness and concept.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As you extend hospitality to others, what concept do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you hold the concept that you are providing hospitality to the saints or to the church?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you have the proper concept, you will realize that your hospitality is not simply to certain saints, but to the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE CHURCH IN THE HOUSE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In verse 5 Paul sends greetings to the church in the house of Prisca and Aquila.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Using this verse as a basis, some say that the church in a house is different from the church in a city.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, if you consider this matter carefully in context, you will see that the church in the house of Prisca and Aquila was actually the church in the city of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church in Rome held its meetings in Prisca and Aquila s house.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we would have the proper practice of the Body life today, we must be general in receiving all kinds of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As long as a person genuinely believes in the Lord Jesus, we must receive him, even though his opinion may differ from ours with respect to doctrine or practice.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, we need to be in a local church and honor the locality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How I thank the Lord for chapter sixteen!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this chapter the Holy Spirit clearly indicates that for the practice of the Body life, we need to be the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Wherever we may be, we must be in the church in that locality.</S>
