   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE THE TRANSFER OF THE REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>INTO ITS MANIFESTATION Scripture Reading: Matt 24:30; 13:39b-43; Rev 14:1-5, 14-16; 3:10; 12:5-6; Exo 23:19a; Lev 23:22</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the Lord Jesus returns, He will reckon with all His servants.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those who have been faithful will be commended and rewarded, but those who have been unfaithful will suffer a loss and a punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What the unfaithful ones had received from the Lord will be taken from them and given to others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are not faithful to the Lord today, when He reckons with us at His coming back, we will lose what we received as a gift from Him; we will miss the marriage feast and the joy of reigning with the Lord as co-kings for a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In addition, we will experience some chastisement, some punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is according to the pure Word of the Lord in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all must take this as a clear and sober warning to be faithful to the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we abuse His grace today, we will suffer at His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have already pointed out that the kingdom has three aspects: the reality, the appearance, and the manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now we need to see that the manifestation of the kingdom is simply the transfer of the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the next age, the reality of the kingdom will become the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What will happen to the appearance of the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the time of the transfer of the reality of the kingdom into the manifestation of the kingdom, the appearance of the kingdom will be burned away.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During this present age, the reality of the kingdom and the appearance of the kingdom progress at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But when the Lord Jesus comes back, His angels will bind all the tares into bundles and cast them into the fire Matt 13:41-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The tares will have done much damage to the Lord's kingdom, and He will be very angry and disgusted with them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, at His coming back He will deal first with the appearance of the kingdom by binding it and putting it into the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then He will transfer the reality of the kingdom into the next age to become the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now we need to see how the Lord will accomplish such a transfer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By referring once again to the chart on pages 338-339, which shows the difference between the kingdom of the heavens and the kingdom of God, you can see that the kingdom of God is composed of six sections.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here we are dealing only with the fourth and fifth sections.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the innermost section of the fourth circle is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This circle is enclosed by another larger circle which represents the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the Lord Jesus comes back, He will bind the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens and throw it into the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That will terminate the appearance of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While the fourth section, the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, will be terminated, the reality of the kingdom will be transferred into the next section, the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After being transferred there, the reality of the kingdom will become the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
