   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 14 DAY 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 18:15-20</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>15 Moreover if your brother sins against you, go, 1 reprove him 2 between you and him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If he hears you, you have gained your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>16 But if he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>17 And if he refuses to hear them, 1 tell it to the 2 church; and if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you 3 just like the Gentile and the tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>18 Truly I say to you, Whatever you 1 bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you 1 loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>19 Again, truly I say to you that if two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they 1 ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>20 For where there are 1 two or three 2 gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>15 1 That he may know his sin and confess his wrongdoing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>15 2 That no third party may know the wrongdoing of the sinning brother.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a covering of love.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>17 1 If a brother sins against us, we need to deal with him first in love v. 15 , then by two or three witnesses v. 16 , and finally through the church with authority v. 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>17 2 The church revealed in 16:18 is the universal church, which is the unique Body of Christ, whereas the church revealed here is the local church, the expression of the unique Body of Christ in a certain locality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Chapter 16 concerns the building of the universal church, whereas this chapter concerns the practice of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In both of its aspects the church represents the kingdom of the heavens, having authority to bind and to loose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>17 3 If any believer refuses to hear the church, he will lose the fellowship of the church and will be like the Gentile the heathen and the tax collector the sinner , who are outside the fellowship of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>18 1 Here to bind means to condemn, and to loose means to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>19 1 Strictly, ask here refers to prayer that deals with the brother who refuses to hear the church v. 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>20 1 These two or three are the two or three in v. 16.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are gathered together into the Lord's name, but they are not the church; for v. 17 says that if there is some problem, they need to tell it to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>20 2 The meetings of the believers are initiated by the Lord, who calls the believers out of all persons, matters, and things that occupy them and gathers them together into His name to enjoy the riches of His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a gathering of a few people, of two or three, implies one of the ways for the church to meet locally.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such meetings of a few people must have been held in the believers' homes, as mentioned in Acts 2:46 and 5:42, for the purpose of prayer Matt 18:19; Acts 12:5, 12 , fellowship, the breaking of bread, teaching, or the preaching of the gospel Acts 2:42; 5:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many such meetings may be held separately in the same locality, yet they are still the unique church in that locality Matt 18:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Otherwise, they are not separate meetings but divisions, and they become sects Gal 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church must remove fornicators and idolaters 1 Cor 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the offending brother who will not listen to two or three or to the church may not necessarily require removal .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although the situation with him is unpleasant, it is not in the same category as fornication or idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is cut off from the fellowship of the church in order that this loss of fellowship may encourage him to repent and to recover his fellowship with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Life-study of Matthew, p.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>609</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
