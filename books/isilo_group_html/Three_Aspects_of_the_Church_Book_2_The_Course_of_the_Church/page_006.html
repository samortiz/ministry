<h1 class="title">THE SPREADING OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>The church was not only hidden in God in eternity past; it was also revealed in time, produced at Pentecost, and spread on the earth.</p>
<p>The spreading of the church not only took place in time, but it also occurred on the earth. After the church was produced at Pentecost, it has been constantly spreading for the past two thousand years and has spread everywhere.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is that there would be a church in the universe; He does not want the church to be in only one locality. In other words, the church that God wants is a church in the whole universe and not simply a church in one place. Even though the church has representative manifestations in many different localities, it is universal, not local. Thus, when the church was produced on the day of Pentecost, even though it was produced in Jerusalem, its nature was not merely that of the church in Jerusalem. The church is universal, not only in Jerusalem. The church was produced in Jerusalem, but it could not be kept in Jerusalem. The church was produced in Jerusalem, but it did not grow only in Jerusalem. The church can be produced in one place, but it is impossible to continue the church in one place forever and force it to grow only there. Because the church is universal, it must not only be produced, but it must also spread. The church is universal, so it must spread.</p>
<p>Both the cross and the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation at Bethlehem have a universal impact. Although the Lord was born in Bethlehem, His birth was not merely for Bethlehem. The incarnation was not local; it was for the universe. The church is the same; even though it was produced in Jerusalem, it is for more than Jerusalem alone. The church is for the whole universe; it is eternal, and it transcends time and space. The church can appear in time and in a certain place, but it is not merely in time and of that place. The church transcends time and place; the church is universal.</p>
<p>Therefore, if a local church does not spread, the nature of that church is too low, and it will lose its universal and eternal character. In principle, the church must spread, and the faster, the farther, and the more it spreads, the better. But when we speak of the spread of the church, we must be careful. This spreading is not promoted by human methods, nor is it worked out by human hands. The spreading of the church is brought about by the growth in the Lord&rsquo;s life. On man&rsquo;s side, the church cannot grow quickly, and we should not be greedy for speed. However, on God&rsquo;s side, the church must spread. Not long after the church in Jerusalem was raised up, God caused His children to be scattered to various places by persecution.</p>
<p>The spreading of the church can break through many barriers and eliminate many undesirable practices. In many places where the church is raised up, however, the saints may be narrow-minded. This was the case in Jerusalem. They had many Old Testament traditions and teachings that caused them to close themselves off from others. If we were to say that there was a people on the earth who were closed and sealed up, we would say it was the Jews. They sealed themselves up and despised other people; moreover, they did not communicate with others.</p>
<p>Peter was the top apostle who saw the vision of the mystery of God and heard the prophecies of the mystery of Christ. Despite the fact that he received the revelation, he almost brought the church into the limitations of Judaism. In Peter&rsquo;s mind the church belonged to Jerusalem and to the Jews and should not go to the Gentile lands or to the Gentile people; however, the church had to spread. When the church begins to spread, erroneous concepts are shattered, regardless of whether the concepts are regional, racial, or mutually discriminatory. When the church begins to spread, concepts are smashed and cease to exist.</p>
<p>We must apply these points to ourselves; I am afraid that we still have many regional concepts. We anxiously expect a spiritual rain to fall on our locality. It does not matter to us when other localities are in the middle of a great drought as long as our locality has the autumn and spring rains. We do not seem to be concerned in the least whether meetings in other localities are living. Our concern is only that our locality would have the Lord&rsquo;s presence. It is very difficult to break through this kind of local concept and regional thinking.</p>
<p>It is possible for us to even come together to seek the Lord&rsquo;s will, kneeling in prayer, saying, &ldquo;O Lord, Your will be done among us as it is in heaven. We truly want to let You be the Head and to allow You to reign among us.&rdquo; Such a prayer seems very spiritual, but after we sit down and begin to discuss where to send the brothers to work, someone might suggest, &ldquo;Let us transfer Brother So-and-so from Taichung to Kaohsiung because he really knows how to serve and is very gifted.&rdquo; After this suggestion, however, the responsible brothers from Taichung would strongly react and say, &ldquo;If you are going to do that, Taichung should close its doors.&rdquo; On the other side, the leading brothers from Kaohsiung would be ecstatic and joyful, and they would be full of praise to the Lord because they had been praying for this and would feel that the Lord answered their prayers.</p>
<p>If we have such situations in the church, how can the church progress and spread? Because it is not easy to break through the regional concepts within people, the church needs to spread even more. It is through spreading that all our close-mindedness is eliminated. The New Testament shows that not long after the church in Jerusalem was raised up, God seemed to throw a huge stone into her midst; it seemed like a big &ldquo;bomb,&rdquo; scattering the saints by its impact and forcing them to leave Jerusalem. God intervened because the church is neither of the Jews nor of Jerusalem; the church is universal.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 2, The Course of the Church &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
