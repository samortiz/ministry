<h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Chang Tze-jieh,<br />Tsingtao, Shantung</h2><p>There are many new ones in our meetings now. The meeting hall cannot hold them all. Seven or eight have confessed the Lord since the Chinese New Year conference. We thank the Lord because almost every day people seek us out to ask questions about the truth! Praise the Lord! He gives us unexpected joy. Since Tsingtao passed through the war, I receive new light when I read the Bible. My prayer is also much sweeter. Every time I mention the name Jesus, I feel so sweet, and I feel that the Lord is so close to me. I thank the Lord not just for the new believers but also for new co-workers. Brother Ju Fu-sheng came here from An-Dong. He and his wife are both nurses. Sister Ju was saved less than two weeks after coming to Tsingtao. Brother Ju also received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. We prayed to the Lord in one accord for a person who had been sick for eighteen years. He had wanted to come to Shantung to do other things, but now he has decided to serve the Lord. There is one other matter concerning myself. The Lord definitely wants me to work in the remote regions. When Brother Hsu Jung-jieh came to Tsingtao from Tsinan, his first words were, "Brother, I hope you will go, too." Later, I told Brother Hsu that I wanted to go to the northeastern border near Russia. When Brother Hsu left, his last words were, "Brother, I'll be waiting for you there." May the Lord lead my way. I really would like to fly there now.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Tze-jieh<br />March 23<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Duan Chai-ju,<br />Kansu Province</h2><p>Four sisters came from Sian to Kansu to preach the gospel recently. Several brothers came also. Several days ago, they had a meeting in a home in Huo-Shih-Chun with much blessing from the Lord. On March 10 they held a home meeting in Gan-Gu. Many brothers and sisters were touched and burdened for the outreach missionary work. May the Lord give us strength to do His work. I will not go west until this work is finished and will go to Tsinghai when I have the Lord's clear leading. I hope X will often send me letters of encouragement and instruction.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Duan Chai-ju<br />March 5<br />[Address omitted]</p>
