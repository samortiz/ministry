   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-SEVEN RECEIVING AND ENJOYING THE GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE LORD IN OUR SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gal 6:18, 1; 1:6; 2:21; 5:4; John 1:14, 16-17; Heb 10:29b; 4:16 PEACE AND GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul ends the book of Galatians in this way: The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the beginning of this Epistle, Paul said, Grace to you and peace from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But at the end Paul speaks first of peace 6:16 and then of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 6:16 Paul says, And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to this verse, peace is upon those who walk by this rule.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The rule here is that of sowing unto the Spirit to live the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we walk by this rule, peace will be upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Israel of God consists of those who walk by this rule.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, all who live the new creation by sowing unto the Spirit are the true Israel of God, and peace is upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul s use of the preposition upon implies that peace rains upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Peace rains upon the real Israel of God, upon those who walk by the rule of living a new creation by sowing unto the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is bestowing peace upon His real Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 6:17 Paul goes on to say, For the rest let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the brands of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here Paul seems to be saying, I am enjoying peace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As far as anything else is concerned, do not trouble me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have just one goal, and that is to walk by this rule.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because I m a part of the true Israel of God, peace is bestowed upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am under the rain of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not speak to me about the law, circumcision, or the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the rest, do not trouble me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why at the beginning of Galatians does Paul mention grace before peace and at the ending speak of peace before grace?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Grace is God as our enjoyment, and peace is a condition which results from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, at the beginning we first have grace, then peace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But once we enter by grace into a condition of peace both with God vertically and with others horizontally, we need grace to keep us in such a peaceful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>GRACE WITH OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to 6:18, the grace we enjoy is the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, Paul points out that this grace is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the book of Galatians Paul refers to the human spirit only in chapter six.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 6:1 he says, Brothers, if ever a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The spirit here is the regenerated human spirit indwelt by and mingled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The fact that Paul mentions the human spirit both at the beginning and at the ending of chapter six indicates that this chapter deals mainly with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not know our human spirit, which has been regenerated by the Holy Spirit, we have no way to enjoy Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may use the practical application of electricity as an illustration of this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although electricity has been installed in your home, you still need to use the switch to turn it on.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you do not know where the switch is, you will have no way to experience the benefit of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The heavenly electricity has been installed in us, and our human spirit is the switch by which we may apply it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ the heavenly electricity is with our spirit, the switch.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 6:18 Paul does not say that the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with our mind, emotion, or will.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He clearly and definitely tells us that this grace is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do you know the location of your spirit, mind, emotion, and will and the difference between them?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We know that we have all these faculties, but it is difficult to define them or to locate them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From our experience we have discovered these different aspects of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we are happy or angry, we are exercising the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we make a decision, we use our will.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we think, we obviously use our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When a husband and wife are arguing, they may express their heated emotion, use their mind to present their case, and exercise their will to make decisions concerning the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But as they are arguing, something deep within may tell them to settle down and be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is not the mind, the emotion, or the will.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is the spirit, the leading part of which is the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whenever the conscience works, the spirit is functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In other words, your spirit works primarily through your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The point here is that we have a faculty within us in addition to the mind, emotion, and will, and this faculty is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to the Bible, the function of the spirit is to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we heard the gospel, we repented of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Repentance involves the exercise of our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the light of the truth was allowed to shine through our mind into our conscience, our conscience caused us to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, repentance involves the exercise of the leading part of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although we probably did not realize it at the time, when we were saved, we exercised our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In addition to repenting, we prayed to the Lord and called on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We may have said, O Lord Jesus, You are my Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I thank You for dying on the cross for my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Lord, I love You, and I take You as my Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we prayed in this way, exercising faith in the Lord, the Spirit of God came into our spirit and regenerated it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At the time we were saved, our spirit was exercised to repent and to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>From that time onward, the Spirit has been dwelling in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Hence, the spirit is the place within us where we contact God, for it is here that the processed Triune God dwells as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Often when we begin to pray, we are in our mind or emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But gradually we pray ourselves into the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then we have the sense that we are meeting the Lord and that we and He are one.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>No words can describe how good it is to be one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>How enjoyable this is!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This enjoyment brings in the assurance that the Triune God is real.</S>
