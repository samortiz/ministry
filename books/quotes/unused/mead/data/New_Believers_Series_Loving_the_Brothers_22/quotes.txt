[1]  LOVING THE BROTHERS Scripture Reading: John 5:24; 1 John 3:14
[2]  Suppose you have many friends and you like them very much, or you admire many people and respect them very much.
[3]  There is still a difference between your feelings toward them and your feelings toward the brothers and sisters in your own family.
[4]  First John 4:7-8 says, "Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and everyone who loves has been begotten of God and knows God.
[5]  First John 3:10 says, "In this the children of God...are manifest.
[6]  Everyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, neither he who does not love his brother."
[7]  In the same way, he who does not have an inward love for his brother is not of God.
[8]  This love does not refer to ordinary love but to the love with which one loves his brothers.
[9]  Concerning the fornicator in 1 Corinthians 5:13, Paul said, "Remove the evil man from among yourselves."
[10]  At the beginning Paul delivered such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh in the name of the Lord Jesus and with the power of the Lord Jesus because the Corinthians did not do anything to cast him out.
[11]  First John 4:20-21 says, "If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen.
[12]  He said, "How does the love of God abide in him?" because the love of God is the love of the brothers, and the love of the brothers is the love of God.
[13]  First John 3:16 says, "In this we know love, that He laid down His life on our behalf."
[14]  First John 4:16 says, "God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God and God abides in him."
[15]  Verses 17 and 18 say, "In this has love been perfected with us, that we have boldness in the day of the judgment...There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear."
