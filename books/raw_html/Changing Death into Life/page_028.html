<h1 class="title">THE NEED OF THE THIRSTY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 7:2, 14, 37-39</h1>
<p>John 7:2, 14, and 37 through 39 say, &ldquo;The Jews&rsquo; Feast of Tabernacles was near...When it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach...Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fourth kind of people whom the Lord Jesus contacted on the earth was the hungry. Now we will consider the fifth kind of people whom the Lord Jesus contacted, the thirsty. In John 7 the thirsty people indicate that human life is a life of thirst.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HUMAN LIFE BEING THIRSTY</h2>
<p>Both thirst and hunger speak of man&rsquo;s need. Thirst, however, is more unbearable than hunger. People can bear hunger for a period of time, but it is difficult to bear thirst. Hence, after telling us how the Lord Jesus met the need of the hungry, the Bible tells us how He met the need of the thirsty. The Lord Jesus is the Lord of life, and He is able to meet the needs of all kinds of people.</p>
<p>In order to portray the thirst of human life, in this portion of the Scriptures a group of people are selected to represent all those who thirst. This group of people was religious, and they were celebrating a religious feast. They were Jews; they believed in the unique true God. They were not atheists, nor were they without a religion. These people were in Judaism and were celebrating the Feast of Tabernacles. The children of Israel held seven feasts every year, the last of which was the Feast of Tabernacles (cf. Lev. 23). In most nations a feast typically lasts two to three days, but the Feast of Tabernacles lasted eight days. It was a long feast. It was the greatest feast, and it was the final feast of the year. Therefore, the people in this feast should have been the most joyful people. However, the Lord Jesus cried out, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink&rdquo; (John 7:37). This means that the people were still thirsty. They were still dissatisfied in their human life. If those who should have been full of joy were still thirsty, who is not thirsty? If they were dissatisfied in their human life, can anyone be satisfied in his human life? Everyone is thirsty and dissatisfied in his human life. Even the most noble and joyful people are thirsty and dissatisfied.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE JOY OF THE HUMAN LIFE HAVING AN END</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus cried out on the last and great day of the feast. The last day of the greatest and final feast of the year was the greatest day of the feast; hence, this day was the most joyful day of the feast. This greatest and most joyful day, however, was the last day of the feast; it also was the last day of all the feasts. When this day was over, all the feasts of the year were over. When the joy of this day was over, the joy of the year was over.</p>
<p>A feast is a time of joy, and it signifies a joyful moment in human life. Therefore, the last day of the feast signifies the end of the joy of human life. There is a limit and an end to the joy of human life. No matter how much joy there may be, every kind of joy in human life comes to an end. There is a common Chinese saying: &ldquo;A good scene does not last.&rdquo; When someone reaches a peak in his human life, he has reached the last day.</p>
<p>Everything has a last day. Some people study diligently in college for many years and are joyful on the day of their graduation. But they eventually find that there is a last day to the joy of graduation. At the beginning of a wonderful marriage both the husband and the wife are full of joy, but this joy has a last day. The joy in a wonderful family reaches a last day when there is a death. The joy of possessing a prosperous business reaches a last day when the business fails. The joy of living a long life comes to an end when we die. A beautiful garment also has a last day. The last day is related to thirst. People are thirsty because everything in human life has a last day. When the last day comes, people&rsquo;s joy ends. When the last day comes, the thirst in human life begins. When the joy of human life comes to an end, people immediately feel thirsty.</p>
<p>The joy of human life, the enjoyment of human life, and the blessing of human life all have a last day. The greater the joy, the stronger the sense of thirst will be on the last day. For this reason, the Lord Jesus did not speak of being thirsty until the last day of the feast. The feast lasted eight days. The first two days were the beginning of the feast when everyone was excited; no one felt thirsty. The third and fourth days were in the middle of the feast when still no one felt thirsty. By the fifth and sixth days, however, people began to realize that the feast would soon be over. On the seventh day of the feast their taste changed. The eighth day was the most joyful time, but it was also the hardest moment. The last day of the feast had finally come. Their joy and excitement were over, and a deep and strong sense of thirst emerged within them. At this moment the Lord Jesus stood and cried out, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink&rdquo; (v. 37).</p>
<p>When I was young, I enjoyed watching Chinese opera and ball games. I was very excited when I went to a Chinese opera. If the opera was in the evening, I was too excited to eat dinner. While I waited for the opera to begin, I felt like I was flying in the clouds. When the opera began, my whole heart was set on the opera, and I was very happy. Halfway through the opera, however, I would begin to worry that the show would soon be over. When the last scene was over, I felt very bad. The same thing happened when I went to a ball game. At the beginning of a basketball game people are excited. However, when the game is in the fourth quarter, the excitement ends. This is the last day of the feast. It is the time when people feel thirsty.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus knew that people would feel thirsty. Therefore, He did not say anything during the first few days of the feast, but on the last day of the feast, He stood and cried out, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.&rdquo; This also applies to preaching the gospel. A couple who are about to get married will not be open to the gospel, because their enjoyment of the marriage is at its peak. Their marriage, however, will gradually come to a last day. Then the couple will be thirsty, and they will also be willing to receive the gospel.</p>
<p>About nine years ago there was a young woman in Nanking who got married after she graduated from college. She and her husband were very happy as newlyweds in a new family. A few days after their wedding they went to visit Xuanwu Lake. The husband went up to the city wall by the lake, and when he was looking down from the wall, he fell into the lake and drowned. The joy of the wife in her marriage had come to a last day. Then some believers told her the words of the Lord Jesus: &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About twenty years ago I went to Honan province to preach the gospel, and I stayed with a Christian couple. The husband and the wife were very capable; they had studied overseas in the United States. When they returned from the United States, they got married. At that time they sought only prosperity and pleasure in the world, and they indulged themselves in material enjoyments. They had no desire for Jesus. Later they had a child whom they loved very much; their whole heart was in this child. One day as they were crossing a bridge, the child fell into the river and died. It is hard to imagine their grief and sorrow; they wept continually and could neither eat nor sleep. After a period of time they could no longer live in their house, so they moved to a faraway place. There they met a Christian whose son had also drowned. When his son drowned, he repented and believed in the Lord. After hearing his testimony, the couple repented and received the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>Many people believe in the Lord on &ldquo;the last day&rdquo; because it is not easy for them to receive the gospel when they are full of joy and enjoyment. The word of the gospel seems to be ineffective. However, when their joy and enjoyment come to an end on the last day, they begin to feel thirsty and remember the gospel that they heard. At this point it is easier for them to believe and receive the gospel.</p>
<p>There is an end to the joy and enjoyment in human life. One day your joy and enjoyment will come to the last day. Then you will feel thirsty and understand that you should receive the Lord Jesus. Many prominent figures do not feel a need for the gospel while they hold high positions and enjoy their prosperity. It is not until they are on their sick bed and about to die that they realize the joy of human life has come to the last day, and they begin to seek Christ.</p>
<p>You do not need to wait for the joy of your human life to come to an end before you believe in the Lord Jesus. Without exception every person who has believed in the Lord Jesus wishes that he had not waited. The longer you wait, the more you will regret. You should believe today. Your human life is a life of thirst. You should be prudent and anticipate the last day. You should not wait until the last day to seek the Lord. It is good to seek the Lord at that time, but it is far better to seek the Lord before the last day.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
