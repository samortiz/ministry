<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY</h1><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br />CONCERNING PRAYER</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>Question: Has God given us a full provision for our prayer?</p><p>Answer: Yes, God has given us a full provision in His Son through His Spirit. If we did not have a full provision from the Lord, we might withdraw from our privilege and duty to pray. Thank the Lord that He has fulfilled all of the requirements for drawing near to Him and living before Him. We can sum up the Lord's provision with two words: trust and help.</p><p>First, let us consider trust. Trusting means committing and having the boldness to depend with full assurance. Many things are included in this word. A trusting spirit is very crucial to prayer and the Christian life as a whole. If we waver before the Lord, and if we lack assurance and trust in Him, our life will suffer a fatal blow. Let us pay attention to a few portions of the Word:</p><p>Hebrews 10:19-22 says, "Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus, which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh, and having a great Priest over the house of God, let us come forward to the Holy of Holies with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water."</p><p>Romans 5:2 says, "Through whom also we have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand and boast because of the hope of the glory of God."</p><p>Ephesians 2:18 says, "For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father."</p><p>Ephesians 3:12 says, "In whom we have boldness and access in confidence through faith in Him." We do not come to God according to our worthiness. Christ holds our hand and leads us to God. It is the Lord Himself who recommends to God those who are washed by the blood and who are alive from the dead. We put Him on as our robe of righteousness. Hence, our trust is in Christ Himself.</p><p>True faith is based on one thing&mdash;Christ Himself. We have an absolute right to come to God. He Himself is our right to come to God. This is His provision. We can come to the Father at any time in His name. We do not have to come to the Father according to our condition or in our own name (this is impossible in any case). We come to the Father in the name of the Son.</p><p>Second, let us consider help. Blessed are those who come to God through trusting in the Lord! However, even though we have such a tremendous privilege, we may feel impotent, weak, foolish, and unable to pray. It is marvelous to have help from the Spirit.</p><p>Romans 8:26-27 says, "Moreover, in like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness, for we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. But He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to God." Our weaknesses are most readily manifested in our prayers. Nothing exposes our spiritual weakness more than prayer. We know how difficult it was for the disciples to pray in the garden of Gethsemane; they could not watch and pray. But thank the Lord that we have the mighty Spirit as our help. We must trust in the indwelling Spirit to operate in us according to His power, because He is our help in our time of weakness and foolishness. Although we do not know how to pray, the Holy Spirit is in us; He knows the will of God and He will teach us to pray according to God's will. He will teach us to fellowship with God intelligently and bring us into the reality of fellowship. We should trust in the Christ in whom we believe and the Spirit who sustains us and helps us pray.</p>
