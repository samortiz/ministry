   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Nearly all of the things revealed about God's eternal plan for the church are found in the two books of Ephesians and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book to the Ephesians is the revelation of the Body, and the book to the Colossians is the revelation of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When put together, these two books reveal a universal man, composed of Christ the Head, and the church the Body!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Ephesians 1:10 and 3:9, the words "dispensation'' and "fellowship'' should be translated "economy.''</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are both the same word in the Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church is something of God's economy, and this word "economy'' is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It means dispensation, arrangement, stewardship, and administration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has something to dispense, so He needs an arrangement and an administration in order to carry out this dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The very substance that God is going to dispense is Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is going to dispense Himself into man, so He arranged and administered the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church is the central matter in God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Putting it into human terms, the church is God's business.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all know that business is the key to any economy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such a large corporation as General Electric has an economy in order to do business.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, business reveals the economy of this large corporation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In a similar way, God Himself is a corporation with an economy, and in this economy God's divine business is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many Christians do not have such an awareness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Their thought is that the church is a group of fallen people who are saved and who come together to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is right, but it is a concept far below God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The heavenly and eternal view of the church is much higher than this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is the very central matter of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In God's dispensation, in God's administration, in God's arrangement, in God's governmental stewardship, He has eternally planned the church.</S>
