   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INCREASING IN SPIRITUAL STATURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul s use of the words being built up in 2:7 do not refer in a direct way to the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rather, this expression denotes an increase in our spiritual stature, which can be compared to a person s increase in stature as he grows physically.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The only way a child can grow physically is by assimilating nourishing food.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the same way, we grow spiritually by assimilating the rich nourishment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is what it means to be built up in Christ, as mentioned in 2:7.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Paul tells us that we have been rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then he goes on to say that we are being built up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No tree can grow up without first being rooted.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The growing up of the tree is also the building up of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are lacking in spiritual stature, it is of no avail to speak of the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Ephesians 4:13 Paul says, Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Body of Christ has a stature, and this stature has a full measure.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all need to grow until we arrive at the full measure of the stature of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For us to be built up does not first mean that we are built up as the church, the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It means that we are built up in the Lord and experience an increase of stature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, in Colossians 2:7 to be built up actually means to grow up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First we are rooted into Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit, and then we grow up in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We build ourselves up by growing up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our being built up depends on our assimilating into our being the riches of Christ as the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Having assimilated these riches into us, we shall grow and be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we are fully grown, we shall be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, to be built up simply means to grow up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to grow, we need nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our growth depends on how much nourishment we assimilate into us by being rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because we are rooted in Him, we absorb into us the riches of the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we grow with the nourishment we derive from these riches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>GROWING BY ABSORBING THE RICHES</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>FROM THE HEAD</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to 2:19, by holding the Head we grow with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Out from the Head, the Body grows with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God here is the processed Triune God, as in Matthew 28:19.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Out from the processed Triune God as our source, the Body grows by absorbing the riches from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Body does not grow with biblical knowledge, but grows with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Himself, God is infinite, perfect, and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, in Himself God cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But in us God can grow and He needs to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We grow by the growth of God in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because we have so little of the Triune God within us, we need the addition of God for our spiritual growth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We grow with what we absorb from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The vital and crucial point is that we grow by absorbing the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to absorb His riches, we must be rooted into Him as the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Remember that this Spirit dwells in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The soil is not our mind, emotion, or will; it is the all-inclusive, processed Triune God dwelling in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The source of the riches we need for our growth is the processed Triune God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Just as we go to a faucet to get water, so we must turn to our spirit to get the riches of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>EXERCISING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order to become more deeply rooted into the processed Triune God, we need to exercise our spirit, not our mind, emotion, or will.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, our environment does not favor the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the contrary, everything in our environment works to keep us away from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, throughout most of the Lord s Day, a brother s wife may be very pleasant to him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But just before the Lord s table meeting, she may speak an unkind word to him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In his reaction to her unkindness, he is immediately drawn away from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the midst of such a situation, the brother needs to exercise his spirit and call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By this exercise of the spirit, he will become more deeply rooted into Christ as the soil and automatically absorb more of the riches of the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This will produce more growth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to continually exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the reason that toward the end of the book of Colossians, Paul charges us to persevere in prayer 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, if, instead of exercising our spirit, we exercise our mind, emotion, and will, Satan will keep us from enjoying the all-inclusive Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Satan, the subtle, evil one, uses the environment to keep us out of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Thus, we need to exercise our spirit continually by calling on the name of the Lord in order to become more deeply rooted into the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then we shall absorb the riches of Christ, grow in Christ, and spontaneously be built up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As a result, we shall walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we understand this, we shall know what it means to walk in Christ by absorbing His riches and by being built up with what we have absorbed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the practical experience of Christ we all need.</S>
