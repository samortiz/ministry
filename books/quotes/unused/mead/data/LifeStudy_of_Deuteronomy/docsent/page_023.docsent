   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>X. MOSES BEING REFUSED IN THE MATTER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF ENTERING INTO THE GOD-PROMISED GOOD LAND,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND JOSHUA BEING ASSIGNED TO BRING THE PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>TO POSSESS THE LAND AS THEIR INHERITANCE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 3:23-29 we see that Moses was refused in the matter of entering into the God-promised good land and that Joshua was assigned to bring the people to possess the land as their inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. Showing God's Righteous</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Governmental Administration</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moses being refused by God in this matter showed God's righteous governmental administration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Numbers 20 Moses had made a serious mistake, a mistake which God could not tolerate because it touched His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's governmental administration is righteous, and even though He loved Moses, He could not for this reason fail to exercise His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moses served God faithfully for forty years, but because his mistake involved God's governmental administration, he lost the right to enter into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>B. Causing the Children of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>to Have More Fear of God's Righteous Dealing</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The way God dealt with Moses in not allowing him to enter into the good land caused the children of Israel to have more fear of God's righteous dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be sure, God is a loving God, but His love is a perfecting love, not a spoiling love.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's dealing with Moses helped to perfect the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They should have learned from this how fearful the righteous God is in His governmental dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The punishment Moses suffered was a perfecting to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>XI.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>MOSES' HEARTY ADVICE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Deuteronomy 4:1-40 we have Moses' hearty advice to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As one who was experienced and who had been disciplined by God, he was qualified to give this advice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A. Like an Aged,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Loving Father to His Beloved Children</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moses had experienced the seriousness of God's dealing hand.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>So in giving his hearty advice, he was like an aged, loving father speaking to his beloved children.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>B. Charging the Children of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>to Keep God's Statutes and Judgments,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Especially Not to Make Idols and Worship Them</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moses charged the children of Israel to keep God's statutes and judgments, especially not to make idols and worship them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>1, 16-19, 23-25, 39 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is a difference between statutes and judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Old Testament often speaks of God's commandments laws , statutes, and ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Ten Commandments are the basic law.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because these commandments are not complete, they are supplemented by the statutes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For this reason, after the commandments in Exodus 20, there is in Exodus 21 23 a record of many statutes, which are the details of the Ten Commandments and which are supplementary to these commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These statutes, however, are without judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once a judgment is added to a statute, the statute becomes an ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For instance, one of the Ten Commandments concerns the keeping of the Sabbath Exo 20:8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The statutes which supplement this commandment give some details as to what can be done on the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One statute may speak of travel and another of cooking Exo 35:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such statutes do not become ordinances unless judgments are added to them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Later we are told that the one who does not keep the Sabbath should be put to death Exo 31:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is not a commandment or a statute but an ordinance with a judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, the commandments are the basic law, the details of the law are the statutes, and the statutes with judgments are ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Deuteronomy 4 Moses charged the people to keep God's statutes and judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moses especially charged the children of Israel not to make idols and worship them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's law concerning idol worship is a commandment, the details of this commandment are statutes, and the addition of judgments causes the statutes to become ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>C. Warning Them with God's Judgment</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that surely you will soon perish from off the land into which you are crossing over the Jordan to possess it; you will not extend your days upon it, but you will be utterly destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>And Jehovah will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations to which Jehovah will drive you" Deut 4:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Here we see that Moses warned the children of Israel with God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>D. Assuring Them with God's Mercy and Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Moses not only warned the people with God's judgment but assured them with God's mercy and blessing vv.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>30-31, 40 .</S>
