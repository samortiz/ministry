   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The greatest difficulty today in studying the Bible lies in the prejudice in the mind of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They have what they consider as truth and what they consider as heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They think that everything that matches them is truth, and everything that does not match them and that differs from them is heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Regardless of how scriptural a basis there is for it, any thought or concept contrary to theirs is considered heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But if that is one's attitude, he is through.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At issue today is what God has said.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am happy in my heart because I can preach the "heresy" of God's Word and I can oppose the "truth" in man's teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today we have to be clear before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We cannot be under any other authority but that of God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I know no other authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I do not know what theology is; I do not know what man's word is; I do not know what the tradition of the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I only know what the Bible says, and only what it says counts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must subject ourselves to it only.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We cannot change God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Word of God tells us the destiny of His children.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It tells us what we will experience in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must pay attention to these issues because sooner or later we will face them again.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we pay attention to them we will be careful how we live on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The second thing that we must realize is that only those who understand the truth can oppose heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One heresy cannot oppose another heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But all heresies are not pure heresy; they are the truth plus a little error.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Heresy is to add wrong things to right things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Add a little of man's thought to God's thought, and you will have heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because Catholicism does not fully know the truth in the Bible, it preaches the doctrine of purgatory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you do not know the truth that we have released in the last few meetings, you will not be able to tell whether the doctrine of purgatory is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now that you have heard these messages, you will realize that the doctrine of purgatory is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You can say that it is heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Bible we see that God's discipline of the Christians happens in the millennium, but Catholics say that there is a purging going on today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They say that if a Christian does not live up to standard on earth today, he will not be able to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, he must be purged.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, they say that as soon as a Christian dies, he begins to be purged and is purged until the job is done.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, there is absolutely no such teaching in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible never says that as soon as a Christian dies, he will be purged in Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible shows us that there will be the discipline in the kingdom in the future, but there is no purging in Hades today.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Second, Catholics make another grave mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They think that if they secure for themselves indulgences while they are alive or if the priests pray for them after they die, they will be relieved of some of the purging of purgatory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the Bible never says anything like this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Bible says only that he who has mercy on others will obtain mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Praying by the priest will not do anything for the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Bible never teaches us to pray for the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Third, Catholics tell people that a man will not be saved until he has been completely purged in purgatory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is an absolute overturning of the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible shows us that there is no other name in heaven or on earth besides that of the Lord Jesus whereby we must be saved Acts 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only He can save us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Apart from the Lord Jesus, there is no salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Discipline and chastisement are not for salvation but for sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The matter of our salvation is settled long before God disciplines us, but there are still things in us that do not match Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There are still imperfections and areas that are not up to standard.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, there is the discipline in this age and the discipline in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once a person is clear about the biblical truth, he will see the heresy in Roman Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Roman Catholic Church takes a few verses and utilizes them for her own purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if we know the biblical truth, we will realize that the doctrine of purgatory annuls grace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thank God that, although I am a filthy sinner, through the Lord Jesus I am now saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When I die, I do not have to be purged any further, because salvation is not of me, but of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Surely I am saved.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now we know what discipline is.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Discipline is God's means to make us perfect as He is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He chastises us so that we will be like Him, even the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This has nothing to do with our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is a matter within His family.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Finally, only after we know this will we be able to deal with the heresy in Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today among the Protestants, two kinds of errors are being promulgated.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>First, one group of Protestant theologians proposes that since a man is "once saved, always saved," he can get away with anything in his conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Since a Christian is saved eternally, they say, he could be evil until the day he dies and still be in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He would, however, occupy a lower position in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His greatest loss is confined to occupying a lower position in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This kind of teaching will make a man loose and irresponsible.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What then is grace to them?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To them grace is an excuse for looseness and licentiousness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is another group of Protestants who say that after a man believes, there is still the possibility that he will not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Perhaps he can be saved and unsaved again three or four times within a day.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If that were the case, the book of life would get very messy indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>A brother once said that if we are not eternally saved once we have believed, then the book of life will be extremely thick.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>My name alone would be deleted and inserted many, many times.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If a man is condemned as soon as he sins and if he is bound for hell as soon as he transgresses, we must wonder whether salvation is by grace or by works.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Both of these groups are too extreme, even though both have their scriptural basis.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Bible shows us clearly that when a man is saved, he is eternally saved.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Bible also shows us clearly that it is possible for a Christian to be "cast into Gehenna" temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But the problem is that some brothers hold onto one side, insisting that salvation is eternal and that there is no such thing as discipline in the kingdom, while other brothers hold onto the other side, insisting that if we can be "cast into Gehenna," eternal life is shaky, and therefore we can go into eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But if we see the difference between the age of the kingdom and the eternal age and the difference between the temporary punishment of the millennium and eternal punishment, we will be clear that a Christian can receive punishment in the future, but at the same time, God has given His sheep eternal life, and they can never lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This knowledge gives us the boldness to say that once we are saved, we are eternally saved.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After a man has been saved by grace, he will never perish again.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Thus, not only have we properly settled the problem of the purgatory of Catholicism, but we have also made a clear distinction between eternal salvation and discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>May the Lord grant us grace tonight and show us that the matter of eternal salvation is solved because of the work of Jesus of Nazareth, but as for one's situation in the kingdom, it is determined by the person himself.</S>
