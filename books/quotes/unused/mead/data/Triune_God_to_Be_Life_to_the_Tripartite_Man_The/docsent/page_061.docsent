   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE ELEVEN THE PRACTICAL WAY TO BEAR THE CROSS Scripture Reading: Gal 2:20a; Rom 6:6a; Gal 5:24; Rom 8:13b; 2 Cor 4:10; 1 Cor 6:7b INCARNATION, CRUCIFIXION, AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING LANDMARKS IN THE ACCOMPLISHMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF GOD'S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In God's New Testament economy, Christ accomplished three new things which remain as landmarks in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These landmarks in the accomplishment of God's New Testament economy are incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, He accomplished incarnation in order to produce Himself as Immanuel Matt 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then He accomplished crucifixion which issued in His becoming the life-giving Spirit in resurrection 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah Isa 4:2 was the branching out of divinity into humanity to be our Immanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Incarnation took place two thousand years ago, but according to God's reckoning of time, it was only two days ago 2 Pet 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before incarnation, God remained in His divinity for an undeterminable amount of time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After His creation of man, God still remained merely in divinity for approximately four thousand more years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then through incarnation, God branched Himself into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Incarnation was something new; it is one of the landmarks of the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before incarnation, God was merely in divinity, but in His incarnation, a God-man was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was a new thing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today we are in the age of incarnation, and we are enjoying Immanuel as the result, the consummation, of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The second accomplishment of Christ in God's New Testament economy was crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the Old Testament, the Jewish death penalty was carried out by stoning Lev 20:2, 27; 24:23; Deut 13:10; 17:5 , not by crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Crucifixion was a heathen practice Ezra 6:11 adopted by the Roman Empire for the execution of slaves and heinous criminals only.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ's crucifixion was foreshadowed in Deuteronomy 21.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verses 22 through 23 predict that a man found worthy of death would be hanged on a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Tree in these verses typifies the cross of Christ 1 Pet 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul strongly confirmed this understanding in Galatians 3, when he said, "Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because it is written, Cursed is every one hanging on a tree" v. 13 . The cross of Christ was also typified by the way in which the Passover lamb was slaughtered.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to tradition, the Passover lamb was tied to a cross of wood and slaughtered.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, the crucifixion of Christ was a fulfillment of the prophecy in Deuteronomy 21:23 and of the type in Exodus 12.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection are landmarks in the accomplishment of God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What a great blessing it is to live in the age of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many prophets and righteous men, including Abraham, desired to see and understand the things of this age and did not perceive them Matt 13:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the history of the universe, incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection are of the highest significance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In resurrection Christ germinated the new creation by imparting Himself into the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The One who became Immanuel through incarnation became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Of these three landmarks, Paul esteemed the crucifixion of Christ to the uttermost Rom 6:6a; Gal 2:20; 6:14; 1 Cor 1:23-24; 2:2 .</S>
