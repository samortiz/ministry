   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS Scripture Reading: 2 Pet 1:1; 1 Cor 1:30; Phil 3:9 INTRODUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have already seen that a saved person should know a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, he should know that he is a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second, he should know God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Third, he should know the righteousness of Christ and that Christ has become the believers' righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now we want to consider the difference between the righteousness of Christ and Christ as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is a big difference between these two things, and we must differentiate them clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Most people think that after we become a Christian, everything of Christ becomes ours.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But the Bible does not say that we are saved by the righteousness of Christ or that the righteousness of Christ has become our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The phrase the righteousness of Christ is only used in 2 Peter 1:1, in reference to Christ's own righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without the righteousness of Christ, we cannot have a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is the Savior because He is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But His righteousness is only related to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The righteousness of Christ qualifies and enables Him to be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we read the Bible, we should not change what we read.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not be satisfied with vague concepts and answers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During the past ten or more years, I have often asked others two questions: By what righteousness are we saved?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By whose righteousness do we come to God?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many people could not give the proper answer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They would say that they are saved by the righteousness of Christ and that they come to God through Christ's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let me put it this way: The righteousness of Jesus was the qualification which the Lord had before God when He was a man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This righteousness has absolutely nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are not joined to the Lord in His walk in this world; we are joined to Him on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everything that the Lord did on earth has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must remember that a grain bears many grains only after it has fallen into the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christians were joined to Christ at His death, not at His birth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Christ was born in Bethlehem and lived on the earth, men could only follow Him from afar.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They could only say, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only when we come to Romans 6 do we see that we are joined to Him in the likeness of His death and resurrection v. 5 . Therefore, a Christian does not become righteous in the eyes of God through the righteousness of Christ, but through Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are saved through receiving Christ Himself.</S>
