   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE GOD'S PLAN AND GOD'S REST Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26 2:3; 2:18-24; Eph 5:22-32; Rev 12; 21:1 22:5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Four women are mentioned in these four passages of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Genesis 2 the woman is Eve; in Ephesians 5 she is the church; in Revelation 12 she is the woman seen in the vision; and in Revelation 21 she is the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>May God grant us light to see how these four women are related to one another and to His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we may see the position the church occupies and the responsibility she bears in this plan and how the overcomers of God will accomplish His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>GOD'S PURPOSE IN CREATING MAN</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why did God create man?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What was His purpose in creating man?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has given us the answer to these questions in Genesis 1:26 and 27.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These two verses are of great significance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They reveal to us that God's creation of man was indeed an exceedingly special one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before God created man, He said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was God's plan in creating man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"God said, Let us..."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This speaks of the kind of man God wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, God was designing a "model" for the man He was to create.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 27 reveals God's creation of man: "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 28 says, "God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From these verses we see the man that God desired.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God desired a ruling man, a man who would rule upon this earth; then He would be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How did God create man?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He created man in His own image.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God wanted a man like Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is very evident then that man's position in God's creation is entirely unique, for among all of God's creatures man alone was created in God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The man that God's heart was set upon was completely different from all other created beings; he was a man in His own image.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We notice here something quite remarkable.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 26 says, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness..."; but verse 27 says, "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 26 the pronoun "our" is plural, but in verse 27 "his" is singular.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>During the conference of the Godhead, verse 26 says, "Let us make man in our image"; therefore, according to grammar, verse 27 should say, "So God created man in their own image."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But strangely, verse 27 says, "So God created man in his own image."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How can we explain this?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is because there are three in the Godhead the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, yet only one has the image in the Godhead the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the Godhead was designing man's creation, the Bible indicates that man would be made in "our" image since They are one, "our image" was mentioned ; but when the Godhead was in the actual process of making man, the Bible says that man was made in "his" image.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"His" denotes the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From this we ascertain that Adam was made in the image of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Adam did not precede the Lord Jesus; the Lord Jesus preceded him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When God created Adam, He created him in the image of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is for this reason it says "in his image" rather than "in their image."</S>
