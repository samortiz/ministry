They also discovered that such an innate knowledge and ability is our conscience within us. In his book called The Great Learning, Confucius spoke of the way of great learning, which was very difficult for the classical scholars to explain: \u201cThe way of great learning is to develop the bright virtue.\u201d In the term bright virtue, bright is an adjective, and virtue is a noun. The meaning of bright virtue is a bright and shining moral virtue. The Chinese philosophers developed this point very much; the emphasis of their moral and ethical teachings was to brighten the bright virtue, which means to develop and increase the function of the conscience, that is, man\u2019s innate knowledge of good and ability to do good.

You may call it the conscience, the innate knowledge and ability, or the bright virtue, but within you there truly is such a thing. Many times there are lusts within you. For example, if you see that your classmate in school has a very good pen, you may think of a way to steal it. When you do this, you are outside of your spirit; you are in the improper functioning of your lusts, emotions, and mind. But on the other hand, [65] while you are doing this, you sense an inner voice condemning you, even forbidding and criticizing you. Sometimes after you have stolen something, you feel uneasy using it. This feeling of uneasiness is not from any outward religious or ethical teaching. According to their studies of all the aspects of the conditions manifested in the human body and heart, Confucius and Mencius reached a conclusion that there is truly such a thing within man, and they called that thing the conscience. Later, Wang Yang-ming studied it further and called it the innate knowledge of good and the innate ability to do good. It is not only a knowledge but also an ability\u2014a knowledge of good and an ability to do good. Knowing good and being able to do good are the functions of the conscience.

Ephesians 3:19b says, \u201cThat you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.\u201d What kind of philosophy or doctrine is this? This is higher than any philosophy or doctrine! The Chinese Confucianists say that the principle of the highest level of learning is to develop the bright virtue. This principle at the most helps to develop our bright virtue, which is our innate knowledge and ability. Today we have not only the bright virtue, the innate knowledge and ability; we have the all-inclusive Christ, the all-inclusive Spirit, and the Triune God in our spirit as the unsearchable riches in us. Wang Yang-ming, a Chinese philosopher, said that if a person only makes outward improvements but neglects to develop his innate knowledge and ability, he is like a tree without roots and a stream without a source. If the philosophers pay so much attention to the matter of our inner source, how much more should we! What they pay attention to is only the innate knowledge and ability\u2014the bright virtue within man.

Within the body there is the soul, and within the soul there is the spirit. When we believe in the Lord and call on Him, He as the life-giving Spirit enters into our spirit. The two spirits are added together, joined, and mingled as one spirit. Through this He brings to us God and the life of God as well, and He enlivens our deadened spirit. Now within the spirit of the saved believers, there is the Spirit. There is also God and the life of God. This is much greater than the bright virtue.
