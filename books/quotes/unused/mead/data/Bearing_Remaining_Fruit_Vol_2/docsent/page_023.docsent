   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR THE MINISTERS AND THE MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW COVENANT THE MINISTERS OF THE NEW COVENANT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BEING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second Corinthians 3:6 says, Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should note that this verse speaks of ministers and not ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ministry is different from the ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ministry refers to the work, whereas the ministers are the persons, just as elders and deacons are persons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Chinese we sometimes add the word many in order to distinguish the two words, speaking of the many ministers of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is correct because in verse 6 ministers is plural.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to 2 Corinthians 3, the ministers of the new covenant are not of the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Letter conveys many meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In literal terms, it refers to the words in black and white.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>With regard to its intrinsic meaning, it refers to the dead scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Letter in this chapter does not refer to the New Testament, because at that time the New Testament had not yet been written.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead, it refers to the Old Testament, in particular, the Scriptures written on stone tablets.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The meaning of letter also includes dead knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The knowledge that comes from the dead letter is also considered as letter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moreover, letter also refers to ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today as the many ministers of the new covenant we are not of the dead ordinances, the dead scripture, or the dead knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead, we are of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our every work and our walk, whether to go door-knocking, bring people to salvation, baptize people, or conduct home meetings, require us to be men of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE CULTIVATION OF</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE MINISTERS OF THE NEW COVENANT Not Keeping the Outward Letter</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>but Cultivating the Inner Life</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our problem lies in this that our spiritual level is too poor.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may do many things outwardly, such as pray, confess our sins, and seek the filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In fact, however, we may very much be under the influence of rituals and letters.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even our praying, confessing, and seeking the filling of the Spirit can become rituals and not come out from the spirit by our living in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The genuine living that comes out from the spirit is without ordinances and rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If our living comes from the spirit, our prayer, being dealt with, and seeking will not merely be the fulfilling of a spiritual duty according to rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, we will pray even more, be dealt with more thoroughly, and be filled to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Perhaps some will say that they are not merely fulfilling duties; they are sincere and true, keeping a time with the Lord every day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This may be true, but their practice may still be a routine practice of keeping the rules sincerely and truly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One may pray, confess his sins, and seek the filling of the Holy Spirit sincerely and truly yet still not touch the spirit even a little.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This kind of praying, confessing, and seeking is still very much of the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although the thing done seems very spiritual, the doing of it is still of the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This proves that such persons themselves are of the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If someone asks you why you pray in this way, you may answer that it is because the Bible teaches us to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These words sound good, yet within these good words there is an implication that is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This answer indicates that you are merely one who keeps the rules.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, you have not prayed in the spirit, and it is not the Spirit that leads you to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You are of the ordinances, of the letter, and not of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Regarding this matter, we must receive life and spiritual cultivation in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to receive a nurturing in life that we may be persons of the Spirit and not of the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we have no ordinances or rituals, yet we still live a life that is higher than others , this will prove that we are not of the letter but of life and of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only a man can do the work of man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a monkey is trained to behave like a man, it is still a monkey, and it cannot do the work of man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our burden is that we all will see that we must follow the Spirit in life and live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is a matter not of outward practices, rituals, and ordinances but of being cultivated to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A fruit tree requires cultivation and special care in order to grow well.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those who work in orchards know that if fruit trees are not protected, cultivated, and pruned, they will not bear much fruit, and they may even be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Still, cultivation is only an outward help for the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No matter how much a farmer cultivates his fruit trees, he cannot replace the life of the trees.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He can hang artificial fruit on the trees, but that kind of fruit is of the letter, and the trees themselves will be of the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Artificial fruit is not the fruit of life that is cultivated, grown, developed, and borne through the life within the trees.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must avoid this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the expression of our life is merely an outward hanging of fruit, it is only a decoration, not the issue of our life within.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This kind of fruit will be tested by the environment and by time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After a few months of testing, the artificial fruit will become old, break, and fail one after the other.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Eventually we will have nothing; we will be exposed to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, regardless of what situation we are in, whether good or bad, we need to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Growth develops the nurturing we have obtained and strengthens the content of our inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Not Keeping the Outward Ordinances but Building Up a Character for Serving</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must also pay attention to our character.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is difficult for us to receive help regarding our character.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To keep ordinances is easy, and to pick up new things is also easy, but to properly build up our character is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is because the building up of character is related to our weightiness in life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We all have seen children singing hymns, and we are truly touched by them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Yet no matter how much they touch us and even stir us to tears, we still realize that they are children.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They can try their best to behave in a certain way, and they can even act like old adults, but no matter how much they perform, they are still children.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Their true outward expression depends not on how hard they try to perform but on the normal growth of the life within them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We need to take care of this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What can truly be a help to others is very much related to the weightiness of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>For a person to be loose in his character is a proof that his spiritual life is immature.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When one person weeps or laughs, others can see his immaturity, but when someone else weeps and laughs in the same way, others can see his maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A person s expressions and feelings of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight are the manifestations of the actual weight of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>No one can pretend in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The building up of a person s character is altogether a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>More than thirty years ago we had a training on thirty traits of character.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>At that time one hundred twenty persons joined the training.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Those who were twenty-five then are now close to sixty.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>To my impression, however, their character now is not much different from what it was when they were twenty-five.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Some of them now have gotten married and had children, and some of their children have already graduated from college.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Still, their character has never changed much; they are mostly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Originally they were loose, and now they are still loose in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is a cause of concern to us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I hope that the young people, including the full-time trainees, as they begin to learn how to serve the Lord, will receive the training of their character in a serious and strict way, forsaking all performance and pretense and gaining a genuine weightiness in their inner life.</S>
