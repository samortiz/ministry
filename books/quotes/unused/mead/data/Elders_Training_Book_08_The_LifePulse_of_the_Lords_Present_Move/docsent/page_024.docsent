   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE TRUTH LESSONS 2 Scripture Reading: Rom 7:6; 2 Cor 3:6 THE STAGES OF THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since October of 1984 the Lord has started a new way among us for the carrying out of His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The recovery has been on the earth for over sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the first twenty years or more we have gone through at least two or three stages, so our practice has changed at least two or three times.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Brother Nee s writings, especially The Normal Christian Church Life, there are indications that the practice in the Lord s recovery did change.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By 1937 Brother Nee had seen the principle or line of Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Based upon this he gave the messages contained in The Normal Christian Church Life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He said that up to that time the practice among us was only according to one way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He admitted that before that time he had not seen the line of Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Until then most of the co-workers stayed in one place, not going out to spread the gospel to establish the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In those messages he charged us all not to stay permanently in one place, but to go out from one city to another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He called this the line of Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since 1937 there was a change in the practice of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From 1937 to 1942 we practiced the line of Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1942 there was a turmoil in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was a real hardship to Brother Nee, and he spontaneously stopped his ministry until 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In those six years he did not minister as usual; he only did a small amount in the interior of China during the war time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While Brother Nee was there in the interior caring for his pharmaceutical factory, he gave the messages contained in The Orthodoxy of the Church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That was all that he ministered.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Besides this he occasionally gave time to some of the seekers to fellowship with him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After the war he came back to Shanghai, and I also was invited to stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We began to come together, even though he would not come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We had much time together to talk about the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He began to let me know privately that he saw something further, which he called the line of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Due to the revival in Shanghai and other cities, Brother Nee was brought back to his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At that time he gave us at least one message on the line of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since 1948 we practiced very much according to the second line, the line of Jerusalem, mainly to have the co-workers stay in the major cities to help the building up of the local churches as strong testimonies there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We practiced this way for quite a number of years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This practice was even brought over to Taiwan and somewhat to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By this you could see that in the past years we practiced the Lord s recovery in three stages, the initial stage, the second stage of the Antioch line, and the third stage of the Jerusalem line until 1984.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE PRESENT SITUATION OF OLDNESS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the last years, especially from 1980, I began to realize that we have somewhat become dull, without much sense of the spiritual situation and condition among us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For years we simply went according to what we had seen through Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We had no intention to question whether we should still continue in that way or not.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We did not realize how old and how cold we were and how much we were retained in our old practice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This practice was new in 1948 but since 1980 has become no longer new.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With the practice according to the vision we had received through Brother Nee concerning the line of Jerusalem, we brought the Lord s recovery to this country in 1962.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the first ten years the recovery was new and living.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was not as cold and old as it has been in the last seven or eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This cold and old situation and condition was more serious in Taiwan than in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Taiwan s situation in 1984 was the primary factor that caused me to reconsider our way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the five years since 1980, whenever the leading ones came to this country to meet with me, I always charged them seriously and thoroughly, even warning them, that the work there could not go on in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, within these five years of charging, warning, and exhorting, there was very little change or advancement.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>During those years I had to spend about ninety days to prepare for the summer training and another ninety days to prepare for the winter training, mainly in the writing of the notes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even while I was so busy, I was considering Taiwan very much because it is the source of the spreading of the Lord s recovery outside of mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because there was a new start there in 1949, I considered that as a great part of the produce of my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, I was very much concerned for the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I realized that if Taiwan would be like that, they would be a spring full of sulfur.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The churches elsewhere would not be able to receive the current from Taiwan without the taste of sulfur.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to purify the current of the Lord s recovery around the globe, I had to purify that spring as the source.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I made this decision after a long period of consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>During those five years while I was advising and exhorting the leading ones there to improve the work, I was already considering to go back to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I was not able to be spared, however, in order that I could finish the Life-study of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After the last word of the notes on the New Testament was written, I felt that this was the time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I had to go back to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At the end of September of 1984 I finished the writing, and in October I went back.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I indicated that I would stay a longer time there and that I probably would go back quite often.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Something stirred up within my spirit telling me that I had to revolutionize the church life, not leaving a bit of the old practice.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The entire practice had to be overturned.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It was too old.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Perhaps thirty years ago it was good.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This can be compared to our means of transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In 1947 I flew from Shanghai to Hong Kong on a DC-4, which was called the King in the Air.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It seemed so pleasant and comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Again in 1958 I flew from Taiwan to San Francisco on a DC-4.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It was marvelous to us that we could cross the entire Pacific and arrive at San Francisco within twenty-four hours.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, today we may travel to Taiwan in twelve hours.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is much more comfortable; I could even walk and exercise on that 747.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What an improvement!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>No one can change the earth created by God, but surely we can improve the transportation around it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Throughout the centuries there have been many improvements in transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In previous centuries travel by wagon from the east coast to the west coast may have taken about one hundred days.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But today to fly from the west coast to New York takes a little over five hours.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is due to the changes, the improvements in the methods of travel.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Why in working for the Lord would we remain in the oldness?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the way of the Catholic Church; the ordinances of the Catholic Church have existed for over fourteen centuries since the establishment of the papal system.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There has hardly been any change.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is somewhat the same with us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>By remaining in the old way we surely have suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We suffered firstly in the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We suffered as well in the matter of the truth, and we suffered the most in the loss of the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the last five years we have not had much increase.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is the same in all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Only a few places are better.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We generally remained the same.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, within the last ten years other groups have risen up in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the Far East in at least three or more places some Christian groups increased from one thousand to a hundred thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In 1958, the same year the church in Taipei began to drop the small group meetings, a church in Seoul, Korea started.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It started simply with the pastor, his wife, and two other couples.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Now they claim to have a few hundred thousand members in that one city.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When I began to study their situation in October of 1984, they claimed they had 300,000.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Today they claim they have more.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Another little group in Singapore was started by a student who returned from the United States within the last ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Every Lord s Day they have several sessions in one rented auditorium.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Quite a few thousand rotate to meet there, session after session.</S>
