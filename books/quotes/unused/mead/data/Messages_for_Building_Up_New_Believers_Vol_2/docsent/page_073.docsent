   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. One Being Allowed to Separate</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Only When the Oneness Is Broken</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Divorce is allowed in the case of adultery because the oneness has already been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Originally, the wife was one with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the husband commits adultery, she becomes free.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the oneness was there, she had to preserve it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now that the oneness has been broken by the husband, the wife is free.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, adultery is the only condition for divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A wife can leave her husband if he has committed adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a sister finds her husband committing adultery or taking another woman, she can divorce her husband, and the church cannot stop her.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>She can divorce her husband, and she can remarry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Anything that destroys the oneness is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A person can leave his or her spouse only where adultery is involved, because adultery has destroyed the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Divorce is but a declaration that the oneness between a husband and a wife is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since the oneness is gone, one can remarry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Matthew 19 and Luke 16 are two clear passages concerning this subject, and we have to pay much attention to them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Divorce is based on adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Adultery breaks the original oneness between a husband and a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The two are no longer one, but have become two.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, they can divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They can divorce each other because there is no more oneness between them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually a divorce has already occurred when one party commits adultery; it does not begin with the divorce proceedings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The so-called divorce proceedings are but a procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Marriage begins with the declaration of oneness, and divorce is a declaration that such a oneness no longer exists.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why divorce is permitted where adultery is found.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A divorce that is not based on adultery means that both parties are committing adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose neither a husband nor a wife has committed adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They cannot have a divorce even if they cannot get along with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once they divorce each other, they have committed adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the oneness has not yet been broken when one tries to remarry, he or she is in reality committing adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only when the oneness no longer exists can a person remarry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to know what marriage is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Marriage means oneness; it means that two persons are no longer two, but one flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Adultery destroys this oneness, while divorce is but an announcement of the destruction of this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today if the oneness is gone between two persons, a remarriage is justified.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But suppose the oneness is still there.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The two may quarrel bitterly, they may not get along with each other, and they may threaten to divorce each other.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The world and civic laws may even allow them to divorce each other.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But in God s eyes, the two still cannot divorce each other.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If they divorce each other, they have committed adultery in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Divorce is allowed only where adultery has already occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must see that no one can separate what God has joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since there is already a union, one must never try to break it for any reason at all.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>X. WIDOWS</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Bible allows widows and widowers to remarry for the same reason.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Marriage is something that lasts till death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In resurrection there is no marriage relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In resurrection men neither marry nor are given in marriage Matt 22:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Marrying and being given in marriage are things of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The angels neither marry nor are given in marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Resurrected men likewise neither marry nor are given in marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Marriage is a thing of this age, not of the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, marriage ends with death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After one s partner dies, he or she may remain unmarried for the sake of cherished affection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But the Bible says nothing to forbid him or her from remarrying someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Consider the teaching in Romans 7 which says that every Christian is a remarried person.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We were remarried through the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Romans 7 shows us that a wife is bound by the law to her husband as long as he is alive.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After the husband dies, the wife can marry another man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whoever marries another man while her husband is alive is an adulteress.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we are not yet dead to the law or if we are Seventh-day Adventists, yet we are married to Christ, all of us are adulteresses.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thank God, we have only one husband.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Seventh-day Adventists have two husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Romans 7 says that we could not belong to Christ as long as the law was still alive; if we had belonged to Christ then, we would have been adulteresses.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We were originally married to the law, and we belonged to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, we have died through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Today, when we turn to Christ, we are not adulteresses.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All of us have been remarried to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We are dead to the law, and we are not adulteresses.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Romans 7 tells us that a wife is bound to her husband until his death.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After the husband dies, the wife is free.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is wrong for anyone in the church to think that widows should not remarry.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is a heathen concept.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is all right if a widow wants to remain single like a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Paul said, It is good for them if they remain even as I am 1 Cor 7:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>To live alone like a virgin for the sake of serving the Lord is right, but to remain unmarried because of criticism and social pressure is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I hope that this concept can be removed from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Paul told Timothy, I will therefore that younger widows marry 1 Tim 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The same applies to widowers.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Today the issue is whether or not one has the need for marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Some have a physiological need.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Others have a psychological need; they would feel lonely if they did not marry again.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Some have a need because of their family.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is all right for a brother or a sister to remarry after his or her spouse has died.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>No Christian should criticize another on this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We need to eradicate all heathen concepts from our mind.</S>
