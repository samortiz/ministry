   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONSTITUTION OF THE BODY OF CHRIST AND TRANSFORMATION IN LIFE FOR THE BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A few words have been particularly selected for use in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first is the word constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We use this word not to denote the constitution of some sort of organization; rather, we use it to denote something that is constituted with particular constituents.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church as the Body of Christ is not a formation or an organization but a constitution that has been constituted with the Christ of life as its very constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>My burden is to help the saints see that the Body of Christ is a constitution, constituted with the Triune God embodied in Christ as the life element.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the church has not only been constituted with Christ as its element; it is also being built up by the transformation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, we intend to cover two things in this book: 1 the constitution of the Body of Christ and 2 transformation for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I would like you all to be impressed with these two words, constitution and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE CONSTITUTION OF THE BODY OF CHRIST WITH THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST AS THE LIFE ELEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this chapter we want to see the constitution of the Body of Christ with the all-inclusive Christ as the life element.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These words may seem quite common in English, but the expression life element is not so common.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is the life element with which the church has been constituted?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must see that the church as the Body of Christ has been constituted not with a simple Christ but with the all-inclusive Christ as the life element.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I. CHRIST, THE TRIUNE GOD EMBODIED</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>IN HUMANITY AS THE SOURCE OF LIFE,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>SIGNIFIED BY THE TREE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This all-inclusive Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all know God is invisible and very abstract and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is difficult for anyone to tell us who God is, how God is, what God is, or where God is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who can do this?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I do not believe anyone can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But such a God, the Triune God, has been embodied in the flesh in a visible man John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is this man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Who then is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is the very Triune God embodied in a man of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God is the source of life, and as the source of life, He is signified by the tree of life Gen 2:9; Rev 2:7; 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To read the Bible is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible is not a simple book.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It has many plain words, but it also has many figures of speech.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One of these figures is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Have you ever heard of such a tree?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have heard of peach trees, apple trees, and hundreds of other trees, but we may have never heard of a life tree.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet in the Bible there is such a thing as the life tree, the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Have you noticed that in the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus told us that He is a tree John 15:1, 5 ?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But He is not a pine tree, shooting into the sky so high that nobody can touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is a vine tree, not shooting up but spreading out.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In a sense He is great and He is vast, yet He is also very low.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is not shooting into the air but spreading out on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even a little one can touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is great and He is spreading, yet He is low.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is what He told us in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then elsewhere in the Gospel of John, the Lord told us that He is life 11:25; 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is a tree and He is life, and if you put these two together, you have a life tree, a tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is the life tree.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to Genesis 2 the trees in the garden of Eden were good for food v. 9 . The tree of life was no exception to this; it also was good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We eat from all sorts of trees for the purpose of nourishing ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But do you realize that we need another kind of tree?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need the life tree, which is God embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A picture or a figure is always better than a thousand words.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this figure Christ presents Himself to us as a tree, not a pine tree but a vine tree, spreading Himself before us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This indicates that we should eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The first crucial figure in the Bible is the tree of life, signifying God Himself as life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We can call Him the life tree, and we can also call Him the God tree.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The tree of life is the tree of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must realize that this tree of life is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Without this tree we would never know that our God is the life tree, the God tree.</S>
