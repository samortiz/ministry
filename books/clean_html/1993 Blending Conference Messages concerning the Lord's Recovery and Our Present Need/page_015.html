<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Oneness of the Body of Christ</H2><P>I am so happy that I am in the Lord's recovery and that the Lord has the way to recover all the deep and precious things in the divine revelation. All of these crucial points are our heritage. They are our treasure. They are our capital to go on with the Lord.</P><P>The fifth point of the crucial points of the major items in the Lord's recovery is the oneness of the Body of Christ. The oneness of the Body of Christ is the oneness in the Divine Trinity Himself. In the Lord's recovery, we have seen that the Divine Trinity is dispensing Himself into the tripartite man. We are the tripartite men, His believers, and He is dispensing Himself into us. When He dispenses Himself into us, He mingles Himself with us so that we become mingled people, people who are mingled with the Triune God. When He gets mingled with His people, what He is gets mingled with them.</P><P>The Triune God is three, but these Three are in a unique and special oneness. The Father and the Son are one (John 17:11, 21), and this oneness includes the Spirit. Because He has mingled Himself with the believers, we believers enjoy the same oneness. We enjoy the oneness of the Divine Trinity. Thus, the oneness of the Body of Christ is the enlarged oneness of the Divine Trinity. I want to be in this kind of recovery, a high recovery, a deep recovery, that includes the Triune God Himself.</P><P>In this oneness the Spirit is the unique essence. The essence is the thing that identifies what something is. If you take an orange and cut it open, and touch it to someone's tongue, they can tell you it is an orange by the taste, even though they may not be able to see it or feel it. This is because there is the essence of the orange. The orange itself is the element, and the juice is the essence of the orange. Once the juice of the orange touches your tongue, you touch the essence, and the essence makes clear what it is. Similarly, the one Spirit is the unique essence of the Body of Christ. Ephesians 4:4 says, "One Body and one Spirit." That means there is one Spirit in the Body of Christ, and that one Spirit is the very essence of the Body of Christ.</P><P>In this one Body there is also an element. The essence is what identifies something, what constitutes it, permeates it, and makes it what it is. But the element is the thing itself. There is the essence of the orange, and then there is the orange itself. The Body is the Body of Christ. This means that Christ is the element! Ephesians 4:5 says, "One Lord, one faith, one baptism." We believe into Christ, and we are baptized into Christ as the unique element of the Body. He is preeminent in everything because He is the element.</P><P>This essence and this element come out of a very wonderful source, who is the Father Himself. So our oneness in the Body of Christ is a oneness that is based on the Spirit as the essence, the Lord as the element, and the Father as the very source. These three things actually are the very Triune God Himself and are the basis of our oneness in the Body of Christ. The Spirit is the essence of our oneness, the Lord is the element of our oneness, and the Father is the source of our oneness.</P><P>You cannot divide the Triune God, so do not try to divide the Body of Christ. When you divide the Body of Christ, you are implicitly trying to divide the Triune God Himself, and He will never allow it. The oneness of the Body of Christ is the oneness of the Divine Trinity&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, undivided and indivisible.</P>
