<h2 class="head5">Stone</h2>
<p>In addition to wood, stone was used for the building of the temple (1 Kings 5:15-18). The stones were cut in a mountain quarry in the wilderness with much effort (6:7). This signifies that the materials for the building of the church are found in the world and cut with much effort. First Peter 2:4-5 says, &ldquo;Coming to Him...you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house.&rdquo; Everyone in the church is a living stone. The name Peter means &ldquo;a stone.&rdquo; In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said to Peter, &ldquo;You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; Formerly Peter&rsquo;s name was Simon, but after the Lord revealed that He would build His church, He changed Simon&rsquo;s name to Peter. This means that Peter became a stone for the building of the church.</p>
<p>Every saved one in the church is a stone in the church. Just as the stones were in the mountains of the wilderness, we were all in the world, but one day God&rsquo;s workers found us; that is, we were found by God&rsquo;s work. Then God&rsquo;s workers and God&rsquo;s work began to deal with us and do a cutting work upon us. The spiritual stones used for the building of the church must have life inwardly and be worked upon outwardly. Hence, the New Testament speaks of living stones (1 Pet. 2:5), and the Old Testament speaks of cut stones (1 Kings 5:15, 17-18; 6:7). The stones used for the building of the church must be living inwardly and must be cut outwardly. Living implies regeneration. However, after regeneration the stones still need to allow God to cut them over a long period of time.</p>
<p>In the church some brothers and sisters can be compared to &ldquo;wild&rdquo; stones, freshly cut from the quarry and full of sharp edges. When people contact them, they are hurt and have an uncomfortable feeling. Such a person, although regenerated, is short of God&rsquo;s cutting work. By the time the temple was built, all the stones had been prepared. The preparation work was done at the quarry. The stones were cut and shaped into certain sizes. In the actual construction, the stones were laid on top of each other to form the building. The way of building the temple indicates that those who are built into the church must pass through a considerable amount of God&rsquo;s cutting work.</p>
<p>Both the wood and stones which were used as building materials for the temple indicate that the materials for the building must pass through much work by God. Wood denotes death and resurrection, and stones denote man&rsquo;s need to be regenerated inwardly and dealt with outwardly. People in the church must not only pass through death and resurrection but must also have God&rsquo;s life and be dealt with by Him. Those who have been regenerated but not dealt with have no way to be built up. They may be living, but they also are raw and wild. They can be compared to freshly cut stones in a quarry that have not yet been built into a house.</p>
<p>When we consider the condition of some brothers and sisters, we cannot deny that they are stones; however, they are freshly cut stones. At this point, there is no way to be built with them. They are not stable enough to be built upon, nor are they stable enough to coordinate and serve with others, to fight the battle with others, or to bear the Ark with others. They have been regenerated, and they love the Lord, but they are not willing to be dealt with; consequently, they are full of sharp edges. They may be capable and quick-witted, but they cannot bear the testimony because they have never been dealt with.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters are too round and slippery. They are like rolling stones that can slip away no matter where they are placed. We can arrange certain things for them to do in the morning, but they sneak away in the afternoon. They may say, &ldquo;No problem, I will do it&rdquo;; however, once we turn around, they disappear. When this kind of person comes into the church to coordinate and serve, their round shape needs to be made square. There is the need for much cutting in order for them to become a certain size to match others. Then when others are placed above them, they can uphold them. In this way they will be able to coordinate and be built up with others wherever they are placed.</p>
<p>According to typology, wood signifies that the materials used for the building of the church must pass through death and resurrection, and stone signifies that the materials must be living and be dealt with. Those who have not passed through death and resurrection cannot be materials for the building of the church; moreover, those who have passed through death and resurrection must also be dealt with. Only those who have passed through death and resurrection and who have been dealt with can be materials for the building up of the church.</p>
