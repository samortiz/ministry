<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>FELLOWSHIP AND EXHORTATIONS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (16)</H1><P>Date:6:30 p.m., Thursday, April 22, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Nature:Testimonies by the co-workers, and exhortations<br>by Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TESTIMONIES</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Consecration through the Lord's Love</H2><P>Brother Du Chung-chun testified: I once consecrated myself to the Lord. For a few months I did not have a job, and I was left with twenty to thirty thousand dollars. Others were hoarding, but I would not do that. Others suggested that I should stock up on rice, but I did not do it. Later I almost committed suicide. I thought that I was quite good, that Satan would choose to attack me. I knew that Satan did not attack some others. This meant that they were worse than I was!</P><P>But then later I also did some hoarding. I bought medicines. On the one hand, I was condemning others for hoarding. But on the other hand, I was doing the same thing. It is bad enough for a man to be sick; it is worse when others hold back medicines from him. From that time on, I dared not despise others any more.</P><P>I was like Thomas, who would not believe until he saw with his own eyes. I did not consecrate myself, and I became very unhappy. Humanly speaking, consecration costs our life. But actually, it is the Lord who has loved us. If a mother asks a child for something, and if the child loves the mother, he will surely give it to her. But will the mother take the thing away and keep it for herself?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Everything Being in the Body</H2><P>Brother Lan Chi-i testified: I am a misguided man. I was brought up in a misguided environment, and I have been taught by misguided teachings. At the age of thirteen I was saved. Although I was misguided, the Father who has begotten me is not misguided. His leading and His demands are the same as His supply. The supply to meet the demands does not come from us, but from the Lord.</P><P>In 1939, Brother Nee spoke on the Body. He said that if a person leaves Christ, he cannot survive, and that in the same way, if a person leaves the Body of Christ, he also cannot survive. In our work and our living, we have to be in the Body. That revelation was like the shining of the sun to me; it outshone my dying lamp and made me feel ashamed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Forsaking All for the Lord<br>Not Being a Loss but a Gain</H2><P>Brother Chen Keh-san testified: After I was saved, someone said to me, "In what position you are called, you should remain in that position" (1 Cor. 7:20). I was deceived by this word. At that time I was the superintendent of the police department. Later, when I dropped the world, I shed many tears. Yet the Lord was moving within me. I have dropped many things, but it was not because I was afraid of the Communists.</P><P>From age twenty-four to twenty-six, I was the superintendent of the police department. After I was called, I felt that, should I have to give up the whole world to gain one soul only, it would have been worthwhile. I reckoned that even if I could get only one person saved during my whole life, it would be better than for me to gain the whole world. But a few days after I said this, I got one person saved already. You may think that what you have dropped is something great, but to the Lord it is a very small thing. What we have is very little. The Lord is the great ocean. Seemingly, when we forsake something, it is a loss to us. Actually, it is a gain.</P>
