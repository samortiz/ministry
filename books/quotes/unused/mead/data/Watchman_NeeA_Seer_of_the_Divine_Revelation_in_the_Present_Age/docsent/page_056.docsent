   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN POURED OUT AS A DRINK OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In November of 1948 and February of 1949, Watchman Nee called two urgent conferences in Shanghai for the leading co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the last of these conferences, after much prayer and consideration, Watchman Nee made the decision to remain in Shanghai for the work of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the one hand, he fully trusted in the Lord's sovereignty; on the other hand, he realized the risk and was prepared to be sacrificed for the Lord's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such willingness on his part was surely the supply of the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After he had made the decision to stay in Shanghai, he took immediate steps to carry out his second training in Kuling.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In January 1950, he visited Hong Kong with the intention of returning to the mainland after a brief stay.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brothers from different places advised him not to return and warned him of the risk.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, because of his burden for the churches, the co-workers, and the Lord's testimony on the mainland, without hesitation he determined to return.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this respect he was like the apostle Paul in Acts 20:24: "But I consider my life of no account as if precious to myself, in order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He realized the risks, but his will was firmly set and his spirit courageous to finish his course and to fulfill the ministry which he had received of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At this same time he received a cable from Swatow that his mother had died.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, because of the urgent need among the churches and co-workers on the mainland, he went directly to Shanghai from Hong Kong in the middle of March and left his mother's funeral in the hands of his eldest sister.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was a crucial time for the recovery in China.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Upon returning to Shanghai, he labored to care for the churches and the co-workers and to edify many believers who had turned to the Lord's recovery from denominations and free groups.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Anticipating what was soon to come, he also grasped the opportunity to publish the messages delivered in his two trainings at Kuling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was his hope that these messages could be preserved for the future benefit of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the spring of 1952, he was arrested and imprisoned; and in the summer of 1956, after a long trial, he was sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was, however, never released.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>During his imprisonment, only his wife was allowed an occasional visit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She passed away on November 7, 1971.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His wife's death was a great sorrow, and it cut him off from any contact with the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not long after her death, on May 30, 1972, Watchman Nee also came to the end of his pilgrimage on this earth and rested with Christ, whom he served at the cost of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His faith in the Lord never changed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He poured himself out as a drink offering upon the Lord's recovery for the care of the churches which were established through his ministry according to the vision and commission he received of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He fought a good fight, finished the course, and kept the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>During his imprisonment he was confined, but his ministry was not bound 2 Tim 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Under the Lord's sovereignty, his ministry has spread throughout the entire world as an anti-testimony to today's Christianity and a rich supply of life to all seeking Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His unique burden was the churches as the house of God, God's tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although his own earthly tabernacle has been dissolved, the churches, so much on his heart, are not only surviving but also continuing to grow vigorously and to spread widely on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"Though he has died, he still speaks."</S>
