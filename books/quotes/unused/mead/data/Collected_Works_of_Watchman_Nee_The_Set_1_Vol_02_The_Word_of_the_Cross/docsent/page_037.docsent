   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>My intention here is not to interpret the meaning of these few verses, but to mention the points related to the question being studied, i.e., where is heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This Lucifer, son of the dawn who fell from heaven, is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we compare this passage with Luke 10:18, Revelation 12:7-12, and 1 Timothy 3:6, we can see that this one is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, regardless of who he is, in these verses there is a clear and accurate mention of where heaven is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Isaiah 14:13 mentions the reason why this marvelous personified one fell.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was proud, desirous to rob the position of God and to be like the Most High.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore he received God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He fell from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, his original dwelling place was in heaven; therefore, he knows where heaven is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here the Bible says that heaven is above the stars of God, on the sides of the north, and above the heights of the clouds; it is also upon the mount of assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This Lucifer, son of the dawn, thought that if he could reach this position, he could be like the Most High.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can understand that heaven is above the stars of God and above the heights of the clouds.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet, what does it really mean for heaven to be on the sides of the north?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Let us first look into the meaning of "the mount of assembly" by reading a few passages in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"And he Micaiah said, Hear thou therefore the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And the Lord said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said, I will persuade him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And the Lord said unto him, Wherewith?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so" 1 Kings 22:19-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This passage clearly points out that the place where the throne of God is i.e. heaven, cf.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Matt 5:34 is the place of assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them" Job 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After verse 6, the book of Job mentions the question and answer which took place between God and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here, the sons of God no doubt refer to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the created ones, they were called the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Satan also came for the purpose of accusing the righteous cf.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rev 12:8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; / he judgeth among the gods.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>/ How long will ye judge unjustly....But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes" Psa 82:1-2, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God divided the universe into regions and ordered the created angels to govern them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These angels are "the mighty" and "the gods" referred to in this psalm cf.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John 10:34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God commanded them to do justice Psa 82:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, they sinned by walking in darkness v. 5 . Therefore the Lord judged their sins that they would be punished vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Daniel 4:17 refers to the "watchers" and the "holy ones."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These are the angels under God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They, being in the midst of God's assembly, know God's will and issue the decree.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to the above quotations, it seems that "the mount of assembly" must refer to the heaven where God meets with the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Isaiah 14:13 says He is "on the sides of the north."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our conclusion is that heaven is on the sides of the north.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Previously, we have said that heaven is "above."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This posed a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if we say that heaven is in the north, such a problem will not exist anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The four directions are east, west, south, and north.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>East and west differ from north and south logically.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For instance, though there is the distinction of east and west on earth, no one can distinguish between the far east and the far west.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If one travels towards the east, he will never reach the extreme east; eventually, he will return to his starting point.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is due to the fact that the shape of the earth is round.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is no possibility for one to reach the extreme east or the extreme west.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But north and south are different.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They are the two poles of the earth with the north being on the top and the south on the underside.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We often say "up north" or "down south," never "up south," or "down north."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>North is above.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we look at a map, we indicate east, west, south, and north by right, left, down, and up, respectively.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We also represent the four directions by our two hands, head, and feet.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our head represents the north, which is above.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, the verses quoted from the Scriptures above prove that heaven is above, which implies that heaven is in the north.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Isaiah 55:9 also says that the heavens are "higher than the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Except for the north, no other direction can be higher than the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The north of any place on earth always points to one direction.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This direction is above all other directions.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, north is the highest point.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If heaven is in any direction, then nothing more can be deduced.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But if heaven is in a certain direction and at the same time "higher than the earth," then heaven cannot be anywhere else but in the north.</S>
