   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The record of all the generations included in this book is a portrait of God's divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Adam we do not see much of God's expression and dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although Abel believed in God, we do not clearly see in him God's expression and dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Enosh realized that he was fragile and weak, and he began to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But in him we scarcely see God's expression or dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Enoch walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, we see in him a little of God's expression; however, we see nothing of God's dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although with Noah we do see a little of God's expression and dominion, it is rather vague; it is not definite, impressive, or clear.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Abraham we see less of God's expression and dominion than we do in Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although many Christians have overly exalted Abraham, he was only on the first level of the doctrine of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Abraham was the father of faith for justification, which is merely the beginning of the doctrine of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, we can hardly see God's expression and dominion in Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Isaac, the one who inherited everything from his father, only cared for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as he was given something good to eat, he would grant his blessing blindly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is in Jacob that we see the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, prior to the last fourteen chapters of this book, we do not see much of God's expression in Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in these last chapters we do see in him very much of the expression of God and the dominion of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although in this section Jacob was old in years, his spiritual eyes were very keen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Wherever he went, he perceived the real situation and blessed people accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, his blessing became God's prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Jacob truly bore the image of God and expressed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even Pharaoh, the highest ruler at that time, was under Jacob's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Jacob was brought into the presence of Pharaoh, Jacob did not say, "Hello, how are you?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How old are you?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, he stretched forth his hand and blessed him 47:7, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that Pharaoh was under Jacob, the one who was God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jacob's blessing upon the two sons of Joseph, Ephraim and Manasseh, was also a prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Isaac, cheated by Jacob, blessed him blindly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, Jacob's blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh was much different.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Joseph brought his two sons to Jacob, expecting that Manasseh, the firstborn, would receive the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But Jacob placed his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, the younger, "guiding his hands wittingly" 48:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Joseph attempted to move Jacob's hand from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's, Jacob refused and said, "I know it, my son, I know it" 48:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jacob seemed to be saying, "My son, you don't know what I am doing, but I know.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I know God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>My blessing is God's expression and God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The word of my blessing is God's prophecy."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here in Jacob we see a man who was one with God and who expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Jacob's speaking was God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not think that speaking is an insignificant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the New Testament, the Son expressed the Father mainly by His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord Jesus said, "Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works"; and, "The word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent Me" John 14:10, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, to express God is mainly to speak for God and to speak Him forth to others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have seen that Jacob, God's expression, bore the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But what about God's dominion?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The book of Genesis ends with Joseph exercising dominion over the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although Pharaoh was the king, he was merely a figurehead.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The acting king was Joseph, who is a part of Jacob in the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Jacob with Joseph we see the expression of God with the dominion of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Never separate Joseph from Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The record of the last fourteen chapters of Genesis mixes the two together.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This indicates that Joseph is the reigning part of Jacob, and that Jacob and Joseph should not be considered as separate persons.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this section Jacob was suffering, and Joseph was reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In chapter thirty-seven Joseph gave no impression that he was suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This chapter reveals that Jacob, not Joseph, was suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some may argue and say, "When Joseph was cast into the pit, was he not suffering?"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is your interpretation, but this chapter does not tell us this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Jacob, on the contrary, suffered greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although he did not weep at the death of Rachel, he wept sorrowfully when he concluded that Joseph had been devoured by a wild beast vv.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>33-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The record in the Bible has a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Genesis, a book of God's image and dominion, shows a complete picture of how human beings can be remade and transformed to express God in His image and to represent Him with His dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The last fourteen chapters of Genesis indicate that after Jacob had become Israel, he bore the image of God and exercised the dominion of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The book of Genesis is complete; it ends the way it begins.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It begins and ends with God's image and dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the closing chapters of Genesis, God must have been happy, and He could have said, "Now I have a man on earth expressing Me and representing Me. This man bears My image and exercises My dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>His words are My prophecy, and his actions are the exercise of My dominion."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the subject of the book of Genesis.</S>
