<h2 class="head1">THE OFFERING OF STRANGE FIRE<br />BY AARON'S SONS, NADAB AND ABIHU</h2><p>The evening before last we read Leviticus 8 concerning the sanctification of the house of Aaron for the holy priesthood. Chapter nine goes on to speak of Aaron and his house offering sacrifices and the commencement of their priestly service. In chapter ten we find Nadab and Abihu with strange fire. We should first go back to chapters eight and nine. Please note 8:2a, 6, 12-14a, 18, 22b-24, 27, 30-31, 36; 9:1, 8-9, 12, 18.</p><h2 class="head2">The Reason for Being Consumed<br />on Account of the Strange Fire</h2><p>Everyone who is learning to take the way of God's service has to see the seriousness of the story of Nadab and Abihu! They offered strange fire, which was not according to God's command. I am afraid you do not see the seriousness of this offense. God chose Aaron to be the high priest; He did not choose his sons to be the high priests. Aaron's sons became priests by virtue of being in their father's house. Aaron was the high priest. God chose Nadab and Abihu because Aaron's house was right in the sight of the Lord, not because they were right in God's sight personally. God chose the sons of Levi because of their ancestor; the choosing was unrelated to the sons themselves. Aaron's sons became priests after their father's footsteps. The Bible is careful to point out that in their priestly service, it was Aaron with his sons who handled the sacrifices on the altar. God appointed Aaron to be the authority, and his sons were to be under his authority. Leviticus 9:8-9, 12 tells us that Aaron was the one who offered sacrifices; his sons were only his helpers and learners. God had no intention that Nadab and Abihu would do anything by themselves. They saw what Aaron did, and they thought they could do the same. They began to do what God had not commanded them to do. They offered strange fire, which was not according to God's command. Before Aaron moved, they should not have moved. Aaron did not order them to offer the sacrifice; they did it of their own accord. This was strange fire. Nadab and Abihu should have followed Aaron alone. However, they thought that they could offer sacrifices as well, and they did so without Aaron's command. They were not acting under authority when they offered their sacrifices. First Samuel 15:22 says that "to obey is better than sacrifice." In this instance there was sacrifice but no obedience and no submission to authority. It was actually rebellion against God's authority. This is the reason fire came from God and consumed them.</p><h2 class="head2">God's Work Being a Coordination with Authority</h2><p>Our service to God is realized through our coordination with authority. This can be seen in the service of Aaron and his sons. Some people have to find the proper authority above them. Their place is to remain under others as helpers. Others have to stand above men and serve as authorities to many. Our work must be carried out in a good order and in coordination with authority. Unless we work this way, our endeavor will not be pleasing to God. We have read the story of Nadab and Abihu for many years. We have to clearly see that for Nadab and Abihu to act independently of Aaron was the same as for them to act independently of God. In Leviticus 8 and 9 Aaron and his sons were referred to repeatedly in the matter of the offering of sacrifices. God's work is carried out in the principle of coordination. No one can be responsible for a work alone. Rather, three, five, eight, or ten people have to work together like a family. Some should stand in the place of Aaron, while others should stand in the place of his sons. God sanctified both Aaron and his sons. In Leviticus 9 we see Aaron offering sacrifices as a priest and his sons helping him. But after Nadab and Abihu saw how Aaron offered sacrifices, they thought they could offer sacrifices in a similar manner. The result was judgment. Any service that has not been touched by authority is an offering of strange fire. Anyone who says, "Since So-and-so can do it, I can do it as well," is in rebellion. The same thing can be said of those who should follow others but do not.</p><p>Some have challenged Leviticus 8 and 9, saying, "If Aaron's sons were simply following Aaron, why did they need to be under authority?" Aaron's sons might have said, "What is so special about the sacrifices? We can offer the same." But remember, if we behave like Aaron's sons when they followed behind their father, we will bring blessing to others, and our service to God will be acceptable to Him; but if we take the initiative and shake off Aaron's authority, we will be offering strange fire, and the result will be death. I have often felt that an atmosphere of independent evangelism has developed in China since 1926 and 1927. Independent evangelism, however, means independence from coordination and authority. Such practice has inflicted great loss on the church in China. Much blessing has been lost because of a lack of vision in coordination. We have to see that in our service we must join ourselves to the authority that God has established. We have to see the seriousness of this matter. In our service to God, there is the need of coordination with authority.</p>
