   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>On man's side, we are also of three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Outwardly we have a body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Inside the body we have the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Within the soul is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, Paul said in 1 Thessalonians that God wants to sanctify our whole spirit, soul, and body 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although we are small, we are not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Within this small man, there are a lot of levels.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Outwardly we have a visible form.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Within this form there is a soul, which is our personality, the seat of our self.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the depth of our being, there is still one more part, which is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The spirit is for us to worship God and to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we exercise our mind, we will not find God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if we would forget our thoughts and would exercise our spirit to call "O Lord Jesus" a few times, we will touch God in the depth of our being and will feel that God has touched us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This proves that our spirit within us wants God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It also proves that God is real, true, and living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you call any other name such as that of Confucius or Washington, you will not have any feeling, even if you were to call a hundred times.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The reason for this is that they are all dead and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But if you call "O Lord Jesus" in whatever language, whether it be English, Korean, or Chinese, you will have a certain feeling within.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps you will feel that you have wronged Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Perhaps you will want to praise Him, or perhaps you will want to tell others how good Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This proves that Jesus is the living God, and He is living within you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I believe all of us who have believed in the Lord Jesus have this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, we have to see that the God revealed in the Bible is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We also are of three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Triune God desires to work Himself into the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, He enters into our spirit to regenerate us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Next, He wants to increase His territory within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He desires to expand from our spirit to our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This requires that we hand ourselves completely over to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to surrender to Him our mind, thoughts, emotion, love, and decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this matter we always have our reservations, and we are always debating and bargaining with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord is not satisfied with gaining our spirit only.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He wants to go one step further to gain our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What is sanctification?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be sanctified is to have the Lord Jesus gain our inward parts step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the Lord gains your mind, your mind is sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When He gains your emotion, your emotion is sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the renewing and transforming mentioned in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our spirit is sanctified already, but our soul must be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now the Lord is transforming us every day until the day He comes when He will transfigure our body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By then even our body will be sanctified, and He will gain all of the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our spirit, soul, and body will all be occupied and saturated by Him, and He will be fully manifested from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the basic thought of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God's economy is the Triune God working Himself bit by bit into us the tripartite men.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The revelation of the New Testament shows us that the Lord Jesus who saved us is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He desires to work the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, we the believers have the Father in us, the Son in us, and the Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul said in 2 Corinthians 13:14, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is enjoyed by us here.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How mysterious!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our God is not one but three.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But though He is three, yet He is still one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our human mind can never understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can only acknowledge it as such.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The entire Triune God is here; the love of the Father is here, the grace of the Son is here, and the fellowship of the Spirit is also here.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On our side, we are not of one part only.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rather, we are of three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Triune God is not just in our spirit; He is spreading out from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The question is whether or not we would allow Him to spread.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Are we willing to be subject to Him and to give Him all the ground?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we give Him all the ground, He will gain us completely to be His living members, coordinating with all the members to become His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The whole Bible is a record of this.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the Old Testament it is revealed in types.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the New Testament it is unfolded in revelation</S>
