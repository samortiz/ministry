   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONTENT OF GROUP MEETINGS With Humanity and Avoiding Leaven</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us consider the content of group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although in 1986 the number in the small groups increased from three thousand to over five thousand with an increase rate of seventy-five percent, the content of our group meetings has never been uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our past method was simply to have some refreshments and some casual talk.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These activities occupied a large portion of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although it is difficult to avoid having casual talk, I would like you to do your best to avoid this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, you should not avoid it to the extent that your behavior is as cold and stiff as a piece of rock or a piece of steel when you go to meet in others homes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You can be assured that this will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are human, and no human being can be without warmth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as we are living persons, we have humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only a dead person would fail to greet others or smile at them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We, however, are living persons, and sometimes we would even smile at cats and dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we always need to remember that we are going to contact people; since this is the case, we need to do it with a humanity that is adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christianity has been on the earth for almost two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their way of gaining people in general is through preaching, on the one hand, and through the use of other things, on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These other things are the leaven hidden in the fine flour, as mentioned in Matthew 13:33.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Old Testament, the fine flour is for the meal offering Lev 2:1 , and the meal offering signifies Christ as food for both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Concerning the meal offering, God has a strict ordinance that no leaven is allowed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In conjunction with this, things that will ferment, such as honey, are also not allowed Lev 2:4-5, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only salt is allowed in the fine flour, because salt kills germs.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Matthew 13, the Lord Jesus likens Himself to the fine flour, whereas the woman is the great harlot in Revelation 17, who is the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She has mixed the pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil things into the teachings concerning Christ, and thus changed the nature of their content.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In all of the works of Christianity today, there is not much that is without leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, in the Chinese Christian work in the United States, the thing most commonly seen is social friendship, which is something of leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Their workers only render help to people outwardly; they do not bring people into Christ, nor do they bring Christ into people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The messages given do not have much truth, and they gain people mostly through social activities.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am afraid that about eighty percent of those attending their meetings are there for social friendship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rendering Help to People</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>for the Dispensing of the Triune God into Them</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Apparently, Christianity has brought in many people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, their gain is not that large because those who go to them are mostly there for some outward help.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is like what the Lord Jesus said in John 6, You seek Me...because you ate of the bread and were satisfied v. 26 . They did not desire the Lord or seek after Him in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The situation today is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are, indeed, many hardships in human life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, when you go to help the new ones, you need to weigh carefully how much outward help you should render to them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You should not think that as long as you do your best to help others, it will be effective.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You have to realize that there is no end to people s demand for help.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, we need to set a limit to this kind of thing, and the limit should depend on the circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we cannot bring a person into Christ in a practical way, though we have tried our best, we simply have to put this one aside temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot spend all of our effort only to care for this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, when you go out, you should not be bothered too much by these things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the one hand, you should not be cold and stiff toward people; you always need to cause people to feel warm.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the other hand, you should not be snared by this; otherwise, you will not be able to do anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is something that we have been guarding against for years.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not that we have no heart to help others, but sometimes we do not dare to do too much.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the principle of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the crowd who had been fed with bread came to force Him to be king, He retreated to the mountains, Himself alone.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The next day they looked all around for the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Later they found Him by the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then the Lord told them that the Son of Man came not to feed people with bread, but to dispense Himself as the bread of life into men John 6:24-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What He did the day before was merely a symbolic act to show people that they are hungry and that He is the bread that came down from heaven to give life to man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the same principle, it is not that today we do not care for people; rather, we care for people within a limit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Most people consider the church as a charitable organization with a goal of seeking the welfare of the society.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You cannot say that this is absolutely wrong, but this is not the commission we received from God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The commission that we have received from God is to dispense the Triune God into people to be everything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This, then, is the real blessing to man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must hold on to this point firmly.</S>
