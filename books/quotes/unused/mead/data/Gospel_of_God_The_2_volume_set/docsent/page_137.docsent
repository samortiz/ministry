   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY OF SALVATION NOT BEING PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We come now to the fifth "not being."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are many people who will add another condition to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not law-keeping or good behavior, nor is it repentance or confession.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They say that a person must pray in order to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They base their claim on Romans 10: "Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved" v. 13 . As a result, some believe that they must beseech God before they can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On a number of occasions I have encountered some people who wanted to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They said, "Daily I plead with God to save me, and I still do not know when He will do so.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have been praying for three months without any inward sensation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I just do not know if God will see fit to save me."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have also met some others who said, "I am waiting for the Holy Spirit to come and move me to my knees to ask Jesus to save me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am not saved as yet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I must wait for the Spirit to inspire me to pray before I can be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason, we need to see whether a man needs to pray before he can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, one seeks to be saved through praying and begging because he is entirely ignorant of God's love and God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He thinks that God hates man, and therefore he must pray for God to change His mind before He will save him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He gives himself to pray, without knowing how much he has to pray before God will hear him or listen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Remember how Elijah challenged the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He challenged them to ask their god to send down fire.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The prophets "cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them" 1 Kings 18:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They supposed that Baal would listen if they would only inflict more pain upon their own bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today there are those who also think that if they bring distress upon themselves and plead enough with God, He will have compassion on them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These kinds of people have never seen the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because they have never seen God in the light of the gospel, they believe that their begging before God will turn His heart towards them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually there is no need for God to turn His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His heart has long been turned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are the ones who need a turn of heart, because we rejected and opposed Him, and we did not believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second Corinthians 5:19 says, "God in Christ was reconciling the world to Himself."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God did not wrong man; it is man who has wronged God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There has never been a need for God to be reconciled to man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, man has to be reconciled to God because it is man who is totally at fault.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The problem is not with God, but with man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everyone who desires to understand the gospel ought to know that God is love and that He loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He has no problem with us, and neither do we need to plead with Him.</S>
