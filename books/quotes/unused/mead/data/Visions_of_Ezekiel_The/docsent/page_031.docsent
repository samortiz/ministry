   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE MAN UPON THE THRONE Scripture Reading: Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1:26-28; Exo 24:10; Gen 9:11-17; Rev 3:21; 4:2-3; 21:19-20; 22:1; Matt 26:64; Acts 2:36; Heb 2:10</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe we all were impressed from the previous chapters that in the Christian life and in the church life we need a clear sky with a throne in it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all need such a life, a life with a clear sky which has the throne of the Lord in it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To have a clear sky indicates that we have no clouds between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It means that our conscience is void of offense we have nothing between us and God and nothing between us and others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To have the throne means that we are under the ruling of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are not free to go where we choose or to speak what we please.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are under His ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this chapter, we will consider the One Who is sitting on the throne 1:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we have seen before, He looks like a man, but He is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the throne He looks like a man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is absolutely different from the human and religious concept.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Most of the time our concept is that the One on the throne is the almighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Have you ever considered that the Lord on the throne is not only the almighty God, but also a man?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The One who sits on the throne is a man!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet, the following verse says that this is the appearance of the glory of the Lord 1:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He looks like a man on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Most Christians do understand that when the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was a man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They realize that from the time He was in the manger in Bethlehem to the time He was on the cross at Golgotha, He was a man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was fully a man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But, they may never have considered that the Lord Who is on the throne today is still a man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although He is the Lord, the almighty God, on the throne He looks like a man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>GOD DESIRING A MAN</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I must repeat that God's intention is to have a man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God desires to have a man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even He Himself became a man, and today on the throne He is still a man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>People want to be like God, but God wants to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some Christians are always dreaming of being like God, but God desires to be like man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's intention is to work Himself into us, making us like Him, and even the more, making Himself like us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He became a man, and He is still a man on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must be impressed that He is a man!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the book of Ezekiel, the term "son of man" is used over ninety times, indicating how much God desires to have a man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>BRINGING MAN TO THE THRONE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must also see that God's intention is to work upon man in order that man can be on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We would perhaps be satisfied to go to heaven, but God will not be satisfied for us merely to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God will not be satisfied until we are on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Have you ever been told that God's intention is to bring you to the throne?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some Christians might say that as long as they could stand inside the door of heaven they would be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This might satisfy them, but it will not satisfy God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Until He brings us to the throne, He will not be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's intention is that all of us would be on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Revelation 3:21, the Lord Jesus promised the overcomers that they would sit upon His throne even as He overcame and was sitting on the throne of His Father.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord Jesus was saying that He became a man, and as a man He went to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God's intention is to take us to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's kingdom can never come in full until we are on the throne, and God's enemy will never be subdued until we are on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God's goal is not merely to deliver us out of hell, but to bring us to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But, we must look at our present condition.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are sloppy and loose.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It seems that in this country to be modern is to be sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Young people buy a good pair of pants and then cut them off to increase their looseness and sloppiness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This kind of looseness comes from Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am very happy to see that many so-called hippies have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But, I feel very sorry for the hippy Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They have no human sensation of how to behave themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even when they sit, they sit in a sloppy way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It seems the more they are relaxed and sloppy, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yes, the Lord is going to take you to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But are you ready to be on the throne?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When you arrive at the throne, will you sit there in your sloppy way?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I am not for the forms in formal Christianity, but neither am I for today's looseness and sloppiness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you mean business as a Christian and a disciple of the Lord Jesus, you can never be loose and sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I do believe that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was never loose and sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He never behaved Himself in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some of the young people have no conscience and no sensation of how to have a proper human life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They are like birds in the sky with no sensation of how to be a proper human being.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>How can they be on the throne?</S>
