	<li>The Spirit of Christ in the Old Testament prophets made them clear concerning Christ coming as grace to us through His incarnation, His sufferings in His human living and crucifixion, and His glories in His resurrection, ascension, second coming, and reigning for the application of God&rsquo;s full salvation to us&mdash;vv. 5, 9-11; cf. Psa. 22; Isa. 53; Dan. 9:26.</li>
	<li>The Spirit of Christ, in His eternal function, was in the Old Testament prophets, making them clear concerning Christ coming to the New Testament believers to be the all-sufficient and unlimited grace of God&rsquo;s full salvation to them for their entry into the joy of the Lord in the kingdom age, which is the salvation of their souls&mdash;John 1:17; Heb. 10:29b; Matt. 25:21, 23; 1 Pet. 1:9.</li>

	</ol></li>
<li><em>Grace with God</em> in 1 Peter 2:19-20 refers to the motivation of the divine life within us and its expression in our living, which becomes in our behavior gracious and acceptable in the eyes of both man and God:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Grace as the processed Triune God for our enjoyment becomes our inward motivation and outward expression in our intimate fellowship with God and our consciousness of God; we all have to learn how to have grace, which is to take grace, possess grace, use grace, and apply grace&mdash;Heb. 12:28.</li>

<li>The grace of life is the inheritance of all the believers, whether strong or weak&mdash;3:7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The grace of life is God as life and the life supply to us in His Divine Trinity&mdash;the Father as the source of life, the Son as the course of life, and the Spirit as the flow of life, who flows within us, with the Son and the Father, as grace to us&mdash;1 John 5:11-12; John 7:38-39; Rev. 22:1.</li>

	</ol></li>
<li>The varied grace of God indicates the riches of the grace of God in its varieties ministered by the saints one to another&mdash;1 Pet. 4:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The varied grace of God is the rich supply of life, which is the Triune God ministered into us in many aspects&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14; 12:9.</li>
	<li>We need to be good stewards of the varied grace of God, speaking the words of grace as the oracles of God and ministering out of the strength and power of grace, which God supplies&mdash;1 Pet. 4:10-11; Luke 4:22; Eph. 3:2; 4:29.</li>

	<li>We must be willing to be made humble, lowly, under the mighty hand of God in His discipline and to throw our life with its care upon God, because He cares for us lovingly and faithfully&mdash;1 Pet. 5:5-7; cf. Psa. 55:22.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The God of all grace&mdash;who has called the believers into His eternal glory&mdash;perfects, establishes, strengthens, and grounds them through their sufferings; this &ldquo;all grace&rdquo; is the &ldquo;true grace of God,&rdquo; into which the believers should enter and in which they stand&mdash;1 Pet. 5:10, 12.</li>
<li>The true grace of God is the grace in which, together with the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the believers should grow unto His glory both now and unto the day of eternity&mdash;2 Pet. 3:18:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This is the concluding word of the apostle Peter&rsquo;s writings, indicating that whatever he has written is of, in, by, and through the grace of God.</li>
