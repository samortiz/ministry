<h2 class="head2">Group Meetings Needing to Include<br />
Singing and Praying but without Any Form</h2>
<p>We should never let the saints chat and talk endlessly in the group meetings and neglect to sing and pray. This is not proper. We need to sing and pray, but we should not do so in a formal and rigid way. The advantage of group meetings is that they do not have forms; only when there is no form can the new ones feel related to the saints and be drawn to the meeting. In this kind of gathering we can bring the new ones onto the right track by leading them and enabling them to have contact with the saints and gradually bring them into the district meetings. This is to serve them in order to bring them from a small meeting to a larger meeting of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Goal of the Group Meetings Being<br />
to Bring the Believers into Mutual Acquaintance, Fellowship, Encouragement,<br />
Strengthening, Care, and Intercession</h2>
<p>The goal of the group meetings is to bring the believers into the practice of being mutually acquainted, having mutual fellowship, being mutually encouraged, being mutually strengthened, rendering mutual care, and having mutual intercession; this is the goal that we should attain to. Personal testimonies and fellowship concerning actual situations are very beneficial to the attaining of this goal (Heb. 10:25). We should encourage everyone to give their testimonies and share their actual situations. For instance, they can fellowship regarding physical illnesses, family problems, business difficulties, and so forth. However, we also need to exercise some direction in this matter. It does not mean that once we open up, we need to tell everything. For example, someone may be going through a divorce or separation, and it would not be appropriate for him to share with everyone all the things taking place between himself and his wife. We always need to direct the meetings in the way that the saints may fellowship properly. All fellowship is for the purpose of enabling the brothers and sisters to know one another&rsquo;s actual situation and to help and care for one another with a spirit of care.</p>
<p>What is spoken above are some main points in regard to leading the new ones to join the group meetings. It is difficult to practice the group meetings. If an elder learns how to practice the group meetings, he has done quite well. We need to know that a group meeting is a miniature church life, and it is a test to the elders as to their ability to handle different situations and lead well. An elder who is incapable of leading a group meeting is incapable of leading a church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: I am planning to give my time, that is, to serve full time beginning next month. What can I do when I actually begin to serve?</em></p>
<p>Answer: There are many things that you can do. First of all, you should go door-knocking. At present, there are ninety-five districts in Taipei, and if all are faithful to labor in a regular and steady way, by the end of the year every district will be able to produce another district; as a result, there will be nearly two hundred districts. Every district will need at least one elder. Of course, we hope that the elders are strong in every aspect. The northern Chinese like to hire Canton maids because they are very capable. They can handle everything in the house, including cooking and taking care of children; they are famous in northern China. If in the church life a new group is produced every six months, such a group will need an elder as capable as a Canton maid. In this way four hundred districts may be produced in the future.</p>
<p>Every district needs an elder who is strong in speaking, leading, administrating, and caring. When this kind of elder comes to a district, the district will be different. This kind of elder is like a Canton maid. However, Shantung maids are altogether different. Once they finish cooking and put down the wok, they pay no attention to the dirty floor or the crying children; they do not care about anything. Hence, people do not like to hire Shantung maids. We are afraid of elders who are like Shantung maids. Once a district has this kind of elder, it is finished, but if a district has an elder who is like a Canton maid, it will be successful. I hope that every elder among us is like a Canton maid; then the church will be blessed.</p>
<p>If we look at the situation of the district meetings in Taipei, we will see that it would be easy for every district to produce a new district within a year. In fact, if every district has an elder who is like a Canton maid, there will be not only a twofold increase but also an endless and continuous increase. This is why I like the new way. The new way will definitely be a success. We have already seen the first sign of success, and we have also seen some fruit.</p>
<p>In short, we will surely gain people by going out to preach the gospel, provided that everyone labors diligently. Then in order to keep the new ones after we gain them, we need to lead them to establish home meetings and join group meetings. Eventually, we will need to bring them to the district meetings. An important aspect in regard to the district meetings is that the speaking needs to be strengthened. This strengthening relies on the elders being like Canton maids. Without this kind of elder, the meetings will be lacking, but with this kind of elder, the meetings will definitely be rich.</p>
