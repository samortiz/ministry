   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RINGS DIVORCED FROM THE GRATING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do you realize what is the situation in today s Christianity with respect to the grating and the rings?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The situation is this: the rings have been divorced from the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The fundamentalists have the grating without the rings; the Pentecostals have some kind of rings separate from the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Lord s recovery the four rings are brought back to the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For the most part, we are opposed not because of the grating, but mainly because of our testimony concerning the rings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There has been some opposition because of our teaching concerning the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You know that I have given messages on Christ being made in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In these messages I pointed out that on the cross Christ was in the form of the serpent John 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some opposing ones, twisting my word, accused me of teaching that Christ had the nature of the fallen flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such an accusation comes from their blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Have these opposers never considered Paul s strong word in 2 Corinthians 5:21?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this verse Paul says that Christ was made sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In my messages I emphasize the fact that, according to Romans 8:3, Christ was in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, referring to the type of the brass serpent lifted up on a pole by Moses in the wilderness, I said that the brass serpent was in the form of an actual serpent, but that it did not have the poisonous nature of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Likewise, Christ was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He did not have a sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who oppose this truth have only a shallow understanding of Christ as our Savior and Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They have not been enlightened from the Word to see that Christ was in the likeness of the flesh of sin and even became sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we have pointed out, most of the opposition is related to our testimony that Christ today is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Regarding the mingling, some have gone so far as to accuse us of teaching pantheism or the deification of man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The accusations concerning Christ being the Spirit involve the Trinity, the Person of Christ, and the mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All these matters are related to the four rings, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many Christians today have an altar that lacks the proper connection between the four rings and the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some have the grating without the rings, but others have the rings without the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who have the grating may have it only in a superficial way without the connection of the rings, and those who have the rings may actually have the wrong kind of rings and without the connection to the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>GOD S REQUIREMENTS FULFILLED</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have pointed out that the grating is at half the height of the altar, halfway between the top and the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that there were one and one-half cubits above the grating and one and one-half cubits below it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was equal to the height of the ark of the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The dimensions of the ark were two and one-half cubits in length and width and one and one-half cubits in height.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, the height of the ark was half the height of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the grating signifying Christ s all-inclusive and completed redemption was placed on a level with the height of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On top of the ark of the testimony was the propitiation-cover.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On this cover all the requirements of God s righteousness, holiness, and glory were fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This enabled God to come to commune with man on the propitiation-cover.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because God s requirements had been fulfilled, this place was called the throne of grace Heb 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fact that the grating of the altar was level with the cover of the ark indicates that Christ s redemption was accomplished according to the standard of God s requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There were one and one-half cubits both above and below the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This indicates that the redemption of Christ was not accomplished according to a standard lower than the requirements of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, it was accomplished at a standard which was up to the height of God s requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moreover, the fact that there were one and one-half cubits above the grating indicates that the effectiveness, the efficacy, of Christ s redemption also comes up to the standard of God s requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To repeat, with the altar of the burnt offering we have a height of three cubits in two sections, with each section measuring one and one-half cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The one and one-half cubits below the grating signify that Christ s redemption was accomplished according to the high standard of God s requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The one and one-half cubits above the grating signify that the effectiveness of Christ s redemption is also according to the standard of these requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, we have two crucial matters: the eternal Spirit and the standard of God s requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ offered Himself to accomplish redemption through the eternal Spirit, and the standard for this accomplishment of redemption was the standard of God s requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And the standard of the efficacy of Christ s redemption also is equal to the height of God s requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The two matters of the eternal Spirit and the standard of God s requirements are covered in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The redemption of Christ is powerful because it is linked to the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The redemption of Christ is also effective because it was accomplished according to the standard of God s requirements, and its efficacy matches these requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the revelation concerning the cross of Christ in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although the record of the altar in Exodus 27 is simple and brief, it is very rich in spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The significance of the altar is seen in the four rings connected to the grating, and in the location of the grating at half the height of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because these points are important, they are emphasized in the divine record.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The ledge, on the contrary, is not given much emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I definitely believe that the ledge protected the four walls of the altar from the heat of the fire burning on the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Otherwise, the wood inside the overlying brass would be scorched by the constant heat.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For this reason, I do not believe that the ledge was made of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Instead, I believe it was made of bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The ledge on the four sides of the altar may also have limited the space used for burning.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Since the altar was five cubits wide and five cubits long, the ledge on each side could have been a half cubit in width.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This still would have left an area four cubits by four cubits for burning the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Furthermore, it would then have been possible for certain utensils to be kept on the ledge.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although I feel quite sure concerning the significance of the four rings, I certainly do not insist on my understanding of the ledge.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Regarding this, I simply make an inference, since there is no sure evidence in the written Word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But if the ledge did not serve as a protection, how would the walls have been protected from the heat of the fire?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There must have been some kind of protection, and this protection may have been afforded by the ledge.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need to have more understanding, more apprehension, of the cross and of Christ s redemption according to the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Because the revelation concerning the cross is presented piece by piece, it is not easy to see a complete picture.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We can see such a picture only when all the pieces of the puzzle are put together.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We praise the Lord for helping us to see more concerning the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What we understand of the cross of Christ should not simply be a doctrine to us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We need the real experience of this.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hallelujah, we have Christ, and we have the eternal Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Actually, Christ Himself is the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>On the cross He was the redeeming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But in our experience He is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The four rings were closely connected to the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Furthermore, the grating and the rings were of the same material, bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Thus, there was a true identification of the bronze grating and the bronze rings.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This indicates that the grating is identical to the four rings, that Christ today is identical to the life-giving Spirit.</S>
