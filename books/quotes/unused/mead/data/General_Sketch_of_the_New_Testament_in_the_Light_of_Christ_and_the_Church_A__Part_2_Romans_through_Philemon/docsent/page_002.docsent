   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE CONDEMNATION AND JUSTIFICATION IN ROMANS Scripture Reading: Rom 1:28; 2:15, 17; 3:21-25; 4:25; 5:10-11 THE CONTENT AND SECTIONS OF ROMANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Romans is composed of five main sections.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The fourth section, chapters nine through eleven may be considered as a parenthetical section, dealing with God's selection by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The four other main sections are condemnation, justification, sanctification including conformation and glorification , and transformation for practicing the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These are all structured in a very good sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first section, the section of condemnation, reveals that all mankind is in a fallen condition, condemned by God under His righteous law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The second section, on justification, clearly reveals that we are justified through the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Concerning the third section, most Bible expositors use one word sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, the word sanctification is not adequate to express the full content of this section.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is preferable to say that sanctification includes the processes of conformation to the image of the Son of God and glorification, the redemption of our body, in which we will be glorified together with Him 8:29, 17, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Having been justified, we are now in the process of sanctification and conformation until the day that the Lord comes back, when we will be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These three matters are dealt with in this section.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Most students of the Scriptures pay attention only to sanctification; they neglect conformation and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Regeneration is accomplished in our spirit, but 12:2 shows us that after the Lord regenerates us in our spirit, He transforms us in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that our soul, our very being, must be conformed to the image of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition, glorification is accomplished in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, we experience sanctification and conformation in our soul and eventually glorification in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The fifth main section of Romans continues the third section, dealing with our Christian walk.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>While we are in the process of transformation and conformation, and before the time of our glorification, we are living on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The manner of our living is dealt with from chapter twelve through chapter sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although many things are covered in this section, the main thought is the Body life, the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Chapter twelve speaks of the Body life, and chapter sixteen reveals the genuine practice of the Body life, indicating that the first item of the Christian walk is the Body life, and the last item of the Christian walk is also the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the regenerated ones are members of Christ's Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's intention in transforming us is to make us the living, functioning members of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The conclusion of Romans is that while we are here on this earth, we practice the Body life as His living, functioning members.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the content and the sections of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>CONDEMNATION</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let us now look at some of the details in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the first five books of the New Testament there is the history of the universal man, who is Christ as the Head and the church as the Body composed of His many members.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now in the definition of the universal man, we have a full picture that we as the many members of His mysterious and wonderful Body were originally sinful before God and under His condemnation according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no other book or portion of the Scriptures that tells us that we are sinful in the eyes of God as fully as the first three chapters of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I expect that all the young brothers and sisters would spend the time to study this book.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should spend an adequate time to study it because it gives us a full sketch and understanding of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not too much to spend even one year to study it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need two or three months just to study the first section alone.</S>
