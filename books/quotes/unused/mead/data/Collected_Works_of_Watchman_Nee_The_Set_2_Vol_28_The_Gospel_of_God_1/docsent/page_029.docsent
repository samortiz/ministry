   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE WORK OF CHRIST REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By the grace of God, we have seen in the past few evenings what God's salvation is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Tonight is the sixth evening.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I hope to give a quick review of what we have covered in the previous five meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we will continue.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have seen sin, the law, God's love, His grace, and His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have seen how man became a sinner and how the law came in to expose man's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have also seen that though man is proved to be a sinner, God still loves him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not only has God loved us, but He has also shown us mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have also seen how God's grace has been manifested, what the nature of this grace is, how it came about, and that it can never be mixed with human effort.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Last night we saw that, in spite of God's love and His desire to give us grace, there was one hindrance to grace's coming to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If one thing had been left unsettled, God's grace could not have come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Though grace is now here to reign, it reigns only through righteousness Rom 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Grace cannot reign by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the Lord showed us how righteousness was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His righteousness has dealt with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the same time, it enables us to receive grace from God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have covered these during the last five evenings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now, we will go on with the gospel of God and His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The salvation accomplished by God through the Lord Jesus has manifested God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the same time, it satisfies God's righteous requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At this time we will cover the work of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is an excellent and sweet subject.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It deals with the way the Lord Jesus accomplished God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to see how the Lord Jesus satisfied God's demand and how He has manifested God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the same time, we have to see how the Lord Jesus satisfies the heart of the Christian so that we would be satisfied with His work also.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A song which we sing says, "God's heart is satisfied with the work of the Lord Jesus, and our hearts are also at rest with His work."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is satisfied, and we are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If time permits, I hope that we can cover both of these aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE LORD JESUS BEING BOTH GOD AND MAN</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first thing we have to see is that the Lord Jesus is God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may say that only God can bear man's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Never consider the Lord Jesus as a third person coming to die a substitutionary death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not think that God is one party, we are another party, and the Lord Jesus is a third party.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Bible never considers the Lord Jesus as a third party.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the contrary, it considers Him as the first party.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You may have been told that the gospel is like a debtor, a lender, and the lender's son.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The debtor has no money to pay back his debt.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The lender, being very severe, insists on the payment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the lender's son steps forth to pay the debt on behalf of the debtor, and the debtor becomes free.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the gospel that man preaches today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But this is not the real gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If this were the case, at least two points would not be fair and would be contrary to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First, this kind of understanding makes God the mean One and the Lord Jesus the gracious One.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In such an illustration, we do not see God loving the world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, we see only His righteous demand and the demand of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We see a severe God, One who is without grace and One whose words to man are always harsh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We see that the Lord Jesus loves us and gives grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is a wrong gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, although this is a wrong gospel, God still uses it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Actually, I was saved through this kind of illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But although I was saved, during the first three years I could never praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I always felt that the Lord Jesus was good, that I should thank and praise Him, that without Him everything was hopeless, and that it was fortunate that He came.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But I felt that God was very harsh, severe, and mean.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was not at all lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It seemed that everything good was with the Lord Jesus and everything bad was with God, that God is terrible and the Lord Jesus is lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But this is not the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible says that God so loved the world that He gave His Son to us John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God sent His Son to us because He loved us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is why we were brought back to God after the Lord Jesus accomplished His work on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If God had not loved us and had not sent us the Lord Jesus, the most that the Lord Jesus could have done would have been to bring people back to Himself; He could not have brought people back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thank the Lord that the One who loved us is God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thank Him that He Himself sent His Son to us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It was the Father who was moved with compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It was the Father who loved us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It was the Father who planned out salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It was the Father who had a will in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>First, the Father purposed everything, and then the Son came.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hence, it is wrong for man to think that there are three parties.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There are only two parties, God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord Jesus is God's gift to man.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, this gift is something living and with a will, rather than lifeless and without a will.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Thank God that salvation is something between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord Jesus is a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today the One we have to face is God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We come to God through the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is the first thing we have to realize.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Second, if there were three parties, the Lord Jesus would not have been qualified to die for us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is true that when the Lord Jesus died for us, God's righteousness was met and man's sins were forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But is this righteous to the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Suppose there are two brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>One brother has committed a capital crime and has been sentenced to death.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The other brother is very willing to die for him and is therefore executed on his behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He is innocent, and also a third party.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He dies instead of the other.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Bible does not show us that the Lord Jesus died for us this way.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It does not show us that God had a demand, that His law had to be satisfied, and that in order for man to meet the law's demand, the Lord Jesus came to fulfill God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What position did the Lord Jesus take when He came to accomplish redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We have to consider this matter carefully and accurately from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I would like you to be aware of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The world thinks that there is only one way to deal with the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Preachers who preach wrong teachings say that there are three ways to deal with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>But for God, there are only two ways to deal with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Some explanation is needed here.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Before one reads the Word of God, he may think that any of three ways can solve the problem: man can solve it, God can solve it, or a third party can also solve it by substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The unsaved ones who do not know God consider that there is only one solution, which is for man to solve it by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>But God's righteousness shows us that there are only two ways to solve the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>One is by God Himself and the other is by man himself.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>What do I mean by this?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Let us first consider what man thinks.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He thinks that he is a sinner and should therefore bear the judgment of sin and the wrath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He thinks that he should perish and go into perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The only way is for him to solve the problem by going to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>He will take responsibility for what he has done.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If one sins, he goes to hell and bears his own judgment of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is one way to solve the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>When one owes money, he sells all that he has.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>He may even have to sell his wife, children, house, and land, if that is what it takes to solve the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Then there is the other wrong concept.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>For those who have heard the gospel, they consider that the Lord Jesus is a third party coming to take our place and solve the problem of our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Man has sinned and has incurred the judgment of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Now all the judgment is laid on the Lord Jesus; He bears all the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Such a teaching seems right.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>But you will see shortly that this is not accurate.</S>
