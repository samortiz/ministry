	 <h2 class="head1">THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK HAVING MANY ASPECTS</h2>
<p>There is not a definite way to take care of the children&rsquo;s work. There should not be only one aspect to the children&rsquo;s work. There should be many locations for the children&rsquo;s work, meetings can be held at different times, and we can use different methods to conduct the children&rsquo;s meetings. There should also be many goals. The teaching material should also cover many aspects.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Many Locations</h2>
<p>Having a children&rsquo;s meeting only in the meeting hall will be a great hindrance to its further development. The children may not all be able to travel to the meeting hall, and the meeting hall may not have sufficient space for the meeting. In the church in Anaheim there are more than ten rooms for children&rsquo;s meetings, but the space is still not enough. Furthermore, the rooms are used only for a few hours every week and have no other use. This is not cost efficient. Even if we have many rooms, it will not be easy for all the children to come to the meeting hall for a scheduled meeting. Their meetings must have many locations.</p>
<p>According to our study, the most effective way is similar to the way we propagate the gospel. Every saint should open his home and have a children&rsquo;s meeting in his home. If a home has no children, then it is up to the individual saint to decide whether he would open his home. Nevertheless, it is best to have the burden to open one&rsquo;s home for the children. Most of the older sisters are burdened for the children. If their children are abroad or married and their circumstances allow them, they should open their home for a children&rsquo;s meeting. They can invite five or six children from the neighborhood to have a children&rsquo;s meeting. They do not have to worry about how to have the meeting, because the church will prepare material for them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Material</h2>
<p>We have considered using videotaped material, which some localities use. In Texas some of the children&rsquo;s meetings watch videotapes prepared for the children. We want to produce a video that shows children from various countries wearing their traditional dress and singing the hymns. There would be Japanese children wearing the kimono, Korean children wearing the hanbok, Chinese children wearing Chinese quilted jackets, and Indonesian children wearing the sarong. The children would enjoy watching such a video. After watching the video, we can help the children identify the different nationalities and then say something concerning God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Many Purposes</h2>
<p>We can open our homes once or twice a week, even on Saturday afternoons and during vacation time, to invite children to our homes to have a children&rsquo;s meeting. We can also contact the children&rsquo;s parents and preach the gospel to them and to their relatives. This is the principle of our gospel work. The more people we contact, the better. In this way, over a period of time there will spontaneously be an effect. We believe that out of every ten children we care for, three or four will be saved. They might not get saved at this time, but at a later time in their life they will remember something and return to the church. It will be easier for these ones to be saved.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Many Ways</h2>
<p>The households with children can take the initiative to open their homes and ask their children to invite other children in the neighborhood. The children can watch the children&rsquo;s videotapes, sing children&rsquo;s songs, or listen to a story. This is the way to have a children&rsquo;s meeting once a week.</p>
<p>We have about five hundred fifty children among us. The children between the ages of six and twelve come from roughly four hundred families. If each of the four hundred families opened their home for a children&rsquo;s meeting with ten children, there would be four thousand children meeting in four hundred homes. If we include the homes of the saints who do not have children but are willing to open their homes, it will be easy to reach a total of ten thousand children. This is one of the many ways we can use to preach the gospel. This is also the way to gain something long-term. We hope that the whole church will hear this fellowship and take action.</p>
<p>The meeting hall also has its use, but that might mainly be to babysit children. We will not be able to separate the children into smaller groups, because of a lack of rooms and teachers. When the saints come to a meeting, their children can watch a videotape, sing, and be spiritually cultivated.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Different Meeting Times</h2>
<p>Furthermore, it is best to have different meeting times for the children&rsquo;s meetings. The schedule should be flexible. The meetings do not have to be on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Saturday afternoon is also a good time. We need to utilize the time when the children are out of school to have children&rsquo;s meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CRUCIAL MATTERS</h2>
<p>The way to carry out the children&rsquo;s work depends on the brothers taking the lead in the children&rsquo;s work. They should determine how to contact the opened homes and how to lead the saints to receive a burden and be faithful. If every home can open to invite children, we will have enough meeting places and manpower. Furthermore, if some saints are designated to prepare teaching material, the saints will not need to labor that much. We can give only some principles related to the children&rsquo;s work. It is up to the saints to carry them out. We also need the elders to promote this matter. If we are diligent, we will gain many people year after year. The children&rsquo;s work will become one source of increase. It is worthwhile for the elders to promote the children&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>We should not make any special arrangements to get teachers for the children&rsquo;s meetings in the meeting halls. Rather, we should find a number of younger brothers and sisters who meet regularly to be the teachers. Children of various ages can be gathered into one room, and two or three younger saints can tell them stories, sing songs with them, or let them watch a video. This kind of service does not require much manpower. The saints who are between the ages of twenty and thirty can take care of the children. In order to reach the goal of having a large number of children, we need to mobilize the entire church. All the saints need to function for this to prosper.</p>
<p>We need to prepare material for the children&rsquo;s meeting. We should not have children&rsquo;s meetings without preparation. The brothers taking the lead in the children&rsquo;s work need to write and compile material. They need much prayer and fellowship to know the content and write lesson plans. We need to prepare material, but the saints can decide the best way to use it. The meetings should not be monotonous; they can be conducted in many ways.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING THE PRAYER AND<br />
COORDINATION OF THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>The children&rsquo;s meetings should be in many locations, at different times, and use different methods. Moreover, the teachers must have a goal. We should be open. We are taking this way to nourish our children and gain many more children so that the gospel can be preached to their unbelieving families. There are many benefits. We hope that all the saints will pray concerning this matter and not take it lightly. We especially hope that the older sisters can open their homes and gather some children to have children&rsquo;s meetings once a week. It should not be too difficult. There will be results. This requires everyone&rsquo;s cooperation.</p>
<p>The saints who serve either full time or part time and are under thirty years old should not excuse themselves from teaching in the children&rsquo;s meeting. As long as there is no conflict in their schedule, they have an obligation to serve as teachers. This is in addition to their gospel work in the schools. The serving saints who are over thirty years of age need to strengthen the small groups. There are saints who are assigned to work with the small groups, but also everyone should participate and become pillars in the small groups to strengthen the meetings.</p>
