   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE SELECTING HYMNS AND PRAYING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE LORD S TABLE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THE PRAYER MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us consider further how to select hymns in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the climax of the Lord s table meeting, in order to maintain the spirit of the meeting after the bread and the cup have been blessed and passed, there is the need to fill up the rest of the time with hymns and prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then the meeting should turn to the second section, which is the worship of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>TURNING THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>FROM PRAISING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>TO WORSHIPPING THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we worship the Father, we do not need a new beginning; we simply need to make a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A hymn for praising the Father is also a hymn for worshipping the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although the worship of the Father is another section, it still needs to be linked to the previous section.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, in the first section of the table meeting if we have seen the Lord s redemptive love that seeks and brings us back, we should turn to the worship of the Father with this feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In such a feeling we can worship God the Father for sending the Lord Jesus to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, our praising and singing will provide a flavor of the Father s sending of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, if we select Hymns, #178, Our hearts are full of Christ and long / Their glorious matter to declare, we will certainly go backward.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not acceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead, Hymns, #42 would be a good choice, By Thee, O God, invited, / We look unto the Son, / In whom Thy heart delighted, / Who all Thy will hath done; / And by the one chief treasure / Thy bosom freely gave, / Thine own pure love we measure, / Thy willing mind to save, because it meets the requirement of worshipping the Father, and its taste is also higher.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we worship the Father, we often call Hymns, #33 or Hymns, #52, without paying attention to the theme of our remembrance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, our spirit often cannot follow when it is time to worship the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is because we do not enter into the atmosphere and feeling of the meeting; we do not enter into the spirit of the hymns that were selected in the section on remembering the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>BRINGING THE WORSHIP OF THE FATHER TO A CLIMAX</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>AND SENDING PEOPLE OFF</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we have seen the Lord s redemptive love, when we turn to worship the Father, the feeling of such worship should be based upon the Father s sending His beloved Son to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, we should select a second hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we select Hymns, #52, however, it may be too quick.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can also turn from the feeling of the Lord s coming to seek us to the praise of the Father s love, matching this with prayers that praise the Father s love and then proceed forward.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even though Hymns, #299, A mind at perfect peace with God, is not a hymn on the worship of the Father, it can be used.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After singing this hymn, it would be good if someone were to stand up and pray, O Father, thank You for sending the Lord Jesus to seek us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Your love we were sought and brought back.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now before You in Your house, we enjoy the love You prepared for us in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After such a prayer, we can call Hymns, #43, Abba, Father, we adore Thee, / While the hosts in heaven above / E en in us now learn the wonders / Of Thy wisdom, grace, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>/ Soon before Thy throne assembled, / All Thy children shall proclaim / Abba s love shown in redemption, / And how full is Abba s name!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Singing this hymn can be compared to putting on a vest in fall; we feel just right, neither cold nor hot.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is good for a brother to choose Hymns, #45, but we should avoid singing two hymns of a similar nature in succession.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It would be too much for us to sing Hymns, #45 after singing Hymns, #43.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After the singing, either a brother or a sister can offer a prayer, saying, Our God, because You have chosen us before the creation of the world, now in Your love we have come back to Your house.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is another turn, from the praise of the Father s love to the praise of the Father s choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After the praises, we can call Hymns, #33, Father, long before creation, / Thou hadst chosen us in love; / And that love, so deep, so moving, / Draws us close to Christ above, / And will keep us, and will keep us, / Firmly fixed in Christ alone...</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is truly good and can be compared to singing hymns of ascent, going up higher and higher, step by step, waiting for the bread and the cup to be put back on the table.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then at the end of the hymn, that is, at the climax of the worship of the Father, a brother should lead everyone to stand up and conclude the meeting with a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, sometimes even though the meeting has ended, everyone may still be unwilling to depart and want to continue.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At this time there is the need for sending off by singing the last stanza of Hymns, #33 again.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I hope that we could all see that this is a lesson we should learn and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In this way, we will be able to function in the meetings.</S>
