   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today I received the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thank the Lord for His grace!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I will work first among the Yi tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I will also go to Sikang if the Lord opens the door.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everything is in the Lord's hands.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When will Brother Nee arrive in Shanghai?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am always thinking of him.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, May 10</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A Letter from Chang Kwang-rong One</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since the meetings at Bai-Sha, I stayed with Brother Hsu in Fan-Shan for a month.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On April 26 we left Fan-Shan for Shi-Ping, and on May 5 we went to Yang-Fu-Ling.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the thirteenth we went to Jin-Shiang.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The churches in Ping-Yang are growing more rapidly than in other places, and the work is plentiful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We wish some experienced co-worker sisters would take some young co-worker sisters along and come to help the sisters in Pin-Shun, Tai-Shun, and Fu-Ding.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ping-Yang and Tai-Shun are poor areas and have been more so recently because of the war.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But thank the Lord that the poor are able to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since meeting Brother Hsu in Hu-Shan, I have been working with him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>More and more I have felt that it is better for two to work together than for one to work alone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The co-workers in Ping-Yang and Tai-Shun would like to have a meeting for co-workers after Brother Nee returns.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It would be even better if Brother Nee could come for some meetings in Ping-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Has Brother Nee arrived in Shanghai yet?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Please give my greetings to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brother Chang Kwang-rong, May 30</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Brother Hsu has gone to Ba-Chao from Jin-Shiang.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am still staying in Jin-Shiang and learning to be with the Lord by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Please pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brother Chang Kwang-rong, June 7</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A Letter from Chen Jai-seng</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thank the Lord for leading me to go with Brothers Chai and Chen to north Fukien to learn to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although the itinerary was tight, I received much help and teaching concerning the work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I intended to stay longer in north and west Fukien to be trained by the Lord in those places, but the Lord did not open the way circumstantially.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I had to turn from Nan-Ping to Foochow and Chang-Loh with Brother Chai to visit the saints in those places.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We met Brother Chen Ke-san again in Bai-Ya-Tan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After the prayer meeting we returned to Pu-Tien.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The next day the road was destroyed, and the order for dispersal came.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>During the past month, although there have been bombings, the brothers and sisters in the Lord have been preserved in safety.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We give thanks unceasingly for the Lord's grace!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Transportation is difficult, and it is difficult to work in the cities and towns.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But thank the Lord that this enables us to be burdened for the souls in the villages and mountain regions.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Otherwise, when would the people who are sitting in darkness receive the light, and when would the footsteps of the apostles accumulate dust from their places?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We see the Lord's good will even in these circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May the Lord empower me so that I will not become a lazy servant.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a time when the harvest is ripe and the workers are few.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yet the workers have been restricted by distance and language and are holding out in their different corners.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The work has been like a pan of scattered sand!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Lately, I have been deeply aware of the preciousness of working together and the importance of praying together.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I also see the danger of acting independently and the evil of walking in an unrelated manner.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The flesh is exposed as being more and more evil, and our spiritual life has become more and more hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One as immature as I am truly needs prayer from all sides.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If Brother Nee has returned, please give my greetings to him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Brother Chen Jai-seng, May 29</S>
