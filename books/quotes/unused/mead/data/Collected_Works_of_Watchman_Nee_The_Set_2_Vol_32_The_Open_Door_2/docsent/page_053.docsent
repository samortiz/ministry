   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Dear Ms. Yu:</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have received all the issues of The Open Door and have obtained much help from the news of the brothers and sisters in all the different places.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thank the Lord that His work can still be so prevailing under the present circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The condition of the churches in the northwest has improved recently.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some of the Chinese brothers in the China Inland Mission adopted the policy of self-propagation and began pioneering evangelism in Ching-Yang last year.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suh Siu-deh, who loves the Lord, is taking responsibility there.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Last winter some brothers and sisters from Kaifeng, who were zealous for the Lord and who were from the Methodist Bible School, established an evangelistic band and intended to go to the northwest to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Lately, the Assembly of God has been very active.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It has a little evangelistic band working in the northwest and has done some lasting work in many areas in Tsinghai.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our respected Brother Witness Lee went to the northwest once last year.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many who desired to see him for years were unable to see him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are still many in Sian and Lan-chou who would like him to come again with the Lord's full gospel and edify the brothers in the northwest.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Mr. Liang Bin-yu was in Hue-Ning in July, and he obtained his missionary passport for working in the northwest from Lan-chou on the fifth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There are only one or two churches with a few dozen people in each between Lan-chou and Di-Hwa, a distance of a few thousand miles.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If Brother Chao Yung-chuen has a burden in his spirit for the gospel work in Sinkiang, we would very much respect it, because there is a great need for men to go there.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church in Hue-Ning is absolutely the Lord's. But there are many things which we do not understand as far as the way is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although we were helped by the books Rethinking Our Work and The Open Door, they are not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>May some writings that can render us more help be published.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May God give you deep wisdom so that thousands of people may receive the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
