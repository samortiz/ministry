   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO HAVE THE MINGLING AND THE ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We may realize the importance of these two matters the mingling of the divine life with man and the oneness of the Body but now we must ask ourselves how much we have been mingled with the divine life and how much we are actually in the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do we have the mingling and the oneness in our Christian life?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should forget about all other things and spend some time before the Lord to consider ourselves with respect to these two matters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The extent to which the Lord values us depends on how much of the divine mingling we have and how much we are in the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These two matters are not merely a wonderful teaching or something that will take place in the heavens or in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The way to realize and practice these two matters is simple and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second Corinthians 3:17 tells us that today the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible also tells us that we have been reborn in our spirit John 3:6 and that our spirit has been renewed through regeneration Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>36:26; Rom 7:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, the Lord Spirit is living within our spirit, and these two spirits the Lord Spirit and our spirit have been joined and mingled together as one spirit Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are at least three verses in the Scriptures that mention both the divine Spirit and our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>John 3:6 says, That which is born of the Spirit is spirit, John 4:24 says, God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit, and Romans 8:16 says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These verses reveal that the Spirit of the Lord and our spirit have been joined together and work together.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today the Lord is one with us, and we are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, it is not in our mind or our mentality that we are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, we are one with Him in our spirit, the innermost part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is a divine and spiritual mystery that the Lord Spirit has mingled Himself with our spirit as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, the way to take the Lord as our life is not by thinking or using our mind but by exercising our spirit to contact the Lord as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not something that we do once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, we need to contact the Lord moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can never graduate from the things of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the realm of knowledge there is a day in which we may graduate from a field of study.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may say, I have been studying this subject for eight years, and now I will graduate.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, we cannot say, I have been eating for eighteen years, and now I will graduate from eating.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can never graduate from eating; to graduate from eating is to die.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even more, we cannot graduate from breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Similarly, we cannot graduate from contacting the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must keep ourselves in contact with the Lord all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, consider an electric lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The lamp may be connected to the electricity, but in order for the lamp to shine, we must turn the switch on.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever we turn the switch off, the lamp stops shining.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am afraid that in our Christian life the switch has been turned off for quite a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may not even know that there is a switch, much less know how to turn the switch on.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps on occasion we blindly turned the switch on without knowing how we did it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, the way to turn the switch on is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All we need to do is simply contact the Lord by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once a brother told me, I have been praying for God to give me a big spiritual battery that would be sufficient for a certain amount of time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I said, Brother, your prayer will never be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord cannot give you a spiritual battery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord can only be like an electrical current that is flowing all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you stay in contact with the Lord, you will sense the flow of the current.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, if you turn off the switch, the current will stop, and you will suffer spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You will stop experiencing all the riches that are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You must exercise to learn how to turn the switch on and how to keep the switch on.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is the real Christian life?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The real Christian life is Christ being lived out through us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have our own personality and our own human life, but we should not live by this human life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead, we should turn to the divine life, which is Christ Himself living within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must do this not once in a while or even once a day but all the time and in every situation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must deny our natural human life and turn to Christ, exercising our spirit to contact this living person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The religion of Christianity cannot save or deliver us, nor can mere Christian teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only Christ Himself, who is the living Lord and a living person, is able to deliver us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today we are contacting a living person Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Day by day and moment by moment we should realize that Christ is life in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is so real and living, and He is moving and working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we turn to Him in our spirit, He motivates us to live, energizes us to walk, and strengthens us to work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then it is no longer we who live but He and we living together Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This mingling of the divine life with the human life is the real Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In our love toward others there should be such a mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In our service in the church there should be such a mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should be able to say with assurance, Lord, although I am serving You, You are actually serving within me.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although I am praying to You, You are actually praying within me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I am not doing these things merely by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Rather, You are strengthening me within to do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What a wonder, a miracle, a rest, and a joy this is!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is no need for us to try to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should not try by ourselves to overcome sin, to be patient, or to do good things.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Instead, we must see that today we have the glorious Christ within us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Simply pay attention to this fact and say, Hallelujah, praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Lord, You are my life within.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I can take You as my life and experience You in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I can take You and experience You not just once a day or in certain matters but day by day, all the time, and in all my circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we experience Christ in such a way, we will be in the heavenlies, all the sinful and worldly things would be under our feet, and we would be spiritually enriched.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Whenever we are going to do something, we must do it by letting the Lord do it through us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We must even worship God by letting the Lord worship through us see Hebrews 2:12 and note 3 in the Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We can worship God in one of two ways in an objective way or in a subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Do we worship an objective God or a subjective God?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The fact is that today most Christians worship the Lord in an objective way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, we must realize that the Lord whom we worship is the One who is living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>While we worship and seek Him, He strengthens us in our spirit to worship Him and energizes us to praise and thank Him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is real peace and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>As Christians we should worship the God who is in us and who has mingled Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is the simple and practical way to realize the mingling of God with man.</S>
