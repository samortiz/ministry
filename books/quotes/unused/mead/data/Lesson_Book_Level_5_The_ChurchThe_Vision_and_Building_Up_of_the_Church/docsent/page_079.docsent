   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All authority in heaven and on earth is given to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since the church is His Body, the gates of Hades cannot prevail against the church.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now He operates by His Spirit, which is the sevenfold intensified Spirit Rev 4:5; 5:6 , to apply all that He has accomplished and obtained to us for the building up of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the work of Christ in heaven.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hebrews 4:16 tells us that we can come boldly to the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are now living on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How then can we come to God's throne in heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The key is the spirit mentioned in verse 12 of Hebrews 4.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Christ who is sitting on the throne in heaven is now also in us Rom 8:10 , that is, in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's dwelling place is this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Bethel is the house of God, the habitation of God, and the gate of heaven.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There are two kinds of building up one is by the gifted persons and the other is by the perfected saints.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The building up of the Body of Christ by the gifted persons is under the Head's supply and is done indirectly.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then these gifts perfect the saints, and the perfected saints do the building work directly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The building up of the Body of Christ by the perfected saints is under the gifted persons' perfecting and is done directly.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They build up the Body of Christ by growing into the Head in all things Eph 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The growth in life of each member of the Body added together equals the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The perfected saints also build up the Body by functioning out from the Head, causing the growth of the Body that the Body may be built up directly by itself 4:16 .</S>
