[1]  Christ Is the Way, the Truth, and the Life
[2]  Christ Is the Bread of Life and the Light of Life
[3]  According to God s desire, plan, and redemption, He has ordained that His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, be all spiritual matters and things.
[4]  The Lord Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life KJV .
[5]  Christ is our way, Christ is our truth, and Christ is our life.
[6]  This is why our Lord said, I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me. What God has given us is just Christ; He has not given us many things apart from Christ.
[7]  If we know God s Son, we have the way, we have the truth, and we have the life.
[8]  We need to see that not only do we have to come to God through the Lord Jesus when we are saved, but that the Lord Jesus is still the way any time we go to God; there is not some method outside of the Lord Jesus.
[9]  The Lord has opened my eyes, but I dare not say that I have seen Him, and I dare not say that I have not seen Him.
[10]  If you say, I will forgive him if I know I should forgive him, and I will not forgive him if I know I should not forgive him, this is dead work based on dead teaching; it is even a kind of false performance.
[11]  Brothers and sisters, if we do not have the Lord living within us, and if it is not the Lord who is our truth, a teaching that guides our action is nothing but dead works; it is not life, and it is not living.
[12]  We have mentioned briefly what it is for Christ to be the way and the truth.
[13]  Now we have to speak some concerning Christ being our life.
[14]  You cannot say that what he has issues from Christ, because what he has is natural; it is not life, and it is not Christ.
[15]  But after we find out that Christ is our life, we realize that everything depends on Christ and not on our working.
[16]  Brothers and sisters, may the Lord be gracious to us and show us that spiritual matters are nothing but the Lord, that spiritual matters are nothing but Christ.
[17]  AND THE LIFE Scripture Reading: John 11:25 WHAT HE DOES VERSUS WHAT HE IS
[18]  Chapter eleven of the Gospel of John shows us how the Lord Jesus gave life to a dead person; it shows us how the Lord Jesus resurrected a person from among the dead.
[19]  The Lord can resurrect man, but He did not say, I will resurrect the dead.
[20]  But the Lord does not want to show us what He will do; He wants to show us what He is.
[21]  In John 11:25 the Lord Jesus was not saying that He can preserve a man s life, but that He Himself is life.
[22]  We hope that at least a little light will shine on us so that we can know that the Lord is everything and know Him as such a Lord.
[23]  AND THE LIGHT OF LIFE Scripture Reading: John 6:35; 8:12
[24]  We have already briefly seen that all the spiritual things and all spiritual matters are Christ.
[25]  God gives us Christ to be our spiritual things and matters.
[26]  We say with our mouth that Christ is the centrality of all things, but in our living we still keep many things other than Christ, as if these things could help us live our Christian life.
[27]  If we wrongly presume that what the Lord Jesus gives is different from the Lord Jesus Himself, and if we wrongly presume that grace and the One who gives grace are separate, these mistakes will cause us to suffer great spiritual damage.
[28]  When the disciples came back with the food they had bought, they invited the Lord to eat, but the Lord said, I have food to eat that you do not know about v. 32 . The disciples thought that someone else had given Him something to eat.
[29]  If you touch the Lord, if you touch life, and if you touch spiritual reality, whether or not you are busy, you will be able to say, Thank and praise God.
[30]  But as long as it is something out of the Lord, and as long as we do these things according to the Lord s operation in us, we will feel relieved and satisfied after we have done them.
[31]  The Lord not only said that He is the bread of life, but He also said that He is the light of life.
[32]  Food is for satisfaction, while light is for seeing.
[33]  We have seen how Christ is the bread of life.
[34]  Now let us consider how Christ is the light of life.
[35]  At the time the Lord was born in Bethlehem, many priests and scribes could memorize the books of the prophets, but they did not know Christ.
[36]  But we need to realize that when we read the Bible, it is possible that we will gain only knowledge instead of knowing Christ.
[37]  May the Lord have mercy on us so that His light may take away our self-assurance and so that we will not be so confident that we are right, that we are not wrong, and that we know so much.
[38]  God s goal is Christ, and Christ is also God s means.
[39]  There is one difference between these two books: Ephesians shows us that according to the economy of the fullness of the times, God wants to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth 1:10 ; Colossians shows us that God has not only made Christ to be Head over all things, but God has made Him all and in all 1:18; 3:11b .
[40]  Only then will all things be headed up, for if Christ is all and if Christ is in all, all things will be headed up spontaneously.
[41]  When this happens, we will only see Christ in the world; we will not see matters and things anymore, because all matters and all things will have passed away.
[42]  I would like to point out that not only does the Lord Jesus own word testify to this, but Paul said the same thing.
[43]  He knew the Lord, and he showed us one very interesting thing.
[44]  He said to Timothy, Christ Jesus our hope 1 Tim 1:1 .
[45]  He did not say that our hope is in Christ Jesus.
[46]  God has not given us humility or endurance; He has given us the whole Christ.
[47]  Christ is becoming our humility, and Christ is becoming our endurance and meekness.
[48]  When we were saved, many of us heard God s Word, which says that He so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, so that we will not perish, but will have eternal life.
[49]  When we heard such a word, we felt that we needed to be saved, and we went to God and prayed, Lord, You have loved me and given Yourself to me.
[50]  We can find one fact in our spiritual experience.
[51]  Some people have been Christians for one, two, three, five, or even twenty or thirty years.
[52]  When we first believed in the Lord, we felt that we lacked love, and we asked God for love.
[53]  The most difficult thing we face today is that many people are merely involved in the things of Christianity; they do not know Christ and have not realized that God s thing is just Christ.
[54]  I may say that knowing Christ is to know Him through matters and things.
[55]  What does it mean to know Christ through matters and things?
[56]  It means knowing that Christ is our matters and Christ is our things.
[57]  Some people can say that they know Christ as their patience, Christ as their love, or Christ as their humility; this is knowing Christ.
[58]  Many people know Christ as the Lord of justification, but they still fear God and do not know that Christ is their righteousness.
[59]  The problem is that although many of us know that Christ is our Lord, we do not know that Christ is our matters and things.
[60]  When we no longer see these things as things, but as the Lord Himself, we will begin to know God.
[61]  CHAPTER FIVE CHRIST ONLY NOT MATTERS OR THINGS Scripture Reading: John 8:28; Col 3:3-4; 1:16-20 MAN S THOUGHTS AND DEMANDS
[62]  But different people have different degrees of knowledge of God.
[63]  In other words, we think that we are lacking just a part; we think that we are lacking only a little and that as long as we can fill up that little part, we will be perfect.
[64]  But the problem is that many of us have come to realize that what we think we lack before the Lord and what we ask for are merely things.
[65]  Many Christians have not seen that there are not many things in the spiritual world; there is only Christ.
[66]  There is no patience in the spiritual world; there is only Christ.
[67]  There is no humility, sanctification, or light in the spiritual world; there is only Christ.
[68]  Now we need another strong and thorough vision: we do not need things; we need Christ.
[69]  You have to realize that what is truly spiritual before the Lord are not things, but the Lord Jesus Christ.
[70]  One kind is filled with things, and the other kind is just Christ.
[71]  But with one, we just have a list of things, while with the other, we have Christ.
[72]  But if He has not said them, we should not, because once we do, we will touch death; we will be inwardly weakened and deflated, and we will collapse.
[73]  In the end He wants to show us that Christ is patience, Christ is humility, and Christ is love.
[74]  We know Christ by knowing Him as the various things ; we know that He is this to us or that He is that to us.
[75]  I must say bluntly that unless a child of God has his eyes opened to see that Christ is his things, he is not of much use, because all that he has is behavior.
[76]  Lord, we pray that You would open our eyes so that Christ would become real to us, so that the things will pass away and life will fill us.
[77]  May the Lord who is our person become our things so that everything in us becomes living and full of life, and so that others would see Christ when they see the things.
[78]  Do not allow us to deceive ourselves, to think that we have seen it when we have not seen it, to think that we have touched the right way when we really have not touched it, to think that we are full of life when we are full of behavior, and to think that we are full of Christ when we are full of things.
