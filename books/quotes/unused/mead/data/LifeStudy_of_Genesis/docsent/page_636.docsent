   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. JOSEPH TRIED BY HIS DREAMS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NOT BEING FULFILLED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Joseph was tested by the fact that his dreams were not fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Immediately after Joseph had his dreams, he told his parents and brothers about them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not long after that, he was sold into slavery and then cast into prison where, I believe, he stayed over ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In his dreams there was no indication or implication that Joseph would suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, immediately after Joseph had those dreams, he had to endure suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Likewise, I can testify that the throne does not immediately follow the vision of Christ, the church, the cross, or the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead, there is suffering, trial, betrayal, and imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to our natural concept, we think that immediately after we see a vision, something glorious will happen in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But this is not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After the vision, trials will come.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Young people, do not think that after you have seen the vision of Christ, the church, the cross, the inner life, or the Spirit, you will have a glorious time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No, you will suffer and be imprisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If I had been Joseph, I might have had doubts about my dreams and said to myself, "These dreams are not something real.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I dreamed that I was a sheaf standing up, but actually I have been made low.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I saw that I was a star shining in heaven, but actually I have been cast into the dungeon.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What has happened is the exact opposite of my dreams."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I would certainly have doubted my interpretation of my dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I would have regarded them as unreal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those of us who have been in the church life for many years have had this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps some years ago you saw a wonderful vision concerning Christ and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps you even sang about the glorious church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But what has actually happened in the church life has not been that excellent or glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, you might have said, "I thought I was in the good land of Canaan, but I actually was in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I dreamed that I was surrounded by sheaves, but actually I am surrounded by Egyptian scorpions.'</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the vision I saw and according to the messages Brother Lee gave us, I expected to be in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But now I am in a dungeon, in a pit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead of being in Jerusalem, I am in Egypt."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many of us can testify of experiences like this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Following the vision there came, not enthronement, but imprisonment.</S>
