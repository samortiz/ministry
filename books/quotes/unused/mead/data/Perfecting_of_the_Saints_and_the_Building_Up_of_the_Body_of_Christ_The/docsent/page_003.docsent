   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST DESCENDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INTO THE LOWER PARTS OF THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND ASCENDING FAR ABOVE THE HEAVENS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This portion first shows us the ascended Head.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Wherefore He says, Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now this, He ascended, what is it except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He who descended is the same who also ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things Eph 4:8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is the One who ascended to the height.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The fact that He has ascended to the height proves that He had descended to a low place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was originally on the throne in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In His becoming flesh, He came down from heaven to earth and was born in a manger in Bethlehem, a small, earthly town.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then He went to the cross and died there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After this He went down to Hades, which is the lower parts of the earth mentioned in verse 9.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From there, He resurrected from the dead and came out of Hades and the grave, ascending to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After forty days, He ascended from the earth before the eyes of the disciples far above all the heavens Acts 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The descending of the Lord was from heaven to the earth, then from the earth to Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His ascending was from Hades to the earth, then from the earth to the height above all the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This journey of His was His work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this work He first became flesh to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The unlimited, boundless God who transcends time and space became a man limited in time and space, restricted in all respects.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He was in Judea He could not be in Galilee, and when He was in Galilee He could not be in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was restricted by time and space for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was not a short period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, His becoming flesh to be a man was a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Neither was it a small thing for Him to live on earth for such a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While He was on earth, the earth was in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There was almost nothing that could afford Him joy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even His closest disciple denied Him when He was about to go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He bore all this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was not a simple thing for Him to bear this for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then He went through a process to go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He passed through man s arrest, interrogations, and examinations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was condemned unrighteously and unfairly by the blind religion in conjunction with the dark politics.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He bore His own cross for part of the way from the city of Jerusalem to Golgotha and was crucified there.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He remained on the cross for six hours, accomplishing the work of the cross, and entered into the grave and descended into Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After three days, He came out of Hades and the grave and was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In His resurrection He remained on earth for forty more days before ascending to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Throughout this process He accomplished many works.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First, He brought God into man in a real way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Second, He lived in man to pass through all the sufferings of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Third, He went to the cross to accomplish the all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the negative side, He solved the problem of our sin John 1:29; 1 Pet 2:24; Heb 9:26, 28; 1 Cor 15:3 , dealt with the flesh of sin Rom 8:3 , crucified the old man on the cross Rom 6:6 , destroyed Satan Heb 2:14 together with his world John 12:31 , terminated the old creation, and abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances which divided man Eph 2:14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the positive side, He released the glorious, divine, unlimited, and eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Fourth, in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This Spirit is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is so available that He is even in our mouth and in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When you call O Lord Jesus, you will have a certain feeling within.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you call on any famous men in history, you will not have such a feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is because they are all dead.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Plato, Socrates, Confucius, Mencius, Laotze, etc., all died.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even if you call their names, there will be no response.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But once you call on the Lord Jesus, something will start happening within you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You will have a certain feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is because this Jesus has resurrected from the dead and has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now He is in us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This was all accomplished through His becoming flesh, through His passing through human living, and through His resurrecting from the dead.</S>
