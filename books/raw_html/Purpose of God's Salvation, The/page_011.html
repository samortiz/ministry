        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">FIVE PRACTICES</h1>
<p>In the previous chapters we saw that God&rsquo;s eternal intention and His eternal plan are centered on Christ. God wants Christ to be our everything, to be our life and our life supply. We also saw that the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation is to build the church. The church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ, and the issue of our enjoyment of the riches of Christ. If we are to enjoy the riches of Christ in order to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose, we need the following five practices.</p>
<p>First, we need to practice living a life of faith. Second, we need to read the Lord&rsquo;s Word and apply the word of life to feed our spirit. Third, we need to have an absolute and thorough consecration and to learn to have continual fellowship with the Lord in spirit and to abide in the Lord. Fourth, we need to experience death and resurrection. In other words, we need to experience our co-crucifixion on the cross, which has terminated our soul-life, and we need to know resurrection life and enjoy the riches of Christ in resurrection. Fifth, we need to practice being built together with the saints in our locality to practically live the church life. We must bring these matters to the Lord in prayer both privately and corporately, and we also need to practice these matters by the Lord&rsquo;s grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING A LIFE OF FAITH</h2>
<p>We need to practice living a life of faith. We must understand the doctrine of living by faith and also commit ourselves with our needs, problems, and situations into the Lord&rsquo;s hand, looking to Him in faith. When the Lord tries us, we can prove Him. Many problems come to us because the Lord wants to bring us to our end so that we would learn the lesson of faith. Our end is God&rsquo;s beginning, and our dead end is God&rsquo;s way out. If we do not learn to trust in the Lord, we may be loose and careless. When we learn to trust in the Lord, He will demand certain things of us and correct us. Then He will have a way to flow out of us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">READING THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD</h2>
<p>We need to read the Lord&rsquo;s Word. We must not only understand the Word with our mind but also feed our spirit with the Word. It is not necessary to read a large portion each time, but we should read a few verses every day. This is like eating a meal. We should not eat too much lest we get an upset stomach, but we should always eat a few meals a day to stay healthy. A person who is fed is healthy, safe, and happy. It is good to ask one another whether we have read the Bible or spent time with the Lord. We must eat spiritual food through the Lord&rsquo;s Word daily. We should not talk about the building up of the church on a spiritually empty stomach. Instead, we should eat, drink, and enjoy the Lord through reading His Word. Some may feel that it is barbaric to speak of eating the Lord, but the Lord Himself said, &ldquo;As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (John 6:57). The thought of eating the Lord is in the Bible. We can eat the Lord because He is our food. We eat Him by reading the Bible. We do not read the Word to accumulate spiritual knowledge but to obtain spiritual food with our spirit.</p>
<p>When saints ask me why they are weak, I ask them how many days they have been without a meal. This question is not concerning physical food but concerning reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word daily to be fed by the Lord. Most of these saints confess that they do not read the Lord&rsquo;s Word daily. If we do not eat every day, it is impossible for us to be strong. A person who does not eat physical food is unlikely to survive after forty days. This should be a warning to us.</p>
<p>Christians are weak because they neither read the Bible nor fellowship with the Lord. A person who does not eat or drink will not have much strength the following day and is more likely to get sick. We have spiritual problems because we lack spiritual vitamins. In order for us to be strong and free from various spiritual ailments, we must read the Bible and draw near to the Lord daily. Reading the Bible daily to enjoy the Lord not only solves our spiritual problems but also strengthens our spirit. I hope that the saints will not neglect this matter.</p>
<p>Some Christians excuse themselves, saying that they are too busy to read the Lord&rsquo;s Word. We do not need to spend much time to read the Lord&rsquo;s Word, but it is important that we take a little time to feed on the Word daily. About thirty years ago I read a tract that said Christians should spend ten minutes to speak, four times a day. The first ten minutes are for speaking to the Lord, that is, for prayer. The second ten minutes are for listening to the Lord speak, that is, for reading the Word. The third ten minutes are for speaking with other believers, that is, for fellowship. The fourth ten minutes are for speaking to the Gentiles, that is, for preaching the gospel. We should practice these four ten minutes daily. We should at least practice the first two ten minutes; we should spend ten minutes to speak to the Lord and ten minutes to listen to the Lord speak. We should not wait until night to speak to the Lord or to listen to Him speak; rather, we should spend ten minutes in the morning to speak to the Lord and ten minutes to listen to the Lord speak.</p>
<p>Someone once asked George M&#252;ller why believers should read the Bible and pray in the morning. He replied that in the Old Testament people offered up the precious fat of the sacrifice, not the dung of the sacrifice (Exo. 29:13-14; Lev. 4:8-12). The morning can be likened to fat, but night can be likened to dung. Therefore, reading the Bible and praying to draw near to the Lord in the morning can be likened to offering up the fat of the sacrifice. We should not wait to use whatever time is left over at night for drawing near to the Lord. No matter what day it is, we should always spend ten minutes for prayer and ten minutes for Bible reading in the morning. Ten minutes is not a long time; hence, this can easily be done. Such time is very precious. May we respond to the Lord and give Him our most precious and best twenty minutes in the morning by praying and reading the Bible to draw near to Him.</p>
<p>We should force ourselves to practice this; otherwise, we will not be strong. Listening to messages will not make us strong. I hope that we would sign a spiritual agreement with the Lord to practice reading His Word and praying. Children must learn to eat so that they can grow up to be strong. Therefore, we must practice reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word every day. We should calm our inner being to read every morning. We do not need to read for too long. We need only ten minutes, and then we should turn what we have read into prayer. This is the way to feed our spirit daily.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
