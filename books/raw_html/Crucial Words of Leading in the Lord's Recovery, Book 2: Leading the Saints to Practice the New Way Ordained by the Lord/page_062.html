 <h2 class="head1">LEARNING THE LESSON OF THE CROSS</h2>
<p>The goal of our service is to bring the brothers and sisters into the church life. When we began our work in Taipei in 1949, the land for hall one of the church in Taipei was bought with the money of the ministry. Later, with great effort we gradually built up the church in Taipei. In 1962, when I began the work in America, I did not bring any brothers with me; I simply took my Bible bag and left by myself. I left the brothers in Taipei with what I had labored on for over ten years. Now in 1984 I have returned, desiring with all of you to bring the church on. I admit that wherever I go, there are no peaceful days. To speak frankly, if anyone wants to have peaceful days, he should not come to listen to my messages. He should go to the denominations because it is very &ldquo;peaceful&rdquo; there. Year after year in the denominations, both those who preach and those who listen live peacefully. The Lord has not commissioned me to do this kind of work. Wherever I go, I work in such a way that no one is able to sleep peacefully. The brothers who conduct the training are apprehensive that once my burden comes they will not be able to live peacefully. It is truly difficult to conduct the training in Taipei. On one hand, it needs to please the many elders in the churches, while on the other hand, it needs to satisfy the young people and also myself. This is not easy.</p>
<p>Since the start of the training, there has been much gossip. We have all heard the gossip, but no one has heard my voice. A person who takes the lead in the Lord&rsquo;s work and the Lord&rsquo;s church must be like this; he must learn the lesson of the cross. Some who come from other places speak loosely regarding whatever they see. They say that this is right and that is wrong, this is good and that is bad. They speak this way because they have never learned the lesson of the cross. The first lesson of the cross is not to speak. Even if we were the apostle Paul, when we come to the church in Taipei, we should first come and sit without saying anything. If a person is able to sit for twenty days, even four months, without saying a word, he would be comparable to Paul; such a one would be useful and able to accomplish something. When some people go to a certain place, they begin to speak loosely and express their own views after having only been there for two weeks; this is to express their opinion. We may use the example of riding in someone&rsquo;s car. One who has truly learned the lesson of the cross does not have anything to say concerning the speed and condition of the driving when he rides in another person&rsquo;s car. He does not comment whether the driver drives too slow or too fast, or whether the driver should make a left turn or a right turn, or go forward or back up. Willingness to say something proves that a person has not learned the lesson of the cross.</p>
<p>We may have heard many doctrines concerning the cross, but when situations come, they manifest whether or not we truly know the cross. We can tell how much a person has learned the lesson of the cross by his speaking. One who has truly learned the lesson of the cross does not and dares not speak loosely; speaking is the touchstone of the cross. If someone has truly learned the lesson of the cross, he will not speak loosely when he visits another place. To use the example of driving, only the driver should speak. When we are in someone&rsquo;s car, we should not say nonsensical things, such as, &ldquo;Your driving is not good.&rdquo; We do not need to speak, because we are not in our car and we are not the one driving. Someone may go to Kaohsiung and say that Kaohsiung is good in a certain matter and not good in another matter; this shows that he has not learned the lesson of the cross and does not know the cross.</p>
<p>We realize that the brothers and sisters serving full time in the churches are inadequate in many ways and that there is a need for some to perfect them properly; thus, we have picked up the burden to provide these full-timers with some training. After the training, we need to consider where we should send them. For example, when someone establishes a medical school or a department of medicine, there must be a hospital nearby that will cooperate with the school. In this way, the medical students will have a place for internships. Without a hospital, the students will not have a place to practice what they have learned. For a medical school to be established, cooperation must be successfully established between a hospital and the medical school. Similarly, the trainees cannot stay in the training center forever; they must go out and practically apply what they have learned. Hence, we require that they go out to labor; in order for them to be able to labor, they must fellowship with the churches in their localities. When the training fellowships with the churches, it demonstrates that what the training carries out is not for the training but for the churches.</p>
<p>I hope we can all see that neither the church nor various works are being merged with the training center. This fellowship is so that all of us may learn the lesson that we are not a social organization that has private fellowships. The churches should not take this way. If we take this way, we should permanently close down and do no more work. Our concept must be utterly changed. We need to realize that we have been saved and regenerated, that we have been sanctified, and that we are in the process of transformation. This is the same in regard to serving in the church; we must pass through regeneration, sanctification, and transformation. We need to serve the church with such a vision.</p>
<p>Through this kind of fellowship and explanation, I believe that the brothers and sisters will have a deeper realization of the cross. In this period of time, if you have anything to say, you must be cautious. Not being careful can be likened to a household full of women whose gossip and criticisms are not fair. There is a saying in Chinese: &ldquo;Even an honest official cannot judge family affairs precisely.&rdquo; No one can precisely judge the family affairs of the church; thus, we should not criticize so easily. We need to have an understanding of the training as a whole. As for unintentional criticisms, we do not now know how to handle them, and we find it difficult to handle them. Thus, we need to pay special attention to these matters.</p>
