<h2 class="head1">"YOU ALSO OUGHT TO WASH ONE ANOTHER'S FEET"</h2><p>In verse 14 the Lord said, "If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet." The Lord washed the disciples' feet. Today He wants us to do the same thing. The washing of sins by the blood is God's work, whereas the washing of feet by the water is man's work. God has not charged us to wash the whole body; He only charges us to wash the feet. We cannot give others a bath, because we cannot redeem them from their sins; we cannot save anyone or cause anyone to perish. The work of salvation is God's work alone. Our only responsibility is to preach the gospel. At the same time, the Lord wants to wash man's feet today. This washing is an indirect washing. He washes us through the brothers and sisters. With what does He apply the washing? We have mentioned previously that the Lord washed by pouring water into the basin. What does water signify? When the Lord died, blood and water flowed out of His side. The blood signifies the redemptive aspect of His death, whereas the water signifies the non-redemptive aspect of His death. The blood washes away our sins, whereas the water becomes the source of our new life. In the Bible water sometimes denotes death and sometimes denotes life in the Holy Spirit. This life is the new life that we received at the time of our salvation. This life comes out of death. The water in the basin signifies that the life is in the Holy Spirit. When we sin, we need to go to the Lord for our washing. But when our feet are defiled, we need to go to the brothers for our washing. The Lord said, "You also ought to wash one another's feet." This shows that the foot-washing is carried out by the brothers and sisters, that is, by the church. No one can say that he does not need his feet washed. "One another" includes all the believers in Christ. Not only you and I need the washing, Paul and John needed the washing also. Every believer, as long as he lives on this earth, will find his feet defiled. It is different in the case of sin. Many believers can completely overcome sin. But no one in this world can avoid having his feet defiled.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW TO WASH ONE ANOTHER'S FEET</h2><p>How can we wash one another's feet? Suppose you have completed your day's work and feel tired. You cannot utter any praises from your mouth. In the evening when you come to the meeting, someone asks you to pray. Halfway through your prayer, you cannot go on, and you stop. You feel as if your prayer is nothing more than a composition. However, perhaps one brother in the meeting has a fresh spirit, and his prayer refreshes your spirit. Your spiritual energy is renewed. This is washing one another's feet. Many times when we come to the meeting, we find the saints' spirit weak and downtrodden. We pray and read the Word, but nothing seems to work. The reason for this is that everyone's feet are defiled, and there is no basin to wash the feet. It is as if something is quenching our spirits. If someone would stand up at this point and wash everyone's feet by offering a prayer or saying a few words, the whole meeting will be refreshed. Without the basin and without the foot-washing, everyone's spirit is bound. The same is true in our family life. A brother or sister may unexpectedly drop by your home and fellowship a short while or give a testimony, and everyone in the family is brought into the presence of God. Before that time there was a separation between them and God, but after such a simple conversation, all the separation is gone. This is washing one another's feet. Those who do this are precious in the Lord's eyes.</p><p>We should have an ambition before the Lord to wash others' feet. In order to wash others' feet, we must have the water, that is, we must be filled with the Holy Spirit and be in constant fellowship with the Lord. For this cause we must live in the Holy Spirit daily. Only then will we have the living water to wash others' feet. Every time we come to the meeting, we must have the living water to wash others' feet. We should never try to wash others' feet without water; that will only defile their feet even more. Those who cannot wash others' feet may still fellowship and communicate with God, but their spirits are definitely cold. Today the Lord does not wash anyone's feet directly. Instead, He charges us to wash one another's feet. We must all learn to be those who can wash one another's feet.</p><h2 class="head1">"IF YOU KNOW THESE THINGS,<br />BLESSED ARE YOU IF YOU DO THEM"</h2><p>In verse 15 the Lord said, "For I have given you an example so that you also may do even as I have done to you." The words "even as" mean to do exactly the same thing. Whatever the Lord did, we should do in exactly the same way. If we do this we will be blessed. Foot-washing is not only a thing in the spirit, but also an actual, outward practice. When the Lord washed the disciples' feet, He used a basin. We also must have our basin. If the Lord washed in a literal way, we should also wash in a literal way. The Lord was not merely performing a sign. He was actually washing with water. Since He washed literally, we should do the same; otherwise, we cannot express the spiritual reality behind it. When we are baptized, not only do we remember the spiritual significance, we also go into the water literally. The outward practice helps us to remember the inward, spiritual significance. Hence, on the one hand, we need to remember the inward, spiritual significance, and on the other hand, we need the outward practice. Foot-washing is a practice carried out in the family, not in the church. For example, 1 Timothy 5:10 mentions the widow receiving hospitality and washing the saints' feet. This, of course, was conducted in the home. We have to follow the Lord's example. We have to wash the feet of the saints physically with water and a basin on the one hand, and wash their feet spiritually for their renewal on the other hand.</p><p>There is one further point. We should note the time the Lord washed the disciples' feet. He washed their feet before the Feast of the Passover. We know that the Passover signifies our bread-breaking meeting. Why are we not fresh in our table meeting? It is because we have not washed our feet before coming to the Passover feast. If some can bring freshness to a bread-breaking meeting, they are remembering the Lord in a real way. What is the result of such foot-washing? "If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them." The Lord blesses the foot-washing. This is something that is acceptable to the Lord and well pleasing to Him. If we do this, we will be blessed. May we all do what the Lord has done.</p>
