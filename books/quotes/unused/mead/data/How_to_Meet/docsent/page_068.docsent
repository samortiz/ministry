   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TOUCHING THE KING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Firstly we need to praise with what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 2 we see this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured upon thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee forever.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is Christ s being, Christ s person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is a man, a fair man, the man who is fairer than all men.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a man, He is full of grace, and God has blessed Him forever.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, in the person of Christ, there is the fairness, the grace, and the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From verse 3 through verse 5 we have Christ s accomplishments the fighting, the overcoming, the riding through.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today Christ is fighting, overcoming, spreading Himself and riding triumphantly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here it says, Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And in thy majesty ride triumphantly...</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not think that the Lord is so silent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we have spiritual eyes, we will see how the Lord is riding through the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is spreading Himself by riding and overcoming this is the way He takes to ride on.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am assured it will not be long before He will be here, He will return.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 6 we have the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thy throne, O God He is God is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After riding through triumphantly, Christ comes to establish the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to praise Him along all these lines.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In verse 7 we see the sweet relationship between Him and God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He loves righteousness and hates wickedness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Righteousness represents the things related to God, and wickedness the things related to the wicked one, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that the Lord loves everything related to God and hates everything related to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore God delights in Him and anoints Him with the oil of gladness above His companions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This does not mean that the companions are not anointed, but that they are anointed not above Him, but under Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are the anointed ones under the anointed One; so we are His anointed companions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Following this, in verse 8 we have the fragrance of all His doings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The garments in this verse signify the Lord s deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What He does is so filled with the fragrance of His death the myrrh and aloes and the fragrance of His resurrection the cassia .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whatever the Lord does is always based upon the principle of His death and resurrection and therefore is filled with these fragrances.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At this point we read of ivory palaces where there are stringed instruments which make Him glad.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is the meaning of this?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ivory here signifies the unbroken life of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Christ was on the cross, none of His bones were broken John 19:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Ivory is a kind of bone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eve was formed out of a bone from Adam Gen 2:22 , typifying the church which has come out of the unbroken, resurrection life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, the ivory palaces are not the heavenly mansions, but the local churches, which issue from Christ s resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Out of the local churches the music, the singing and the praising rise unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>So, you see, what we need in the local churches is the raising up of praises.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to praise Him according to all these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>TOUCHING THE QUEEN</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have seen that the church is mentioned as the ivory palaces in verse 8.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, the church in this verse is pictured as a building.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then in verse 9, the church is also mentioned, but this time as the Queen.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The palaces are the building, and the Queen is the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the entire Bible God always uses these two figures to signify the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Genesis 2 there are firstly all the materials for the building and secondly a bride, Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then when we come to the end of the Scriptures, we see the completed building; it is the bride, the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>So in this Psalm we see the church on one hand as the dwelling place of the Lord and on the other hand as the wife of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How many praises we can compose out of such experience!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we are praising Christ, we can never forget the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ and the church are forever joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now let us read verse 9: Kings daughters were among thy honorable women...</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the praise to Christ, but about the saints, the kings daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Spiritually speaking, before the Lord we are all females; we are the kings daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We were poor sinners, but now we are royal, we are kingly, we belong to the King s family.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do not imagine that the kings daughters are one group and the honorable women another.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No, the kings daughters are the honorable women.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The kings daughters speak of our royalty; the honorable women speak of our honor and majesty.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should not be proud, but we must all realize that we are so kingly, so honorable.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What praise this will inspire!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When you walk on the street, do people sense something honorable about you?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should not forget our royal state and our honor.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is praise about us, but this is praise to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If others say, Look at those poor Christians, what miserable beggars they are! that would be a shame to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, when people recognize or sense something in us of our royal and honorable nature, though they may not agree with us, that is a real glory to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>How much praise we too can render to Christ for all we see of Him in the kings daughters and honorable women.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Verse 9 goes on to say, Upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The kings daughters are the saints, and the Queen is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Individually speaking, we are the saints, but corporately speaking, we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are all one Queen; the Queen is a corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>And the Queen is at His right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Brothers, if you have your dear wife standing at your side, and I speak commendably of her, you will feel quite happy.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The praise is about your wife, but it goes to you.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The praise here is about the Queen, but it goes to the King.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When we say, Look, look at the resplendent glory of that golden Queen, the glory goes to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Every time we speak well of the church, Christ in heaven is made glad.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When we say, Praise the Lord for the church in Los Angeles, or, Praise the Lord for the church in Houston, He is well pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Whenever we commend or speak well of the local churches, it is a kind of praise to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The praise about the King must undoubtedly come first, but the praise regarding the Queen should follow.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Suppose you were the King: what part of the praise would make you happier?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If I were the King, I would delight more in the praise about the Queen.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Christ is deeply gratified when we speak well of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Our praises must not only be about Christ, but many times about the Queen, about the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Queen is seen in gold of Ophir.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Gold in typology signifies the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The church s beauty is not in anything but the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>She is royal and she is divine; she is in gold of Ophir, the best gold.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Then the Psalmist immediately turns to the Queen and says, Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father s house...</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Here we have instead of praises an instruction to the Queen which is exceedingly meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>But, I tell you, sometimes even the instructions given to the local churches are the same as praises in the ears of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Because the proper instructions given to the church make the church more really the church; therefore these too are praises.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>All the local churches must learn how to hear and how to forget: how to hear the Spirit s living, up-to-date speaking, and how to forget the past the old relationships, the old way, and the old background.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We must forget our people and our father s house So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The more we forget the past, the more beautiful we become.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Whenever I hear some people speak of their past, I have the sense of ugliness.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we would leave all the past and go on with the Lord in a new way, we would obtain beauty in the eyes of the King.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In verse 1 of this Psalm Christ is the King, in verse 2 He is a man, in verse 6 He is God, and in verse 11 He is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Because He is the Lord, He is worthy of our worship.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He is thy Lord; and worship thou Him.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The Bible allows us to worship only God; anything or anyone that is not God, we should not worship.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>But here we have the proper worship, because it is the worship of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>He is the King, He is a man, He is God, and He is the Lord He is everything!</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Worship Him!</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Verse 12: And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favor.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Here we see that if the local church is in a proper condition, the people of the earth will come to it.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Not only the poor and the lowly will come, but the rich and the honorable, on the one hand with a gift, and on the other hand to entreat the church s favor.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>All these are praises about the church, but praises to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Now let us go on to verse 13.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The king s daughter is all glorious within the inner part of the palaces: her clothing is of wrought gold.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Here we have not the daughters, but the daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>In verse 9 we read that the Queen was arrayed in gold, but here the clothing is of wrought gold.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Gold, as we have seen, signifies the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Wrought gold, however, signifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Christ is not only gold, but wrought gold.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>He with His divine nature has undergone so many sufferings and has been dealt with in so many ways that the gold in Him has become wrought gold.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Now this wrought gold, this Christ, is our clothing, our righteousness that we may stand in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>We are all justified with Christ; Christ becomes our righteousness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>What a source of praise!</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>In verse 14 we read, She the Queen shall be brought unto the king...</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>You see, it does not say that she shall be brought unto God, but unto the King.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Wrought gold is sufficient for us to be in the presence of God, but we need an added factor that we may stand in the presence of the King.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of broidered work.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>This raiment of embroidered work is the pure and white linen as the righteousnesses of the saints mentioned in Revelation 19.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>The clothing of wrought gold, as we have seen, is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>The raiment of embroidered work here is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>But the first is the objective Christ; the second is the subjective Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>The objective Christ is our righteousness that we may stand in the presence of God; the subjective Christ is Christ Himself woven into our character, embroidered into our being, that we may stand before the King.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>The latter is not merely a garment that we put on, but one that is worked into us, stitch by stitch.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Christ as the wrought gold is the righteousness put upon us that is our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>But following that, the Holy Spirit day by day is working to embroider Christ into us stitch after stitch.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Thus, we will have another raiment.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>We will have two robes: the first is for God the Father s satisfaction; the second is for Christ s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>It is by the second that we will be brought unto Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>All these are definitions and descriptions of the Queen, but praises unto Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>I believe that nearly all of you have upon you the wrought gold as your clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>But I also believe that there is a real shortage of the embroidery.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>All the brothers and sisters in the church life are indeed precious, and we praise the Lord for them.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>But in another sense everyone is a little needle.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>In the local churches we need many needles to do the embroidery work that Christ may be wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Then we will have another garment that will be a real praise to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>In Revelation 19 we see that it is by this garment that the bride is made ready.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Praise the Lord, we have the first robe, but we need the second robe that we may not only praise Christ, but be a praise to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>Verses 14 and 15: The virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king s palace.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>The virgins also are the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>They shall be brought with gladness and rejoicing they are all praises to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>They shall enter into the King s palace.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>All the saints shall be brought into the New Jerusalem.</S>
