<h2 class=head4>(2) Not Uncertainly</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 9:26a Paul says, “I therefore so run, not as uncertainly.” Paul did not run the race uncertainly but with a definite goal in view. Today we must run the race with a definite goal; we should not run uncertainly.<h2 class=head4>(3) Putting Off Every Encumbrance and the Entangling Sin</h2><p>In order to run the course of the race, we need to put off every encumbrance and the entangling sin (Heb. 12:1). The Greek word translated “encumbrance” in Hebrews 12:1 may also be rendered weight, burden, impediment. The runners in a race must strip off every unnecessary weight, every encumbering burden, that they may have no impediment to running the race. It is easy for us to pick up unnecessary burdens. But if we would run the Christian race, we need to put off every encumbrance, every unnecessary burden or impediment.<p>From Hebrews 12:1 we see that we also need to put off “the sin which so easily entangles us.” Here the sin refers mainly to the thing that entangles us from running the race. Both the encumbering weight and the entangling sin frustrate us in running the race. The encumbrances are outward, but the sin is inward, for it involves our sinful nature. Within our sinful nature there is something that often entangles us. In order to run the course of the Christian life, we need to put off the entangling sin.<h2 class=head4>(4) With Endurance</h2><p>At the end of Hebrews 12:1 we are charged to “run with endurance the race which is set before us.” We need to run with endurance because there is much opposition to the Christian race. In order to run this race, we must suffer the opposition with endurance, never growing weary or fainting in our souls (v. 3).<h2 class=head4>(5) Looking unto Jesus Who Is Now Seated at the Right Hand of the Throne of God in the Heavens</h2><p>The believers run the course of the race also by “looking away unto Jesus” (Heb. 12:2). The Greek word translated “looking away unto” means to look with undivided attention by turning away from every other object. The runners in a race should turn away from everything else and look at the goal with undivided attention. We need to turn away from everything other than Christ and look to Him with undivided attention. This is the way to run the race.<p>Hebrews 12:2 tells us to look away unto Jesus, “the Author and Perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.” In the book of Hebrews Paul points us particularly to the Christ seated in heaven with so many aspects to care for us in every way. If we would enjoy this heavenly Christ, we need to look away from all things on earth unto Him who is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. By His death and resurrection He accomplished everything that is needed for both God and us. Now in His ascension He is sitting in the heavens as the Son of God (Heb. 1:5) and the Son of Man (2:6), as the appointed Heir of all things (1:2), the anointed One of God (1:9), the Captain of our salvation (2:10), the Sanctifier (2:11), the instant Helper and constant Succor (2:18), the Apostle from God (3:1), the High Priest (2:17; 4:14; 7:26), the Minister in the true tabernacle (8:2) with a more excellent ministry (8:6), the surety and the Mediator of a better covenant (7:22; 8:6; 12:24), the Executor of the new testament (9:16-17), the Forerunner (6:20), the Author and Perfecter of faith (12:2), and as the great Shepherd of the sheep (13:20). If we look unto Him as such a wonderful and all-inclusive One, He, ministering heaven, life, and strength to us, will transfuse and infuse us with all that He is to enable us to run the heavenly race and to live the heavenly life on earth, carrying us through all the lifelong pathway and leading and bringing us into glory (2:10).<p>The wonderful Jesus, who is enthroned in heaven and crowned with glory and honor (2:9), is the greatest attraction in the universe, like an immense magnet drawing all His seekers unto Him. It is by being attracted by His charming beauty that we look away from all things other than Him that we may run with endurance the race which is set before us.<h2 class=head4>(6) Not in Vain</h2><p>Our running the course of the race is not in vain. Paul was concerned about running in vain (Gal. 2:2). We do not run uncertainly or in vain; instead, we run with a definite goal and in reality.<h2 class=head4>(7) By Obeying the Truth—the Reality in Christ Preached by the Apostle</h2><p>The believers run the Christian race by obeying the truth, the reality in Christ preached by the gospel. Galatians 5:7 says, “You were running well; who hindered you that you should not obey the truth?” Truth here does not refer to doctrine but to the reality in Christ, as preached to the Galatians by Paul.<h2 class=head4>(8) To the End</h2><p>The believers need to run the course of the race to the end. This is indicated by Paul’s word in 2 Timothy 4:7b: “I have finished the course.”
