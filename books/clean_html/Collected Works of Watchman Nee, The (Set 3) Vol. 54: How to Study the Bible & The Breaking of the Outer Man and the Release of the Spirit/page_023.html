<h2 class="head4">d. Isolated Examples</h2><h2 class="head5">1) "Who Is My Neighbor?"</h2><p>In the story of the good Samaritan in Luke 10, we should focus on the Lord's word. The lawyer asked, "Who is my neighbor?" (v. 29). The Lord's answer was based on something completely different. Verse 27 says, "You shall love...your neighbor as yourself." The word yourself refers to the lawyer, and the neighbor must be someone other than the lawyer. In effect the Lord was saying, "If you, the lawyer, can love your neighbor as you love yourself, you will have eternal life." Verse 29 says, "But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?" He thought that the Lord Jesus was asking him to love others, and he wanted to find out who these others were. The Lord responded with the story of the good Samaritan, and at the end, asked, "Which of these three, does it seem to you, has become a neighbor to him who fell into the hands of the robbers?" The lawyer answered, "The one who showed mercy to him." Jesus said, "Go, and you do likewise" (vv. 36-37). The lawyer asked who his neighbor was, and the Lord Jesus responded by asking who was the neighbor of the man who fell into the hands of the robbers. In other words, the lawyer was the one who had fallen into the hands of the robbers. The One who showed mercy to him was his neighbor. The neighbor does not refer to any man; it refers to the Savior. The Lord showed the lawyer that the neighbor is the Lord Himself. He said, "Go, and you do likewise." This means that the lawyer should do his best to love that Samaritan. Many people have turned the parable around. They think that the Lord wants them to be the Samaritan. They do not realize that they cannot go to the cross to forgive sins, and they cannot be lifted up to bring down the Holy Spirit. Only He has the wine and the oil. Only He has the beast, the inn, and the denarii. We are not the Samaritan. It would be totally wrong to ask the man who fell into the hands of the robbers to be the Samaritan. The neighbor whom the Lord referred to was the Samaritan. This means that the Lord came to be our Neighbor; He came to save us, to provide us with the beast, the wine, which signifies the forgiveness, the oil, which signifies the life, the inn, which signifies the church, and the denarii, which signify the gifts and grace. These things He gives until He returns. When the Lord tells us to love the Samaritan, He is telling us to love Him. We have to learn to touch the fine points in this passage. This is the way to read the stories in the Bible.</p><h2 class="head5">2) The Lord's Dignity and Glory</h2><p>When men sought to catch the Lord in the garden of Gethsemane, He stepped forward and said to them, "Whom do you seek? They answered Him, Jesus the Nazarene. He said to them, I am....They drew back and fell to the ground" (John 18:4-6). The Lord simply spoke one sentence, and they drew back and fell to the ground. What a glory we find here!</p><p>Our Lord prayed at the garden of Gethsemane, but He did not plead for anything at the court, before the high priest, or before the magistrate. This One is far above all. He is the Lord, yet He was judged. Who was actually judging whom? The high priest was the one who was agitated. He was the one who stumbled in words. Our Lord remained calm. When He appeared before the magistrate, it was the latter who became nervous; he was the one who was aimless in his questions. The Lord did not bother even to answer the questions. Jesus of Nazareth is God. Although He was put on trial, He did not lose His dignity or His honor.</p><p>In the garden of Gethsemane, He told the disciples to be watchful with Him (Matt. 26:38), but He did not ask them to supplicate for Him. Paul needed the brothers in Rome to pray for him (Rom. 15:30), but the Lord did not need anyone to pray for Him. He is the Son of God, and He does not need anyone to supplicate for Him. He asked the disciples to pray because He did not want them to enter into temptation (Matt. 26:41); He was asking them to pray for themselves. Here we can observe once again the Lord's dignity and honor.</p><p>He lived in poverty on earth, yet He did not ask anyone for any money. He prayed to God in the garden, yet He pleaded with no one in the court. Who is like the Son of God? The throne is glorious, but the glory of the judgment and the cross is even greater. We have to worship Him and say, "You are Lord! You are God!"</p>
