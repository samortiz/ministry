   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BELIEVER'S IGNORANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When a believer has fallen deeply into passivity, he may think that he is submissive to God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But he does not realize that evil spirits are utilizing his passive state to accomplish their deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The believer thinks he must be very passive before he can truly submit to God and before he can be truly in union with God in his will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He does not realize that God has no use for his passivity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is the power of darkness that has use for his passivity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Moreover, God requires that the believer exercise his own will to actively work with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is what the Bible repeatedly says: "If anyone resolves to do His will, he will know..."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 7:17 , and "Ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you" 15:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God does not annihilate our will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Human beings have a free will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God never infringes upon this and does not change this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He wants man to actively work with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Though He wants us to be submissive to Him, He does not annihilate our personality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Author's note: in this book, "personality" refers to "man's person," not "man's character."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The readers should take heed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He wants us to propose on our own and choose what He wants us to choose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He will not choose in our place, allowing our will to lapse into a state of deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He requires active cooperation from us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God delights to see man reaching the highest level of attainment as a creature, which is the total freedom of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God in creation established man's free will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God in redemption regains man's free will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At creation, God did not want man to obey Him mechanically.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, after redemption, He definitely does not want man to follow His direction like a machine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Indeed, God is so great that He does not require man to become wood and stone to submit to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His way is to rely on the working of His Spirit in us; the Spirit causes us to obey Him willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But He will never make any decision on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The difference here is truly immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The principle of God's work and Satan's work in man is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When God created man, He wanted man to have a free will.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why He gave man a free will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He wanted man to have the right to choose and determine everything related to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Though God is the Lord of the universe, He delights in being limited and does not infringe upon man's free will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He does not want to force man to be loyal to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Similarly, without man's consent consciously or unconsciously , Satan cannot occupy any part of man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Both God and the devil require the permission of man's will before they can work in man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Just as man "wants" a good thing and God accomplishes this for him, if man "wants" an evil thing, evil spirits accomplish this for him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is what we see in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before man is regenerated, his will is a slave to Satan and cannot be free.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But with a regenerated and victorious believer, his will is freed; he is able to choose all that is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, Satan will not give up on these newly regenerated believers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He will scheme to gain them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He knows he cannot obtain their clear permission for evil spirits to come into them and rule them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, he uses deceit to obtain the required permission.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should note that Satan must obtain the believer's permission.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, a believer will certainly not give him the permission.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is why he can only steal this permission through deceptive maneuvering.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Evil spirits will not come into a person without first gaining the permission of man's will.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even the degree to which they enter is determined by man's will.</S>
