<h2 class="head1">THE HOLY WORD ENABLING US TO KNOW CHRIST</h2>
<p>In order for something to occupy us, it must pass through our mind. If we want to gain a person, we must first gain his mind. Hence, newspapers and magazines are filled with words of advertisement to engage a person&rsquo;s mind. We may not pay much attention to words, but they are important. A person who speaks effectively will prosper, and a person who speaks convincingly will prevail.</p>
<p>If God had never spoken, we would be confused concerning everything in the universe. However, our God speaks, and He is the Word. He has even put His words into writing in the Bible. There are sixty-six books in the Bible, and every chapter of every book is God&rsquo;s word. God speaks so that we would know and understand that He is a speaking God and that the Lord Jesus is the Word. Since we have God&rsquo;s Word, we know that He is the Word, that He is triune, that He is life, and that the Spirit dwells in us. We would not have a way to know all these matters without God&rsquo;s speaking. We can know and understand the things of God because He has spoken.</p>
<p>Hebrews 1:1-2 says, &ldquo;God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son.&rdquo; God spoke to the fathers through the prophets, but now He speaks to us in His Son. God is a speaking God, He is the Word, and He gave us the Bible, His Word. When we read the Bible, we are enlightened to understand many things that scientists and philosophers are not able to understand. The Bible tells us who God is, and it tells us the source and destination of the universe. It also tells us where we came from, where we are, and where we are going. The more we read the Bible, the more enlightened we will be. God&rsquo;s word is precious.</p>
<p>We must remember that Christ is the Word of God; He is what God speaks, and He is what God reveals. If we want to know the Bible, we must know Christ. Christ is the key that opens up the Bible. Furthermore, if we did not have the Bible, we would not know the Lord Jesus: we would not know that He is the Son of God, that He bore our sins on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24), that our old man was crucified with Him (Rom. 6:6), that He destroyed Satan on the cross (Heb. 2:14), that He accomplished the work of redemption on the cross, that He resurrected from the dead and is sitting at the right hand of God (Eph. 1:20), or that God has given Him the name which is above every name (Phil. 2:9) and has given all authority in heaven and on earth to Him (Matt. 28:18). The more we read the Bible, the more we will see and know our glorious, great, and immeasurably rich Lord. We are thankful that God has given us the Bible, which fully reveals His Son, our glorious Lord Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT ENABLING US TO GAIN CHRIST</h2>
<p>Not only do we have a mind, which is a part of our soul; we also have a spirit, which is deeper than our soul. If the Lord were only the Word and not the Spirit, He would be able to reach only our mind for us to understand Him, but He would be unable to enter our spirit for us to gain Him. The Lord, however, is not only the Word but also the Spirit. The Word is the explanation of the Lord, but the Spirit is His essence. The Word explains the Lord to us so that we may apprehend, understand, and know Him. However, He is not only the Word; He is also the Spirit so that we can contact Him with our spirit.</p>
<p>We must see that God has not only prepared the Word for us but also given the Spirit to us. These two items are related. When the Word enters into us, it is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is released from within us through the Word.</p>
<p>A brother might read Genesis 1:1 in the morning. This verse says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; This is a very simple word. However, while reading it, he might pray, &ldquo;Lord, You are the beginning of everything.&rdquo; Then he will be full of praise and spontaneously say, &ldquo;Lord, I praise You because You are the beginning of all things. I want You to also be the beginning of everything that I do today. I do not want to begin anything.&rdquo; By praising and praying in such a way, the Word enters into him. Hence, the Word that he contacted and received becomes the moving of the Spirit within him. This example shows that the Bible is outside of us, but once we contact and receive it, it becomes the Spirit within us. God is the Word, and He is the Spirit; hence, the Word is the Spirit. As soon as the Word enters into us, it becomes the Spirit.</p>
<p>Every person who is filled with God&rsquo;s speaking is also filled with the Spirit. A person who has no understanding of the Bible and no knowledge of the Lord Jesus has no way to be filled with the Spirit. There is a brother who was filled with the Spirit the first time that he prayed. He knelt down and confessed, &ldquo;Lord, I am a sinner. You are the Son of God, and You are my Savior. You died on the cross for me.&rdquo; At that time he wept and was filled with the Spirit. His prayer was according to the Bible. We can receive the Spirit only through the Word. The Word that we receive enters into our spirit and becomes the Spirit.</p>
