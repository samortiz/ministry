   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the past, our Lord's Day morning meetings were carried out in a routine way.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Very few came to the meeting with a sincere heart, burdened for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Most did not bear the burden even to pray for the meeting because they knew the responsible brothers would.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The situation in the eldership in some places in the past was not so encouraging either.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before a brother became an elder, he may have been sitting in the back in the meeting without much exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One day he was appointed to be an elder, and then he came to sit in the first row.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>During the meeting the need might have arisen for a hymn or for a word to be spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The elders all looked at one another, but no one could meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Most of the elders do not endeavor; instead, they do a routine work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If I were doing a routine work, I would not be able to travel so much in order to hold so many conferences, nor would I be able to publish so many books.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>My fellowship with you here concerns the destiny of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is a matter of life or death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do we really love the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Are we really for Him and for His recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are, we have to forget about the routine work, and endeavor and labor to do something extra.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even as an older brother, I am still studying.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The point is this: if there is no labor, no work, there is no result, no profit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>People who desire to make a big profit in business do not waste their time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Anyone who works only eight hours a day cannot be wealthy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He can only make a living as an employee.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who among us is laboring for the Lord's recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we had been laboring, we would have studied the new way to carry out the increase and spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We would have practiced visiting people by knocking on their doors to find out about it and to break through in our increase.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Spontaneously we would have set up a pattern for the other saints to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the flock, the sheep taking the lead may be considered as the head sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The elders are the head sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When they go in a positive direction, the rest of the saints will follow them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In some places the elders did not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead of getting into preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes and practicing it to set up a living example, they restricted the saints from knocking on doors and poured cold water upon this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some want to stop the saints from going out to knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They do not care for the fruit, the increase.</S>
