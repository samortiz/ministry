The Move of the Divine Life<br>in the Believers' Inner Being</H2><P>Transformation is the issue of the move of the divine life in the believers' inner being. This is very intrinsic. Every living thing moves. The move of life within us is the result of our eating. Whatever we eat is digested and assimilated into our cells. This digestion and assimilation is what I call the move of the divine life in the believers' inner being. When we eat and drink Christ, He becomes the new element within us to replace and discharge the old things within us. The divine essence comes into us to replace the fallen human element, causing us to be transformed metabolically and inwardly.</P><P>After you have been saved, you have the desire to live a life like Jesus. Thus, when you lose your temper, you are full of regret and ask the Lord to forgive you. Then you may pray, "Lord, You know I am weak. I have no way to deal with my temper. You must come in to deal with it." But when your temper rises up again, you do not allow Jesus to deal with it. You try to deal with it yourself, and you are defeated. Instead of trying to deal with your temper, you have to realize that the divine life is in you. This is basic. We all have Jesus' life within us, and this life is divine, living, moving, organic, and very energetic. While this life moves, lives, and works, it will deal with your temper.</P><P>The apostle Paul said, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" (Gal. 2:20a). We need to say, "I can do nothing and I don't want to do anything. I have been crucified. It is no longer I dealing with or being concerned for my temper, but it is Christ who lives in me." Do not forget that you have another life, the divine life, and this life is stronger than your first life. When your temper is rising up, just say, "O Lord Jesus." Do not try to do anything. Just wait, and let Him do it. Whenever He does something, He will cause you to go along with Him. This secret is not known to most Christians, and this secret is very fine. When an occasion comes to cause you to lose your temper, do everything slowly. If your wife is tempting you to lose your temper, it is best not to do anything. Remember that you have been crucified, and that it is no longer you, but Christ who lives in you. Then He will begin to take care of your temper, not just by Himself but with you. He will cause you to walk with Him so naturally, and your temper will go away.</P><P>Another weakness we have is that we like to talk about others. Mostly we like to talk about others in a critical way. We may regret this and confess our sin to the Lord. Then we may say, "Lord, help me never to do this again." But the Lord does not hear this kind of prayer. We should not try in and by ourselves to overcome our temper and our criticism of others. This is wrong.</P><P>Instead, morning by morning and day by day, we should enjoy Christ, realizing that it is "no longer I but Christ who lives in me." We have been regenerated, and we have another One living in us and with us. Thus, we do not need to do anything. We do not need to be concerned and anxious for so many things, because everything is in His hand. He is in us, and He takes care of us. We do not need to do anything regarding our temper. Instead, we should just say, "I am crucified with Christ, and it is no more I, but Christ who lives in me." In great things and in small things, we should always let Him live in us and through us.</P><P>On certain occasions, we may be angry with someone and we may want to go to speak to him, but the Lord would say, "If you go, I am not going with you." We should respond by saying, "Lord, if You don't go, I will not go." This is what it means to live Christ. The way to have the victory is to live Christ. In everything, we should not act. Instead, we should allow Him to act because His living is our victory. Whenever we live Christ, He as the divine life is adding Himself into us. Then we are metabolically renewed with the new element of the divine life, the resurrection life. The new element of the divine life comes in to replace our old and fallen element.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> </body></html>
