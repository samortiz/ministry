   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO RIVALRY OR VAINGLORY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 3 says, "Let nothing be done by the way of rivalry or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>. According to this verse, there must have been rivalry and the seeking of vainglory among the Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is not the way to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The enjoyment of Christ has nothing to do with rivalry or vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we do anything by the way of rivalry or vainglory, we are through with the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>LOOKING ON THE QUALITIES OF OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 4 says, "Look not every man on his own qualities, but every man also on those of others" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>. No doubt, some of the Philippians were looking on their own qualities, on their own good points.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But Paul was telling them to look also on the qualities of others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then, according to the Greek, in verse 5 Paul said, "Think this, which was also in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, Paul was telling them to think whatever Christ thought.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the way for us to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>HAVING A CO-SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this message we have seen the detailed way to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, we need to preach the gospel in the fellowship of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order to keep ourselves in the fellowship of the gospel, we need to deal with our soul and be one in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Actually, the Greek word translated "one in soul" in Philippians 2:2 should be translated "co-soul."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all need to have the same soul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The problem today is that we do not have a co-soul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, we are one in spirit, but we are different in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can pray, praise, and sing together because all this is in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we may not be able to talk together.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that we are one in spirit, but not one in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the meetings we have a co-spirit, but in our daily walk we do not have a co-soul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For the enjoyment of Christ, we need such a co-soul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to be together in the soul as well as in the spirit.</S>
