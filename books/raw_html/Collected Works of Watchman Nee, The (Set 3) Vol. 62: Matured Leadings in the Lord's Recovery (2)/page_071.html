<h2 class="head1">THE MORE ADVANCED ONES<br />TEACHING THE MORE RECENT NEWCOMERS</h2><p>We cannot advance to new lessons unless we have first finished the fifty-two Messages for Building Up New Believers. For this reason we have to learn every one of these lessons thoroughly. Then we can help the newly saved ones pass on the same teachings to the next generation. This does not mean that we have to know all fifty-two lessons and learn them all by heart within a year before we can graduate and teach others. As long as we have learned something in the last month, we can use the same material to teach the new ones this month. This is like a provisional makeshift military school where the more advanced students serve as teachers to the newcomers. When I was young I studied at Trinity College. For a while I substituted for the teacher. I could teach, but this does not mean that I could sit down and teach as a teacher. When I spoke to the class, I dared not sit like the teacher; I had to stand while I spoke. Those who have learned a new believers' lesson last month can teach the new ones who show up the next month. But they can only teach as one student teaching another student; they cannot assume the role of a teacher. All waves eventually are caught up by the waves behind them. The latter glory is always greater than the former glory. The last shall be the first (Matt. 19:30). However, if the first group does not set a good standard, the ones who follow will not be able to go on in a proper way. We have to follow the way of the army in our training; we have to raise up our own teachers and then assign them to teach. We have to make up the lessons ourselves first and then help others make them up.</p><h2 class="head1">TAKING CARE OF OUR LANGUAGE</h2><p>The hidden reef in our visitation and fellowship is our mouth. James said that we bless the Lord and Father with our mouth and also curse men who have been made according to the likeness of God with our mouth (3:9). Satan has his way of dealing with the world. To him, there is not enough sin in the world; there is not enough to meet his need. He wants more sins. To him, murder, theft, idolatry, etc. are not enough. This is why he creates lies to increase the sins of this world. He thinks that the sins in conduct are too few in this world, and he stirs up man's mouth to multiply sin. Of all the transgressions in this world, sins in action occupy less than one-quarter; the others are sins in words. These are produced by Satan through man's mouth when many things are said and many lies and rumors spread.</p><p>Satan multiplies the sins of this world through man's mouth. When lies multiply, sins multiply. Satan was a liar from the beginning, and he is the father of liars (John 8:44). Who are the liars? Everyone who lies is a follower of Satan. James said that the tongue is a fire that is set on fire by Gehenna; it is the very world of unrighteousness (3:6). Man's mouth can create all the sins of this world. Many people like to speak, and they like to speak inaccurate words, evil words, and idle words. These ones are helping Satan multiply sin in this world; they are followers of Satan's way.</p><p>If our mouth is clean today, Satan can do nothing in this world. If sin decreases, Satan will be out of a job; he will be unemployed. In Matthew 5 the Lord Jesus said that our words should be yes, yes, and no, no. Anything more than this is of Satan (v. 37). We should not have any gossip, rumors, or idle talk in our family. In our fellowship with the brothers and sisters, we should only speak spiritual words and words of building; we should not help Satan multiply sin with our mouth.</p>
