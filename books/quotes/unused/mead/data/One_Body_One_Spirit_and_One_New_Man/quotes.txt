[2]  This book is a translation of messages given in Chinese by Brother Witness Lee during an international training in Taipei in October 1977.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE SPIRIT AND THE BODY Scripture Reading: Eph 4:4a; 1:23; 1 Cor 12:13, 12
[4]  In these messages we will consider the one Body and the one Spirit.
[5]  We all know that in Ephesians 4 there are two great matters: One is the Body, and the other is the Spirit.
[6]  Because in the church many of you have received much help and have had many experiences, you know what I am talking about when I speak of one Body and one Spirit.
[7]  The record in Luke 24 tells us that after His resurrection and before His ascension, when He met the two disciples on the road to Emmaus, the Lord told them, "Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into His glory?" v. 26 . This proves that when He resurrected, even though He had not yet ascended, He had already entered into His glory.
[8]  ALL THE EXPERIENCES OF CHRIST BEING IN THE SPIRIT
[9]  Do not think that I am exaggerating; over the past fifty years, the Lord has led us to progress in our knowledge of the truth.
[10]  Now we may speak something concerning the one Body.
[11]  MESSAGE TWO THE FULLNESS AND THE BODY Scripture Reading: Eph 1:23; Gal 3:27-28; Rom 12:5; 1 Cor 12:12; Acts 9:4-5; 1 Cor 1:13a THE BODY BEING THE FULLNESS OF THE ONE WHO FILLS ALL IN ALL
[12]  In this message we will speak directly about the Body.
[13]  We may say that there is only one verse in the entire New Testament that tells us what the Body is, and that is Ephesians 1:23: "Which the church is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all."
[14]  NOT BEING THE NATURAL MAN BUT THE MAN RECONSTITUTED WITH CHRIST
[15]  Someone may say, "Since I am a believer, I am a member of Christ."
[16]  It is only when the life of Christ, the nature of Christ, and everything of Christ have entered your being to regenerate and reconstitute you that you become a member of Christ.
[17]  The Body of Christ is the fullness of Christ, and the fullness of Christ is the issue of our being constituted with the riches of Christ which we have enjoyed.
[18]  THE LORD'S RECOVERY BEING THE RECOVERY OF THE ONENESS OF THE BODY
[19]  It is not a recovery of a certain truth or of a certain doctrine; the Lord's recovery today is a recovery of this oneness in Christ.
[20]  When I was young, I also thoroughly studied the matter of the sisters covering their heads.
[21]  I studied this matter to such an extent that I looked even into the color, size, style, thickness, and material of the covering, and I even studied how it should be worn.
[22]  MESSAGE THREE THE PRACTICAL EXPRESSION OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: Eph 1:23; 4:10, 13
[23]  In these days I have been very happy because for many years I have been waiting for an opportunity to release some messages specifically concerning the Body of Christ.
[24]  Now I feel that I have such a good opportunity for us to focus on the Body.
[25]  THERE BEING NO BODY OF CHRIST WHEN WE LIVE BY THE FLESH OR THE NATURAL MAN
[26]  If you have this light and use it to carefully examine today's Christianity, you will say that the Body of Christ is nowhere to be found.
[27]  THE LORD URGENTLY NEEDING THE EXPRESSION OF THE BODY
[28]  THE CONDITION OF THE CHURCH TODAY LACKING THE REALITY OF THE BODY
[29]  But, and this is a big "but," suppose the brothers and sisters in Los Angeles apparently are meeting in the name of the Lord as the church in Los Angeles, but when they live, they all live by their natural being, their flesh, their self, their individuality, and their peculiarities.
[30]  If this is their condition, do you think the so-called "church in Los Angeles" is a part of Christ?
[31]  THE CHURCH BEING THE BODY, AND THE BODY BEING THE FULLNESS
[32]  We must pay attention to the fact that in the New Testament fullness is not an adjective but a noun.
[33]  CHRIST BEING THE HEAD AND CHRIST BEING THE BODY
[34]  How then does Christ constitute Himself into us to become His fullness?
[35]  I can say it in this way: The Lord Jesus in Himself is the Head, and the Lord Jesus constituted into us is the Body.
[36]  THE BODY NEEDING TO GROW UNTIL IT ARRIVES AT THE PROPER MEASURE OF ITS STATURE
[37]  It is quite possible that as we are meeting here at this time, Christ is being experienced from within us, and this Christ experienced from within is the Body of Christ.
[38]  If, as the churches in all the localities, you enjoy more of Christ, experience more of Christ, have more Christ constituted into you, and have more Christ experienced from within you day by day, you will cause the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ to increase in all the localities.
[39]  For example in John 14, Philip said to the Lord, "Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us" v. 8 . The Lord Jesus then said, "Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father?" v. 9 . Then in verses 16 through 20, the Lord said, "I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever .I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you .In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you." Furthermore, 1 Corinthians 15:45b says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit," and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, "The Lord is the Spirit." Eventually, in Revelation, the last book of the Bible, there are seven epistles written to seven churches.
[40]  Our measure today is not enough, so we need to enjoy and experience Him every day.
[41]  When we enjoy Him and experience Him every day, the measure of the stature gradually increases until one day we will arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness.
[42]  When we pray, we must touch Him; when we read the Word, we must touch Him; when we read the life-studies, we must touch Him Christ as the living Spirit.
[43]  Some people in Christianity do not have this light.
[44]  BEING DELIVERED FROM RELIGIOUS RITUALS, PAYING ATTENTION ONLY TO THE ONENESS OF THE FAITH
[45]  In addition, there is another problem, that is, so-called religious piety.
[46]  CHAPTER FIVE THE NEW MAN BEING UNIQUELY ONE Scripture Reading: Eph 2:15-16; 4:3, 22, 24; Rom 15:6; 1 Cor 1:10 TOUCHING THE DEEPEST MATTERS
[47]  In these messages, we can say that we are touching some of the deepest matters in the New Testament, and we can say that these are matters that Christianity has not touched for centuries.
[48]  The term Body has been used many times in the writings of Christianity, but the writers have not touched the particular points concerning the Body, nor have they seen the vision of the Body.
[49]  THE BODY BEING A MATTER OF LIFE AND THE NEW MAN BEING A MATTER OF PERSON
[50]  The Bible has a few passages that are so profound that our natural mind cannot understand them at all.
[51]  Why does verse 15 say that Christ has created the two in Himself into one new man, while verse 16 says that He has reconciled both in one Body to God?
[52]  IN THE NEW MAN THERE BEING ONLY ONE MOUTH
[53]  The Body is a matter of being members one of another, but for the new man the requirements are even more than what the Body requires.
[54]  For many years I read Romans 15:6, which says, "That with one accord you may with one mouth glorify God."
[55]  THERE BEING NO FREEDOM TO SPEAK OUR OWN THINGS IN THE NEW MAN
[56]  THE BODY BEING FOR MOVING AND THE NEW MAN BEING FOR LIVING
[57]  We still have not arrived at the highest point in our vision because our knowledge of the Body is insufficient, our knowledge of the new man is not enough, and also our knowledge of the bride is very limited.
[58]  Nevertheless, I hope that we can see something concerning the Body and the new man.
[59]  CHAPTER SIX PUTTING ON THE LIVING OF THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Eph 4:11-16 THE BODY AND THE NEW MAN BEING THE HIGHEST VISION OF GOD
[60]  As we have said before, on the one hand, the church is the Body, and on the other hand, the church is the new man.
[61]  In the Body we are members one of another, but in the new man what are we to one another?
[62]  I cannot say for sure, but you must understand that in the new man all of us are simply one man.
[63]  If we want to understand Ephesians 4:13, we must begin reading at 4:11.
[64]  TAKING CARE OF THE UNIVERSAL NEW MAN IN OUR DAILY WALK
[65]  I must take the opportunity at this time to speak a word on taking care of the universal new man in our daily walk.
[66]  If we have all seen the vision of the new man and have seen that all the churches are not merely individual local churches but the one new man, we will be willing to say, "Lord, I want to receive grace and mercy with all the saints as the one new man, taking You as the person in all of us."
[67]  If you take Christ in this way as the person of this corporate new man, you will not decide anything in your life by yourself.
[68]  Dear brothers and sisters, do you want to grow?
[69]  NOT BEING LITTLE CHILDREN CARRIED ABOUT BY WINDS OF TEACHING
[70]  After this, verse 14 continues to say that we should no longer be little children.
[71]  CHAPTER SEVEN ONE NEW MAN APPEARING IN ALL THE EARTH Scripture Reading: Eph 4:13-16; 1 Cor 12:14-17 THE FOUR-LEVEL MEANING OF THE CHURCH ASSEMBLY, HOUSE, BODY, MAN
[72]  The Chinese term for church readily conveys the meaning of the church as being a congregation.
[73]  We cannot say that to understand the church as a congregation is wrong, but this concept is too human, natural, and religious.
[74]  ALL THE CHURCHES ON EARTH AS ONE NEW MAN BEING POSSIBLE ACCORDING TO THE LORD'S WORD
[75]  Dear brothers and sisters, I am looking to the Lord from the depths of my being that at this time when saints from all the six continents are meeting together here, we would all seize the opportunity to see the highest meaning of the church revealed in the Bible.
[76]  I absolutely believe that from that time on, their criticizing mouths were sealed.
[77]  We would have given them everything, and all that we asked for in return was the oneness.
[78]  HENCEFORTH THE LORD DEFINITELY MAKING ALL THE CHURCHES ON THE EARTH INTO ONE NEW MAN
[79]  I absolutely believe that this conference and training are symbolic.
[80]  Now we must come to see how we can become the one new man.
[81]  WITH ONE HEART AND ONE MOUTH SPEAKING THE SAME THING
[82]  When that happens, even though we all are many, when we speak, it will be with one mouth because we will all speak the same thing.
[83]  You will not have to teach me something first, and also I will not have to tell you anything; yet we will speak the same thing.
[84]  CHAPTER EIGHT EXPERIENCING CHRIST TO BE JOINED AND KNIT TOGETHER Scripture Reading: Eph 4:13-16, 22-24 THE FIRST APPEARING OF THE CHURCH BEING IN AN INTERNATIONAL GROUP OF PEOPLE
[85]  The first time the church was established on the earth was on the day of Pentecost.
[86]  THE APPEARING OF THE NEW MAN BEING ENTIRELY A MATTER OF SPIRITUAL LIFE
[87]  In this message I want to give a further word of fellowship.
[88]  It is not that you stir me up and I stir you up; instead, it is that each of us lives out Christ by enjoying and experiencing Him.
[89]  Moreover, I would like to say that in the Lord's economy there is no evolution; evolution is of the devil.
[90]  PUTTING OFF THE OLD MAN AND PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN
[91]  Verses 22 and 24 continue to say that we must put off the old man and put on the new man.
[92]  MESSAGE NINE DRINKING OF THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Eph 4:3-4; 1 Cor 12:13; 6:17; Phil 1:19b; Eph 4:23; 2 Tim 4:22a
[93]  I absolutely believe that at this time the Lord's Spirit has led us to touch the matter of the Body, and from the Body to touch the new man.
[94]  The problem with today's Christianity is that many do not know the Spirit in a proper way.
[95]  Second, prior to us there may never have been anyone who paid adequate attention to the seven Spirits in Revelation.
[96]  Today we not only see that the Holy Spirit is part of the Triune God the Holy Father, the Holy Son, and the Holy Spirit nor do we only see the Spirit of Pentecost who enables people to have the manifestation of different gifts, including speaking in tongues but we also see that the resurrected Christ is the life-giving Spirit and that in the darkest hour of the church age this Spirit has become the sevenfold intensified Spirit.
[97]  CHAPTER TEN THE SPIRIT AND THE SEVEN SPIRITS Scripture Reading: Rev 1:4; 2:7, 11, 17, 26-29; 3:5-6, 12-13, 21-22; 14:13; 22:17 REVELATION BEING A BOOK ON THE SPIRIT AND THE CHURCHES
[98]  In this message we come to Revelation, which is the last book of the Bible.
[99]  From the time I was saved, I loved to read the Bible, and I loved understanding the Bible even more.
[100]  THE BOOK OF REVELATION BEING CLOSED TO CHRISTIANITY BUT OPENED TO THE CHURCHES
[101]  Poor Christianity has degraded into a religion that pays attention only to outward actions and outward corrections.
[102]  I can truthfully say that through our Chinese heritage we all understand ethics and morality, and we all know how to improve ourselves.
[103]  Brothers and sisters, in conclusion I would like to say that if you would like to be a top Christian, you must be a Christian in the churches of the Lord's recovery.
