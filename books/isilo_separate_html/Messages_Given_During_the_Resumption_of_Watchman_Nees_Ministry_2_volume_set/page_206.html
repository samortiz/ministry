If you withstand Satan in an inward way, you do not know whether or not the withstanding works. But if you say a few words, Satan will go away.</P><P>The same is true with baptism. Once a person believes, he needs to be baptized. Perhaps some will think that it is too quick to baptize a person right after he believes. But this is wrong. To believe with the heart is something that is invisible. One must have the visible baptism before the matter is settled. To believe with the heart is mystical. To be baptized in the body is tangible.</P><P>The same is true with consecration. A mystical consecration is not solid. Many consecrations remain a mystical consecration. Many say to the Lord, "I consecrate everything." But the Gospel of Luke shows us that Zaccheus' consecration was very concrete. He offered up his possessions (Luke 19:8). The Lord's command to him was also very concrete. During the past one hundred years, the church has received many mystical consecrations. But the consecrations at the time of the early apostles were tangible consecrations. At that time, when a man handed himself over, everything was settled. Every brother and sister should hand over himself or herself; everyone should submit to the authority of the church and should be coordinated together with other brothers and sisters. Brother Witness said it well: When the church is advancing and the material offering falls behind, it is the fault of the brothers and sisters; while, on the other hand, if the material offering is adequate, yet the gospel falls behind, it is the fault of the co-workers. Those brothers and sisters who participate in the spiritual services have to be coordinated, and those brothers and sisters who are holding jobs should also be coordinated. Some sisters wanted to offer up something, but I declined their offerings, because they had not offered up themselves yet. First Corinthians tells us that God first receives us, and then ours. The person has to come first, before the possessions and the time come also.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD BEING AFTER ABSOLUTE ONES</H2><P>The coordination that we are speaking of today is one that costs the co-workers' lives. It is one that also costs the other brothers' and sisters' lives. All the brothers and sisters must have the Lord as their center, and they have to offer up everything for the gospel and for the service. We do not consider being a Christian to be our second profession. Some are professing Christians. But we should be the "professional" Christians. Christ should be our first profession. All the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs should offer up all their time. The Lord demands that we deny ourselves for the sake of loving Him. The Lord's demand is the same today as it was in the first century. In God's word, there is no place for halfway ones; there are only absolute ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A PRAYER</H2><P>Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi prayed: May the Lord forbid that tonight's words be merely mysterious words in our heart. May they be transformed to outward realities. May they not be merely notions, but realities. May they not be merely doctrines, but life. May they not be something that is nice to hear, but something that is good to see. May we not have fragmentary services, but complete services. May we not only have a consecration of the heart and the mouth, but a consecration of the hands and the feet. Amen.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_205.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_207.html">Next</a> </body></html>
