<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>LIVING AND WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:4, 6, 14; Gal. 5:25; Eph. 6:18; 1 Thes. 5:17, 19; Rev. 1:10a</h1><h2 class=head1>THE TRIUNE GOD BECOMING THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</h2><p>The Bible ultimately shows us one thing: God passed through creation, incarnation, more than thirty-three years of human living on earth, and death on the cross; then He came out of death and was resurrected. In this wonderful resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit as the consummate expression of the Triune God. This Spirit is on the throne today and is also moving on the earth, waiting for people to receive Him. Wherever one is, as long as he is willing to repent and believe into the Lord Jesus by calling on His name, the Spirit will immediately enter such a one. This wonderful Spirit thus becomes one spirit with the spirit of this believing one. This is the mystery of mysteries in the universe. This is also the greatest, highest, deepest, and richest mystery in the universe.<p>Since the Triune God went through creation, incarnation, thirty-three and a half years of human living, death, and resurrection, He possesses all these qualifications. He is the Creator, the Redeemer, the God-man, and the One who died and resurrected. He has divinity with humanity; in Him are the effectiveness of His marvelous death, the power of His resurrection, and the transcendence of His ascension. Furthermore, He is the Ruler on the throne with all authority; both the kingdom and glory belong to Him. All positive things are concentrated on Him and in Him. He is truly all-inclusive. As long as you receive Him and let Him come into you, the riches of His all-inclusiveness also will come into you. He is within you today as the Spirit. The Spirit, the rich Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, the Spirit who passed through death and was raised from the dead, the Spirit with the effectiveness of death and the power of resurrection, is now in you. Hallelujah!<p>Everyone who believes into Him has this Spirit. Furthermore, as He is in our spirit, He becomes one spirit with our spirit. “He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit” (1 Cor. 6:17). What a glorious thing it is that we and the all-inclusive Lord have become one spirit! He is we, and we are He. He and we, and we and He are one spirit. In this one Spirit there are divinity, humanity, power, life, holiness, and glory. All the fullness is in Him.<h2 class=head1>LIVING AND WALKING ONLY ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2><p>What then shall we do? We do not need to do anything; we simply need to live and walk according to the Spirit. I hope that you all can see this, remember this, appreciate this, and praise the Lord for this. Hallelujah, I have become one spirit with the all-inclusive Spirit! What a marvelous salvation this is! Oh, how glorious is the story of the new creation! His redemption is eternally effective and truly worthy of our praises. This is not religion, nor ethics, nor morality, nor culture. This is the all-inclusive Spirit dwelling in our spirit. How glorious! This is the Spirit according to whom we live and walk. This is all that we need. This is the crystallization of the entire Bible. This is what the sixty-six books of the Bible are all about.<p>We know that when people cook food in a kitchen, the food goes through many processes. They have to kill some items and cut them into pieces; they have to put some items in a pot to be boiled and other items in the fire to be roasted; they have to add this and that. If you go to the kitchen to take a look while they are busy there, you will find a mess. You will see grease, blood, water, and fire. However, after all these processes are completed, there will be many delicious dishes set before you for you to eat. Likewise, in His economy the Triune God had to pass through various processes that He might become the Spirit. He passed through the processes of creating all things, becoming flesh, living on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, entering into death, passing through death to subdue and conquer death, coming out of death, and entering into resurrection. After these processes, a delicious dish was ready. This delicious dish is the all-inclusive Spirit. All you need to do is repent and believe, call on the Lord’s name, pray and receive Him; then this delicious dish will become your portion. We do not need to do anything; we only need to enjoy this Spirit.<p>Brothers and sisters, this Spirit is the tree of life in Genesis 2. What is the tree of life? It is the Triune God who went through creation, incarnation, human living on the earth, death, and resurrection to become the Spirit presented to you. You should receive Him, eat Him, and enjoy Him, and you should live and walk according to Him. This is different from religion, morality, and culture, which all require that you do something. Only the tree of life does not require you to do anything. You simply need to receive, to eat, to drink, and to live and walk according to Him.
