<p><em>Question: Was there no church at the time of Madame Guyon, Andrew Murray, or Dr. Meyer?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The church was there, but it had lost the proper ground. Madame Guyon had a strong and influential role in the church, but we must acknowledge that she did not stand on the ground of the church. She stood on the ground of the Roman Catholic Church, not on the proper ground of the church. Similarly, Andrew Murray and Dr. Meyer were strong and influential in the church, but in terms of the ground of the church, they were in organized Christianity. Their ground was organized Christianity, not the genuine ground of the church. They were a part of the church, but they did not stand on the ground of the church.</p>
<p>We are not saying that spirituality is unimportant. We confess that it is basic and important, but merely having this is inadequate. Rather than asking, &ldquo;What are you?&rdquo; we need to ask, &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; Let me use another illustration. A member of a family should live at home. If he goes anywhere else, whether to a place where he feeds hogs and eats carob pods or to a grand and luxurious palace, it is the wrong place. It is insufficient to merely be a member of a family; a member should also live at home. Therefore, it is not a question of who we are but of where we are. It was not a question of whether we are the church but of what ground we are on. Are we on the ground of the Catholic Church or the Protestant churches? Are we on the ground of the various denominations or on the ground of the church? In the case of the children of Israel, it was not a question of whether they were God&rsquo;s people but of where they were. Were they in Babylon or in Jerusalem? Were they in the wilderness of Arabia or in the land of Assyria or Samaria?</p>
<p>We deeply sense that among those who stood up to speak for God in the past several centuries, too many knew only who they were. Hardly anyone who has stood up to speak for God has genuinely asked this one question on God&rsquo;s behalf: &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; Throughout the ages God has recovered much, but there is still one matter that has yet to be recovered, that is, the matter of &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; The recovery of this matter began among us almost thirty years ago. Nevertheless, we must continue to ask, &ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; It is not sufficient merely to do things correctly. We will be right only when we are in the proper place. Sadly, until today, those who are saved by God focus only on what they are, but they neglect, or even greatly oppose, the matter of the ground. Some who have much spiritual knowledge strongly oppose, blame, and condemn us concerning this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A SUBTLE SCHEME OF THE ENEMY</h2>
<p>A subtle scheme of the enemy is to undermine the recovery through men who are very spiritual. This scheme of Satan is able to come in through almost anyone. No one is so spiritual that he cannot be used by Satan to damage the recovery. Satan is able to use any spiritual matter or any matter of faith as a covering. Today, at this critical juncture, we need to consider this matter clearly and carefully. Although what we have encountered and heard may cause us to feel troubled, we cannot let ourselves be easily shaken. In the past thirty years we have paid a great price and suffered innumerable attacks. We have been slandered and reproached many times because of our desire to maintain the ground of the church. But despite this, we should rise up to speak a clearer word concerning the ground of the church. The truth concerning the cross has been recovered and adequately preached, and the truth concerning resurrection has also been clearly and sufficiently preached. However, the matter of the ground of the church has not been adequately preached. This is the result of the enemy&rsquo;s scheme.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TARGET UNDER<br />
THE ENEMY&rsquo;S CONTINUAL ATTACKS</h2>
<p>In spiritual warfare the enemy continually attacks the place where there has been a &ldquo;military deployment.&rdquo; In the past thirty years people have not opposed us for the gospel. Neither are we wrong in regard to the truth. For the past thirty years we have been attacked fiercely, being accused and forsaken by other Christians. All this friction is due to the fact that we stand firmly on the ground of the church. In the past thirty years this has been the very item that the enemy has constantly sought to defeat. We are determined to guard this truth, and we must guard it. Moreover, if the Lord is merciful to us, we need to further strengthen this matter.</p>
<p>Brother T. Austin-Sparks once said that since God was unable to get what He was after in the West, He came to the East. We believe that this principle can also be applied to the matter of the ground of the church. Over the past century the matter of the ground has been damaged by much action, work, and speaking. As a result, people in the West avoid speaking of this matter and consider it a shame to do so. If someone were to ask about it, he would be regarded as being the same as the Brethren. My point is that God has had no way in the West. As a result, He was merciful to us by coming to the East.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
