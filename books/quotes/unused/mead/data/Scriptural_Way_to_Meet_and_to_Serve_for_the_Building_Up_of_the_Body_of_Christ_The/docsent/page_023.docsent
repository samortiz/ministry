   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED TO PAY A PRICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The foregoing statistics prove that the way of preaching the gospel by knocking on people s doors is prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We could not find another way so prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, our success depends on whether or not the saints in the Lord s recovery would sacrifice and pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must pay a price, for this way is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you go out to visit people in a natural way, you may gain no one, even after knocking on two hundred doors.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You must take the way of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before going out to knock on people s doors, you must pray to confess your sins, failures, and wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Confess that for a long time you have not lived Christ, you have not lived to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Make a thorough confession to receive the infilling of the Holy Spirit Acts 13:52 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then exercise your faith to believe that the ascended Christ is with you as the One who has been given all authority in heaven and on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You will be able to tell the whole universe, I am going out, not by myself, but with Him who is sovereign over the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Formerly, when I went without Him, my arms and legs were shaking with fear.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now I am different.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am coming to knock on this door with Christ, the Lord of lords.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have the boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the occupant opens the door, you may say, I have a grace to pass on to you!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I assure you that you will be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Formerly you might have knocked on two hundred doors without finding one son of peace Luke 10:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if you go out in this way, you will find many sons of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To go out in this way makes a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, you must be prepared to sacrifice yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Forget about your face.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some may scold you and slam the door on you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You must be prepared to joyfully receive all manner of persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not criticize those who go out to knock on doors in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are sacrificing much.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They have paid a high price.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you do not go out to visit people by knocking on their doors, it may be that you are not so willing to sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thank the Lord that some are willing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Stay at home to pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Support them with your prayer and even with material things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I love these young saints who have paid such a price.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have watched them and have seen their sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some young sisters have knocked on the door of university professors.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On first meeting these sisters and the brothers who accompanied them, the professors somewhat despised them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But when the sisters opened their mouths, the professors were subdued and became as little lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the sisters told them to change their clothes to be baptized, they did it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the sisters told the professors wives to prepare the water for baptism, they did it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Within only fifteen minutes, the whole family was subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Could you do this?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is conditional.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Without such a dealing before the Lord, with the Lord, and in the Lord, we could never go out in such a strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some in one denomination knocked on sixteen hundred doors but did not baptize one person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How we go out makes a big difference.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we pay the price and sacrifice much, we will surely go out with Christ, with the Triune God, and full of power, authority, and boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We will be afraid of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This kind of boldness in a young sister will subdue everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This way of knocking on doors will not be in the common way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Rather, we will be desperate to knock on doors and tell people that we have a heavenly commission to pass on to them the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This way of presentation will shock people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They will surely invite us in and receive our word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The way in which we go out makes a great difference.</S>
