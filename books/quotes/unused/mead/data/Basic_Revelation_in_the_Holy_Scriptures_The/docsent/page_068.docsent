   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION 3 Scripture Reading: Rev 21:2-3, 10-23; 22:1-2a, 14, 17, 19 TWO MAIN SCHOOLS OF INTERPRETATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The New Jerusalem has been a puzzle to Bible readers and teachers throughout the twenty centuries of the Christian era.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There have been two main schools of interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One school says that the New Jerusalem is a physical city.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It will be part of the new heaven and new earth and will be on the earth as a literal city.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The second school, which is very shallow, says the New Jerusalem is the heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, we should not think of this city as being merely physical, nor as a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let us put aside these different schools, which come from human understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is very significant that the New Jerusalem stands at the end of God's entire revelation and occupies the final two chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need the whole Bible to understand, interpret, and designate what its meaning is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The conclusion of a book must be the final word concerning its contents.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Any book which is meaningful surely has some proper, definite contents and also a proper, definite conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let us come to the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must consider its contents and then look at its conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>OF GOD'S DWELLING PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible is a complete revelation of God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This dwelling place is for Him to rest, to be satisfied, and to be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Genesis 1:1 says that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then, after all the things in the universe were created, God made Adam on the sixth day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God wanted to have man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He prepared the heavens, the earth, and everything else for this man whom He made in His own image and after His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a strong indication that God wanted an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He wanted something living and organic to bear His image and to have His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Image refers to something inward, while likeness refers to something outward.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Inwardly we all have the intellect, the will, and the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Outwardly we have the likeness, the body form.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Genesis 1 we are told that God created the animals after their kind and the plants after their kind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The horse, for example, is after the horse kind, while the peach tree and the apple tree are each after their kind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Kind means a family, a biological genus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man, however, was not made after man's kind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man was made after God's kind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We men are of God's kind.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are one family with God because we bear His image and have His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even though man at this time didn't have God's life or His nature, he did have His image and likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that God wanted an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Genesis 1:26-27 shows that man was not just a single person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 27 says, "God created man in his own image...; male and female created he them."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This indicates that the man here is something corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>J. N. Darby says man in Genesis 1:27 means mankind, man as a race.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In God's creation He did something according to His plan to have an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Mankind was to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the beginning of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then the Bible goes on to talk about eight great men: Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Including Adam, these are the eight giants in the first book of the Bible.</S>
