   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>TWO TYPES OF PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are mainly two types of prayer prayer to have fellowship with God and prayer for God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Prayer to have fellowship with God is for us to contact God and to be filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this type of prayer we confess and repent of the things He enlightens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Prayer for God's work is to pray according to His heart's desire so that He may accomplish His work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A. Prayer to have Fellowship with God</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The significance of the first aspect of prayer is that we use our spirit to contact God, and to absorb God, and to have our entire being brought back to our spirit to have fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we contact God, absorb God, and have fellowship with God in this way, God has the opportunity to reveal Himself in us and to infuse Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As God flows Himself into us in this way, our mind, emotion, and will are gradually mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a result, God can open His heart's desire to us, causing us to apprehend His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the same time, as He is operating and moving within us, He will oftentimes point out our weaknesses, our mistakes, our hindrances, and our difficulties, and then remove them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, the significance of the first aspect of prayer is to contact God, to touch God, and to let God have the opportunity to mingle with us and to eliminate all our difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, whenever we come before God to pray, we must look upon this as the first priority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That is to say, whenever we come before the Lord to pray, we should not first petition Him for any other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should rather first turn our entire being back to our spirit and lay our whole being in the light of the Lord's face, waiting for His operating and moving, enlightening, revealing, anointing, infusing, mingling, filling, and saturating.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should also let Him expose our weaknesses, mistakes, hindrances, and difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are willing to confess thoroughly and to allow the Lord to remove all these difficulties, our conscience will be at peace, without any accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our spirit would thus be full of the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At this point, we can then mention to the Lord the things we want to pray for.</S>
