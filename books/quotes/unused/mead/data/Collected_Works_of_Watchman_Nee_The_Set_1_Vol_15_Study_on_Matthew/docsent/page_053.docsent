   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Matthew 1 13:51 constitutes the first major section, and 13:52 through chapter fourteen constitute the second major section.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord asked this question because in speaking the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, He specifically desired that the disciples understand and that the blasphemers not understand at all see Matt 13:11-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the question asked here is a conclusion of verses 11-16.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 52:The "scribe" refers to those who are familiar with the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From this we know that the kingdom of the heavens is surely not the kingdom of the Messiah; otherwise, the scribes would have participated in it.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Within the second major section, we can further divide it into four smaller sections.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first subsection of the second major section focuses on the rejection of the Lord by two kinds of people the common people the men of Nazareth and the rulers Herod .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verses 53-54:The people of Nazareth acknowledged that the Lord's speaking was with wisdom and was accompanied by works of power, and they greatly admired Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, they were wrong when they asked, "Where did this man get ...?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If they acknowledged that the Lord had wisdom and did works of power, then they should have known that He came from God and should not have asked "Where did this man get...?"</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Is not His mother called Mary, and His brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because of their doubting in the preceding verse, they were led by the evil one into more erroneous thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because of the turn in this verse, such people became hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 56:"And His sisters, are they not all with us?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Where then did this man get all these things?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The names of the sisters are not revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some confess the Lord in the flesh; they know the Lord's parents, brothers, and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, they reject Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Human beings like people or things that are mysterious; they think that someone who is powerful must also be mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If someone is known by everyone, then he becomes common, having nothing extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This was the situation with the people of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They thought that Christ must be mysterious and different from them.</S>

   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verse 57:"And they were stumbled because of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord was rejected by the Jews not only because He was too familiar to them, but also because He was not in a territory where prophets would be honored.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Verse 58:"And He did not do many works of power there because of their unbelief."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is an unfortunate word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many people hindered the power of God because of their unbelief.</S>

   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God delights to perform works of power in us; unfortunately, our faith is insufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our faith is like a water bucket, whereas God's power is like water in the well.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Without the bucket, we can have no water.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Today our faith is like a wicker basket that leaks out the power of God.</S>
