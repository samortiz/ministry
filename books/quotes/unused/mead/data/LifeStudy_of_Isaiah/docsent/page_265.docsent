   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and Led to the Slaughter like a Lamb</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and Sheared before the Shearers</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>like a Sheep, with No Reaction</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In His vicarious death for sinners, Christ was oppressed, afflicted, and led to the slaughter like a lamb and sheared before the shearers like a sheep, with no reaction Isa 53:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, Christ was oppressed; then He was afflicted.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Affliction is more serious than oppression.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then, third, He was led to the slaughter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the night in which He was betrayed, He was praying in Gethsemane.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then the soldiers came and arrested Him and bound Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That was an oppression.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a man, Christ was entitled to certain human rights.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He had done nothing wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, for people to come and arrest Him was an oppression.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After being arrested, He was judged, first by the Jewish leaders according to their religious law, and, second, by the Roman officials according to Roman law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>While they were judging Him, people spat on Him and mocked Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These were afflictions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After all this, they made the decision to crucify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then they led Him like a lamb to the slaughter and like a sheep to be sheared before the shearers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ was not only led to the slaughter; He was even sheared like a sheep by the shearers, the Jewish people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet, He did not react against any of this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He did not argue, vindicate Himself, or justify Himself; instead, He was silent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This surprised Pilate Matt 27:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Taken Away by Oppression and by Judgment</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Isaiah 53:8 says that Christ was taken away by oppression of the hypocritical Jewish leaders Matt 26:57, 59, 65-68 and by judgment of the unjust Roman officials Luke 23:1-12; John 18:33-38; 19:1-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, Christ was oppressed; then He was judged.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By these two things He was taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All these things are included in and issued in His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Numbered with the Transgressors</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>and Interceding for the Transgressors</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to Isaiah 53:12c, when Christ was crucified on the cross, He was numbered with the transgressors Luke 23:32-33 and He interceded for the transgressors v. 34a . Christ was crucified between two criminals, one on His left and one on His right.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, He was numbered with the transgressors.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In speaking of Christ's crucifixion, Isaiah's sequence proceeds from Christ's being oppressed to His being numbered with the transgressors.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>While on the cross, Christ interceded not only for His companions, the transgressors, who were beside Him, but also for those who were killing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He prayed for the transgressors.</S>
