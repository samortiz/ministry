   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. The Spirit Being Fine</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why do we treasure a portion of the Scriptures so much, yet another brother sees nothing precious about it?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is because we capture the spirit of that portion of the Scripture, while the other brother does not.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am not saying that the other brother does not have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I am saying that his spirit is not in step with the spirit of this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes, he may treasure another portion of the Word, yet we have no feeling about it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are as closed to that portion as he is to our portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our spirit must be fine, and we must be sensitive to many things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once our spirit is fine, we will be sensitive to our many different circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The finer our spirit is, the wider the scope of our knowledge of the Word will be.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The scope of our knowledge of the Bible depends on the amount of discipline we have received from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our feelings can only become rich and fine after passing through much discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the discipline increases, the feelings increase.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A man understands a certain portion of the Word only after he has passed through a certain kind of discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, it is important that we gain rich experience by going through dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are not rich in such experiences, our feelings will not be rich, and if our spiritual feelings are not rich, our knowledge of the Bible will not be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>E. Two Examples</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us consider two examples in the Bible and from them find the meaning of entering into the spirit of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Story of Jacob</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Jacob was a clever, cunning, and selfish man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In everything he considered himself first, never others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was very conniving, and he resorted to all kinds of schemes to achieve his goal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was the reason God had to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When he was born he held to his brother's ankle and fought with him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But Esau became his father's love, while he was set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jacob tried everything he could to usurp his brother's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But in the end what he got was not blessing but wanderings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He served Laban, who changed his wages ten times.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He wanted to marry Rachel but had to take Leah first.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On his way back to his father's land, Rachel died, while Leah survived.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His heart was with a few of his sons, being particularly fond of Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet Joseph was sold by his brothers, who dipped his garment in blood and deceived Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He thought that Joseph was devoured by the beasts, and said, "I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning" Gen 37:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then he shifted all of his hopes to his youngest son, Benjamin; yet Benjamin was taken into Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Day by day Jacob suffered God's dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His days were hard.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Proverbs 13:15 says, "The way of the treacherous is hard."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Jacob's days were full of sufferings as a result of his stubbornness and craftiness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not think that Jacob's experience at Peniel was a cheap one Gen 32:22-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He insisted that God bless him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It seems as if he was saying, "My father had to bless me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Everyone had to bless me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God must also bless me!"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was a cunning man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In everything he wanted to gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He wanted God's blessing, and God promised that he would be called Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet his blessing did not come immediately; it came decades later.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At Peniel God touched the hollow of his thigh, and he was crippled.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From that day forward God's work took a turn in him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yet the next day we see the same old Jacob on his way to meet his brother Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He split up his children into groups, thinking that he would preserve the second if the first suffered calamities.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He put his beloved Joseph and Rachel in the last group.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was still exercising his own wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He was still scheming.</S>
