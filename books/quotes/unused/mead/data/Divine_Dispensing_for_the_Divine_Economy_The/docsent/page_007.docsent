   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE APOSTLE'S STEWARDSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>DISPENSING THE RICHES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN THE HEARTS OF THE SAINTS Scripture Reading: Eph 3:2-5, 7-11, 14-19 THE FATHER'S CHOOSING, THE SON'S REDEEMING,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>AND THE SPIRIT'S SEALING ISSUING IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to chapter one of Ephesians, the church has been constituted for its existence through the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The dispensing of the Divine Trinity is of the Father as the source vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>3-6 , of the Son as the course vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>7-12 , and of the Spirit as the flow vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The dispensing of the Father as the source includes the Father's choosing v. 4 and predestination v. 5 . The Father's intention in choosing us is to dispense His holy nature into us so that we may be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Father's predestination is so that we will receive the Father's divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Upon receiving the Father's divine life, we are born of God to be His sons in order to enjoy the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church is also constituted through the Son's redeeming.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Father chose and predestinated us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then the Son came in to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Son's redeeming brought us into a condition in which we could become the Father's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God the Father inherits only that which has the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His inheritance must come up to the standard of His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason, the redemption of Christ must bring us into God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His redemption is not just a matter of redeeming us from sin; it is even more a matter of redeeming us into God Himself, into His very divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This divine element constitutes us into a precious treasure for God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity according to Ephesians 1 consummates in the Spirit's sealing vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The entire being of the complete God reaches our being through the sealing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The sealing of the Spirit saturates the sealed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Spirit as the living seal is also the sealing ink applied to our inward being in the image of the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The ink stamped onto a piece of paper will eventually become dry, but the Spirit as the sealing ink remains "wet" all the time unto eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because the Spirit as the sealing ink remains "wet," the Spirit continually saturates and permeates us until our entire being spirit, soul, and body is sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, through the divine sealing, we human beings become the expression not only of the God who creates, but also of the regenerating, sanctifying, transforming, and glorifying God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We become His expression, His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the aim and goal of the divine economy, God's eternal arrangement as His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God desires to make His chosen ones His expression, His fullness, in a corporate way.</S>
