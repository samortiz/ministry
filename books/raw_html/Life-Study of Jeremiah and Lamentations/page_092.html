<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Jehovah Intending<br>to Visit upon the Kings of Judah<br>the Evil of Their Deeds</H2><P>Jehovah pronounced woe to the kings of Judah as shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of Jehovah's pasture. He intended to visit upon them the evil of their deeds (23:1-2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Jehovah's Promise of Restoration to Israel</H2><P>In the midst of His word of condemnation and punishment, Jehovah gave a promise of restoration to Israel (23:3-8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Jehovah Gathering the Remnant of His Flock<br>out of the Lands Where He Has Driven Them</H2><P>Jehovah said that He would gather the remnant of His flock out of all the lands where He has driven them and that He will bring them back to their pasture. Also, He said that they would be fruitful and would multiply (v. 3). Concerning this promise of restoration, verses 7 and 8 go on to say, "Therefore behold, days are coming, declares Jehovah, when they will no longer say, As Jehovah lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; but, As Jehovah lives, who brought up and led back the seed of the house of Israel out of the land of the north and out of all the lands where I had driven them, that they might dwell in their own land."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Jehovah Raising Up Shepherds<br>over Them Who Will Feed Them</H2><P>In verse 4 Jehovah said that He would raise up shepherds over them who will feed them, and they will no longer fear or be dismayed, nor will any be missing.</P>
