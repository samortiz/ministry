   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God purposely and sovereignly put Moses aside for forty years Exo 2:14-15; Acts 7:27-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>D. Learning to Serve God according to</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His Leading and to Trust in Him</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In those forty years Moses learned to serve God according to His leading and to trust in Him Acts 7:34-36; Heb 11:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moses eventually became a person who did nothing according to his will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He always acted according to the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord led him, and he followed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He had no faith in his ability.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although he was very capable, he did not use his natural ability.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His natural ability was dealt with, so it became an ability in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The ability in resurrection corresponds with God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If our ability is not dealt with, it is separate from God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But after being dealt with by the cross, our ability becomes one with God's move.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His ability eventually was full of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Exodus 2 shows us a natural Moses, a Moses with his natural strength and ability.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That was purely, solely, wholly, and absolutely Moses without God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then after chapter three we can see another kind of Moses, a Moses that was fully dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After chapter three, God was in Moses and whatever Moses did in his acts and move was full of God, having the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE CASE OF PETER A. Being Self-confident</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>in His Natural Strength and Ability</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Peter was self-confident in his natural strength and ability even to the point of thinking that he would follow the Lord both to prison and to death Luke 22:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>B. Being Put into a Test</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Peter was tested and he denied the Lord three times, even before a little maid John 18:15-18, 25-27 .</S>
