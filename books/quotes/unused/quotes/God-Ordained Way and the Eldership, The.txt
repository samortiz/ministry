A number of the working saints among us could not afford a house in a big city, so they moved to suburbs and small towns
The raising up of these new churches is evidence of the profit of gaining people for the Lord by our personal contact
New ones were brought in not by preaching meetings but by each saint's personal preaching and personal contact with others
During the past seventy years of our history, from 1920 to the present time, that way never brought us an increase of over twenty percent
Of course, according to history, there has not been a church in Christianity which has continuously had an increase of thirty percent
We have to admit that the old way of having preaching meetings with a gifted preacher is not the spiritual way
If you would receive mercy from the Lord to live Him, to live for Him, and to preach Him to gain sinners for Him, just do it yourself
To be cut off is not to suffer eternal perdition but to lose the enjoyment of Christ in the organic union with Him
They love the church, they are for the church, and they support the church financially, but they are not bearing fruit
The Lord wants us to have a spiritual life in the church, to go to the meetings, to worship Him, and to live Him
If all the saints in the church were like this, yet no one bore any fruit, the church would eventually die out
These twenty-five minutes should be reckoned as part of your two to three hours of labor in the gospel every week
Our publication called The Holy Word for Morning Revival has been a help to the saints to be revived by the Lord every morning
The most effective way to live the Christian life is by having a vital, living, active morning watch with the Lord
We should get two verses from the Scripture to live on every day and then contact people for the Lord in a definite way
The reason why we do not bear fruit is because we do not practice contacting people directly, personally, and faithfully
We need to redeem our time by praying for our acquaintances and relatives, writing them letters, and sending them booklets
Among the saints, you have to be the examples, the living ones who get three to five people saved every six months
It is not pleasant to see our co-workers serving the Lord full-time and yet not bringing anyone to the Lord within a year
You should find out who is available for you to contact and then contact them directly and continually over a long period of time
To get someone saved and established takes about six months, and to bring them into the church will take another six months
If twenty are meeting together in a locality, and five of them bring two people into the church life, that is a fifty percent increase
The elders need to work two to three hours in the gospel every week to bring one or two remaining fruit into the church within a year
They study the situation of their land, their crops, and the weather, and they labor accordingly so that they can reap a proper harvest
If the parents have five children, and none of them has any children, the parents will be bothered and disappointed
The rock upon which the church is built is surely Christ Himself but we need to consider the context of Matthew 1618 to see something deeper
The Lord was asking the disciples who He was, but eventually what came out was a revelation concerning Christ being the rock
The rock in Matthew 16, strictly speaking, does not refer to Christ directly but to the divine revelation concerning Christ
John 3 shows us that Christ is the Bridegroom and the church is the bride as the enlargement and increase of the Groom
Of course, the Epistles show that the bride, the increase of Christ as the Groom, is the Body of Christ, the enlargement of Christ
Even though the bride is mentioned in John 3, we could not thoroughly understand who the bride is without the Epistles
The revelation the apostles and prophets received concerning Christ is considered the foundation upon which the church is built
The building of the church upon Christ as her foundation is according to the apostles' and prophets' revelation
When Brother Nee brought the recovery to us according to the revelation he had received at his time, he actually brought in the teaching
Christians have argued, for example, over the way to baptize people, and they have been divided because of this
The apostles' teaching in the New Testament shows us that Christ builds up His Body through all of His members
We have to admit that over a period of time, we gradually drifted back to the practice of deformed Christianity
The elders should realize that the way that our Head, Christ, takes to build up His Body is to use all of His members
By trusting too much in these two categories of people, we spontaneously and unconsciously annul the one-talented ones
If such a situation is to be resurrected, the so-called clergy must be buried, and all the saints must be resurrected
Today people need to learn to use the computer because this is the computer age; otherwise, they will not be able to work effectively
The eldership in its shepherding is for the purpose of raising up all the saints, all the members, to function
We may have the label of practicing 1 Corinthians 14, but in actuality we do not have the practice of 1 Corinthians 14
If the elders want their church to be living, fresh, and even refreshing, they must know how to preach the gospel and prophesy
There are a number of saints who will not be able to take this way, but they will still appreciate your taking of the new way
You have to release everything concerning the church out of your hand, and let the saints share in these things
If you tutor the saints one by one, you will gradually gain a good number of saints to function in the meetings
You will be in fellowship with the church to whom you gave the gift, and they will be brought into fellowship with you
The circulation of the spiritual blood will become a strong factor in the Body to neutralize all the differences and take away any troubles
On the one hand, in the eyes of the Lord, all the churches are distinct, but on the other hand, they are all the same
The Lord's way is not to federate the churches, nor is it that the churches should be independent and separate from one another
Some of the co-workers may want to keep their locality or area of the country independent and, to some extent, isolated
If you have been working in one place for years, it might be good for you to take the initiative to go to another place
If you keep yourself isolated in your environment and situation, that will be a loss to you and to the Lord's interest
