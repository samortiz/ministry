This is especially true in their coordination with the brothers and sisters. You have to function like a machine. You cannot work according to your own emotions, preference, or temperament. As a responsible one in a district, you cannot work according to your own likes, preferences, or disposition. You have to be like a machine, running or stopping according to the on-off switch, not according to your own likes and dislikes. As soon as the switch turns on, you operate mechanically.</p><p>In the church we do not want anyone to do anything out of a good heart or out of his own zeal. When a person acts according to his emotion, he is like a thermometer that has no calibration at all. Parents cannot stop feeding and clothing their children just because they misbehave. If you deal with your children according to just your emotion, you are not qualified to be a parent. Some people scorch others when they are zealous but put others into the freezer when they are cold. Suppose Brother Nee has a cook who acts according to his own preference. When our brother wants noodles, the cook serves porridge. What can he do to such a cook except discharge him? Such a cook can only be a master; he can never be a servant. If a man acts according to his emotion, he will damage others when he is emotionally high, and he will damage others when he is emotionally low.</p><p>You have to go to the Lord all the time to find out how much you love Him. You have to say to Him, "Lord, I am willing to put my temperament, preference, and emotions on the altar." When children provoke their parents to anger, the parents often consider giving up on their children. But they are compelled to go on because they love their children. We have to be brought to the point where we work all the time, whether or not we like it. We do it because the Lord loves us and because we love Him. If we work only when we feel like working, we are like an unreliable thermometer. Others will not know what clothes to wear when they read us.</p><p>One passage in the Old Testament touches me very much. When Aaron's two sons died before the Lord because they offered strange fire, Moses ordered Aaron not to mourn (Lev. 10:1-7). Moses was a faithful servant of God. Aaron also knew God very well. Their work was to serve God in His presence. God required that they not mix their own personal affections with His work. When God says that no one should mourn, no one can mourn. Even if a person wants to cry, he can only swallow his tears. Whatever you have to do, you should do it. You cannot overstretch your hands when you feel like it or stop working when you do not feel like it. Your likes and dislikes should not affect the way you work. Let emotions rise and fall. With the Lord's grace in us, we can continue with our work all the time.</p><h2 class="head2">Rejecting Natural Affections</h2><p>The responsible ones in a district should also be on the alert against the encroachment of natural affections; they should guard against acting by their own emotions. Among the brothers and sisters, they should only exercise a love that is in Christ. They should not develop any natural affection through their service. The more divine love there is, the better it is. Natural affection must be denied. Two people become friends through working together and developing an affinity for each other. In the church we should condemn natural affection; it is something loathsome. Some good brothers and sisters have fallen by the wayside just because they were not careful in this matter. Natural affection can kill the church life. In the Old Testament God ordained that the meal offering must be free from honey (Lev. 2:11). Both leaven and honey kill the church life.</p><p>Brother Chao Ching-hwai and I have been coordinating with each other for over twenty years. During those years, except for the purpose of discussing spiritual work and meeting various needs related to our service, I never visited his home. I was afraid that human love would be mixed in with our love in the Lord. In order to maintain the boundary that the Lord has laid down, I even went out of my way to guard against visiting his home. I can testify that we only maintain a divine love in the Lord; we have not developed a natural affection outside the Lord. Today many brothers and sisters get into trouble when they develop some affections through living together or coordinating together. We must have much spiritual fellowship, but we should guard against pitfalls.</p><p>Watchman Nee: Christians have no friendships; they only have brothers. Their relationships with each other are brotherly relationships. Whenever we fall from a brotherly relationship to friends, our Christian life is finished. The New Testament contains all kinds of teachings. It speaks of relationships between masters and slaves, parents and children, and husbands and wives. But it does not say anything about friendships. This is the most peculiar thing about Christianity. You can have only worldly friends, not spiritual friends. We should replace our friends in the world with brothers and sisters in the Lord. Our contact with each other should only be in the form of coordination, service, and fellowship. We should not have any other kind of unnecessary contact. The Lord charges us to love one another as He loves us. We should lay down our lives for our brothers (cf. John 15:13). This love transcends any kind of friendship. The love we experience in our coordination is beyond any kind of human love.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
