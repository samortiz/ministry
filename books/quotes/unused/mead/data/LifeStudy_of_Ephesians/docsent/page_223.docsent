   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SEVENTY-SEVEN CHRIST IN GOD S ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Eph 1:20-23; 3:8, 16-19; 4:8-10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s economy is Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>May the Lord grant us a clear sky so that we may see the vision of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although Ephesians is a short book, no other book in the Bible reveals Christ in His all-inclusiveness, both vertically and horizontally, as the book of Ephesians does.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>FAR ABOVE ALL AND FILLING ALL</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many students of the Word realize that Colossians reveals Christ as the Head and Ephesians reveals the church as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, not even the book of Colossians reveals Christ in such a vertical and horizontal way as He is revealed in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ephesians 1:21 says that Christ is far above all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such a word cannot be found in Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Colossians says that Christ must have the preeminence, the first place, in all things, but it does not say that Christ is far above all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some may regard the third heaven as the highest point in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But in 4:10 Paul says that Christ has ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ephesians 1:23 says that Christ fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Colossians 3:11 says that Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, Christ s filling all in all in Ephesians 1:23 surpasses His being all and in all in Colossians 3:11.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Colossians 3:11 refers to the sphere of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, in the new man Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But Ephesians 1:23 refers to the universe, which includes time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is not only all and in all with respect to the new man, but He fills all in all with respect to the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Universally, Christ is above all and fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 3:8 Paul refers to the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This term is not found in Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The riches of Christ are what Christ is to us, such as light, life, righteousness, and holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These riches are unsearchable and past our tracing out.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 3:18 Paul speaks of the breadth and length and height and depth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The breadth, length, height, and depth are the dimensions of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is not only higher than all things He is the height.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is not only deeper and broader and longer than all things He is the breadth, the length, and the depth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This very Christ who is all-inclusive both vertically and horizontally is making His home in our hearts in a very intimate way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Oh, may we see that the all-inclusive Christ is now making His home in our hearts!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>RAISED FROM AMONG THE DEAD</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ is far above all because He has been raised from among the dead 1:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Apart from Christ, no one has been able to overcome death and come out from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For Christ to be raised up out of death indicates that nothing can hold Him down.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When death comes to visit us, we cannot refuse it, for death has the power to hold us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But it did not have the power to hold Christ Acts 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After visiting the realm of the dead for three days, Christ came forth in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although death did everything possible to hold Him, Christ could have said, Death, is this all you can do to Me?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If this is all, then it is time for Me to walk away from you in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Just as nothing can hold Christ down, so nothing negative can hold us down, because we have Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We who believe in Christ must be the raised-up ones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ has been raised from the dead, and nothing can hold Him down.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the reason that He is now far above all.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He has been resurrected to be far above all.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is our Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All Christians know that Christ is the Redeemer and the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some realize that Christ is the Giver of all gifts and that He Himself is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But Christ is even more than this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Ephesians, a book concerned with God s economy, we see that Christ is far above all.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I can testify that the Christ I enjoy is the One who is far above all.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A DIFFERENT CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In a number of respects the Christ we enjoy in the Lord s recovery is different from the Christ in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When some hear this, they may accuse us of heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But consider the typology in the book of Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this book five main offerings are described: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These offerings typify Christ in various aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even with one kind of offering, such as the burnt offering, there are different types of sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One could offer as a burnt offering a bullock, a lamb, or a bird.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All these are types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This gives us the ground to say that in our experience the Christ we enjoy may be different from the Christ enjoyed by others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Christ I experience may be different from the Christ you experience, and the Christ you enjoy may differ from the Christ enjoyed by others.</S>
