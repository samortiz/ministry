<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You for this precious hour, that You have gathered many of us from many countries. Lord, we believe there is a will in You for this gathering. Carry out this will among us. Speak something to us that will impress us for eternity. Lord, give us the understanding, give us the revelation, and give us the speaking. Lord, speak with us. We believe that You are one spirit with us in this meeting. Anoint all the brothers from all the countries. Lord, it is a lovely time that we can come together to have such a fellowship. Lord, help me in the speaking. You know that I am fearful and trembling before You that I may delay You. Lord, save me from this. Whatever You want to speak to us, speak it. Speak it freely. Glory be to You, shame to Your enemy, and blessing to all Your Body. Amen.<p>I have been considering very much what the Lord would speak to us for this time. I do not want to speak anything that is not from Him. Eventually, the Lord reminded me of ten great, critical points in His revelation concerning our belief in Him for His recovery. I call them the ten “ones.” Each critical point is a “one.” These first five “ones” are the one Bible, one God, one Christ, one Spirit, and one life. These five big “ones” are the factors. Then there are another five “ones”: the one salvation, one living, one testimony, one Body, and one city, which is the one consummation. These five are the issues which are produced from the preceding five factors. Each great “one” actually needs two conferences so that it can be covered adequately.<p>This is a golden opportunity for me to present to you these ten great “ones.” All of you are either co-workers or elders in the Lord’s recovery. In this sense, you are important persons. What the Lord’s recovery will be depends upon you co-workers and elders. Thus, I consider what I am releasing here to be very critical. I want to give you the proper knowledge of the ten great “ones” at this juncture. Then you will know who we are, where we are, and where we should go. “We” means the recovery. Although we need twenty conferences to speak all these points covered by these six messages, I am taking the opportunity to present an abstract of these points. We have to take these ten great “ones” back to our places to have conference after conference. First, we must get ourselves into them and then help all the saints realize what the Lord’s recovery really is.<h2 class=head1>I. ONE BIBLE—ONE REVELATION</h2><p>Upon this earth, everyone knows there is one Bible, but this one Bible is in the hands of different people. What kind of Bible people have depends upon what kind of people they are. The Jews have their Bible. Their Bible is just the first part of the whole Bible, so they have a Bible which is incomplete. The orthodox Jews do not believe in the New Testament. They believe that their Bible, the Old Testament, is the pure, holy Word of God and that nothing should be added to it. Of course, they are mistaken in what they believe.<p>Then the Christians have their Bible, the entire Bible, but there are many divisions today among the Christians. The Brethren were raised up in the middle part of the last century and they were one, but today there are over one thousand divisions among them. Nearly every division of the Brethren has “their own Bible.” This means that they have the same Bible with different interpretations, which have divided them. Furthermore, the closed Brethren use the New Translation by John Nelson Darby. The open Brethren use the Newberry Bible with its marginal notes. The Catholics also have their Bible, which has more than sixty-six books because they have added something.<p>Today I would ask, “What kind of Bible do we have?” The Bible we have determines what kind of persons we are. All the divisions among the Christians came out of different interpretations of the Bible. We should not have more than one Bible in the recovery. To have a proper Bible, which is really according to God’s revelation, depends upon the way we understand it. If we understand the Bible properly, we will have a proper Bible. The Bible itself is never wrong, but with us it can be wrong.<p>In 2 Timothy 2:15 Paul said, “Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth.” We have to cut the word straightly as in carpentry. We have to interpret the written Word of God as a carpenter cutting wood. This means to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion. Second Timothy 2:15 is very meaningful and should control us to the uttermost. There are different ways of understanding the same Bible. When the apostle Paul was on earth, he was contending with the unbelieving Jews and correcting them by cutting the word rightly, straightly. Now we need to see how to cut the word in a straight way.
