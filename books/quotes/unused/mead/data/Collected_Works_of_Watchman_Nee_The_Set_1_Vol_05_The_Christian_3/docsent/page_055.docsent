   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VERSE THIRTEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 13:"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because this teaching is so crucial and solemn, all those who have ears should hear what Christ says in this and what the Holy Spirit says through this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should never despise this word, for it is not the word of man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since there is such a solemn teaching set before us, we should ask God to circumcise our ears so that we may hear.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should also have a circumcised heart to keep this word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The future rapture and glorification all depend on our present conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Oh, what a responsibility this is!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>APPENDIX</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>FULFILLMENT IN HISTORY</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of course I cannot surmise what the fulfillment of this church will be.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the present age of church degradation, it is an unhealthy act to assume oneself to be a Philadelphian.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is better to commit this into the hand of the One who knows our works.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as we know that in church history there is such a time of Philadelphia after Sardis, we should pursue to have such a condition for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The most important thing for the saints to do is not to remain in Sardis if the Lord so leads them to go on to Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If they do not go on, they will enter the stage of Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, we can say a few words here.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the beginning of the nineteenth century, about a hundred years ago, God began a work in England.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Gradually, this work spread to the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It led believers to leave everything man-made and to cleave to the Lord's word and exalt the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The truth concerning the glorious coming of the Lord Jesus was recovered through them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This could have been the fulfillment of Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At present, it pleases the Lord to open the eyes of some in China.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We do not know what will happen in the future, but we know that it is indispensable to follow the Lord faithfully.</S>
