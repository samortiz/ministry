<P>In John 17:6, the Lord Jesus said to the Father, "I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world. They were Yours, and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word." All the saved Christians are given and awarded by God to the Lord Jesus. Verse 9 says, "I ask concerning them; I do not ask concerning the world." The Lord Jesus did not pray for the world, but "concerning those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours." Hence, we Christians are the gifts given by God to the Lord Jesus. Verse 12 says, "When I was with them, I kept them in Your name, which You have given to Me, and I guarded them; and not one of them perished, except the son of perdition." In the Lord's prayer, He said that He kept every one of those whom God had given Him. There was only one son of perdition. He was Judas. Judas never believed; from the beginning he was the son of the enemy and was never saved. The Lord Jesus said that except for Judas, not one of the ones God had given Him perished.</P><P>My friends, you have to know that God has already given you to the Lord Jesus; He has already given you away. This is like a girl being given in marriage. When we were saved, God had given us to the Lord Jesus already. Therefore, all those whom God has given to the Lord Jesus, who have believed in the Lord Jesus, will be kept by the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus said, "I kept them in Your name, which You have given to Me." How could a Christian lose his salvation again? After God has given you to the Lord Jesus, how could you vanish away? The Bible says that not one of those whom God has given to the Lord Jesus would perish.</P><P>God has given so many of us to the Lord Jesus. Think about it: After God has given all of us to the Lord Jesus, could we perish again after three or five years, simply because we are not good? You should listen to what the Lord Jesus said in 6:37: "All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out." Why did you believe in the Lord Jesus? Why did you come to Him? You came to the Lord Jesus and received Him because God gave you to the Lord Jesus. "All that the Father gives Me will come to Me." In other words, all those who come to the Lord are given to Him by the Father. The only reason that you come to the Lord Jesus, that you receive Him as Lord, that you trust in His redemptive work and in His resurrection as your proof of justification, is that God has given you to the Lord Jesus. In heaven God gave you to the Lord Jesus, and on earth you believed in Him and came to Him. God gave you over so that you would come to the Lord Jesus. What does it say after this? "Him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out." There is no way for us to lose our salvation because God has already given us to the Lord Jesus.</P><P>This is not all. There is another portion in the Bible, John 10:29, which says, "My Father, who has given them to Me." Who are the sheep of the Lord Jesus? We are the sheep. In the Gospel of John, we are shown numerous times that we are the gift given to the Lord Jesus by God. God cannot give us away as a token favor that has no substance to it, and the Lord Jesus cannot simply throw us away after He has received us. Do not think that our salvation is a small thing. Since we are not saved by doing this or that, neither can we be unsaved by doing this or that.</P>
