Praying Without Ceasing by Calling</H2><P>[In 1 Thessalonians 5:17 Paul charges us to pray without ceasing. What does it mean to pray unceasingly? Although we may eat several meals a day and although we may drink many times during the day, no one can eat and drink without ceasing. But we certainly breathe unceasingly. Paul's command to pray without ceasing implies that unceasing prayer is like breathing. But how can our prayer become our spiritual breathing? How can we turn prayer into breathing? The way to do this is to call on the name of the Lord. We need to call on the Lord Jesus continually. This is the way to breathe, to pray without ceasing. Because we are not accustomed to this, we need to practice calling on the Lord's name all the time. To live is to breathe. Spiritually speaking, to breathe is to call on the Lord's name and to pray. By calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, we breathe the Spirit.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Pray-reading the Word</H2><P>As we have seen in Lesson Twelve, the Spirit is embodied in the Word. In order to experience the supply of the Spirit in the Word we must exercise our spirit. Pray-reading is one of the best ways to exercise our spirit.</P><P>[Let us use Psalm 133 to show the difference between analyzing the Bible and enjoying the nourishment contained in it by pray-reading. In their time of personal devotions, some Christians may read Psalm 133. As they read, they may begin to analyze and to ask about the precious ointment, the beard, the skirts, the dew, and Mount Hermon. Instead of receiving the bountiful supply, they are left with many unanswered questions. But if we pray-read Psalm 133, we shall take this portion in the way of life. As we pray-read, we may say, "Behold, amen! How good and how pleasant, amen." By taking the Word in this way, we shall apply the all-inclusive Spirit to our inner being. By pray-reading we exercise our spirit to receive spiritual nourishment from the Word. Through this nourishment we grow in life. We are nourished with the words of faith and healthy teaching. If we take even as little as ten minutes to pray-read a portion of the Word, we shall receive nourishment. Furthermore, we shall experience the various elements of Christ's riches.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT IN THE MEETINGS</H2><P>Finally, we must see that it is crucial to exercise our spirit in the church meetings. [Whenever we Christians come together in a church meeting, we need to function. We need to pray, praise, or give a word of testimony. This is to exercise our spirit and not allow it to remain dormant or in a deadened condition. But sorry to say, many saints do not preserve their spirit by exercising it in this way. Instead, they allow their spirit to remain dormant. It seems that they leave their spirit in a tomb.]</P><P>[When everyone exercises his spirit in a meeting, the Holy Spirit is free to move and flow. But this is a real battle, for Satan knows that if we all release our spirits, he will be defeated. He subtly hits the strategic point of choking the spirit of the saints. As long as he can choke our spirit, we are finished and he is successful. Therefore, we must fight the battle. We must learn to practice releasing our spirit all the time and be continually ready to pray. Whenever we come to a meeting, we must immediately exercise and release our spirit to pray.]</P><P>[All our problems are solved and all our needs are met through the exercise of our spirit. All that God is and all that He has accomplished are in the all-inclusive Spirit who has been installed in our spirit. Therefore, by turning to our spirit and by exercising our spirit, we may obtain the full supply to meet our need.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUMMARY</H2><P>We believers must know how to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord. In order to exercise our spirit we must take care of our conscience by applying the cleansing blood. The unique way to exercise our spirit is to pray. We can all pray without ceasing by calling on the name of the Lord continually. We exercise our spirit to receive spiritual nourishment from the Word by pray-reading. We must exercise our spirit in the church meetings by praying, praising, or giving a word of testimony.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS </H2><ol class="decimal"><li>How did Paul relate bodily exercise to our spirit?
