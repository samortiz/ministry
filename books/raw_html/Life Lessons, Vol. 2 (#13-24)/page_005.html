<h1 class=msg>LESSON FIFTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>MEETINGS</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h2 class=head1>IV. THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MEETINGS FOR BELIEVERS</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Bread Breaking Meeting</h2><p>1)“And on the first day of the week, when we gathered together to break bread” (Acts 20:7).<p>To break bread is to eat the Lord’s supper, remembering the Lord who died for us (1 Cor. 11:20, 23-25). This should be the first kind of regular meeting for us who have been redeemed by the Lord’s death. See the following two lessons for details.<h2 class=head2>B. Prayer Meeting</h2><p>1)“If two of you agree on earth concerning anything, whatever they may ask, it shall come to them from My Father who is in the heavens. For where two or three are gathered together…” (Matt. 18:19-20).<p>Here the Lord is speaking concerning the prayer of a meeting. This kind of prayer is more powerful than the prayer of an individual, being able to bind on earth what has been bound in heaven, and to loose on earth what has been loosed in heaven (Matt. 18:18).<p><B>2)“These all were persevering with one accord in prayer, together with the women…” (Acts 1:14).</B><p>Here again, the prayer of a meeting is mentioned. It was this prayer that brought in the blessing of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost.<p><B>3)“And when they heard this, they lifted up their voice with one accord to God and said…And as they were beseeching, the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness” (Acts 4:24-31).</B><p>It says here that in those days when the disciples were under persecution, they met together to pray with one accord. That kind of prayer caused them to be filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit and to speak the word of God with boldness.<p><B>4)“Prayer was being made fervently by the church to God concerning him” (Acts 12:5); “where [the house of Mary] a considerable number were assembled together praying” (12:12).</B><p>On the day when Peter was imprisoned, the church prayed fervently for him, and a considerable number were assembled together in a sister’s house, praying for him specifically. That prayer caused God to perform a great miracle, delivering Peter out of prison.<h2 class=head2>C. Meeting for the Exercise of Spiritual Gifts and for Mutual Building Up</h2><p>1)“Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up” (1 Cor. 14:26).<p>The meeting mentioned here is for the exercise of spiritual gifts and for mutual building up. In this kind of meeting, there is not a special person doing a specific thing, but everyone is exercising the spiritual gifts; one has a psalm, one has a teaching, one has a revelation, one does this, and another does that. Each one may participate with the goal of building up and edifying others.
