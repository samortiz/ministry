<p><strong>WEEK 10 &mdash; DAY 3</strong></p>
<h2 class="head3u">Scripture Reading</h2>
<p><strong>Phil. 1:19 For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and <em>the</em> bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2 Cor. 3:18 But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.</strong></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Spirit of Jesus</h2>
<p>In the New Testament, the life-giving Spirit is referred to as the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7). This title of the Spirit is concerning Jesus in His humanity, who passed through human living and death on the cross. It indicates that in the Spirit there is not only the divine element of God but also the human element of Jesus and the elements of His human living and suffering of death.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Spirit of Christ</h2>
<p><em>The Spirit of Christ</em> is concerning Christ in His divinity, who conquered death and became the life in resurrection with the resurrection power, indicating that in the Spirit there is the element of divinity that became the death-conquering and the life-dispensing Spirit (Rom. 8:9b).</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Spirit of Jesus Christ</h2>
<p><em>The Spirit of Jesus Christ</em> refers to the Spirit, comprising all the elements of Jesus&rsquo; humanity with His death and Christ&rsquo;s divinity with His resurrection, who becomes the bountiful supply of the unsearchable Christ for the support of His believers (Phil. 1:19b).<sup>87</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Lord Spirit</h2>
<p><em>The Lord Spirit</em> (2 Cor. 3:18) is a compound title like <em>the Father God</em> and <em>the Lord Christ.</em> This means that the Spirit is the Lord.<sup>88</sup> When we call &ldquo;O Lord,&rdquo; we get the Spirit, the Lord Spirit. This Spirit is the transforming Spirit....If a quick person called, &ldquo;O Lord Spirit&rdquo; again and again for two weeks, he would be slowed down. The Lord Spirit changes us, transforms us. He transforms us into the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ from glory to glory.<sup>89</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Spirit of Grace</h2>
<p>The Spirit of grace [Heb. 10:29] simply means that the Triune God in the Son as the Spirit becomes our enjoyment. The Spirit is the reaching of the Triune God to us. The Son could not get into us until He became the Spirit. He was among the disciples, but He needed to go through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit (John 14:16-20; 1 Cor. 15:45). Then He was able to breathe Himself as the holy breath [Spirit] into the disciples for their enjoyment (John 20:22).</p>
<p>When the Bible uses expressions such as the Spirit of grace, the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of reality, this means that the Spirit is grace, life, and reality. Therefore, when we are the partakers of the Holy Spirit [Heb. 6:4], this means that we are the partakers of the Holy Spirit as grace....It is always better to pray, &ldquo;Thank You Lord for another day, a new day, and thank You that I have the grace to live You today.&rdquo;...The grace we received is the eternal grace which is the eternal, unlimited Spirit. It is inexhaustible.<sup>90</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Spirit of Reality</h2>
<p>The writings of John reveal that the Spirit is the Spirit of reality (John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 4:6). The Spirit is called the Spirit of reality because whatever the Father in the Son is and whatever the Son is, is realized in the Spirit....God the Father is light, and God the Son is life. The reality of this light and life is the Spirit. If we do not have the Spirit, we cannot have the light of God the Father. If we do not have the Spirit, we cannot have God the Son as our life. The reality of all the divine attributes of both God the Father and God the Son is the Spirit....Eventually, because the Spirit is the reality, He is...the reality of God, the Son, eternal life, grace, and every divine matter.<sup>91</sup></p>
