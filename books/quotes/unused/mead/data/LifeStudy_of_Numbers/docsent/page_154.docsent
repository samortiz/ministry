   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>e. A Burnt Offering for the Feast of Weeks</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Numbers 28:26-31 is concerned with the burnt offering for the feast of weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This burnt offering was offered in the day of the first fruits, that is, the fiftieth day of the feast of weeks v. 26 , when a new meal offering was offered to Jehovah Lev 23:10-11, 15-16 . A holy convocation was held on the same day with no laborious work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The offering for the feast of weeks was the same as that offered at the beginning of the month.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God needs daily food, weekly food, monthly food, and yearly food.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In addition to enjoying ordinary food, God wants to enjoy food at the yearly feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have pointed out that these feasts correspond to our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Passover typifies Christ, who is our Passover 1 Cor 5:7 , and Pentecost typifies the processed Triune God, who has become the consummated, life-giving, dispensing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such a Spirit is the fullness of the Triune God and also the consummation of our enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the offerings in Numbers 28, which are God's food, point to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that Christ is not only our food but also God's food.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God and we enjoy the same food Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The center of Numbers 28 is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is the intrinsic substance of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is also the peace that enables us to have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The best fellowship involves eating.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we would enjoy the best fellowship with God, we need to serve Him with Christ as His food.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then as we are having fellowship with God, we and God will have the mutual enjoyment of Christ by eating and drinking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although Christ is God's food, He is not God's food in a direct way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, Christ is God's food served to God by us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, however, God's food also becomes our food.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we carefully read the book of Leviticus, we will see that the burnt offering is to be wholly and absolutely burned for God's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No portion of the burnt offering is to be eaten by the ones who offer it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the burnt offering is accompanied by a meal offering, a large portion of which is for the offerers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that when we serve God, offering Christ to Him as His food, God takes care of us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God seems to say, "You serve Me with My food, and now I would like to share a portion of this food with you."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this way we enjoy Christ with God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we are feasting, God also is feasting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is feasting with us, and we are feasting with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In mutuality, God and we feast together on the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The burnt offering typifies Christ as the One who, as a man, is absolutely for God and who satisfies Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The meal offering typifies Christ in His perfect, fine, balanced humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The drink offering typifies Christ's pouring Himself out for God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Christ was dying on the cross, He was pouring Himself out as a drink offering to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The sin offering typifies Christ as our sin offering redeeming us back to God and solving the problem of our sin, sins, and failures.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>With Christ as all these offerings, we may now enjoy Christ with God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First, we enjoy Christ as the One given to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Having experienced Christ, we present Him to God as His food, and then God shares with us a portion of the Christ we have offered to Him.</S>
