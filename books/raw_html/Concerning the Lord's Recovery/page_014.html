<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CONTENTS OF GOD'S EXPRESSION<br>IN ITS MODEL</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Exo. 40:17-35; Heb. 9:2-5</H1><P>The Bible is a record of God's expression. From the first page to the last page the expression of God is revealed. In the last message we pointed out that the first time man is mentioned in the Bible it says that he was created in the image of God (Gen. 1:26, 27). This indicates that man was intended to express God. Then God put this man before a tree which is called the tree of life, showing that God's intention was for man to eat of the tree of life so that he might enjoy and partake of the divine life of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S EXPRESSION IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</H2><P>In Genesis. the first book of the Bible, there are nine persons as landmarks of the human race. The first, Adam, was the landmark of man's fall. Man got fallen in Adam. Following Adam was the second man, Abel, who was the landmark of man being brought back to God according to the divine way of salvation. The third landmark was Enosh. Not many Christians have paid attention to this person. Enosh means a fragile man, easily broken, and easily put down. Because he realized that he was weak and fragile, he began to call on the name of the One who is the great I Am, Jehovah. This is the One who was and who is. This is the One who is the To Be. This is Jesus. In the Old Testament He was called Jehovah, and Enosh was the first in human history who called upon this all-inclusive One, this great To Be. He trusted in this One for his life. The fourth landmark was Enoch who walked with God and lived a life together with God. The fifth landmark was Noah who not only walked with God but also had a common interest with God and worked with God. God's interest was his interest. From these five landmarks we can see where man should be.</P><P>In Genesis there were four other important persons: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. These four persons actually depict one complete person. In our Life-study of Genesis we pointed out that the three generations of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are really three parts of one complete person. Joseph should not be considered as a fourth part but as a kind of annex to Jacob. In the father, Abraham, there was the calling by God out of the idolatrous world into the sphere of the full enjoyment of the riches of God. He was called out of Ur of the Chaldees into Canaan.</P>
