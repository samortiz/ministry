The Seventh Reason</H2><P>Revelation 3:10 says, "Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth."</P><P>These ones consider this verse to be the strongest proof. They argue that this verse clearly promises that the church will not pass through the tribulation. It is true that this verse is a promise. But does this verse say that all the Christians will be kept from the tribulation? No, it does not, because again, this verse has a condition; it is not unconditional. This verse does not promise that all the Christians will not go through the tribulation. It says, "Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial." It is because you have kept the word of His endurance that you will be preserved. The Lord preserves only the ones who keep the word of His endurance; He does not preserve everyone regardless of whether or not they keep His word.</P><P>What is keeping "the word of My endurance"? In Revelation 1, there are the words, "fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus" (v. 9). This tells us very clearly that today is the time we endure with Christ; our reigning with Christ will not take place until the future. Today is the time Christ endures. People revile Him, but He does not beat them to death; people curse Him, but He acts as if He has not even heard them; people oppose Him, but He does not threaten them. It seems that no matter how others treat Him, He does not care. Today is the time that He is opposed and blasphemed by men. This is the word of Christ's endurance. This is how Christ is, and this should be how all Christians are. Today there are many oppositions and persecutions, yet Christ endures them all. We ought to endure with Christ. Two thousand years have passed, and we have not seen Christ avenged once. He endures to such an extent that it seems as if He does not even exist in this universe.</P><P>However, has every regenerated and saved Christian, who has trusted in the blood, kept the word of Christ's endurance? If all Christians have kept the word of endurance, then they will not go through the tribulation. If there is one who has not kept the word of Christ's patience, this promise is not for him. This promise is conditional. If one has not met the condition, he cannot receive the benefit that is dictated by that condition.</P><P>One summer there was a Bible study in Kuling. A group of people were studying Revelation 2 and 3. One time I went and listened to their meeting. On that day they were talking about Revelation 3:10. One brother said, "There is a group of people who say that the whole church will not be raptured before the tribulation. How blind their eyes are! Does it not say clearly here that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation?" After the meeting, when I was walking with four or five brothers among them, I asked them, "Does this verse promise that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation? Have all the Christians kept the word of Christ's endurance today?" Of course they have not. If we only hold onto the promise of this verse and ignore the condition in the previous sentence, the whole world could hold onto the promise of John 3:16 and say that everyone in the world is saved. If someone would say this, you can tell him that he has missed several words, "Every one who believes into Him." "Every one who believes into Him" is a condition; "Would not perish, but would have eternal life" is a promise. One cannot just ask for eternal life without believing in the Lord. If a sinner does not believe, he will perish; he will not have eternal life. Likewise, if a Christian has not kept the word of Christ's endurance, he will not be kept out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth. Those who believe that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation have left out the words, "Kept the word of My endurance." Therefore, the verse they quote cannot be counted as evidence.</P><P>They say that the promise is given to the whole church in Philadelphia. The church in Philadelphia has kept the word of Christ's endurance, and the church in Philadelphia represents the whole church. So it can be said that the whole church has kept the word of Christ's endurance, and thus the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation.</P><P>However, we must know that Revelation 2 through 3 talk about the seven churches in Asia at that specific time. These seven churches were actually present then. Although the seven churches indicate the seven ages of the church, the seven churches were present at the same time then. Did the Lord say the same words to the church in Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, and Laodicea? No, He did not. Why did the Lord say these words only to the church in Philadelphia? The Lord's speaking to the church in Philadelphia proves that the church in Philadelphia does not represent all the churches. If it did, then the churches in Laodicea, Thyatira, and so forth would all have been given the same promise as the one to the church in Philadelphia.</P><P>In 1931 I was in Peking and I met a Western friend who said to me, "Did the Lord not promise the church in Philadelphia that they would not go through the trial? Does not the church in Philadelphia represent the whole church? Is not this a proof that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation?" I said, "The Lord gave the promise to the church in Philadelphia, but not all the churches are the church in Philadelphia. Therefore, the Lord did not promise all the churches."</P><P>All of these points show us that the reasons held by those who believe the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation cannot stand as valid. Besides this, they also made some basic mistakes. We will cover that too, but we have to wait until tomorrow.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 19: Notes on Scriptural Messages (3) &nbsp; pg 29</div><br></body></html>
