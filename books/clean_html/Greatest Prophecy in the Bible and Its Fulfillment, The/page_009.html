<h1 class="title">KEEPING THE ONENESS<br />
OF THE SPIRIT AND ARRIVING<br />
AT THE ONENESS OF THE FAITH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:23; 2:15-16, 18, 21-22; 3:2, 8-11, 16-17a, 19b; 4:3-4a, 11-16, 23-24</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>We have seen that the church is the Body of Christ and the new man, so the church needs the growth in life. This growth comes through the feeding, the nourishment, by the riches of Christ. The riches of Christ are the foodstuffs for our nourishment. The unsearchable riches of Christ in Ephesians 3:8 are for the church in verse 10. The church is the outcome of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. This shows us that God&rsquo;s economy is to dispense all the riches of Christ into our being so that these riches may become our inward nourishment. This means that Christ will be wrought, will be dispensed, will occupy, and will settle Himself in every part of our being. This makes Christ one with us, and spontaneously we will corporately be the Body of Christ and the new man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DILIGENT TO KEEP THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Now we have to go on to see some further points regarding the building up of the Body. For the building up of the Body, there is the need of oneness. Ephesians speaks clearly and definitely about keeping the oneness: &ldquo;Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace&rdquo; (4:3). This is because the Body of Christ is one and the new man is also one; that is, there is one Body and one new man. The riches of Christ, which produce the Body and the new man, are altogether realized in the Spirit. There is one Body and one Spirit (v. 4), so we have to keep the oneness. If the oneness is damaged, the building is gone. Even though we have the best enjoyment of the riches of Christ, if we lose the oneness, there is no possibility for the building up of the Body. This oneness is not the oneness of practices, regulations, or forms but the oneness of the Spirit. The Spirit is one, and this Spirit who dwells in our spirit is the Triune God Himself.</p>
<p>Actually, the Spirit Himself is the oneness. It is similar to the electricity flowing within many lamps, making them all one in the shining. In themselves, the lamps are separate, but in the electricity they are one. The electricity within them is the oneness. Likewise, the Spirit within us is our oneness. The same one Spirit dwells in all of us, so He is our oneness. If we care for Him, we have the oneness. If we do not care for Him, the oneness among us is gone. If we go to something else, surely we will have different opinions and dissension. You will have your concepts, I will have my understanding, and another will have his idea. Then we will be divided. But if we give up all the other things and come back to the one indwelling Spirit, right away we have the oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ARRIVING AT THE ONENESS OF THE FAITH</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4 tells us that this oneness, on the one hand, is the oneness of the Spirit and, on the other hand, is the oneness of the faith (v. 13). The faith is composed of what Christ is, what Christ has done, and what Christ is still doing for us. The faith is what we believe in for our salvation. We all believe in Jesus as the Son of God becoming a man, who died on the cross for our sins, was buried, and was resurrected on the third day; today He is our Redeemer, our Savior, our Lord, and also the all-inclusive Spirit indwelling our spirit. If we believe in Him, our sins will be forgiven, His blood will be applied to us, and we will be redeemed, justified, saved, and regenerated to have Him within us as our life. This is our faith, which is common to all different kinds of Christians. Anyone who does not have such a faith is not a real Christian. He is not saved or regenerated. But as long as a person believes that Christ is the Son of God incarnated to be a man, crucified on the cross for our sins, and resurrected from the dead to be our life, he has the faith. Regardless of what kind of background he keeps or what kind of doctrine he holds on to, he is a brother, a saint.</p>
<p>In doctrines we may be different, but in the faith we are absolutely one. You should never consider any doctrine as your faith. Some may say, &ldquo;My faith is in immersion by water,&rdquo; but immersion by water is not the faith. The doctrine of the presbytery is not the faith, nor is any other kind of doctrine. We do not need to keep anything else other than the oneness of the Spirit and of the faith. When we come back to the Spirit, we are one. When we care only for the faith, we are one. Ephesians 4:13 speaks of the oneness of the faith, and then verse 14 speaks of the wind of teaching, the wind of doctrine. The faith produces oneness, but doctrine brings in the wind to blow us away, to carry us away. If we forget about the doctrine, care only for the faith, and turn to the Spirit, we are one.</p>
