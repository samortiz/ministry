<h2 class="head3">35. The Firstfruits, the Second Man,<br />
and the Last Adam</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15 presents Christ as the firstfruits (vv. 20, 23), the second man (v. 47), and the last Adam (v. 45). It is significant that these three aspects of Christ are mentioned in one chapter. When we put together these three aspects of Christ, we see that Christ is the first, the second, and the last; as such, Christ is everything. Concerning these aspects of Christ, we must not only learn the truth and see the vision but also have the experience.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Firstfruits</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:20 Paul says, &ldquo;Now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.&rdquo; In verse 23 Paul speaks of &ldquo;the firstfruits, Christ.&rdquo; Christ is the firstfruits of resurrection to be the beginning of God&rsquo;s new creation and to be the Head of the Body, the church.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) To Be the Beginning of God&rsquo;s New Creation</h2>
<p>Christ was the first One raised from the dead, becoming the firstfruits of resurrection. This was typified by the firstfruits (a sheaf of the firstfruits, including Christ with some of the dead Old Testament saints, was raised at the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection&mdash;Matt. 27:52-53) in Leviticus 23:10-11, which were offered to God on the day after the Sabbath, the day of resurrection (Matt. 28:1). As the firstfruits, Christ is the beginning of God&rsquo;s new creation. Christ in resurrection is the beginning, the germination, of the new creation. Through the resurrection of Christ the old creation passed away and a new creation came into being. By His all-inclusive death He terminated the old creation; in His resurrection He germinated the new creation with the divine life. Christ is the firstfruits of the new creation in resurrection. This is confirmed by Colossians 1:18b: &ldquo;He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead.&rdquo; This verse shows that Christ is the first in resurrection; as such, He has the first place in the church, God&rsquo;s new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) To Be the Head of the Body, the Church</h2>
<p>Christ as the firstfruits of resurrection is the Firstborn from the dead that He might be the Head of the Body (Eph. 1:20-23). Hence, Colossians 1:18a tells us that Christ is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead. Since He, the Head of the Body, has been resurrected, we, the Body, also will be resurrected.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Second Man</h2>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Out of Heaven</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:47 unveils Christ as the second man. &ldquo;The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second man is out of heaven.&rdquo; <em>Out of the earth</em> denotes the origin of the first man, Adam, and <em>earthy,</em> his nature. As the first man, Adam is the head of the old creation, representing it in creation. As the second man, Christ is the Head of the new creation, representing it in resurrection. In the entire universe there are only two men: the first man, Adam, including all his descendants, and the second man, Christ, comprising all His believers. We believers were included in the first man by birth and became a part of the second man by regeneration. Our believing has transferred us out of the first man into the second. In regard to our being part of the first man, our origin is the earth and our nature is earthy. In regard to our being part of the second man, our origin is God and our nature is heavenly. <em>Out of heaven</em> denotes both the divine origin and the heavenly nature of the second man, Christ.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 306-322) &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
