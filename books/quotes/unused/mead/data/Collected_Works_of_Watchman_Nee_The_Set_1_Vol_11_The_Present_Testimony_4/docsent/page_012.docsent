   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>However, this dryness does not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sometimes it lasts for one or two weeks; sometimes it goes away in three to five days.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once the dryness goes away, the joy comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Formerly, their reading of the Bible and praying were such an effort and drag that it felt like trying to recite a forgotten passage.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now it seems that the fellowship with God is resumed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But how the recovery came about, they do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now they are more careful to maintain their joy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They try their best to maintain the exciting joy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are more careful in reading the Bible, praying, and testifying to others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But not long after this, the joy is gone again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They wonder why today is not the same as the day before for they read the Bible, pray, and testify just the same.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why is there such a big difference between the two days?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why was there the joy yesterday but not today?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Under such a condition, they even wonder what God is like and what Jesus Christ is like.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They have fallen into a great error.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They think that their spiritual power is gone and that they have become fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although they pray, it is not done faithfully; although they read the Bible, they spend less time on it; and although they testify, they do so only reluctantly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After a few days or several weeks, however, the joy strangely returns.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now they feel an interest in everything again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If they are not having the experience of the third heaven, they are, at least, having a mountaintop experience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But stranger than this is the fact that after a while, they revert to their former dry and tasteless condition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They begin to conclude that their spiritual life is one of ups and downs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If someone asks them about their spiritual life, they would say that their life is fluctuating.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During the highs, they read the Bible, pray, and testify with interest and joy, and during the lows, they do the same things without any interest and in dryness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the fluctuating life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I would like to consider the matter of this fluctuation, starting from the first joy we received at the time of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we can find the cause of the illness, we can find the cure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From the experience of many saved people, we can find a law that joy is greater at the beginning than at the end, while dryness is greater at the end than at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The joy becomes less intense though deeper , and the time of joy becomes shorter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the same time, the dryness becomes more intense and lasts longer though shallower .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Perhaps the first dryness lasts for three to five days; the second dryness for a week; the third for two weeks, and the fourth for perhaps a month.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, the second time around, the joy is less intense and shorter than the first, while the dryness is more intense and longer than the first.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The period of dryness extends longer, and its intensity increases more.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All believers have this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, our dryness is more than our joy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Can any Christian say that he has more joy today than on the day he was saved?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may feel sad in our hearts and feel that we have sinned or failed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are not as joyful as when we were first saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we were first saved, it was like riding on a cloud or like standing on a mountaintop.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We were bold to testify without fear, even on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We could read fifty to sixty chapters of the Bible a day and still feel that this was not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But today we feel that we are dragging our feet in everything we do, and we are reluctant to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let me say that we have made a basic mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have a big misconception concerning spiritual experiences; we think that the joyful times are the peak times of our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the dry times are not times of spiritual decline.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Suppose I lost a watch.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When I find the watch again, I will become very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After three to five days, my joy will not be as great as when I first found the watch.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Perhaps after a few days, the joy will be completely gone.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But this does not mean that I have lost my watch again.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What has been lost is merely the joy of finding the watch.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The same is true with our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we found the Savior, we were saved and could not help but rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Not only did we rejoice from ourselves, God gave us joy as well.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If someone did not have joy when he was saved, I doubt that he has found the Savior yet.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But later the joy was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We may think that the things that we gained are lost.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Actually, only the joy is lost; the things we gained are not lost.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Let me ask: Has the Lord Jesus changed?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No. Has God changed? No. Has the eternal life that God has given us been taken back? No. They were ours when we were excited about them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They are still ours when we feel so dry.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It does not matter how excited we are or how dry we are.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What we gained has not been lost; it is still there.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is why I say that there are no fluctuations in a Christian's life and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This does not include the case of those Christians who have sinned, fallen, or backslidden.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Those are exceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What we are talking about are the normal conditions of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God never changes, the work of the Lord Jesus never changes, and the Holy Spirit never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The eternal life that we have received is still there; it is never lost.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What is lost is merely our initial joy.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A young child may think that the sun is gone when it rains.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He may go to his father and ask, "Where is the sun?"</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He may go up to the roof and find that the sun is not there.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He may go to a nearby watchtower and find that the sun is not there.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But the sun has not changed; it has merely been blocked by the dark clouds.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today our Sun has not changed; what has changed is our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The sun in the sky has not changed at all.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But there are dark clouds in the sky which block the sunlight.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we live in our feelings, our sky will always change, and there will always be the covering of the clouds.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we do not live in our feelings, there will be no change in our sky.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We ought to live above the clouds of our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I have said that the intensity of joy decreases while the duration is shorter, and the intensity of dryness increases while the duration is longer.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>These are common phenomena of a Christian's experience; they are not accidental.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The experience of most Christians falls under this pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We can conclude that these things do not happen by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Since they do not happen by accident, there must be a hand behind everything.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Whose hand?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It must be God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He causes our joy to become less intense and its duration to become shorter.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He causes our dryness to become more intense and its duration to become longer.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We are merely referring to the experiences of ordinary Christians; we are not talking about the experiences of abnormal or outstanding Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Abnormal Christians have sinned and become fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Of course they have no joy.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Outstanding Christians have denied themselves from the beginning in a specific way and pursued after God in a specific way.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Every time they go through some special dealing, they experience special joy.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Every time they see God working in a special way, they experience special joy.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Outstanding Christians and abnormal Christians are exceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>What we are talking about are the normal Christians.</S>
