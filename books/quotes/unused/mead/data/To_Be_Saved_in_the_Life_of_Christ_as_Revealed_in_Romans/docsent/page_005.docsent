   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Through Our Cooperation by Presenting Ourselves as Slaves to Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This dispositional sanctification by the indwelling Spirit takes place through our cooperation by presenting ourselves as slaves to righteousness Rom 6:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to be sanctified, we must be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God can never sanctify anyone who is unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God sanctifies only the redeemed and justified ones; therefore, first we must be redeemed and justified in order to be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then we are able to be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sanctification is based upon righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, if we want to be sanctified dispositionally, we must present ourselves as slaves to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through Our Cooperation by Presenting our Members as Slaves to Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are dispositionally sanctified through our cooperation by presenting our members as slaves to righteousness Rom 6:19b .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to participate in gambling, we must first give our members, our hands, to play the game.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But if we have presented our hands as slaves to righteousness, we cannot gamble, because it is not righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to present each one of our members, not just ourselves as a whole, as slaves to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we present our members as slaves to righteousness, we are able to overcome many things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many of the saints cannot overcome the practice of "window-shopping'' at the department stores.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Often, not having any extra money in the bank saves some from shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although they have very little money in the bank, they still would go window-shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Apparently, window-shopping is not unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But because many items within the department stores are sinful and worldly, window-shopping is actually not righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we walk through the department stores, many items attract us and cause us to present our eyes to these unrighteous things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to be sanctified, we need to pray, "Lord, I present my eyes as slaves to righteousness.''</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then as we present our eyes as slaves to righteousness, the indwelling Spirit prevails to sanctify our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Romans 6 Paul is very detailed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He not only tells us to present ourselves as a whole, but also tells us to present every member of our body to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to present our whole being, our entire body, and each member of our body, not only to God as the divine person but also to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we present our members to righteousness, we are righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a result, God can come in to sanctify us in our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we present ourselves and our members as slaves to righteousness, the issue is dispositional sanctification Rom 6:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must present ourselves and our members as slaves to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This righteousness is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To present ourselves and our members to righteousness means to present ourselves and our members to Christ as righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the book of Romans, grace 5:17, 21 , righteousness 5:17, 21; 6:16, 18-20 , and sanctification all are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To present ourselves to righteousness is to present ourselves to the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is our righteousness, and He is the foundation, the base, for our being sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without Christ as a base in life, we cannot be sanctified in our disposition.</S>
