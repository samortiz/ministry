[1]  This publication is a collection of some further talks on the church life given by Brother Watchman Nee within the period of 1948 through 1951.
[2]  The talk on the unity of the church, printed as chapter four of this book, was given in the year 1951, a short time before his imprisonment, which began in the early part of 1952.
[3]  In one of these talks Brother Nee emphasized that the light concerning the church which the Lord gave him before the year 1937 and which was made known to all his co-workers in 1937 and published in the book Concerning Our Missions cannot be clearer, even after more than ten years' experience and test.
[4]  So these talks are not only an adequate proof that up to the latest part of his ministry Brother Nee still held the same viewpoint as he always did throughout all the time of his ministry concerning the church life, but are also a strong confirmation to the light concerning the practical side of the church life which he received from the Lord and ministered to His Body prior to quite a long time of testing.
[5]  Question:The brothers and sisters who have been meeting with us for more than ten years all seem to know our ground and how it is different from that of others.
[6]  The brothers and sisters saved during the past seven or eight years especially those saved during the most recent six or seven years , however, do not know what our ground is.
[7]  Therefore, I would like to ask what the actual ground of the church is.
[8]  I presume we all recognize that the blessing of God, the Holy Spirit of God, the light of God, and even the very life of the Lord Jesus Himself are all in the church.
[9]  Whether or not a so-called "church" is really the church is very important, because God has committed so many spiritual things to the church.
[10]  Today, let me bring out two matters; both must exist before there can be the church.
[11]  The New Testament clearly shows us two basic requirements: first, the authority of the Holy Spirit; and second, the boundary of locality.
[12]  We must realize that where there is not the Holy Spirit, there is not the church.
[13]  The church is absolutely not Witness Lee, Chang Yu-zhi, or Yu Cheng-hwa; the church must only be the Holy Spirit.
[14]  An Outlet for the Authority of the Holy Spirit
[15]  Recently, I saw what happened to a brother who had carried a very heavy object over a long distance several years ago.
[16]  We use authority to serve the brothers and sisters, not to govern them.
[17]  Anything Not Initiated by the Holy Spirit Is Not the Church
[18]  In Shanghai many people can establish an evangelistic mission, seminary, Bible institute, or Bible study class.
[19]  If we are not able to obey the Holy Spirit, and man's authority and man's things come in, there is no church.
[20]  There is one thing we must all notice: The world does not have a church; therefore, the Roman Catholic Church is wrong.
[21]  A province does not have a church, nor does a race.
[22]  In the Bible only the smallest administrative unit is related to the church only a locality or a city has a church.
[23]  Today in Bijie in Kweichow province, no one has taken the standing of establishing a church on the ground of locality.
[24]  If anyone desires to establish a church, it is all right for him to go to Bijie because in one locality there can only be one local church.
[25]  If an additional church appears there, God will say that is a division.
[26]  I hope the brothers and sisters will hold fast to this basic principle.
[27]  If they do, they will be clear about the standing of the so-called denominations, churches, groups, and organizations.
[28]  If any group is not built upon the ground of locality, we can see that it is not the church.
[29]  Some of us pray that the Lord would bless us as He blessed the church during Pentecost.
[30]  CHAPTER TWO THE CHURCH IN THE CITY AND THE CHURCH IN THE HOUSE A talk to the brothers and sisters in Shanghai on April 1, 1950, published in The Open Door, dated June 30, 1950.
[31]  Some people, however, speak of "the church in a house," quoting the Scriptures as their basis, as being an additional unit to the locality.
[32]  They imply that the church may possibly have several units in a locality.
[33]  If mentioning individual names in addition to greeting the church means that these individuals were not of this church and that there was another church in existence, then even Prisca and Aquila, whom Paul mentioned separately in his greeting, were not of the church which was in their own house!
[34]  Aquila and Prisca greet you much in the Lord with the church, which is in their house."
[35]  First, some people desire to have a church bigger than a city or a locality.
[36]  They want to unite many churches in different localities and make them one big church, that is, bigger than a locality.
[37]  In the Bible, when the house is equivalent to a locality or city, that house is called the church, like the church in Rome, the church in Colossae, the church in Laodicea, etc. But when the house is smaller than the locality or city, that house cannot be called the church, like the house meetings of the church in Jerusalem.
[38]  If the "churches" in the "house" of Cephas, in the "house" of Paul, in the "house" of Apollos, and in the "house" of Christ were added together, there would not be four churches in Corinth, they would still singularly be the church in Corinth.
[39]  From this we can see that God has never made this type of "house" a unit for the boundary, the jurisdiction, of the church.
[40]  If the church in Nymphas's house Col 4:15 and the church in Laodicea v. 16 are not the same, then when we add them up they must be two churches, but after we add "them" together in this way, God speaks of "the church in Laodicea" in Revelation 3:14, not "the churches" or "the two churches in Laodicea." They are just one.
[41]  They agree that the boundary, the jurisdiction, of the church is locality, yet because they are unwilling to get out of the sects, they think that the house is also a boundary of the church.
[42]  When we search the Bible for judgment and settlement upon some teaching, we must not only check the intention of our heart, but we must also take heed to the direction in which this kind of teaching leads and the outcome it produces.
[43]  Likewise, if anyone says that there can be the church in a house besides the church in a locality, we will also ask, What will be the outcome of this kind of teaching?
[44]  In order to practically make the church singular become the churches plural , God has established the way for one individual church and another individual church to remain two churches instead of one.
[45]  Now let me repeat what I have been saying about the nature of the church.
[46]  Any reason to divide the church damages the nature of the church; that is, it turns the unity of the church into disunity.
[47]  Such separation does not threaten the nature of church unity.
[48]  God also ordained that in one locality there should be only one church to express the unity of the heavenly church.
[49]  I would like to speak to the brothers a little more concerning the problem of the church.
[50]  The church must have both the authority of the Spirit and the ground of locality.
[51]  The ground of locality, however, is not a simple matter, because a church still needs content.
[52]  Does this mean that we must receive all believers in a locality without any reservations?
[53]  A church in a locality must not only receive all whom Christ has received in that locality, but must also exercise church discipline.
[54]  If the Lord puts a certain one into the world, yet we put him into the church, we open a door to the world in the church.
[55]  Furthermore, the most important matter for the church in a locality is that she must be inclusive, not exclusive.
[56]  The church must be inclusive in two aspects of its behavior and its doctrine.
[57]  First, we will consider the aspect of Christian behavior that the church should not exclude.
[58]  If the church in a locality is standing in the position of the church, she must not shrink from declaring the perfect, complete will of God.
[59]  Therefore, a local church must include all kinds of God's children who seek the Lord.
[60]  It must include the brothers who sell everything as well as the brothers who do not sell everything.
[61]  For example, head covering is definitely in the Bible.
[62]  Today the church must be absolutely in favor of head covering.
[63]  But if some brothers have not seen it, we have to take the attitude of Romans 14 and wait for them to see it, because we must receive those whom the Lord receives.
[64]  If a sister covers her head and the church does not receive her, she will feel that the church is not hers and she will leave.
[65]  In summarizing the above points, there are several basic principles.
[66]  First, the church must stand on the positive side of whatever is in the Bible and forbear the negative side.
[67]  If some are weak and unable to come up to what is in the Bible, the church needs to forbear.
[68]  If the church includes rather than excludes God's children, the church will not be responsible for brothers who desire to go another way, because it is they who are creating the division, not the church.
[69]  First Corinthians 12:27 says, "Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually."
[70]  Following this it says, "And God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues" v. 28 . It is wonderful that Paul asks in the next verse, "Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all have works of power?" v. 29 . Are all apostles? God is asking here.
[71]  Because there are prophets who want to occupy God's whole church, teachers who want to occupy God's whole church, and workers of miracles who want to occupy God's whole church, the Lord asks, "Are all prophets?
[72]  Even if everyone in the whole church does works of power, that is still not the church.
[73]  Even if everyone in the church is a prophet or a teacher, that is still not the church.
[74]  Finally, we absolutely must not cherish any thought of having a system.
[75]  We should not think for any reason that the truth and gospel of God only issue forth from our midst.
[76]  Suppose fifty brothers are standing on the ground of the church in a certain locality, and later, another fifty brothers in the same place become enlightened and clearly see the ground of the church.
[77]  The most important, visible problem of recent days is perhaps the unity of the church.
[78]  Today we must see the way of unity and how to walk in unity.
[79]  We must be clear which one is in accordance with God's will, which one is scriptural, which one is the proper way for the church, and which one we must take.
[80]  We must take notice of one condition that prevailed after the Roman Catholic Church came into being.
[81]  Why did no brothers or sisters in the church stand up to deal with the situation for eleven hundred years?
[82]  Does the Bible ever say that there is only one church on the earth?
[83]  The Bible shows us that God establishes churches on the earth, that is, one church in each locality.
[84]  Here is an important matter which we must notice before God: In the Bible, God has never united the churches in the many localities together as one church.
[85]  The Bible never indicates that the churches in a province should unite as one church, that the churches in a country should unite as one church, or that the churches on a continent should unite as one church.
[86]  There is a second kind of unity today which can be found throughout the world, and it is called "spiritual" unity.
[87]  The Doctrine of the Visible and the Invisible Church Produced
[88]  Since both the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Church were state churches, they naturally contained many unsaved people.
[89]  This view creates two problems: we have just seen the problem from the viewpoint of the state church; now we must see it from the viewpoint of the dissenters, many of whom did not approve of the state church.
[90]  They not only disapproved but also stood up to oppose the errors of the state church.
[91]  Since people already have the denominations today, what should we do?
[92]  For a clearer understanding, I will give an illustration.
[93]  The Bible shows that God accepted Abel's offering but not Cain's Gen 4:2-7 .
[94]  Today it is not just a matter of whether or not the denominations are right.
[95]  What matters is that if we feel they are right, we must support them, but if we feel they are wrong, we have to tear them down.
[96]  Now we will look at the third kind of unity, that is, the unity in the Scriptures.
[97]  The Scriptures show us that the church is the Body of Christ and that there is only one Body.
[98]  The Scriptures also show us that God through the Holy Spirit dwells in the church and that the Holy Spirit is one Spirit.
[99]  How were the seven churches in Asia before the Lord?
[100]  In other words, for every church on the earth, there is a golden lampstand in heaven.
[101]  These seven churches were in seven different localities: Ephesus was a locality, Smyrna was a locality, Pergamos was a locality, etc.; there was a total of seven localities.
[102]  If it were God's will to unify all the churches on earth into one church, then God in heaven would have only one lampstand, not seven.
[103]  The Church Spoken of in Ephesians and Colossians Being Universal Both in Space and in Time
[104]  Two Epistles in the Bible especially speak about the church: Ephesians and Colossians.
[105]  This church not only refers to the church on the earth, because even though the church on the earth is broad enough to include everyone according to space, it can only include a section of the church according to time.
[106]  First Corinthians 1:10 says: "Now I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same things " To whom does you refer?
[107]  The "Body" Referring to the Children of God in a Certain Time and at a Certain Place
[108]  We have just seen the negative view of division; now let us see the positive view of unity as is demanded in the Bible.
[109]  Now we shall go on to see the reason we stress the expression of unity in locality.
[110]  Now let us see the importance of the boundary of locality.
[111]  Congregationalism is actually very close to the Bible, but it goes a little beyond the Bible.
[112]  The Congregationalist brothers studied the Bible but failed to discover the thought of locality.
[113]  Therefore, we must see clearly before God that in the Bible there is one locality with one church, or in short, one locality, one church.
[114]  When it swings to one side, it is wrong because it causes three or four localities to have one church or the whole world to have one church.
[115]  The Lord has shown us that one locality should have only one church, and one locality should have only one administration.
[116]  If any brother is not one with me, I must wash his feet and beg him until he becomes one with me.
[117]  Within these few days I have heard someone say, "We can talk and fellowship, even though you can still have your church, I have my church, and he has his church.
[118]  We Must Fear More to Found a Church than to Do Anything
[119]  We have seen that the unity of the Body is expressed in the locality.
[120]  If we do not pay attention to the unity in the locality, then other kinds of unity are vain words because they are not found in the Bible.
[121]  A brother asked, "As the word concerning the unity of the church goes out from us at this time, people may very easily misunderstand that we are asking others to unite with us.
[122]  In order to answer this question, we must let them know the basic problem: Before the Lord we can yield in certain things, but there are other matters in which we can never compromise.
[123]  We can yield in our own position, but toward brothers who are in the denominations, whether in a congregational church or a united church, there are things which we cannot compromise.
[124]  CHAPTER FIVE THE SERVICE OF THE CHURCH Parts of two talks given by Brother Watchman Nee to the co-workers as trainees on Mount Kuling in the year 1948.
[125]  The first part was published in April 1949, in chapter forty-nine of Messages for Building Up New Believers, and the second part published in March 1950, in the third chapter of Church Affairs.
[126]  If the church has the proper ground outwardly and the proper content inwardly, it is still insufficient.
[127]  Romans 12:4-8 says, "For just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, so we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.
[128]  And having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; or service, let us be faithful in that service; or he who teaches, in that teaching; or he who exhorts, in that exhortation; he who gives, in simplicity; he who leads, in diligence; he who shows mercy, in cheerfulness."
[129]  With regard to the practical affairs of the church, the brothers and sisters must be very concerned and very clear.
[130]  For example, the cleaning of the meeting place and the care and arrangement of the blankets and sheets that belong to the church are all in the nature of the service of the Levites.
[131]  You have to be clear before God about this principle that all the brothers and sisters must have spiritual service as well as practical service.
[132]  You have to work to such an extent that you bring all the brothers to the same condition that you are in. When all the brothers come and serve together, the church in that locality will have a foundation.
[133]  The Body of Christ is not a doctrine; it is something living.
[134]  We all must learn this one thing: Only when every member functions is there the Body of Christ.
[135]  Today I think that two ways are clearly set before us.
[136]  If the Lord can really break through in our midst, the way we have taken for the past ten, twenty, or thirty years will be completely reversed.
[137]  CHAPTER SIX THE WAY FOR THE WORK HEREAFTER A talk given to the co-workers as trainees on Mount Kuling, August 19, 1948, and published in The Ministers, dated November 1, 1948.
[138]  Our former pathway in the Lord's work has caused us to encounter some practical difficulties.
[139]  The second matter involves a center in each region.
[140]  The highest place a church can appeal to is its own locality; there is no district council or headquarters for the church.
[141]  You will remember that Peter went out to Caesarea and returned to Jerusalem.
[142]  The Measure of Increase Being in Proportion to the Number Going Out
[143]  God used persecution to force the saints to migrate.
[144]  For the provinces of Kiangsu and Chekiang, the center of the work along the Nanking-Shanghai and Shanghai- Hangchow railways lines is in Shanghai.
[145]  Now we come to the fourth point, that is, the need for all the brothers and sisters to receive the same training.
[146]  The local churches should send promising ones here to be given one or two months of spiritual help.
