Because this point is such a significant and crucial truth regarding the Spirit, we must consider it once again. We will also see more about the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Most Christians today are very confused about this matter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. TWO ASPECTS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</H2><P>[In chapter one of Acts the resurrected Christ charged His disciples to remain in Jerusalem for the baptism in the Holy Spirit: "For John indeed baptized in water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now" (Acts 1:5). In verse 8 He went on to say, "You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you." Here we see that the baptism in the Holy Spirit is a matter of the Spirit descending upon the disciples.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. As Breath for Life</H2><P>[In Acts 1 the Lord talks about the disciples experiencing the Holy Spirit coming upon them. But had the disciples not received the Holy Spirit already? According to John 20, in the evening of His resurrection day, the Lord appeared to His disciples, breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit" (v. 22). In this verse the Holy Spirit is likened to breath. Breath is something inward, something related to the life within us. In John 20:22, therefore, the disciples received the Holy Spirit as breath for life.]</P>
