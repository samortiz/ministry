   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE POWER OF DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A man can be free from sin, but he cannot be free from the satanic operation of death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 8 says, "For if you live according to the flesh, you must die" v. 13 , and "the mind set on the flesh is death" v. 6 . The death spoken of in these two verses is not the death of the body nor the death of hell but spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The power of death is suppressing our spirit and putting it to death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every believer can be under the effect of the power of death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, a Christian may have offended the Spirit and spoken something that should not have been said.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not only is the speaker under the power of death, but the words themselves spread death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the power of death comes upon a man, it kills his spirit and depletes him of any vitality or energy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As soon as a man sets his mind on the flesh, he falls under the power of death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Any act that is according to the flesh affords death an opportunity to prevail upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As long as Satan has not been cast into the abyss and the lake of fire, it is still possible for the power of death to operate in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once this power of death operates, a believer's spirit becomes bound and suffers damage.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When a man hits a wall, the first part that is hurt is his nose, because the nose is the part that protrudes from the body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When a man spreads death, the spirit of others is the first part that is hurt, because man's spirit is the "protruding" part as far as life is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not only must the speaker release life in the meeting, but the ones in the audience must be receptive to life as well.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How good a meeting is depends as much on the condition of the consuming elements as it does on the supplying elements.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the number of those who consume life becomes too large, the meeting will be taken over by death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the other hand, if the number of those who supply life becomes larger, the meeting will be full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>None of us should be a bystander in the meeting; even more none of us should spread any death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whether we are speakers or listeners, our spirit should be on the alert and not allow death to take over; rather, we should drive away the power of death through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>OVERCOMING DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First Corinthians 15 says that death comes from Adam, while resurrection comes from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Adam all have died, while in Christ all will be made alive v. 22 . When the kingdom comes, the sting of death will be gone, and death will be completely annihilated.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At that time mortality will put on immortality, and death will be swallowed up unto victory vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>54-55 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From the time of Adam, death has been man's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But in the end, this enemy will be annihilated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At that time Christ will be king and all things will be put in subjection to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The last enemy death will also be abolished vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, the kingdom will be a time when eternal life reigns.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Not only will sin be terminated in the kingdom, death will be terminated as well.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although eternal life will not reign until the age of the kingdom, we can have a foretaste of the power of the kingdom victory over death today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As long as we walk by the Spirit and put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit, we will live with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace" Rom 8:6 .</S>
