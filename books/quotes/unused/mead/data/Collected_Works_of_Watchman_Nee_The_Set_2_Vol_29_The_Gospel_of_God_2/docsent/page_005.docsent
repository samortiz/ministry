   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REGENERATION AND ETERNAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The third point that we need to consider is the salvation that God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What has God done for us, and what has He given us?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all know that God has given us His life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He has regenerated us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All those who believe in Him and who receive Him are given the authority to become children of God John 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are begotten of God, and we have the authority to become His children vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 3 says that we are to be born anew; it is the Holy Spirit who has regenerated us v. 6 . The first Epistle of John tells us how man can be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First John 5:1 says that everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How are we regenerated?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are regenerated through believing in Jesus as the Christ whom God appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After reading the above three verses, we can realize who we, as Christians, are.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When a sinner believes in the Lord Jesus and is saved, God gives him a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible shows us in at least three or four places that being regenerated is to receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible repeatedly shows us that those who receive eternal life are the ones who have believed, and those who believe have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is shown to us repeatedly by the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here we have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God has given to us eternal life, but what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must realize that this is both the beginning and the end. If I do not desire to have a relationship with someone, I have to approach it in one of two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since human relationships are bilateral, they always have two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, not having a relationship also involves two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, there must not be a beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If there is not a beginning, there will not even be a relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Second, the relationship can terminate and die, in which case there will no longer be a relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, suppose I am a very bad son, a prodigal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are two ways for my father not to have a relationship with me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, he should not have begotten me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If there had not been a beginning, he would not have to be related to me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if there has been a beginning, he cannot use the first way anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this case, he can only wait day by day for me to die.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I die, my relationship with him will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If I am not born of him, I will have nothing to do with him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If I have died, I will also have nothing to do with him anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What happened between God and us?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God has begotten us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the time that we believed in Jesus, God begat us with His Spirit and with His own life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have become the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Can this relationship be severed?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you have a son today who is bad, undisciplined, and lawless, you can disown him in court.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But the fact that you have begotten him still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is still your son in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today God has begotten us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Can He say that He has not begotten us?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even if we become worse than we are, we are still begotten of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even if our father denies us, we are still begotten of him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No one can deny the fact of begetting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A good son is begotten of his father.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A bad son is also begotten of his father.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No one can nullify this relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, when God justified us, He did not do it in the way that a person sends people away on the street with two pennies.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He said that He has begotten us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God is in Spirit, and we are also in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God and we have a father-son relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is what God Himself has said.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He has given us authority to become children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He has given to us eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are children of God by authority.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>That is the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What then can God do now?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He can only hope for us to die.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But the strange thing is that our relationship with Him begins with regeneration and ends with eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Not only has God begotten us, He has also given us eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If God had started the work but had been unable to complete it, we would be finished.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In that case, we could not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As far as the eternal life that we received from God is concerned, it is impossible for God not to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Thank the Lord that He has regenerated us and has given us eternal life, which is the life of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If there is a man today who thinks that a Christian can perish again if he becomes weak and that only a good son will have eternal life, while a bad son will perish, this man does not know God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He may think that the Lord is a debt collector, coming to collect eternal life and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we do well, we can keep them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we do not do well, He will take them back.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is not the salvation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The beginning has to be of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The continuation also has to be of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Since God has given us salvation, how can we lose our salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Since God has started this relationship, and the life we received is an eternal life which can never cease to exist, we can never perish again.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God gave us another type in the Bible to show us that we can never lose our salvation once we have received it from God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Genesis 3 is a familiar passage to us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It tells us how Adam sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After Adam ate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, God drove him from the garden of Eden and guarded the way to the tree of life with the cherubim and the flaming sword that turned every way v. 24 . Why did God have to surround the entrance to the tree of life with the flaming sword and the cherubim? Why did He not allow Adam to eat of the fruit of the tree of life? Genesis 3:22 says, "And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever." Here we see a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We all know that the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil signifies independence from God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The fruit of the tree of life, on the other hand, signifies life the life given to us by the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>After Adam sinned, God was afraid that Adam would eat of the fruit of the tree of life and that if he ate of it, he would not die.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If Adam could still die after eating the fruit of the tree of life, then why did God have to do so much work?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Why did He have to guard the way to the tree of life with the cherubim and the flaming sword?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>God did this because He was afraid that Adam would live forever if he ate of it.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We are those who have been redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What we have eaten is not the fruit of the tree of life, which is a type only.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We have eaten Life Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Can we still die?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If Adam could not die after having eaten a symbolic fruit, how can we die after having been washed by the blood of the Lord Jesus, having eaten of the tree of life itself, and having received eternal life?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Adam knew the tree of life as a type, whereas we have received what the tree of life typifies.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>How can we possibly die?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Only those who do not know what regeneration is and what eternal life is can say that salvation can be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Thank the Lord that eternal life is a fact that can never be annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It is a history that can never be blotted out.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is why we can live before God.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>What grace God has bestowed upon us!</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The relationship between God and us is such that we can strongly say that no power on earth can separate us from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Even if God were to be unhappy about it, He cannot annul this relationship.</S>
