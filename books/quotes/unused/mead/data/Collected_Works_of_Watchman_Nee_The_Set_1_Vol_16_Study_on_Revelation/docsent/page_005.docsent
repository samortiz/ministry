   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Concerning Himself</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although John had seen such great visions, he still called himself our brother.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What humility this is!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that time he was in the midst of tribulation, yet he did not mention his tribulation only.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He also mentioned the kingdom because to enter the kingdom, one must pass through tribulation Acts 14:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since we have the hope of the kingdom, we need endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the endurance of one patiently waiting for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Fellow partaker" indicates that we all have a share in this kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since we have a share in the kingdom, we should have a share in the tribulation and endurance as well.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. Concerning His Environment</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was lonely with nowhere to go, yet the Lord was with him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The gate of heaven was opened wide to him, and he received new revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By this we see that tribulations are a great blessing to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>C. When He Saw the Vision</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"On the Lord's Day."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some have said that this is "the day of the Lord," that is, "the great day of Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>D. The Heart and Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>of the One Receiving the Vision</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"I was in spirit."</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"And I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet, saying, What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me; and when I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands, and in the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And His head and hair were as white as white wool, as snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire; and His feet were like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace; and His voice was like the sound of many waters.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And He had in His right hand seven stars; and out of His mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword; and His face shone as the sun shines in its power."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A. What Was Heard</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"A loud voice like a trumpet."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A trumpet was used to gather the people together.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord specifically called John and charged him to write to the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although these seven churches were actual churches at that time, the Lord specifically chose them to typify the churches throughout the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The different conditions of the church from the time of the apostles to the second coming of Christ are represented by these seven churches.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"Seven Golden Lampstands"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 12</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The seven golden lampstands are the seven churches v. 20 . The lampstands represent God's view of the churches and what their spiritual reality should be.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church should shine for the Lord to illuminate this dark world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But the lampstands cannot shine on their own; they must be filled with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, the church must be filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>2.</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What was the appearance of this Son of Man?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was "like the Son of Man."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This implies that His appearance was different from what it had been on earth because He only looked like the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His appearance was recorded as follows:</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>a "Clothed with a garment reaching to the feet."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This denotes the Lord's glory, the glory which He had before He was born on the earth Isa 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord has now been restored to His former glory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This garment not only denotes that the Lord has obtained His former glory; it also denotes that He is a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord is now our High Priest Heb 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>b "Girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle."</S>

   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>c "His head and hair were as white as white wool."</S>

   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Fire is used for testing 1 Pet 1:7 ; it exposes the good as well as the evil.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>With His eyes as a flame of fire, whatever the Lord looks at will immediately be exposed as either good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The fire in 1 Corinthians 3:13 is this fire of the Lord's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we stand before the judgment seat of Christ, He will test each one's work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The meaning of 1 Corinthians 4:5 also corresponds with what is said here in Revelation 1:14.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There it says, "So then do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then there will be praise to each from God."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>e "And His feet were like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Feet are for walking, and in the Bible bronze signifies judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Wherever these bronze feet go, judgment follows.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Here the Lord's feet are in the church; thus, the Lord must judge the church first 1 Pet 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>f "And His voice was like the sound of many waters."</S>

   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches v. 20 . That the messengers are in the Lord's hand means that they are used, controlled, and protected by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>h "And out of His mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This sword is used to deal with the church 2:16 and the worldly people 19:15, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>i "And His face shone as the sun shines in its power."</S>
