   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE A GENERAL OUTLINE OF GOD'S ECONOMY Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 1:3-4; Gen 1:26-27; 2:8-9; 3:6-7; Rom 5:12; 8:20-22; John 15:1, 4; 11:25; 14:6; 2 Cor 5:17; Eph 2:5; Col 2:13; 1 Pet 1:3; Rom 8:29; Acts 13:33; 1 Cor 15:45b; Col 1:22; 1 Thes 5:23; Rom 12:2; Titus 3:5; 2 Cor 3:18; Heb 2:10; Col 3:4; Phil 3:21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer: Lord, pour down Your Holy Spirit generously that we all may be filled with the Spirit outwardly and meet in the Spirit; may we have not only the Word but also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Grant us Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We trust only in Your mercy and Your blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE BIBLE BEING A MYSTERIOUS BOOK DEALING EXCLUSIVELY WITH THE ECONOMY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible is a mysterious book to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Tens of thousands of people read the Bible, yet each one has his own opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In my studying of the Word, I went through several stages of progression.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, according to my study, I saw that the entire Bible is a book that deals exclusively with the economy of God, and that in particular the New Testament is focused on the consummation of the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, the New Testament is especially thorough in dealing with the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul wrote to Timothy, asking him to charge and exhort certain dissenting ones not to teach different things any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What are the "different things"?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are things that have nothing to do with the economy of God 1 Tim 1:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With this as the guideline of observation, today, needless to say in the past generations, very few things taught by Bible teachers can be linked to the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although what they teach is both scriptural and fundamental and concerns Christ and His salvation, in their presentation to people, they do not link these things to the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, "the economy of God" has become a phrase not used in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>GOD'S TWO CREATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now we want to see how the Bible refers to God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible first shows us that God has two creations: one is the old creation and the other is the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The old creation was a twofold creation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the first section of God's old creation, which was His original creation, He created the heavens and the earth including the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Among them, an archangel, who was a cherub, led a group of them to rebel against God and thus became God's adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, his name is Satan, which means "adversary" Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>28:14-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Due to his rebellion, the original creation of God became waste and empty Gen 1:2; Jer 4:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, God came to carry out the work of restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In His work of restoration, God recovered the wasted heavens and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He first created the different kinds of plants and animals, and then He created man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Man was created by God according to Himself in image and likeness Gen 1:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What God created was a man, yet the man whom He created looked like God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How marvelous it is that God created man according to Himself!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He created man, yet what came out was Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Very few readers of the Bible pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This man who was created by God was the center of His restoration in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then God presented Himself to this man in the form of the tree of life 2:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that He wanted this man to take Him in. Although this man was created by God with His image, he did not yet have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, God placed him in front of the tree of life which signified Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God wanted man to receive the tree of life, to receive God, as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, man would be like God both in his inward nature and life and in his outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>SATAN COMING IN TO DAMAGE</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Satan came in, however, to seduce man to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil Gen 3:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, man sinned and became fallen, and the entire restored old creation, which he represented as the head, was corrupted Rom 5:12 and became vanity of vanities 8:20 , groaning together in travail under the slavery of corruption vv.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because of this, God's economy also suffered a setback.</S>
