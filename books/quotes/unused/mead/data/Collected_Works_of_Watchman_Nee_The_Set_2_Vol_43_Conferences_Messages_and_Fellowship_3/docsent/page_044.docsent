   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus reveals that He is now in the Holy Spirit and that He is ready for us to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul knew of Christ according to the flesh, but in 2 Corinthians 5:16, he said that "now we know Him so no longer."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ was God putting on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was the Word incarnated on the earth to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The flesh was like a garment to the Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After His death and resurrection, He put on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He put on the flesh; then He put on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before His death the Holy Spirit was in Him; after His resurrection He was in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When He was on the earth, the Holy Spirit was present with the disciples through Christ; after His resurrection, Christ was present with the believers through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, the Holy Spirit came through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now Christ has come through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, Christ was in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now Christ is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul knew of Christ according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that he only knew of the Christ who had put on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But in 2 Corinthians, he no longer knew of Him in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that he knew the Christ who had put on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is a big difference between putting on the flesh and putting on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Christ was living in the flesh, He was always limited by time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When He was in Galilee, He could not be in Bethsaida.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If He was in one place, He could not be in another place at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By putting on the flesh, Christ became a Savior outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If He was by the sea, He could not be in an inland region.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The disciples were at times close to Him and at times far away from Him; they could not be with Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If Christ were in Judea and we were in Singapore, we could not follow Him every day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When He became Christ in the flesh, He became a Savior outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If He had remained this way, what could we do?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We could go to worship Him in Jerusalem three times a year.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We could draw near to Him in this way, but once we left Jerusalem, we would be far away from Him again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we were in the right place, we could be with Him, but when we were not in the right place, we could not be with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the Christ in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But Christ is no longer in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Through His death He put off the flesh, and in resurrection He took on a spiritual body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After His resurrection, He put on another garment; He put on the Holy Spirit, and He is now in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His birth in Bethlehem was His first coming.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>During the first coming He put on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After His death and resurrection, He put on the Holy Spirit, and He is now living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Holy Spirit is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At one time the Holy Spirit lived in the earthly Christ; now the resurrected Christ lives in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Spirit is not physical; He is omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since Christ is in the Spirit, He can live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since Christ resurrected for us, we can receive Him through faith and regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Brothers and sisters, have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The tree of life has now produced fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Originally, it was a tree; there was life, but no one could eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No one can take in the life of a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But once a tree bears fruit, the life of the tree gets into the fruit, and when one eats the fruit, he takes in the life of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the Lord was a man, we could not receive Him into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But now that He is in the Holy Spirit, we can receive Him into us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thank the Lord that Christ is no longer an outward, objective Savior; He is our life within.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The descending of the Holy Spirit is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Without the descending of the Holy Spirit, Christ could not be in the Spirit, and man could never be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thank the Lord that today we are in Christ and that we are one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God's salvation is complete.</S>
