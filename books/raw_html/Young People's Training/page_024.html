 <h2 class="head1">THE COMPOUND SPIRIT</h2>
<p>This life-giving Spirit is the compound Spirit. Many have never heard of this term. Thus, you must help them, through the study of typology, to see the holy ointment which is a compound of various spices (Exo. 30:22-33). This ointment is a compound of four spices mixed with olive oil. Formerly, the oil was merely the oil, but after the spices had been added to it, the oil became a compound. One of the spices signifies the death of Christ and another the resurrection of Christ. If you read carefully, you will see that all the spices indicate the human nature of Christ. This implies that in the compound Spirit there is the humanity of Jesus as well as His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. This is the all-inclusive Spirit who gives life and who is Christ Himself. During the past years, many messages have been delivered along this line.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</h2>
<p>In typology, the meal offering contains oil mingled with fine flour (Lev. 2:5). Even the King James Version uses the word &ldquo;mingled&rdquo; in Leviticus 2. Many have criticized us for using the word &ldquo;mingle,&rdquo; saying, &ldquo;How could God lose His nature and be mingled with our nature?&rdquo; It is stupid to argue this way. When the oil mingles with fine flour, the oil does not lose its nature. When tea is put into the water to form tea-water, the tea and the water do not lose their nature. It is foolish to say that they do. Although they are mingled, they remain two different elements.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some Christians are offended by this completion of the word of God. Because they do not have the completion, they miss a great deal. Instead of having the whole seed with the shell and the kernel, they only have some part of the shell. They condemn us for being heretical, for having the kernel as well as the shell. If you oppose what I am saying, you will miss the blessing. I can testify that I have come here with much blessing. I have not suffered any loss, but you may suffer a loss. In all the messages given during the past years, I have been doing nothing except completing the word of God. Many can say that they have never heard these things before. The reason is that there was a great lack. Now, thank the Lord that in His recovery we are seeing the completion of the word of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR REVELATION AND LEARNING</h2>
<p>You can never complete the word of God in a full way in a short time. Although I have given hundreds of messages over the past twelve years, the word of God has still not been completed. Do not expect to do a quick work. Rather, preach the gospel in the way of completing the word of God. To complete means to cover every point. If I would only speak of the kernel and not the shell, this also would be incomplete. We need to be complete on every side and in every aspect, point, and element. Only then will the word of God be completed. When you reach people, do not expect them to be saved overnight. Even after they are saved, they will need completion. Do not be disappointed at this word. You all need much learning. There is a great deal that you need to know: God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, the devil, sin, redemption, the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s prevailing blood, objective and subjective righteousness, objective holiness, subjective sanctification, the redemption of your body, how Christ dwells in your spirit, the difference between spirit and soul. Without exaggerating, I can say that there are many, many items you need to know.</p>
<p>When you contact people, do not preach to them; instead, reach them by getting into their situation, circumstances, and condition. If you contact a person in this way, you will realize what part of the Word he is ready for. If he is not ready to hear of redemption, do not mention it. If you would tell him about it, he would not accept it. Be like a doctor who dispenses different kinds of medicine. When a &ldquo;patient&rdquo; comes to you, you must exercise your discernment to know what medicine is suitable for his condition. After several days, you may need to change the medication. We must learn and practice this, for, in the long run, this will avail.</p>
<p>Do not follow the way of the Jesus people. Only a few years ago, thousands were baptized in the ocean; but where are they now? The Lord desires a living testimony. As long as He has some to be His living testimony, it does not matter whether the number is large or small. We must gain those who are practically available for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. If we see that the Lord&rsquo;s desire is to have a living testimony, then we shall not expect to see people saved so quickly. Rather, we would prefer to work on them, completing in them the word of God.</p>
<p>After a certain time, you will realize that the one on whom you are working is ready for a particular point. Then you will help him in that very matter. In order to do this, you must have some learning, some revelation, concerning God, Christ, the cross, redemption, the divine life, rebirth, and many other things. Do not think that there are too many things to learn. Often when you contact people you will realize that you are short in a particular matter. Some years ago, we prepared our hymnal containing one thousand and eighty hymns. Although this is a large number, when we are in a certain situation, we realize that we do not have a proper hymn to meet it. But if we are rich in songs, then whatever the situation, we shall have a suitable hymn for it. Likewise, if your revelation and learning in the Lord are rich, you will be able to afford people help in any kind of situation.</p>
