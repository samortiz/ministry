   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Teaching of the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Constitution of God's New Testament Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that in the Old Testament, the law could be considered as the written constitution of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the New Testament what replaced the law for God's administration among His people?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We know that Christ replaced the law, but we are referring to the aspect and sense of replacing the law in God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the New Testament, the teaching of the apostles replaced the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Acts 2:42 says, "And they were continuing steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Immediately after the three thousand were saved on the day of Pentecost, they began to continue steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Old Testament kingdom of God, the constitution was the law, and in the New Testament kingdom of God, the constitution is the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The teaching of the apostles is the complete New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It comprises firstly the teaching of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first group of apostles were charged by the Lord Jesus to teach the new believers what the Lord had taught them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is clearly recorded in Matthew 28:19-20.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The teaching of the apostles also includes what is recorded in the Acts, the Epistles, and the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the conclusion of the book of Revelation, John tells us that no one should add anything or take away anything from the divine revelation Rev 22:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that with the book of Revelation, the teaching of the apostles has been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From that time onward, no one is allowed to add or deduct anything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you add something, you will suffer the plagues; and if you deduct something, you will suffer the loss of the divine blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The entire New Testament, which is the complete teaching of the apostles, must be considered as the constitution of God's New Testament kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Elders as Priests and Administrators</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul, in his first Epistle to the Corinthians, made this matter of God's administration in the New Testament very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He charged the brothers in Corinth to remove a certain sinful man from the fellowship of the church 5:13 , which is also the fellowship of the apostles and of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His desire was that this evil person would be removed from the church, but he would not do it by himself because he was not the direct administrator.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, he charged the ones who were the direct administrators in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By the New Testament teaching and example, we can realize that some elders had been established in the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul gave such a charge to the brothers, but he did not carry out the administration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The elders were the direct administrators of the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The written constitution of the New Testament kingdom of God is the teaching of the apostles, the complete New Testament, and the direct administrators in this kingdom are the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, in the New Testament age, there is still some instant speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the New Testament, we have the reality of the high priest and the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Old Testament, the priests are one group, and the elders are another group.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But in the New Testament, these two groups are one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the believers in Christ are priests to God 1 Pet 2:5; Rev 1:6 , including the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All of the elders are priests, and Christ is the High Priest Heb 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Where is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We know that He is seated at the right hand of God in the heavens Rom 8:34 , but we must see that for God's movement among us on this earth, our High Priest, Christ, is in us 8:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All of the elders need to declare that Christ, the High Priest, is in them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have such a High Priest Heb 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The elders, who are also the priests, should be the ones who administrate the church in God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If there is a problem in the church under the administration of the elders, how shall they solve it?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Old Testament, it was necessary to study the law to find out what to do to solve the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If there is a problem in the church, we have to study our New Testament constitution.</S>
