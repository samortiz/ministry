 <h2 class="head1">THE CRUCIFIED AND RESURRECTED CHRIST BEING GOD&rsquo;S WISDOM AND GOD&rsquo;S POWER TO US</h2>
<p>Verse 22 says, &ldquo;Indeed Jews require signs and Greeks seek wisdom.&rdquo; A sign is a miraculous token given to substantiate what is preached. For Balaam&rsquo;s donkey to speak in a human language was a sign (Num. 22:28-30). In principle, all the miraculous gifts, such as speaking in tongues, are signs. The Jews continually required miraculous signs. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet. For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights&rdquo; (Matt. 12:38-40). The sign given to us today is not something miraculous; it is the crucified and resurrected Christ.</p>
<p>The Greeks, on the other hand, seek wisdom, that is, knowledge, doctrine, and teaching. First Corinthians not only speaks of spiritual gifts, but it also has a certain amount of teaching concerning marriage life, head covering, the Lord&rsquo;s table, and other matters. In principle, the expositions of the Brethren teachers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries mainly follow the Greeks to emphasize the teachings in this book, and the Pentecostal teachings mostly follow the Jews to emphasize the gifts. However, Paul says, &ldquo;We preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness&rdquo; (1:23). We do not care for signs, gifts, doctrines, or teachings. We are neither Jews nor Greeks but partakers of Christ. Moreover, to the called ones, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God (v. 24). Verse 30 says, &ldquo;Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&rdquo; Christ is everything to us. He is God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom as our righteousness for the past, our sanctification for the present, and our redemption for the future.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST REVEALED TO US BY THE DIVINE SPIRIT<br />
IN OUR HUMAN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Verses 1 and 2 of chapter 2 say, &ldquo;I, when I came to you, brothers, came not according to excellence of speech or of wisdom, announcing to you the mystery of God. For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified.&rdquo; In verse 7 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;But we speak God&rsquo;s wisdom in a mystery.&rdquo; The wisdom Paul preached is Christ as our wisdom, as mentioned in 1:30. Eye has not seen and ear has not heard the deep and hidden things pertaining to Christ as God&rsquo;s wisdom, nor have these things come up in man&rsquo;s heart, but God has prepared them for those who love Him and has revealed them by means of the two spirits, the divine Spirit and the human spirit (2:9-12). God reveals Christ to us through these two spirits. If we do not care for the two spirits, we are soulish men, men who live in the soul. God requires us to forsake our soul and turn to our spirit so that we may be spiritual men, those who live, walk, and do things in their spirit (vv. 14-15). It is in the regenerated spirit of man that God the Spirit dwells (Rom. 8:9, 11, 16).</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BECOMING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT TO BE WHAT WE NEED IN A PRACTICAL WAY</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; Without Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit, all that is taught in chapters 1 and 2 is mere doctrinal knowledge to us. To know that food is nourishing means nothing in itself. We need to apply this knowledge by eating the food. Similarly, in order for Christ to be our power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, we must see that today Christ is the life-giving Spirit. If He were not the Spirit, He could not be these things to us. He and we would be separate persons and could have nothing to do with one another in a practical way. Today Christ is the life-giving Spirit to be all the aforementioned items to us. Whenever we call on His name, the life-giving Spirit comes into us. When we need righteousness, victory, power, or light, He becomes all these things to us in a practical way. We may know that Christ is our patience and love, but this may only be a doctrine to us. We must realize that He is now the life-giving Spirit and apply Him in a practical way by calling, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Whenever a brother is bothered by his roommate, he can remind himself in a doctrinal way that Christ is his patience, but eventually his natural patience will be exhausted. This is because he has the doctrine that Christ is his patience, but he does not experience Christ as his patience. Whenever he is bothered, he should call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Then he will have not merely the doctrine but the experience of Christ as his patience.</p>
<p>Doctrine without practical application means little. We need to apply the Lord Jesus to our situation. We can realize the way to apply the Lord Jesus by considering the whole of 1 Corinthians. Chapter 1 speaks of calling on the name of the Lord, who is the portion of all the believers. We have been called into the enjoyment of Christ as our portion, and this Christ is wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption. Then chapter 2 tells us that this portion can be realized by us only in our spirit. Moreover, chapter 15 tells us that Christ as our portion is now the life-giving Spirit. If Christ were not the life-giving Spirit but were only far away in the third heaven, we could not receive Him. Today, however, our Lord Jesus is the life-giving Spirit to be real, living, near, and available to us. Therefore, whenever we call on the name of Jesus, He comes to us immediately, and we receive His person. Jesus is His name, and the life-giving Spirit is His person. Therefore, day by day we all need to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; When we call on this dear name, we receive His precious person as the life-giving Spirit. Then He becomes whatever we need. If we need righteousness, He is our righteousness. If we need sanctification, He is our sanctification. If we need submission, when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, He comes as the life-giving Spirit to be our submission.</p>
<p>Many times I become weak by the end of the afternoon, because the nourishment I received in the morning and at noontime has been exhausted. However, shortly after supper I am strengthened and invigorated again, not by the doctrine of nourishment but by my practical eating, by my taking food into me. The food we eat is our supply of energy and strength. The tragedy of today&rsquo;s Christianity is that people have many doctrinal teachings with little practical application. In His recovery, the Lord is turning us, causing us not to care for mere doctrines but simply to call on the name of the Lord Jesus, who is the life-giving Spirit. If we have a problem with someone, we should not try to apply a doctrine to our situation. This will not work. We simply need to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Then we will receive the living person of Jesus as the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit who ministers life to us.</p>
<p>We must all see that Jesus is not a mere doctrine. Jesus is real, living, near, and available. A person may be real, but if he is not living and near, he cannot come when we call him. Likewise, if he does not care for us and is not available to us, he will not come when we call. However, the Lord Jesus is not like this. On the contrary, He is real. There is nothing as real as Jesus. He is also living, and He is near, even in our mouth (Rom. 10:8). No one but Jesus can be as near as this. Moreover, He is available. Because of this, whenever we call on Him, He comes into us. Some persons have called on Jesus without a full sincerity or intention to receive Him; nevertheless, simply by calling, they were captured by Him. The Lord Jesus is always real, living, near, and available to us regardless of our sincerity in calling on Him. If someone is not a Christian, he can still come to Jesus, saying, &ldquo;Jesus, I do not believe in You, and I do not love You.&rdquo; Jesus may gradually say to such a person, &ldquo;You do not love Me, but I love you.&rdquo; We have seen some persons be saved in this way. Jesus is not a doctrine; He is a living person, the life-giving Spirit. In my early years as a believer, I received the knowledge of the Bible at the feet of the Brethren for several years, but one day I realized that I was void of life. At that time I cried out to the Lord, and by crying out in this way, I received life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING IN CHRIST BY BEING BAPTIZED IN ONE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 1:30 says, &ldquo;Of Him you are in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; When we believe in Jesus, receiving Him by calling on His name, He comes into us as the life-giving Spirit. From that time on, we cannot get away from Him, because we have been put into Him by God. To be put into Jesus is to be baptized in one Spirit. Verse 13 of chapter 12 begins, &ldquo;For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body.&rdquo; The one Spirit in chapter 12 is the life-giving Spirit in chapter 15. Some people ask, &ldquo;Have you been baptized in the Holy Spirit?&rdquo; Many Christians dare not answer positively, supposing that since they have not spoken in tongues, they have not been baptized in the Spirit. This is a wrong concept. According to 1 Corinthians 1:30, we believers are all in Christ, and according to 15:45, Christ is the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, we are in the Spirit. This indicates that we have all been baptized in the Spirit. This is truly scriptural and logical. From now on, if anyone asks if we have been baptized in the Spirit, we should say, &ldquo;I am in Christ. Therefore, I am in the life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; In Greek, <em>were all baptized</em>in 12:13 is in the aorist tense, indicating that our baptism in the Spirit has been accomplished. We have all been baptized in one Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DRINKING THE ONE SPIRIT<br />
TO BE ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>Verse 13 continues, &ldquo;And were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; We are in Christ, but now we need to take Christ into us. To be baptized is to be put into water, but to drink is to take the water into us. Many in Christianity pay attention to baptism, but they neglect drinking. Our baptism in the Spirit has been accomplished, but our drinking the Spirit is ongoing. Through baptism we have been positioned to drink the Spirit; therefore, now we need to drink all day long. Verse 3 shows the way to drink. This verse says, &ldquo;No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Whenever we say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus!&rdquo; we are in the Spirit, and we are drinking the one Spirit. By drinking the Spirit, we become one spirit with the Lord Jesus (6:17). He is the life-giving Spirit, and we have all been put into Him and have been positioned to drink of Him day by day. We are in Him, and He is in us; hence, we are one with Him. We are in the Spirit, and we are drinking the Spirit. As a result, the Spirit is in us, and we are one spirit with the Lord. In this one spirit we experience Christ as our light, life, power, holiness, sanctification, and everything. In this spirit we also have the church life. If we truly see this, we will be beside ourselves.</p>
<p>We should not count on our feelings as proof that we have been baptized in the Spirit. Our feelings can be very deceptive. After speaking for an entire chapter concerning marriage life, Paul said, &ldquo;I think that I also have the Spirit of God&rdquo; (7:40). It seems that he did not have much assurance. Someone might have said to him, &ldquo;Brother Paul, if you do not have the assurance that you have the Spirit, you should not say anything.&rdquo; Nevertheless, what he said in chapter 7 is the word of the Bible today. Because Paul was a person who lived in the mingled spirit&mdash;the human spirit mingled with the divine Spirit&mdash;whatever he said was God&rsquo;s word, even though he did not have a strong feeling about it. This illustrates that we should not care for our feelings. We must care only for the facts and the practicality. The fact is that we were all baptized into Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit. When we believed in Him and called on His name, we entered into Him, and He entered into us. Now we all need to take this fact and call on His name hour after hour. We may compare calling to breathing. We are in the air around us, but by our breathing, the air enters into us. On the one hand, we are in the air, and on the other hand, the air is in us. Eventually, we become one with the air. Likewise, our breathing the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit makes us one spirit with Him. By our breathing and drinking the one Spirit, He comes into us more and more. As a result, whatever we do and say is something of the Lord. Like Paul, we can say, &ldquo;I think that I also have the Spirit of God.&rdquo; This kind of experience is the proper Christian life that issues in the church life.</p>
