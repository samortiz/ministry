   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE CENTRAL VISION 1 GOD AS OUR CONTENTS Scripture Reading: Col 1:25-27; Rom 9:23-24; 2 Cor 4:7; Eph 3:19b; 4:6; Phil 2:14; Heb 13:20-21; 1 Tim 3:16 COMPLETING THE WORD OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Very few Christians have seen Paul s completing ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This term, the completing ministry, is based upon Colossians 1:25, where Paul says he was commissioned to complete the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To complete the word of God means to complete the revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No doubt the King James Version s rendering of complete the word of God as fulfil the word of God has somewhat obscured the real meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without Paul s writings the revelation of God is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If his fourteen Epistles, from Romans through Hebrews, were taken from the Bible, it would no doubt still be a marvelous book.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Think how wonderful Genesis is!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How great a book Exodus is!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet without Paul s Epistles we could not have had the wonderful Life-studies on Genesis and Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Though Genesis and Exodus are admirable, without Paul s writings they lack completion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE MYSTERY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Notice the two verses which follow Colossians 1:25 about the completing of the word of God: The mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations, but now has been manifested to His saints; to whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Grammatically speaking, the mystery is in apposition with to complete the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The completion of the word of God is the mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This mystery, which was hidden but is now manifested, concerns Christ in you, the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Well, you may wonder, does not Matthew tell us about Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And is Christ not the subject of the other Gospels?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Surely every book of the New Testament is about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>None of these books except Paul s, however, say that Christ is God s mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Matthew deals with the mystery of the kingdom of God, but does not present Christ as God s mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Mark and Luke make no mention of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even in John s Gospel the word mystery is not to be found.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It does occur in his Revelation, but it is not as clearly mentioned as in Paul s Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only Paul uses the word mystery for Christ and for His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE SOURCE AND ISSUE OF THIS MYSTERY</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is the source of Christ as a mystery?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is surely God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Both the Jews and the Moslems claim to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They are of a similar origin, in that their faith is based on the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Moslem Bible, the Koran, is largely an imitation of the Old Testament, with some changes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The God in whom the Jews and Moslems believe is the God of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the New Testament our God is the God in Christ and through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be a Christian is to come into Christ and through Him into God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is embodied in this Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God s entire being is embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>My body is the embodiment of me; if you want to find where I am, you will find me in this body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Similarly, our Christ is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If anyone has a God who is apart from Christ, he must be like a Jew or a Moslem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God, then, is the source of this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What is the issue of this mystery?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This mystery comes out of God and issues in the church, including all the believers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the whole universe this is the mystery!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Without such a word the Bible is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This completion of the word is this great mystery: Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These two comprise the mystery of the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They are unfolded to us in Paul s completing ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>GOD NOT ONLY THE CREATOR</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this message and in the next two we want to consider what the focus is of Paul s completing ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have elsewhere referred to Ephesians, Galatians, Philippians, and Colossians as the heart of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In these messages we shall discuss the central vision, the focal point, of Paul s completing ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have three messages on this subject because Paul s ministry has three main points: God, Christ, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This message will be concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, I would first like to comment on Christ, the subject of our second message.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The matter of the Trinity is the most puzzling in the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we want to know Christ, we must understand this puzzle.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we do not understand how God is in Christ, we know neither God nor Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we do not know how Christ is related to, even identical with, the Spirit, we do not know either Christ or the Spirit.</S>
