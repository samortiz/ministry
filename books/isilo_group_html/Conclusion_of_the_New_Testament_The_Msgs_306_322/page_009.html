<h2 class="head3">23. The Content of the Apostle&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>Christ as the content of the apostle&rsquo;s ministry is an aspect of the enjoyment of Christ as our portion. First Corinthians 2:1-5 reveals that Christ who is our portion for our enjoyment is the content of the apostle&rsquo;s ministry. The apostle&rsquo;s ministry consists of not only Christ as the mystery of God but also the crucified Jesus Christ. In the apostle&rsquo;s ministry, Christ is the mystery of God ministered to us, and Jesus Christ is the crucified One. Such a Christ is ministered not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that is, the power of God. In contrast to many so-called ministries today that scarcely know the mystery of God, the apostle&rsquo;s ministry was the New Testament ministry, a ministry that ministers the mystery of God concerning Christ and the crucified Jesus Christ. In the eyes of human beings, the crucifixion of Christ is foolishness, but in God&rsquo;s eternal economy, it is something powerful, carried out in order to fulfill God&rsquo;s mystery, His eternal purpose (Eph 3:9-11). Moreover, Paul&rsquo;s proclamation was in demonstration of the Spirit and of power. Whenever we properly minister the mystery of God concerning Christ, we will have impact. The New Testament ministry that ministers the mystery of God concerning Christ is a powerful ministry, a ministry that is demonstrated by the living Spirit and the divine power.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Mystery of God</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 2:1 Paul says, &ldquo;I, when I came to you, brothers, came not according to excellence of speech or of wisdom, announcing to you the mystery of God.&rdquo; What the apostle testified was the mystery of God, which is Christ as the embodiment of God and the church as the expression of Christ (Rom. 16:25-26; Col. 1:26-27; 2:2; 4:3; Eph. 3:4-6, 9).</p>
<p>Today many preach about Christ and testify of Him, but most of those who preach Christ do not care for the church. However, in the New Testament, the full mystery of God includes Christ and the church. Christ is the Head, and the church is the Body. Christ is the mystery of God, and the church is the mystery of Christ.</p>
<p>In Colossians 2:2 Paul speaks of &ldquo;the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.&rdquo; Christ is God&rsquo;s mystery. In Himself God is a mystery. He is real, living, and almighty; however, He is invisible. Because no one has ever seen God, He is a mystery. This mysterious God is embodied in Christ. Christ is not only God; He is also God embodied, God defined, God explained, and God expressed. Therefore, Christ is God made visible (John 14:9); Christ, God expressed, is the mystery of God.</p>
<p>As believers, we have Christ dwelling in us, but this Christ whom we have is a mystery (Col. 1:27). In Ephesians 3:4 Paul thus uses the expression <em>themystery of Christ.</em> Although Christ lives in us, worldly people do not realize that He is in us; to them, this is a mystery. But though Christ is mysterious, the church is the manifestation of Christ. As the Body of Christ, the church is the expression of Christ. When we see the church, we see Christ. When we come into the church, we come into Christ. When we contact the church, we contact Christ. The church is truly the mystery of Christ. When Paul came to Corinth, he preached concerning Christ and the church. That is, Paul presented the complete mystery of God: Christ, the Head, and the church, the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Crucified Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 2:2 Paul continues, &ldquo;I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified.&rdquo; The crucified Christ is the unique subject, the center, the content, and the substance of the apostle&rsquo;s ministry. For this he did not determine to know anything but the all-inclusive Christ, and this One crucified, when he was going to minister the word of the testimony of God to the excellent-speech-exalting and wisdom-worshipping Greeks. What a determination! It should be a pattern to us all.</p>
<p>The expression <em>this One crucified</em> speaks of the example of the Lord&rsquo;s living, action, work, and way, indicating His humiliation and abasement. In order to overturn the pride of the Greeks in their elevated wisdom, Paul did not refer here to the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection in glory (Luke 24:26) and His ascension in exaltation (Acts 2:33, 36).</p>
<p>In order to belittle their highly esteemed knowledge and point them to the crucified Christ, Paul reminded the Corinthians that the Christ he preached was One who had been crucified. He proclaimed not an honored, exalted, and glorified Christ, but a Christ who had been despised, rejected, and even crucified. This indicates that after receiving Christ, we should no longer live in a way to exalt ourselves. Rather, we should live a crucified life, even live the crucified Christ. We should be willing to give the impression that we do not know anything other than the crucified Christ. We should learn to determine not to know anything among the saints except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified. If we determine not to know anything except Christ, there will not be any problems or divisions among us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 306-322) &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
