Do you like to have someone as your counselor? To take others' counsel implies humility. A person is humble who wants to receive counsel from others. The Lord Jesus blessed Jehovah, the One who counseled Him. Isaiah 50:4 tells us the attitude of Christ as the Servant of Jehovah: "The Lord Jehovah has given me/The tongue of the instructed,/That I should know how to sustain the weary with a word./He awakens me morning by morning;/He awakens my ear/To hear as an instructed one." Christ, in His human living, had the tongue of an instructed One, and He heard as an instructed One. He took God the Father as His counselor.</P><P>Psalm 16:7b says, "Indeed in the nights My inward parts instruct Me." This shows us that when God counseled Christ as a man, Christ's inward parts instructed Him. The inward parts of Christ were one with God. God counsels, and the inward parts instruct. This is our proper experience today. On the one hand, it is God who counsels us. On the other hand, it is our inward parts which instruct us. Our inward parts instruct us mostly in the nights while we are quiet. In the night, from four to six in the morning, I receive many things and many instructions from the Lord. Most of the light I have written down in the outlines for these messages has come during these hours. This is an experience of our inward parts instructing us in the nights.</P><P>Verse 8a says, "I have set Jehovah before Me continually." According to David's natural concept, he might have said, "I have set the law before me continually." We may want to say, "I have set the Bible before me continually." But even this is not as good as saying, "I have set Jehovah, the person, before me continually."</P><P>Verse 8b says, "Because He is at My right hand, I shall not be shaken." Because the Father was at Christ's right hand, He would not be shaken. Our security is not to keep the law, but to have Jehovah, the person, at our right hand. We shall not be shaken because we have Him as our security.</P><P>Verse 9 says, "Therefore My heart rejoices and My glory exults;/Even My flesh dwells securely." Glory here refers to our spirit. This verse covers our soul, which is included in our heart; our spirit, which is the glory; and our body, which is the flesh. What is in this verse transpired in the death of Christ. When He was in Hades He said, "My heart rejoices, My spirit exults, and even My body dwells securely." His body dwelt in a secured tomb.</P><P>Verse 10 says, "For You will not abandon My soul to Sheol,/Nor let Your Holy One see the pit." Christ was not bothered to be in Hades, in Sheol. Hades is from the Greek, and Sheol is from the Hebrew. They both refer to the same thing. The Septuagint translates pit as corruption. This means that Christ's body would not see corruption. It would not be decayed. This is because within three days, His body was resurrected from the tomb, and His soul was raised up from Hades.</P><P>Verse 11 says, "You will make known to Me the path of life." The path of life is the way of resurrection. God the Father made known to Christ the way of resurrection. Verse 11 continues, "In Your presence is fullness of joy." This was in Christ's ascension. In God's presence in the heavens is fullness of joy. Finally, verse 11 says, "In Your right hand there are pleasures forever." In God's right hand in ascension, Christ is enjoying pleasures forever.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_052.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_054.html">Next</a> </body></html>
