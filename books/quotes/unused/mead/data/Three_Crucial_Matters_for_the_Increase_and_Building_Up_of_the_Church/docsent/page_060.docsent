   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING NOT TO EXPRESS OUR OPINIONS QUICKLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Everyone has an opinion, unless he is a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is impossible not to have an opinion, and opinions have their place.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are pretending when we withhold our opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, we must express our opinions appropriately and at the right time, or they will generate unnecessary problems.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is best to wait a day before we express an opinion so that we can be sure that we feel peaceful about expressing it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we do not have the peace, we should not express our opinion; rather, we should wait until we have the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When responding to mail, I often put my letter in an envelope without sealing it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes I wait two days before I mail a letter, and during the night I consider whether my wording was appropriate and my answers were proper.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a great protection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I may wait even three days before mailing certain letters.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During this time I pray and ask the Lord whether the decisions I made in the letter were correct.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not wrong for us to have opinions, but we should not be too quick to express them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is best to wait for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord s Spirit will lead us inwardly, and we may even receive a confirmation in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may feel that something is right and good, but if we are too quick to express our opinion, we may get a wrong result.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to a proverb, we should hold back half a sentence and not speak it even though what we want to say is at the tip of our tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Another proverb says, Diseases enter through the mouth, and misfortunes issue from the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Proverbs 10:19 says, When there are many words transgression does not cease, / But he who restrains his lips is prudent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not exercise restraint when expressing our opinions, we will get into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should, therefore, do our best not to speak too much, and we should not speak too quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A co-worker who does not speak is being pretentious, or he is being a politician instead of a faithful, coordinating member of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Members who coordinate faithfully must speak the truth and say what they have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, they should be careful when they express themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, if we have an opinion while we are in a meeting with others, it is best for us to express it slowly or not at all.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Most of the time we are wrong when we express our opinion quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, instead of expressing our opinion, it is best to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, if we are clear, we should speak, but we should not be abrasive in our tone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our speech should be seasoned with salt Col 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>SISTERS NEEDING TO STAND FIRMLY</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>IN THE POSITION OF A SISTER</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In their fellowship the brothers said that some sisters are too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Strong sisters are a lesson to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our way of dealing with any situation is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Genesis 45, when Joseph s brothers were returning to Jacob, Joseph charged them not to quarrel on the way v. 24 . To quarrel is to argue, and when we argue, we express our opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The best way to overcome our opinions is to refrain from speaking, no matter how strong and stubborn others may be.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The sisters may be strong when they express their opinions, but after two hours they are no longer strong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, the sisters need to remember that they are sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Bible says that the man is the head of the woman 1 Cor 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, the sisters must always remember that no matter how strong they may be physically, they are still sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, they should be gentle and exercise restraint when they speak.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead of speaking eight sentences, they should speak only five.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the sisters can also lower their tone when they speak, others will not feel that they are too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE BROTHERS TAKING THE LEAD</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>BUT NOT LORDING IT OVER OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some brothers are faithful and diligent to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes they are not polite in their dealings with those around them, because they want everything to be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This can cause them to be controlling and to rule over other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, according to the Bible, the elders should only oversee; they should not lord it over others 1 Pet 5:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, the brothers should only oversee and not rule over the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To rule over others is to lord it over them, to exercise lordship, and to enslave the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These things are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the one hand, the sisters should cover their heads; on the other hand, the brothers need to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, the brothers should lead the saints without ruling over them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Bible says that the brothers should take the lead, and the Bible also says that the sisters are weaker vessels 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The brothers must always be considerate of the sisters as weaker vessels, because they have weaknesses that the brothers do not have.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Their weaknesses are according to God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, it is good for the brothers to consider how the sisters were created when they touch any matter related to the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even though the sisters are also human beings, they are different from brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They are different in their constitution and their nature.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The brothers should not deal with the sisters as if they are dealing with brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In everything the brothers do, they must recognize that the sisters are weaker vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We can hit a board of wood many times without breaking it; however, a pane of glass will break the first time we hit it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the same way, it does not matter if a brother hits me, because I will not break.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, when we deal with a sister, we must first know her condition before speaking with her.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In conclusion, it is proper for the brothers to take the lead, but it is wrong for them to assume the headship.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is only one Head our Lord Jesus.</S>
