Only Christ can meet man&#8217;s need, for no one and nothing other than Christ can enliven us. The holy feast is empty without Christ, and the Sabbath is not a true rest apart from Christ. Furthermore, without Christ the holy city, Jerusalem, is nothing. What, then, about the pool of Bethesda? We have seen that the word Bethesda means the house of mercy and that Christ Himself is the real house of mercy. Apart from Christ, there is no house of mercy. Apart from Christ, the sick, blind, lame, and withered ones (5:3) would not be able to receive mercy. Furthermore, without Christ even John the Baptist and Moses are nothing. Even the holy Scriptures, though inspired by God, are empty apart from Christ, for without Christ there is no eternal life in the Scriptures. It is very important for us to see that without Christ everything is empty, vain.<p>In the Gospel of John there are certain basic thoughts. First, we need a new birth in order to have a new life that we may become a new man. We also need Christ as the source of life and as the means for us to worship God. Furthermore, if we do not have Christ, everything is empty. This means that if we do not have Christ, we are empty. Christ is the reality, and we need to be filled with Him. Apart from Christ, everything is empty. Only Christ is the divine reality.<h2 class=head2>Truth, the Divine Reality</h2><p>John&#8217;s Gospel and Epistles emphasize the matter of the truth. Recently I have been studying this word in John&#8217;s writings. The more I study, the more I realize how profound this is. Truth is the divine reality, the reality that came with Jesus Christ. When Jesus came, grace and truth came (John 1:17). The divine truth revealed in the Gospel of John is actually the Triune God embodied in Jesus Christ and expressed through Him.<h2 class=head1>THE POOL IN JERUSALEM AND THE SEA IN GALILEE</h2><p>Much of what is recorded in chapters one through five of the Gospel of John took place in Jerusalem. Half of chapter two and all of chapter three describe matters that took place in Jerusalem. All of chapter five records events that happened in Jerusalem. We have seen that chapter four is a record of something that occurred in Samaria. The feeding of the multitude in chapter six of John took place in Galilee. Judea signifies the religious world, and Galilee signifies the secular world. In Judea there was Jerusalem, the holy city, but in Galilee there was the sea. Between Galilee and Judea was the territory of Samaria, which was partly religious and partly secular.<p>It is significant that in chapter five we have a pool, and in chapter six we have the sea. Furthermore, the pool is in the holy city, and the sea is in the secular world. Those gathered around the pool were sick, blind, lame, and withered. But those near the sea were not in such a condition. On the contrary, they were quite active and apparently they did not need mercy. They did not need the pool of Bethesda for their healing. As we shall see, the need of the people near the sea in John 6 was related to food, not to healing.<p>In John 5 we see the sick, blind, lame, and withered lying near a pool in Jerusalem. This is a picture of the fact that those in a pitiful condition are drawn to religion. They come to the traditional &#8220;pool&#8221; of religion for healing. If you are involved with religion, therefore, that is a strong indication that you are sick, lame, blind, or withered. In other words, you are impotent. All those under the porches near the pool of Bethesda were in such a condition. Would you like to be at the pool in Jerusalem with all the impotent ones, or would you rather be with the active ones around the sea in Galilee? Of course, we would prefer not to be at the pool but at the sea.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_067.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_069.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John &nbsp; pg 68</div><br></body></html>
