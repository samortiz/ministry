   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED OF MUCH STUDY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You young brothers are in a golden time because you have many years to study these precious things if the Lord delays His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe that all this wonderful knowledge will be very useful in the millennium and in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you do not pick this knowledge up today it will be too late.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You will be the later graduates.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Ultimate Consummation of the Stones</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Again let me emphasize that we must study the consummation of all the stones in the Bible from Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Onyx is the very first stone mentioned in the Bible and one of the last stones mentioned in the Bible is jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is very interesting and needs your study.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You also must study the twelve stones on the breastplate of Urim and Thummim and the stones on the shoulders of the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By such study you will receive something.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When you present these things to the saints, even the new ones among us will enjoy hearing them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You will attract people, and the church will be built up through the saints being edified by you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then your preaching or teaching will enrich the ministry in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You do not need to go to the traditional teachings in the books on your shelves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many marvelous mines in the twenty-seven books of the New Testament have been opened up in these last ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The only problem is that we did not take the time to dig in them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not go away from these mines to other sources, hoping to get something there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You must see the ultimate consummation of all the stones.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Ultimate Consummation of the River</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then you must go on to study and see the ultimate consummation of the river with the water of life in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Genesis 2 we see a river flowing out of Eden to water the garden that parts into four heads v. 10 . In Exodus there is the flowing water out of the cleft rock.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Psalm 46 tells us that there is a river whose streams make glad the city of God v. 4 , and Psalm 36:8 tells us that the Lord will make us to drink of the river of His pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Also, in Ezekiel 47 we see a river that brings life wherever it goes v. 9 . Finally, in Revelation 22:1 we see a river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the book of Revelation there are some minor things which should not be considered as consummations of the things in the other books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But all the major things are the consummation of items already existing in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is because Revelation is a book of the harvest of all the truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is the harvest of all the seeds of the divine truth which have been sown and grown up throughout the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why in Ezekiel 47 the water is issuing out of God s house vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>1-2 , which nearly matches Revelation 22 with the water proceeding out of the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From God s temple there is water flowing and from God s throne there is water flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then in the New Testament the Lord Jesus says that if we drink of Him we will have rivers of living water flowing out of our innermost being John 7:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul also tells us that the Israelites in the wilderness drank the same spiritual drink and that they drank of Christ who was the spiritual rock which followed them 1 Cor 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Revelation chapter seven we see that the Lamb shepherds the saints and guides them to springs of waters of life v. 17 . In 21:6 it says that God will give to the thirsty one from the spring of the water of life freely.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Also, in chapter twenty-two is the ultimate calling in the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit and the Bride say that whosoever is thirsty must come to drink the water of life v. 17 . This needs much study.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the consummation of the river and of the water of life in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Ultimate Consummation of Light and Life</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We also need to study light throughout the Bible with its consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to go to all the references of light in the Old Testament and in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Genesis 1 are the fourth day lights.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Psalm 36 says, In Your light we see light v. 9 . Isaiah 2:5 says, House of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Peter tells us that we have been called out of darkness into His marvelous light 1 Pet 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even Paul was charged by the Lord to preach the gospel to open peoples eyes and to turn them from darkness to light Acts 26:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There are many references to light in the Old and New Testaments which we must study.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once you have studied light throughout the Bible, then you can see that the light in Revelation 21 is a consummation of all the light in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have also seen that the tree of life, the river of life, and the light of life are the consummation of the divine life throughout the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This also needs our study.</S>
