   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN A SIGN BEFORE THE LORD'S COMING Date: February 13, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: James 5:1-5 How shall I follow Him I serve?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How shall I copy Him I love?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nor from those blessed footsteps swerve,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Which lead me to His seat above?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Privations, sorrows, bitter scorn,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The life of toil, the mean abode,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The faithless kiss, the crown of thorn</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Are these the consecrated road?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, should my path thro' suff'ring lie,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Forbid it I should e'er repine;</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Still let me turn to Calvary,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nor heed my griefs, rememb'ring Thine.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>O let me think how Thou didst leave</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Untasted every pure delight,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To fast, to faint, to watch, to grieve,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The toilsome day, the homeless night:</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To faint, to grieve, to die for me!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thou camest, not Thyself to please;</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And, dear as earthly comforts be,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Shall I not love Thee more than these?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hymns, #462</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first stanza of the above hymn consists of a series of questions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The writer is speaking to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is fellowshipping with his own heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This musing results in his awareness of his straying away to outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word still in stanza 3 is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In stanza 1 there is a yearning for consecration; in stanza 3 the prayer is that the consecration would not change.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Consecration is not a once-for-all thing; it should be something continuous.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The writer yearns for a continual consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The emphasis in this stanza is the word still.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Stanza 4 is a reflection on the Lord's forsaking of "every pure delight."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are many delights which are not pure, but the delight that the Lord enjoyed was pure; no sin whatsoever was found in this delight.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Immediately after this the word to is used four times.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a very unusual hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the first two lines of stanza 4, the Lord leaves something behind, while in the third and fourth line, He takes something up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here we can feel that the Lord's Spirit has brought the writer to a new height.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the one side, there is the "pure delight."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the other side, there are the "toilsome day" and the "homeless night."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Stanza 4 describes the Lord's work, but this description is still somewhat objective.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Stanza 5 brings a subjective tone to the hymn: "for me!"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He came for me!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The word to appears here three times, and they are somewhat different from the previous stanza.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord not only grieved and fainted for us, but died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord's goal was to accomplish God's work of redemption for us; He did not come to please Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although "earthly comforts" are hard to give up, the Lord's love enables us to overcome them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The hymn concludes with a question.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This song describes a person who was once very prosperous and successful in the world, but who forsook everything for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can sense the height that his spirit has soared.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In 1924 I chose this hymn for the brothers and sisters to sing in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They sang well with spirit and with much feeling; their voices were loud.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>While they were singing, I was meditating on the song.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is sometimes difficult to meditate on some hymns if they are sung too loudly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some hymns which are suitable for meditation cannot be sung loudly at all.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Between 1923 and 1924, a few of us young people were zealous for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>One couple among us considered quitting their jobs to work full-time for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They felt unsure about their future.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>While they sat quietly this way, they began to sing this hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As they sang they made the decision to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This hymn has a grand feeling to it, yet it is not overbearing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some people are carried away by the grand feeling of a song, yet they do not touch the tender spirit behind the song.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When this couple sang this song, they touched the tender feeling behind it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we feel that our future is unsure, we can try to sing this song and offer ourselves once more to God.</S>
