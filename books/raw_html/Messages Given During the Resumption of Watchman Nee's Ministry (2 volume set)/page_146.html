<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Replacing but Leading</H2><P>The principle of the work is not to replace others, but to work along with three or five others. If we want to see the work in Shanghai built up, we have to put all the brothers and sisters here into function.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Humbling Oneself to Give to the Poor</H2><P>In addition, the church must pay attention to the matter of caring for the poor. No servant of God can hold back his money. Every item that was there in the early churches has to be recovered. If one item is missing, the church will suffer great loss. Caring for the poor is one item of practice in the early churches (Gal. 2:10). If we want to match God's heart, we have to be recovered in this matter. Contacting the poor always enlarges one's heart. We should do everything we can to contact the poor and to help them. A church that is separated from the poor will not be a prospering church. We have to learn to be led away to the lowly (Rom. 12:16). We have to learn to humble ourselves, as the Lord humbled Himself (Phil. 2:5-8). To give to the poor is not to perform charity toward them. It is only when a person has learned some lessons, has touched something, and has some kind of wound as a result of this touch that his help to the poor is proper. When I was living in Shanghai, one time I invited a street boy to eat dumplings with me. We must look for opportunities to contact the poor. There are always people around us who are poorer than we are. When the Lord was on earth, He never separated Himself from the poor. Many people are wrong in their dispositions; they have never been trained. We have to learn to "step down," to humble ourselves. The more people are saved among us, the more we should give away our money.</P><P>In order to do this, many saints may need to change their jobs. Some who are in business need to change their way of earning money. Some need to change the place they live. Those who are in school have to realize that even their studying has to be related to the gospel. The gospel has to be the center of everything. If it is not, whatever we do will be out of order.</P><P>The Body of Christ is a matter that demands our whole life. When you listen to a message, you may nod your head or smile. But when you put the words into practice, it will make you cry and scream. However, we must turn back to God's ordained principles before we can have His blessing.</P><P>We hope that our conference here will end in May, after which some will remain in Shanghai, while others will go to Fukien. Still later, some others may go to some other places. In the end, they should still return to Shanghai. Shanghai must be strong. If we can have a proper testimony in one place, the work in the other places will be easy. Otherwise, we will not have a model to show others.</P><P>We can make mistakes. But we do not want to make mistakes. It is not easy to make decisions before God. We really hope that the authority of the Holy Spirit can be manifested among us. In the coming days, we hope to look back to find that we have not made a mistake today. The whole work today must be carried out according to the principle of the Body. It must be carried out in coordination, and not in a scattered way.</P>
