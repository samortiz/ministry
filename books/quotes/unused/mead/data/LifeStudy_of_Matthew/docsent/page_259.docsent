   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BEARING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MAN S UNRIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Secondly, the Christ who exposed man s unrighteousness to the uttermost also bore all the unrighteousness He had exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He firstly exposed man s unrighteousness and then He bore it on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is like housecleaning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you do not clean, you may not see the dust hidden under the furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In cleaning a room the dust is firstly exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then it is swept into the dustpan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Likewise, on the day of the Passover, the Lord Jesus firstly exposed all the dust, all of man s unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then He cleaned up the dust He had exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Oh, the very presence of the Lord Jesus exposed every particle of hidden dust in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself became the dustpan, and all the dust was collected upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During the first three hours He was on the cross, the time of man s dealing with Him, all the sins, all the unrighteousness, all the universal dust, were put on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As He hung there on the cross, He was the universal dustpan into which all the dust in the universe had been gathered.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, after all man s unrighteousness had been exposed, it was borne by Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This made everything ready for the righteous God to come in to judge the unrighteous ones and all their unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without the black, the white could not be clearly manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because all the dust, all man s unrighteousness, was put on the cross, the stage was prepared for God s righteousness to be revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If there had not been so much unrighteousness, it would not have been possible for so much righteousness to be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The complete unrighteousness of mankind was heaped upon the Lord on the cross so that God s righteousness could be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The righteous God came in to exercise His righteousness by judging all this unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the reason that through Christ man s unrighteousness eventually turned into God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By this we have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ was the turning point.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man s unrighteousness turned into God s righteousness through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Firstly, Christ exposed man s unrighteousness, and then for judgment by God s righteousness He bore upon Himself all of man s unrighteousness that He had exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today are you still in man s unrighteousness, or are you now under God s righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hallelujah, we, the saved ones, are under God s righteousness!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>GOD S RIGHTEOUSNESS IN THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This matter of righteousness is a crucial aspect of the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is very basic, for it is our ground and basis for being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our salvation rests upon the solid rock of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Romans 1:16 and 17 say, For I am not ashamed of the gospel; for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one who believes, both to Jew first and to Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For the righteousness of God is revealed in it out of faith to faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because of God s righteousness, the gospel is powerful to save everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The gospel of Christ is so powerful not because of God s love nor because of God s grace, but because of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Legally speaking, both love and grace can fluctuate, but righteousness, especially God s righteousness, cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Madame Guyon once said that even if God wanted to change His mind regarding her salvation, He could not do it because He had already judged her on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through Christ our substitute, we have already been judged according to righteousness on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, God must save us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God is a just God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because He has already righteously dealt with us judicially, He is now obligated to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can boldly say to Him, God, I do not speak now of Your love or of Your grace, but of Your righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I appeal to You regarding Your righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to Your righteousness, You must save me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If You do not save me, it means that You are unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we say this to God, He will reply, I surely must save you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nothing binds God as much as His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Psalm 89:14 says, Righteousness and justice are the foundation of thy throne A.S.V. . If God s righteousness could be taken away, His throne would be cast down.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can say, Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even if God wants to change His mind, He cannot do it because He is a just God!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How meaningful this is!</S>
