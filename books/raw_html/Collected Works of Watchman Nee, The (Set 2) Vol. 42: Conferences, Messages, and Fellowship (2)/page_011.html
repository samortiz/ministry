<h2 class="head1">SEEKING FOR PRECIOUS THINGS</h2><p>Next, you must seek after precious things. If you ask questions such as who were the sons of God in Genesis 6, who was Cain's wife, or where will man go after he dies, you are treating spiritual matters as objects of curiosity. Some people are only interested in strange things. They are not interested in how Christ becomes our life or how one can overcome sin. There is no point in asking curious questions. In the past I received many such questions. I often put these letters aside and felt sorry for those who only pay attention to these strange things. On the one hand, we have to be very hungry for the spiritual things, and on the other hand, we have to be delivered from all curiosity. We have to seek after things that are spiritually precious. If we are as indifferent toward God as we are today, we will be useless in His eyes.</p><h2 class="head1">A PATTERN</h2><p>A few months before Miss Barber died, I went to see her and spoke with her for a long time. I wondered why this sister had such profound spiritual experiences. I wanted to know the reason for this. I asked her why the Lord had been so gracious to her. She answered, "I do not know. I only know that I have always been hungry and I have always been eating. Since I was nine, I have always been hungry; I have never been content before the Lord for these many years. I might have received grace and revelation yesterday, but today I say to God, `You have more, and I want more. I want more all the time.' I am forever hungry and yet at the same time forever satisfied." Her spiritual attainment was so deep that few have even scratched the surface of it.</p><p>Last year I met a sister in her thirties. She was an ordinary woman, but her experience in the Lord was not ordinary at all. Her experience was something that others do not have. She told me that once she was bitter against a person; she prayed and prayed to the Lord until the bitterness went away from her. Yet after her bitterness was gone, she realized that there is a difference between not being bitter and positively loving someone. She felt that she could not love the other person yet, and she continued to pray. We often become satisfied as soon as we receive something. But this sister said, "Lord, what You have prepared for me in Your gospel is not this small. I want everything. I want all the provisions that are there in the gospel." This kind of "covetousness" for Christ or "jealousy" as described by Paul in 2 Corinthians 11 will bring satisfaction to a person. Some people are good at preaching the gospel and saving men. The Lord answers their prayers all the time. They also have good dispositions. Others may be exactly the opposite&mdash;they see all the virtues in others, but have none of them in themselves. Yet they are not desperate enough or concerned enough. Such ones will never make any progress. Spiritual stagnation is the result of indifference to one's own spiritual lack.</p><p>Many brothers and sisters know about a couple who have rendered me much help in the past. I consider this couple to be forever hungry. I have known them for a long time. They have made much progress. When I met them the year before last, they were still very unclear about many things. (I do not mean that they were evil; I mean that they were spiritually unclear.) Today they are still asking, seeking, wanting, and searching from place to place. Some brothers and sisters have criticized them for traveling so much, saying, "If you have Christ you have everything already." It is true that when we have Christ we have everything. However, there is an experiential side of having Christ as everything. For example, we can study geography and know the names of all the cities. We can know the locations of Kuling and Tsingtao, but we must personally visit Kuling and Tsingtao before we will know what these cities are like. While it is true that we have everything in Christ, we must also seek to have these things in our experience. I often pray to be as hungry as that couple. Before God we are beggars. Lazarus was a beggar all his life until he went to Abraham's bosom. In this respect we should never change our profession.</p><p>Our prayer should have the capacity of George MÃ¼ller. We should be like Charles Finney in the way we save men. We should never be satisfied with what we have. The Bible says that we should open our mouth wide, and God will fill it (Psa. 81:10). We must open our mouth wide before God will fill us abundantly. Some have opened their mouths, but they are not opened wide enough. We must open our mouth wide before God will fill it. God is waiting for us to open our mouth. Whenever we seek after Him in a hungry way, He will answer us immediately. If we are hungry, the filling of the Holy Spirit will come.</p>
