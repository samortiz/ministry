   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LIVING ORGANS TO SPEAK CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God created wonderful living organs for us to speak to dispense God as life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God created us with vocal chords, a tongue, lips, and teeth that we may be filled with Christ who is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we are filled with Christ as the Word of God, we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We speak Christ in a language such as Chinese, English, Greek, or Hebrew, not in nonsensical utterances.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We speak Christ in our mother tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We speak Christ in our borrowed tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the denotations of our speaking concentrate on one Person, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not use our God-created organs to speak nonsensical speech such as foolish talking, coarse jesting, and foul abusive language Eph 5:4; Col 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ephesians 4:29 says, "Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for needful building up, that it may give grace to those who hear.''</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should use our speaking ability to speak the words of Christ to minister life to people that they may be built up into the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>SPEAKING FOR THE DISPENSING OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For you to be filled in spirit with the Word is not only for your nourishment, it is for you to dispense.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is for you to generate.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every human being is made by God to propagate, to generate.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, everybody has to bring forth children!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now we all have to learn how to generate, how to dispense, how to impart into others what we have received into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is to reproduce, this is to generate, this is to bring forth new Christians by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, speaking is generating, speaking is imparting, speaking is dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>SPEAKING IN THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 1 Corinthians chapter twelve, Paul refers to the matter of speaking in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verse 2 he reminds the Corinthians, "You know that when you were of the nations, you were led away to dumb idols, however you were led.''</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The worship of dumb idols had made them a dumb people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because the object of their worship was a dumb idol, their worshipping made them a dumb people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But now the Corinthian brothers were different.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They were not worshipping the dumb idols any more.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They were worshipping the living God, who is the speaking God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This speaking God is just the speaking Spirit, who is the Spirit of God, who is also the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, in verse 3 Paul says, "No one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.''</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because of our background, the tradition of Christianity, and our old habits, we do not speak for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may speak many other things, but we do not have the habit of speaking the word of Christ in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are all like the dumb idols who have mouths but cannot speak.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need a break-through.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to repent to the Lord, exercise our spirit, and boldly speak forth the word of Christ we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the way to be in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because He is living and speaking, whenever we speak His word, His Spirit fills us within Eph 5:18-19 , and we are in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Inward filling is essential for life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Being in the Holy Spirit implies that we are clothed economically with the Holy Spirit of power for God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, when we speak the word of Christ, we have the authority and power to overcome the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>V. SPEAKING BY THE SPIRIT OF FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Second Corinthians 4:13 says, "Having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, therefore I spoke; we also believe, therefore also we speak.''</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Speaking by the spirit of faith in our practical life is a great, crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This very particular expression is used only once in the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The spirit of faith is a mingling of the Holy Spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The phrase "spirit of faith'' places the spirit in apposition to faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Faith is of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, the spirit of faith is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our faith is just the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, faith comes from hearing and hearing comes from the preaching of the Word Rom 10:14, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is why we must get into the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more we get into the Word, the more we will have faith, and this faith is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now by such a spirit you may speak the Word which is the source of your faith.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Here is a cycle.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Word produces faith, faith is the spirit, and by this spirit you speak the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Your speaking will become the source of faith in others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The faith in them then becomes the spirit by which they speak.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As we are speaking to our friends, we must exercise our spirit of faith to impart faith, which is the spirit, which is life imparted into our friends.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They may not have faith in the beginning of the conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But by hearing the word of Christ from your wonderful mouth, faith is generated in them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Romans chapter ten tells us that this kind of speaking puts the word of faith into your friends' mouths and hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, we do not have to worry about whether our friends believe or not.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We speak by the spirit of faith to impart the believing ability, faith, into them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Their response to our speaking in the spirit of faith is their faith Their salvation does not depend on them, but it depends on our speaking.</S>
