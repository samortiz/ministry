   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Fellowship between East and West</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Causing the Lord s Body to Be Living</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The brothers in the West thought that I, as a well-known evangelist, had friends all over the world, and therefore that I must have been receiving financial support.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the same time, the brothers in Taiwan considered the United States as a land of gold, and since I was there, there was no need for them to support me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the beginning of 1965 I asked a brother who was an accountant to file my 1964 income tax return.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is difficult to imagine that, under his investigation, the offerings that I had received from the church in Los Angeles that year were less than eight hundred U.S. dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This amount was just enough to cover one month s living expenses.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Perhaps you would ask what I lived on for the remaining eleven months.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Of course, I did not steal or rob; I just lived.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I did not starve; rather, I ate well.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now, in the hand of this ministry there are two large ministry stations, one in Anaheim, California and the other in Irving, Texas.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The property value of each is approximately four to five million dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is all the Lord s doing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I would like to take this opportunity to give a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because the truth I brought to the United States was fresh and new, some became jealous, saying, Can anything good come out of Nazareth?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the past, American missionaries went to China to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet today, an old Chinese is here to teach us Americans.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I began the Lord s work in America at the end of 1962.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was a good start.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The local churches were flourishing, and I was invited to speak in one place after another.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Wherever I went I was told the same thing: Brother Lee, in the past it was the Americans who went to China.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today, it is the Chinese who come here to America.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I said, Isn t that proper?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Isn t that the case with the circulation of the blood in the body?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It flows from the left side to the right side and from the right to the left; from the top to the bottom and vice versa.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the past the Lord flowed from the West to the East; today, why should He not flow back from the East to the West?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Without circulation, the body becomes dead; with circulation, the body becomes living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At a conference in December 1962 I spoke from Deuteronomy 8:7-9 concerning the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once these messages were released, the eyes of the Americans were opened.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They invited me from all over.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I went from the East Coast to the West Coast, from the South to the North.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through this the Lord gained a group of people who truly loved Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE NEED TO BECOME FAMILIAR</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>WITH THE HYMNS AND THE TRUTHS,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>AND THE NEED TO HAVE SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This evening I purposely set up this meeting as a pattern so that you might see that a meeting does not need to be conducted in a formal way and that it does not need to have a sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I feel that this meeting tonight is quite sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the beginning of the meeting we sang three hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then I mentioned that the denominations invited me for dinner and that I challenged them concerning the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have the boldness and perseverance because what I preach is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I proclaimed the truth all over China as well as in the United States, and I desire to proclaim it all over the world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This truth cannot be put down.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then at the end of the meeting I gave a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What do you think about such a meeting with hymns, truth, and testimonies?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do you think it is good or not?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you desire to have such a meeting, you need to have some capital.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Suppose those three hymns were never written; or suppose that they were written, but that you do not know how to sing them, or that you can sing them, yet you do not have the understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If this were the case, there would not be any response within you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then I used a kindergarten teaching method to give a message concerning the truth of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This kind of speaking seems quite shallow, but to speak in this way is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Finally, I gave a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I want you to see that to have a meeting requires capital.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>First, you need to be familiar with the hymns; second, you need to be equipped with the truth; and third, you need to have spiritual experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Having these three things, you may use them in whatever way you like.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A meeting with hymns, truth, and testimonies will surely be living, fresh, and rich.</S>
