<P>Prayer: Lord, we thank You that You are both the Word and the Spirit. The Word which is so solid and which is in our hand is touchable, understandable. But we need Your Spirit to give us the wisdom and revelation that we may see the intrinsic contents of Your Word and that we may understand to interpret the divine revelation according to Your desire in Your economy. Lord, this is what we need, not only now but also for our whole life in dealing with You as the Word and the Spirit. Lord, meet our need again and again from now until we see You.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE INTRINSIC CONTENTS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</H2><P>In my heart I have a burden to tell you the intrinsic contents of the New Testament. In order to see these intrinsic contents, we need to be unveiled again and again. Layers and layers of veils need to be taken away from us. The New Testament presents to us four acts of God and three products of these four acts. These three products issue in one ultimate goal and consummation. The four acts of God are His incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection. The three products are the firstborn Son of God, the many sons of God, and the life-giving Spirit. The unique, ultimate consummation is the New Jerusalem. We need to see these four acts, three products, and one goal.</P><P>The outline of chapter one shows us the intrinsic contents of the four acts of God&#151;the incarnation, death, human living, and resurrection of Christ. The act of God in resurrection produced three great items. Before the resurrection, there was no firstborn Son of God (Acts 13:33). He was produced in God's action in resurrection. Also, before the resurrection, there were no men becoming sons of God in this universe. But we were all produced as the sons of God in His act in resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3). John 7:39 says that "the Spirit was not yet" before Jesus was glorified in His resurrection. First Corinthians 15:45b reveals that in resurrection, the last Adam, Christ, became a life-giving Spirit.</P><P>This life-giving Spirit is "the Spirit" in John 7:39. The life-giving Spirit, even at the Lord Jesus' time on earth, was still "not yet." Then Christ became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, and this life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. Before the resurrection there was not such a God; in other words, before the resurrection the Triune God had not yet been processed and consummated. Before the resurrection of Christ, God was eternal, triune, self-existing, ever-existing, and divine, but He had only one element, the element of divinity. He did not have the elements of humanity, incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection. Christ was the last Adam, the last man. The last Adam became the life-giving Spirit, and this last Adam was the embodiment of the Triune God. So the embodiment of the Triune God became the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, the life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.</P><P>Before the resurrection of Christ, there was not the firstborn Son of God. Before the resurrection of Christ, there were not the many sons of God who were men regenerated to be God's sons. Before the resurrection of Christ, there was not the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. All these items of the high peak of the divine revelation are in the holy Scriptures. I am not speaking of something in the ethical or philosophical realm. I am teaching something from the intrinsic contents of the holy Word, the Word of God, which we all love.</P><P>The firstborn Son, the many sons of God, and the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God issue in one thing. That is the unique closing of the entire Bible, the New Jerusalem. It is superstitious to say that the New Jerusalem is a heavenly mansion. It is not even logical to say that the Bible tells us that our God in His economy, His oikonomia, produced a heavenly mansion as the goal of His purpose. If we could enter such a heavenly mansion, what would we do there? This is a nonsensical teaching. The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the processed and consummated God with Himself as the firstborn Son and with the many chosen ones as His many sons. These are the intrinsic contents of the New Testament.</P>
