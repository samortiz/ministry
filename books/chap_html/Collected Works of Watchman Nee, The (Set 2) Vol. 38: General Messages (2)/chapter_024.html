<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">MEASURE AND FLOW</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 7:37-38; Ezek. 47:1-10, 12</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>In the Bible water is a very important matter and has a great significance. In Genesis 2, after creating man, God put him in the garden of Eden, which was watered by a river. In this chapter we see water, and as we read further, the Bible often mentions water or a river. According to Psalm 36:8, God's people "are saturated with the fatness of Your house,/And You cause them to drink of the river of Your pleasures." The prophets frequently referred to water; Ezekiel 47 vividly depicts water flowing out and becoming a river. In the Gospels, especially the Gospel of John which deals with life, the Lord Jesus referred to water many times. He said, "Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life" (4:14). He also said, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" (7:37-38). The last chapter of the Bible, Revelation 22, indicates that there is a pure river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the New Jerusalem (v. 1). In these passages, the Bible uses water as a symbol of the life of God. When we receive the life of the Lord, it enters into us and becomes as if it were a spring of water connected to our being. Once we receive the life of the Lord, we are joined to the fountain of life. According to John 7:37-38, when the water comes into us, it becomes rivers of living water flowing out from us. Now we need to consider the following question: How can the life within us flow out like a river of living water?</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>The word flow is in John 7, and the synonyms issued or ran out are in Ezekiel 47. Both John and Ezekiel said that the water would become a river. If we compare Ezekiel's word with John's, we will see how the water flowed out. It flowed out by measuring. In Ezekiel we see that after measuring, the waters came to the ankles; after measuring again, they came to the knees; after measuring once again, they came to the loins; after measuring the fourth time, they became waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over. From this we should notice one thing. In order for the water in John 7 to flow out like a river, there must be the measuring spoken of in Ezekiel 47. By putting the two passages together we can see that the secret for the living water to flow out is measuring.</p><p>What is the meaning of measuring? According to Ezekiel, it means the separation of the holy from the common. The man whom Ezekiel saw in the vision measured several times. Ezekiel 42:20 says, "He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place." The measuring in this verse discriminates between the sanctified and the profane; it separates the sanctified from the profane. After measuring a piece of land, it is regarded as a sanctified, no longer profane, place and it is consecrated to God. God wants us to be consecrated to Him. This is why He measures us. Any part in us that is measured is no longer profane; it is sanctified. What was once worldly becomes godly after it is measured.</p><p>While communing with God, Ezekiel saw the measurer in a vision. His appearance was like the appearance of brass (Ezek. 40:1-3). When the Bible speaks of man meeting God or His angel, it often mentions the appearance. For instance, Revelation 4 says that John saw God sitting on the throne and that He looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. The measurer whom Ezekiel saw had the appearance of brass. The significance of brass in the Bible is judgment. The altar, which was made of brass, represented judgment. The bronze serpent prefigured the Lord Jesus undergoing judgment on the cross on behalf of man. The measurer had the appearance of brass; this signifies that he was a judge. At the time of measuring, there is separation as well as judgment. There must be a definite standard, or a definite scale, in order to measure. Sloppy people cannot measure; neither can those who are unable to differentiate between good and evil. Likewise, those who are ignorant of the measuring scale cannot measure. When we are in fellowship with God and are enlightened by Him, we will come face to face with the measurer. When God measures us, light shines on the areas where we have fallen short of His standard or His delight. This is God's judgment.</p>
