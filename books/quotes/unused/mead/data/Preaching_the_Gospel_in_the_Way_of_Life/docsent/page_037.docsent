   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL BEING THE EXPERIENCE AND MAGNIFYING OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Philippians tells us the secret of experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the book of Romans there are the two Corinthians, and after these are four short books: Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These four short books are the deepest books.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's central thought, eternal purpose, and economy are revealed in them more than in all the rest of the sixty-six books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Colossians tells us who Christ is and how much Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to know who Christ is, you have to study Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In relation to God, Christ is the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In relation to creation, He is many items.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In relation to the new creation, He is all the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ is so much; He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is life to us, our hope for the future, and all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Galatians tells us that this all-inclusive Christ must be experienced by us not merely outwardly but inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is revealed in us, Christ lives in us, and Christ has to be formed in us 1:16; 2:20; 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then in Philippians, Paul tells us the secret of how to experience this all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Finally, Ephesians speaks of the Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Body comes into existence from Christ and by Christ as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This can be possible only through our inward experience of Christ according to the secret of experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The book of Philippians is the unique book that tells us how to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The experience of Christ is for the preaching of the gospel, and the preaching of the gospel is the very experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, the preaching of the gospel is the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we express Christ, when we live out Christ, and when Christ is expressed through us, there is the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Consider the branches of a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The bearing of fruit by the branches is the branches' experience of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the branches experience the life of the tree, the bearing of fruit eventually comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Bearing fruit is the outworking of the inner experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A branch cannot experience the life of the tree without bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more the branches properly experience the life of the tree, the more fruit they will bear.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the same way, the preaching of the gospel is the outworking of Christ experienced by us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we experience Christ, there is the outworking of this life, that is, the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul and Silas were put into prison in Philippi Acts 16:23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The magistrates charged the jailer to keep them securely, so he put them into the inner prison and secured their feet in the stocks.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At that time Paul and Silas did not preach.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They were simply filled with Christ and filled with the Spirit, and at midnight they sang hymns of praise to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That was not merely preaching in word; that was the expression of Christ, the outward expression of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That was a strong example of the genuine preaching of the gospel, and the jailer, the keeper of the prison, was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we put that story together with the writing of the book of Philippians, we can realize what the proper preaching of the gospel is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The proper preaching of the gospel is the very expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Suppose, on the other hand, that these two apostles had merely realized that their responsibility was to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They might have tried to do it with a long face, saying, "We preach that Christ is the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You have to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you do not believe in Him, you will go to Hell."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This kind of preaching would not have been prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, these two apostles did not do this kind of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They were simply experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They were filled with Christ, so they were full of joy and singing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This kind of singing is simply the overflow of the indwelling Christ, that is, the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At that time God shook the prison, and the jailer was also shaken and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" v. 30 . Then he and his whole household were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That was the genuine preaching and the real experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Philippians 1:19 contains the secret to experiencing Christ the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is not only the Spirit of God but the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and with this Spirit there is the bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These two apostles, Paul and Silas, lived in this Spirit and received the supply from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, regardless of what kind of situation, in life or in death, even in suffering and in prison, they magnified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To preach the gospel is to magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As we have seen, it is a matter of the Body, but it also depends on the magnifying of the Lord in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Wherever we are, in school or at the store, among neighbors or among relatives, there must be the magnifying of Christ in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We cannot preach the gospel only by our word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to preach the gospel by magnifying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to experience Christ within and learn the secret of how to experience Christ; then we will have an overflow of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This overflowing is the real preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This will minister Christ to others.</S>
