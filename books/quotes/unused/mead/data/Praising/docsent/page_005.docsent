   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. PRAISING BEFORE UNDERSTANDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Finally, in Psalm 50:23 God says, "Whoever offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies Me."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here, the word thanksgiving can also be translated as praise.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord is waiting for our praises.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nothing can glorify our God as praises can.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One day, all the prayers, works, prophesying, and labor will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But on that day our praises will be more than today's. Praise will last for eternity; it will never cease.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we reach heaven and arrive at our final home, our praises will swell even higher.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today we have the opportunity to learn the best lesson; we can learn to praise God even today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today is still the time when we see in a mirror obscurely 1 Cor 13:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although we can see a little of many things, we cannot understand the meaning behind them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can only feel the pain of all the inward wounds and outward trials that we have encountered and experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We cannot comprehend the significance behind them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why we do not praise.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We believe that praises will abound in heaven because there will be full knowledge in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fuller the knowledge, the fuller the praise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everything will be clear when we go before the Lord on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The things that are unclear to us today will be clear to us on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On that day we will see the Lord's excellent will in every step of the Spirit's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Had there been no discipline of the Spirit, we cannot imagine how much we would have fallen!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If some of our footsteps had not been stopped by the Holy Spirit, we cannot imagine how pitiful our fall would have been!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many things, thousands and even millions of things which we do not see today, will become clear to us on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we see everything on that day, we will bow our head and praise Him, saying, "Lord, You were never wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every step of the Spirit's discipline is God's work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Had we not become sick that one time, what would have become of us?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Had we not failed that one time, what would have become of us?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What we faced may have been a problem, but through facing that problem we may have avoided greater problems.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What we encountered may have been a misfortune, but through that encounter we may have avoided greater misfortunes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On that day we will see why the Lord allowed all these things to happen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today the Lord is leading us on, every step of the way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On that day we will bow our heads and say, "Lord, I was a fool, because I did not praise You that day.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I was a fool, because I did not give thanks to You that day."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When our eyes are opened and we become clear on that day, how very shameful we will be when we recall our murmurings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, today we must learn to say, "Lord, I cannot understand what You are doing, but I know that You cannot be wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to learn to believe and to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do, we will say on that day, "Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I thank You for Your grace which saved me from unnecessary complaints and murmurings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I thank You for the grace which kept me from murmuring during those days."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For many things, the more knowledge we have, the greater will our praises be.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have a desire to praise the Lord because He is good Psa 25:8; 100:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to always say, "The Lord is good."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today we have to learn to believe that the Lord is good and that He is never wrong, even though we cannot always understand what He is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we believe, we will praise.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our praises are His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To praise is to glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God is worthy of all glory.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>May God gain abundant praises from His children.</S>
