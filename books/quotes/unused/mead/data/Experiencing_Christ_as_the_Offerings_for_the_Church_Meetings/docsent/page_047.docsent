   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AS THE SIN OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first case concerning the offerings in the Gospel of John is the case of Nicodemus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nicodemus was a proper gentleman, full of qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was old with a high position as a ruler and teacher of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was also a Pharisee.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He came to the Lord Jesus not realizing that he had been bitten by the poisonous serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He never realized that he himself was a little serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Outside he was a gentleman and perfect, but inside he had a serpentine nature, so the Lord Jesus told him that he needed to be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because he didn t understand rightly, the Lord Jesus explained to him that to be born again is to be born of the water and of the Spirit John 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually he understood so he asked how this could be.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus then referred him to the story of the brass serpent in Numbers 21.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The children of Israel had been bitten by the serpents and were dying.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then God designed a way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He told Moses to lift a brass serpent up on a pole and whosoever would look upon that brass serpent would live.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This word should have indicated to Nicodemus that he was a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He had been bitten by the old serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Satan had bitten his forefather Adam, and he was born of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was to help Nicodemus realize that he was a bonafide and typical sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So he needed the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ knew no sin, but He was made sin for us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He came in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was not a serpent, but He took the form of a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He didn t have the nature or the poison, but He had the form of a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not just a matter of washing away your sinful doings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This also is a matter of regenerating you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The problem is not mainly the outside wrongdoing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The main problem is the inside sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Inside you are a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You need another life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You need to have another person, another nature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The only way to have another life is by Jesus Christ who died on the cross in the form of a serpent to terminate your serpentine being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you believe into Him you receive the eternal life, the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you receive this life of God you will have another life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You will have another birth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You will be born of the life of God to be another person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You will be a re-born person, a new person with a new nature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is Christ as the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>CHRIST AS THE TRESPASS OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Following chapter three of John there is another case, that of the Samaritan woman.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This person was not moral; she was immoral.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord Jesus did not talk to her about the brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She pretended to be very religious, although she was altogether immoral.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>She talked with the Lord Jesus about worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How good this seems to be!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What a wonderful subject.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the Lord Jesus knew her story, and He had a way to attract her and to cause her to desire the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once she thirsted for the living water, the Lord asked for her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then she lied by telling the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>She said, I don t have a husband John 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This sounds very good.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord agreed with her that she did not have a husband, but He said that she had had five already and that the one she had now was not hers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This was the Lord s confession of her sins, her trespasses.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By changing from one husband to another she was living a life full of trespasses.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>So the Lord presented Himself to her as the trespass offering, while He presented Himself to Nicodemus as the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No doubt in these two chapters you have these two basic offerings the sin offering and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You have to realize that we all are Nicodemus inwardly; and we all are the Samaritan woman outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Outwardly everything seems good, but inwardly we are sin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>So we all are Nicodemus, needing Christ to be our sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We also are the Samaritan woman needing Christ to be our trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He is both the sin offering and the trespass offering to us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He has been given, and He has been offered on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We can surely lay our hands upon Him, taking Him as our sin offering and as our trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What a grace this is!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Grace is not merely an unmerited favor.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>That is too vague.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The real grace is very solid.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Grace is Christ as all our offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>CHRIST AS THE BURNT OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the initial cases in the Gospel of John, such as the case of Nicodemus and the case of the Samaritan woman, you have the sin offering and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the following cases you have the burnt offering and the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The main and striking characteristic of the burnt offering is the matter of absoluteness.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The burnt offering was absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The whole offering was burnt unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Nothing was left for man.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The entire burnt offering was burnt for God s food and for God s enjoyment and for God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>That is a full portrait of Christ s absoluteness.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Christ was not only for man; Christ was absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In John 7:16-18, you could see the absoluteness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Christ was so absolute for God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He was for nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He did not care for what His flesh brothers thought.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He didn t care for His own name or His own will.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He only cared for God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>These verses show us that Christ is not only the sin offering and the trespass offering, but also the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He is not only the sin offering for sinners and the trespass offering for trespassers, but He is also the burnt offering for God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He is not only for Nicodemus or only for the Samaritan woman; He is also for God absolutely.</S>
