   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This proves that the three parts of our fallen being body, soul, and spirit are all involved with the corrupted, evil flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, in order to deal with the flesh, we have to deal with the lustful body, the corrupted soul, and the deadened spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to deal with the flesh by the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</S>
