   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In this message I would like to present an extract of the basic divine revelation in the Holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The seven points of this extract may be regarded as an extract of our theology.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you study all these points, you will see that the theology in the Lord's recovery is much different from all the theologies in today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. TO KNOW THE PROCESSED</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, we need to know the processed and consummated Triune God Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. Incarnated to Be the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Triune God was incarnated to be the flesh John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through incarnation He became the first God-man, the Lord Jesus, and as such He expressed God in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>B. Anointed to Be the Christ</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God was incarnated to be a God-man, and this God-man was anointed to be the Christ, the anointed One of God, to accomplish God's plan in His eternal economy Luke 4:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually, it was God Himself who came to accomplish what He had planned in eternity according to His eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>C. Consummated to Be the Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Triune God has been consummated to be the life-giving Spirit to apply what Christ has accomplished 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God the Father planned; God the Son accomplished what God the Father planned; and God the Spirit applies what God the Son has accomplished according to God the Father's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>TO KNOW THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Next we need to know the all-inclusive Christ in many different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A. The Mystery of God</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to know the all-inclusive Christ as the mystery of God to be the reality of the Triune God Col 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is both the mystery of God and the reality of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Embodied in Christ is all that God is and has.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All that God intends to do is related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do not know this Christ, we do not know God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may say that Christ is the key that opens up the way into God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we have Christ, God is open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through Him we know God and even are brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Colossians 2:2 Paul speaks of "the mystery of God, Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The fact that Christ is the mystery of God indicates that He is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the contrary, He is immeasurable and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be sure, God is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is unlimited, infinite, eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How, then, could Christ, the mystery of God, be simple?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the mystery of God, Christ is the immeasurable, infinite, and eternal God.</S>
