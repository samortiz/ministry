   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. Jehovah Whistling for Them</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Gathering Them</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 8 through 12 reveal further aspects of the Lord's loving visitation to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 8 says, "I will whistle for them and gather them, for I have redeemed them; / And they will multiply as they have multiplied."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord's whistling is not shrill but mild and gentle, somewhat like the singing of a bird.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Often during our time of morning revival, the Lord whistles to us, calling us and gathering us to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verses 9 and 10 continue, "I will sow them among the peoples; and in distant lands they will remember Me; / And they will live with their children and return.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>/ I will also bring them back from the land of Egypt / And gather them out of Assyria; / And to the land of Gilead and Lebanon I will bring them; / And there will not be enough room found for them."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord's people will surely multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I believe that we will see many new ones in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That will be the real multiplication in the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 11 goes on to say, "He will pass through the sea of distress / And strike the waves in the sea, / And all the depths of the Nile will dry up; / And the pride of Assyria will be brought down."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The sea mentioned here is the Red Sea which, along with the Nile, protects Egypt and keeps it separate.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, God will strike the waves in the Red Sea and dry up the Nile.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 12 concludes, "I will strengthen them in Jehovah, / And they will walk about in His name, / Declares Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The I here is Jehovah, indicating that Jehovah will strengthen His people in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They will then walk about in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be in someone's name is to be one with the person who is the reality of that name.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be in God's name is to be one with God in our daily walk, living, walking, and having our being in God's name.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All of chapter ten talks about God's loving visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to realize and remember that this visitation is actually Christ's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I can testify from my experience that when we enjoy the Lord's loving visitation, our situation is exactly like that of God's people described in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Often after we enjoy such a loving visitation, our situation changes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In His visitation He encourages us to seek more blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are little lambs, but after His loving visitation, we become horses.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are not that bold or strong, but after the Lord's visitation with His dear touch, we are strengthened to become horses of majesty in battle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually, the Lord strengthens us in Himself so that we may walk about in His name.</S>
