   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR TWO LIVES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The mystery of the Christian life is related to the fact that both Christ and we have two lives, the divine life and the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ was God, but one day He became man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As God, He had the divine life; as man, He had the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, Jesus was the God-man, a Person with both the divine life and the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Was God's intention that Christ live out the human life or the divine life?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The answer is that God intended Christ to live out the divine life in His human life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It will help us to understand this if we ask another question: Did God intend Christ to express His humanity or His divinity?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The answer to this question is that God wanted Christ to express divinity in His humanity by means of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God can only be expressed by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, a cat cannot express a bird, for a bird can only be expressed by the life of a bird.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In like manner, the human life cannot express God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To expect God to be expressed by the human life is like expecting a bird to be expressed by a cat.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A cat cannot possibly express a bird because it does not have the life of a bird.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Likewise, a man cannot express God if he does not have God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's intention was that Christ would express Him by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, God wants to have Himself expressed in man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If God is expressed only in Himself, He will not be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He loves man and wants to be expressed in man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once again, let us use the relationship between a husband and his wife as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every husband wants to be expressed, not in himself, but in his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, the secret of being a good wife is for the wife to be the expression of her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, I enjoy eating Mandarin dumplings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, I do not like to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead, I prefer that my wife say it for me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates I desire to be expressed by my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If she does not express me, I am disappointed and displeased.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Just as a husband wants himself expressed, not in himself, but in his wife, so God desires to have Himself expressed, not in Himself, but in man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is not my concept; it is the concept of the Bible, wherein the relationship between God and man is likened to that between a husband and wife.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A wife needs to learn one secret: to know what is in the heart of her husband and express it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If your husband likes to eat Mandarin dumplings, do not simply tell others that he likes to eat them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, you should say, "We like to eat Mandarin dumplings."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This will be most pleasing to your husband.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whenever my wife says this, my heart leaps for joy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This shows how much I desire to be expressed through her.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In like manner, God wants to express Himself in man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For the expression of God in man, two lives are needed, one life to express Him and another life to be the channel for this expression.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that one life is needed to express God and another to be the channel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When some hear this, they may say, "This is not logical, for to express is to be the channel, and to be the channel is to express."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nevertheless, there is a difference here.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is impossible for man's life to express God, just as it is impossible for the life of a cat to express a bird.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only the divine life, God's life, can express God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nevertheless, God desires that this expression be in man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although the human life cannot express God, the human life is needed for the accomplishment of this expression.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As we have pointed out, the Lord Jesus had two lives, the divine life and the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The divine life expressed God, and the human life accomplished the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have seen that only the divine life is able to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have also seen that God does not want Himself expressed in Himself, but in man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, everyone could see that He was a man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But very few realized that God was concealed within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God did not want Jesus to express Himself; He wanted Him to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, in order for Jesus to express God, He had to deny His human life by constantly putting it to death under the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In other words, He had to live a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although He was always being crucified, nevertheless He lived, yet not He, but God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As Jesus lived the crucified life, this crucified life gave the opportunity for the divine life to be lived out for the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The power of Christ's resurrection needed the death that killed His natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord Jesus had to place His natural life under death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When this took place, there was the opportunity for the divine life to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In this we see the power of Christ's resurrection.</S>
