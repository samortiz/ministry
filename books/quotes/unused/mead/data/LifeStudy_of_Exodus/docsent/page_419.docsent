   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not for Saul</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because David was a godly person, the Lord answered him through the Urim and the Thummim.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>King Saul, however, was not godly, and he could not receive any answers through the Urim and the Thummim.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, the Urim and the Thummim worked for David, but not for Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>David was a godly one, but Saul was not godly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In fact, the time came when God would no longer have anything to do with him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Samuel 28:6 says, And when Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This verse clearly indicates that the Urim and the Thummim were not available to Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First Samuel 28:6 gives three ways for God to reveal matters: dreams, the Urim, and prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Which of these ways do you prefer?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I do not prefer the way of dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I would rather have God speak something to me directly instead of through a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I know from experience, however, that some dreams are of God and that He does reveal certain matters through dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you prefer to have God speak to you through a prophet?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The reason the prophets were raised up is that the priests and the kings failed God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because God had no way to go on with the priests and the kings, the prophets were raised up by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the reason in the Old Testament we have first the priests, then the kings, and then the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, some Christians like to hear someone speak in the way of the Old Testament prophets and declare, Thus saith the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you enjoy this kind of speaking and prefer God s speaking through the prophets, this may be an indication that you are not close to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you are a person who is intimate with the Lord, you will be a priest with the Urim and the Thummim.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should prefer God s speaking not through dreams or through prophets, but through the Urim and the Thummim.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are not dreamers or prophets; we are priests with the Urim and the Thummim.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>CHRIST AS WITNESS AND ILLUMINATOR</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Urim and the Thummim are types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is significant that two items, not one or three, were added into the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Two is the number of testimony, and these two items, the Urim and the Thummim, indicate that Christ is the witness, the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is both the Urim and the Thummim.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the means for God to speak to us, Christ is a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is a living witness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Revelation 3:14 He refers to Himself as a faithful and true witness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From our experience we know and understand that Christ surely is God s witness, God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Urim typifies Christ as lights, illuminators.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No doubt, Christ is the light, and He is also the true illuminator.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is easy to understand, for in the New Testament Christ says of Himself, I am the light of the world John 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, Paul declares that Christ shines upon us and enlightens us: Wherefore He says, Awake, sleeper, and arise from among the dead, and Christ shall shine on you Eph 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>CHRIST SHINING THROUGH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>AND THROUGH THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The appendix in The Ancient Scriptures and the Modern Jew says that the Urim contained oil that was burned with fire from the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That fire came from God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, it was a divine fire, a heavenly fire, that burned the oil in the Urim to give light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The oil typifies the Spirit, and the fire comes from the altar, which typifies the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the illuminator, Christ surely has the oil, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This Spirit burns through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today Christ the illuminator is shining through the burning Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I would ask you to consider the significance of the Urim according to your spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even though your experience may be limited, you certainly have had some experience of Christ shining in you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do you not realize that this shining Christ works through the Spirit and also through the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may not have the words to explain it, but in our experience we realize that as Christ shines within us, the life-giving Spirit is burning and the cross is working.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In our experience of Christ as the illuminator, the shining One, we have the cross, the Spirit, and Christ Himself.</S>
