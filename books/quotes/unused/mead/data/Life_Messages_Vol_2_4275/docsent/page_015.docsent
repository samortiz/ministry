   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HIGHER THAN ETHICS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is not to say that we are unethical.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we are given too much change when we buy something, we return the extra amount.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we visit someone, we do not step over the threshold until we are first invited in; otherwise, we would be intruding.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such behavior is higher than ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord said that our righteousness must surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, or we are not qualified for the kingdom of the heavens Matt 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What we have is higher than ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To live ethically is merely a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our stability, honesty, and faithfulness are not part of a code of ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A TROUBLESOME INKPOT</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This does not mean that I am naturally a good person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I was a teen-ager, I was working for a large company.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day the place caught on fire, and everything was in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>An inkpot on the manager's desk attracted my attention.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Amidst all the turmoil of moving things, I picked it up and slipped it into my pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After I got saved and began to seek after the Lord, the trouble began!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I would tell the Lord Jesus that I loved Him, but He seemed to say, "What about the inkpot?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I closed my eyes to pray inkpot!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I tried to read the Bible inkpot!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When I went to bed at night and tried to sleep inkpot!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I told myself that I must resolve this matter of the inkpot.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I looked all over to see if I could find it, but I could not seem to locate it anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After much prayer, I found a way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I sensed within that what I could do would be to take the manager the money to pay for the inkpot.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I was happy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I figured out how much it was worth and took the money with me to the manager.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the way there I stopped to buy a calendar with beautiful pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was New Year's time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then I went on to the manager's. He said, "My, we haven't seen each other for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What brought you to see me?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He had always considered me a fine young man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>My face turned red.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord had told me I must not use polished words but confess directly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I answered him, "I came here because I stole from you."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I told him the story, then added, "Now here is the money for the inkpot.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am sorry I cannot return the inkpot, but I think this money will more than cover its cost."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He said, "No, no, no!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>An inkpot is a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I don't want your money."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I begged him to take it, telling him I would have no peace if he refused.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then he noticed the calendar and asked, "What is this?"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I did not want to talk about the calendar, but I told him what it was.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then he said, "I don't want your money, but I do like this calendar.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I'll take this instead of the money."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I did not like his proposal I wanted the calendar! but the Lord said I should go along with what he said.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I agreed, thanked him, and left.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To tell the truth, I was not happy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Yes, the inkpot problem was gone, but so was my beautiful calendar.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the way home, though, I met another acquaintance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He greeted me and then asked, "How would you like this calendar?"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It was another calendar.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I was so happy I wanted to jump.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>THE PERSON PRESENTED IN THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We were not good people before we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At that time we did not have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But now we have this living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have no need of religion or ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Unfortunately, we as Christians are still under the influence of today's religious and ethical concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These concepts frustrate our seeing this living Person, even when we come to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must drop all such preoccupations and pray, "Lord, I come to You through Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Bible is Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I drop my concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I want only You."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What a Person is presented to us in this book!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He was God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In Him was life, and this life was the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Does this sound like religion or ethics?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When I was young I used to wonder how He could be both God and the Word and how could I take Him as my life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Over the years I have found out that this One is not only the Word, but also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>"Now the Lord is that Spirit" 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then, from John 6:63 we can see that the word is also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He is one Person, called the Lord, the Word, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>These three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Lord is also life John 14:6 , as are the Word and the Spirit 6:63; Rom 8:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord, the Word, the Spirit, and life are four in one.</S>
