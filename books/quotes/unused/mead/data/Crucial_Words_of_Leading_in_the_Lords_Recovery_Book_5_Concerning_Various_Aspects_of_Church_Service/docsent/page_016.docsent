   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TRYING OUR BEST TO GET INTO THE MINISTRY BOOKS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>While many seminary students are studying in seminaries, they prepare fifty-two topics that they will use weekly after they graduate and become pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What we publish in the Lord s recovery contains life and truth, not empty doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have published quite a number of books and received letters of appreciation from many people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In one letter the writers said that they spent money to buy books from other places but did not gain any benefit even after reading twenty to forty pages; however, they gained something from the first page of our publication.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our publications are the best source to learn the truth, and they are guaranteed not to lead a person into error.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since most Christian books do not contain a controlling vision, a believer can be led astray.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, our knowledge of the Bible affords us a basic controlling vision.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the apostles, the first group of people to study theology was the church fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The last group of believers who thoroughly studied the Bible was the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In between the church fathers and the Brethren, many believers studied the Bible and put out books, which was their theology.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Martin Luther had his theology, and John Calvin also had his theology.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are several schools in today s theology, and the best among them is related to the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The most orthodox seminaries in America are Dallas Theological Seminary and Moody Bible Institute, both of which are based on the theology of the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Scofield Reference Bible is also based on the teaching of the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a believer who desires to expound the Bible takes the Brethren theology as his standard, he will not be far off the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot say much concerning other schools of theology.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot accept everything from reformed theology.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those in reformed theology do not even speak of regeneration, and they do not accept that believers have two natures within them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In my youth I purchased quite a number of books by reformed theologians, but I eventually threw all of them away.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Around 1965 I disposed of five big boxes of books.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The books were mainly in English and had followed me from northern China to Shanghai, to Taiwan, and finally to America.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Consulting various schools of theology, especially the theology of the Brethren, has kept us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I was taught by the Brethren for the first seven and a half years of my Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That was my foundation in theology.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Later, Brother Nee told me that the Synopsis of the Books of the Bible by J. N. Darby would help me the most, and he gave me a set as a gift in 1933.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have used this set whenever I encountered a difficult problem; however, I do not follow it blindly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I also consult others writings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Almost all the notes in the New Testament Recovery Version were written after looking into the writings of others and making a decision about the usefulness of the content.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this reason I have the boldness to say that the New Testament Recovery Version is not my creation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is the crystallization of Christian theology, which we inherited by standing on the shoulders of those who have gone before us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We save much time by studying the Recovery Version, because many good points in the expositions of others are included in our footnotes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should try our best to get into our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This does not mean that we should not read books published by others but that reading our publications is the shortest and the safest way to learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In particular, we should read the Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>PURSUING THE TRUTH AND GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What we are doing is not out of our own imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have inherited the riches of the past nineteen centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We consulted and studied these riches together with the light we received from the Lord, and then we either included or dropped an item.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Over the past sixteen years the Lord has given us higher and deeper light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, we must try our best to pursue the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The most important matter for the young full-timers is to know the truth and then to pursue the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These are two basic matters that we must pursue.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we do not know the truth and do not grow in life, we are lacking the basic condition of service.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is an older sister in Kaohsiung who received three years of spiritual education in the old meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At that time she was not married, but now one of her sons is an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This shows that the truth is effective.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Another sister, who preached the gospel in the schools, was bold and fearless and was not afraid to lose her job.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I met her parents when I preached the gospel in Tsingtao, China.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Her parents received much help and enjoyed the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This sister is now serving in a church overseas.</S>
