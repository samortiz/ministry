<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE MANIFESTATION OF THE KINGDOM</H1> <H1 CLASS=TITLE>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 25:1, 6, 10-12, 14-30</H1><P>In the Gospel of Matthew, the Lord Jesus spoke of the kingdom on three different occasions. In the Sermon on the Mount, given in Matthew 5, 6, and 7, He spoke concerning the reality of the kingdom. In Matthew 13 in a discourse given at the seashore, He spoke concerning the appearance of the kingdom. Then on the Mount of Olives, the Lord Jesus spoke concerning the manifestation of the kingdom. The manifestation of the kingdom is related to the Lord's second coming. In a sense His second coming brings in the manifestation of the kingdom. We may also say that when the kingdom becomes matured within us, this maturity will bring the Lord's second coming. The manifestation of the kingdom is simply the maturity of Christ within us in His coming back.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TEN VIRGINS</H2><P>Matthew 25, which reveals the manifestation of the kingdom, contains three important matters: the parable of the ten virgins, the parable of the talents, and the parable of the sheep and the goats. All three are related to the Lord's second coming, and all three are related also to the manifestation of the kingdom. In this chapter we will cover only the first two parables. The parable of the ten virgins is related to the manifestation of the kingdom because it says that the kingdom is likened unto ten virgins. At midnight the Lord returns, and all ten of the virgins arise to go forth and meet Him. At that time five wise virgins receive the reward and are able to enter into the marriage feast. Five others who are foolish are shut out from the marriage feast. In other words, five receive a reward, and five miss the reward. When the Lord Jesus comes back and the kingdom is manifested, all the real Christians will be judged. What we have done since we have been saved will be judged by the Lord Jesus at that time (1 Cor. 3:12-15). This will not be a judgment to determine whether we are saved or lost, but to determine whether we will receive the reward or miss the reward. This is to determine whether we shall enter into the marriage feast or be shut out of the marriage feast. This matter is very clear in the parable of the ten virgins. Because of the lack of revelation in past centuries, many Christians have considered that the five foolish virgins were not saved. But according to the pure Word the five foolish virgins are real virgins. They may be foolish, but they are not false. Because one is foolish does not mean that he is false. One may be foolish and yet still be genuine. The five foolish virgins are real Christians, but they will miss something at the Lord's coming in the manifestation of the kingdom. Some real Christians will miss the marriage feast.</P>
