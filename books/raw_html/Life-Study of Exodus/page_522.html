<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">THE INGREDIENTS OF THE COMPOUND SPIRIT<br />TYPIFIED BY THE COMPOUNDED OINTMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 30:23-30; 1 John 2:18-27; 4:1-3, 6; Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17; Gal. 5:22-24; Rom. 8:13</h1><p>We have seen that the compounded ointment is a type of the compound Spirit. In this message and in the two messages following we shall first consider the ingredients of the compound Spirit, and then we shall consider the function of the compound Spirit. Actually, our main concern will be with the function. But in order to understand the function of the compound Spirit, we need to see the ingredients of this Spirit. Knowing this will also help us to understand 1 John 2:18-27.</p><p>If we read 1 John 2:18 through 27 carefully and consider the context, we shall see that John speaks of the anointing in relation to dealing with the Antichrist. Verse 18 clearly says, &ldquo;Young children, it is the last hour, and even as you heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come; whereby we know that it is the last hour.&rdquo; Then in verse 19 John goes on to say that these antichrists &ldquo;went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out that they might be manifested that they all are not of us.&rdquo; After this, in verse 20, John says that we the believers have an &ldquo;anointing from the Holy One.&rdquo; This indicates that John&rsquo;s word concerning the anointing has something to do with his warning concerning Antichrist.</p><p>John&rsquo;s Gospel and Epistles were written at a time when different heresies concerning the Person of Christ were creeping in. According to one of these heresies, it was claimed that Christ was divine, but it was denied that He was human. According to this heretical teaching, Christ was God, but He was not a man. This is a heresy related to Christ&rsquo;s humanity. According to another heretical teaching, Christ was human, not divine; it was claimed that He was a man, but not God. This is a heresy with respect to Christ&rsquo;s deity. Therefore, these two heretical schools represent two extreme positions.</p><p>In his Gospel John declares that the Word, which is God, became flesh (1:1, 14). The word &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; in John 1:14 no doubt refers to Christ&rsquo;s humanity. The Word is God, and this Word became flesh, a man. This reveals that Christ is both God and man. All genuine Christians confess that Jesus Christ is both God and man. Throughout the centuries, a number of great teachers have used the term &ldquo;God-man&rdquo; to express the fact that Christ is God and man. He was God before incarnation, but through incarnation He became a man. Therefore, after His incarnation, Christ was both God and man, the God-man.</p><p>First John 2:20 and 27 speak of the anointing typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30. The anointing in these verses is a sign that has its source in the type of the anointing oil in Exodus 30. The anointing oil was a compounded ointment, an ointment containing a number of elements. The basic element was olive oil. We may use today&rsquo;s oil-based paint as a simple illustration of the compounded ointment. The basic element of this kind of paint is oil, and to this oil other ingredients or elements are added. In the same principle, to the basic element of olive oil the four spices were added to produce a compounded ointment. This compounded ointment was formed by blending olive oil with four spices. It is very helpful for us to know all the elements of this compound and what they signify.</p><p>The Spirit of Christ is the fulfillment of the type of the compounded ointment. The Spirit of Christ is the compound Spirit, and this Spirit is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. If we understand the ingredients of this Spirit, we shall be able to understand the function of the compound Spirit. As we shall see, the function of the Spirit is to anoint us. This is the reason 1 John 2:20 and 27 speak of the anointing.</p>
