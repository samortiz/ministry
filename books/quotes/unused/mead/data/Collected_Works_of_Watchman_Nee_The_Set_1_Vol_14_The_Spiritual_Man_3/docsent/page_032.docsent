   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What is the condition for evil spirits to attach themselves to man?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What must man do before he will be possessed by evil spirits?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What condition does he have to meet before evil spirits will work?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the most crucial question.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible calls this condition the "place" Eph 4:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This "place" or "room" is the empty spot left in man for evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This place is the footing that evil spirits can gain in man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Evil spirits attach themselves to man according to the place they are given.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The amount of place they are given is the degree to which they attach themselves to man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whether this place is given by a heathen or by a Christian, demons will attach themselves to that person just the same.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whatever in man allows evil spirits a spot to attack, an opportunity to invade, a footing to stand on, can be called a "place."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a man gives place to evil spirits, he cannot help but be possessed by them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since there is a cause, there must be an effect.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a believer gives place to evil spirits, relying on the notion that he will not be possessed because he is a Christian, he has already been deeply deceived by evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In short, the place that the believers give to the devil is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sin includes all the places.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When believers tolerate sin, they tolerate the evil spirits behind sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Any kind of sin will give place to evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, sin can be classified into two kinds: one is active and the other is passive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Active sin is the sin that man commits, such as committing evil with the hands, beholding lewdness with the eyes, listening to licentious sounds with the ears, or speaking profanity with the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These all give evil spirits an opportunity to attach themselves to the hands, eyes, ears, and mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is an invitation for evil spirits to come and dwell in whatever part of man's body commits sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should pay attention to three matters in determining how active sin develops a relationship with evil spirits: 1 some sins do not result in the possession by evil spirits, 2 other sins call for the possession by evil spirits, and 3 still other sins are caused by being possessed with evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a believer is possessed by evil spirits as a result of committing some sin, he should specifically forsake that sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After he regains that ground, he will be delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Otherwise, he will see the ground that he has given to the evil spirits gradually increase and not stop until his whole being is possessed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many believers are still not delivered from besetting sins, even though they have accepted the fact of their crucifixion with Christ, because the source of their sickness is not just the "flesh," but the possession of their bodies by supernatural, evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This aspect of affording evil spirits an opportunity to work through an active sin, comparatively speaking, is easier to apprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Most believers believe in this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We will not speak more concerning it because it is outside our present scope.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We will now pay attention to the second aspect of sin the place given to evil spirits by passivity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the aspect that is least understood by today's believers; most believers err in this aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, this kind of sin is in the realm of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we will speak of it in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is a difference between active sin and passive sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A person commonly regards active sin as sin and does not regard passive sin as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In addition to calling the various unrighteous acts committed by man on his own as sin, the Bible also says, "Therefore to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin" James 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Bible not only regards what man does as sin; it also regards what man does not do as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sin is the place where evil spirits attach themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We will call this demon-possession from now on.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, besides an actively-committed sin, which gives ground for demon-possession, there is also a passive sin of not doing something, which gives ground for demon-possession.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Passive sin gives ground to evil spirits through passivity in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In God's eyes, both giving up the use of any part of our being or using it wrongly are sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God has endowed us with various faculties.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They are not there for us to use wrongly or leave unused.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When a believer does not use any part of his faculties, allowing it to fall into passivity, a way is opened for evil spirits to use it instead of the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This will give place for demon-possession.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although all believers admit that sin is a condition for demon-possession, they do not realize that passivity also is a kind of sin and a condition for demon-possession.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once the place is given, a person cannot help but be possessed; once he is possessed, he cannot help but suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>PASSIVITY</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The reason "heathens" and fleshly believers are demon-possessed is mainly due to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But the reason some consecrated believers are demon-possessed can be stated in one word, "passivity."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The meaning of passivity is that the will no longer actively rules and directs a person's spirit, soul, body, or any part; consequently, he does not use his will to choose and decide everything that is related to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Being passive is the opposite of being active.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There are two aspects to the passivity of the believers: 1 losing self-control this means one cannot control his entire being or a part of it; 2 losing freedom this means one cannot make decisions that would coincide with God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For a believer to be passive means that he does not use his various faculties, and that he allows his faculties to fall into a state of passivity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Though he has a mouth, he does not speak; rather, he wants the Holy Spirit to speak through his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Though he has hands, he does not use them; rather, he wants God to use his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is unwilling to move any part of his being; he wants God to move them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He thinks that he is totally consecrated to God and that he no longer needs to use any part of his being.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this way he falls into passivity and allows evil spirits to deceive him and attach themselves to the passive members of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many believers accept what we spoke about in the last chapter concerning the union with God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, they are misled to think that such a union with God, such a comprehension of His heart's desire and such a denial of one's own intention require that they passively submit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They think that their will should be nullified and that they should become like robots.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They assume that the meaning of submission to God is not using their own will anymore and not using any part of their bodies through their will.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Such a person will no longer 1 choose, 2 decide, and 3 use his own will to act.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Outwardly, there seems to be an indication of a great victory because he used to be stubborn in his will, but suddenly he has become very submissive and is as weak as water.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He does not have an opinion in anything and is completely submissive in following orders.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He does not use his mind or will, and he does not exercise the discernment of his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Rather, he simply becomes a person of complete obedience whenever God moves, he would move.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But this is an inducement for demon-possession.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Since the believer has consecrated to God this way, he naturally falls into a passive state.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He does not move at all.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>All day long he quietly waits for an external force to move him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When there is such an external force, he moves.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Otherwise, he remains calm.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When this condition continues for a long time, he finds that he cannot act at the times he should be acting because there is an absence of an external coercing force.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Perhaps he even wants to move, but in the absence of an external urging force, he cannot move.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As this drags on, the believer finds that without an external force, he is not able to move even one step.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Even when the will wants to move, it seems as if it is suppressed by something.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He seems to have a kind of bondage around him, which restricts him from moving as he wishes.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He must wait until an external force urges him before he moves.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In this circumstance, the believer thinks he is very submissive to God because he does not have any activity.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But even if he desired to move, he could not do so.</S>
