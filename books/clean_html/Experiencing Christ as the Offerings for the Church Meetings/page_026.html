<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO HAVE CHRIST INCREASED IN YOU</h2>
<p>This is the way to have Christ increased in you for the sin offering and for the trespass offering. If you live a life every day in such a practice, you will be so rich with Christ as your sin offering and your trespass offering. Then you will come to the meeting with such a Christ. In your prayer this will be expressed. In your testimony this will be expressed. In your sharing something will come out. Especially at the Lord&rsquo;s table you will appreciate and see the Lord as your sin offering and as your trespass offering. At the table meeting you will enjoy the Lord as a big bullock, so adequate for your sin and for your trespass offering. You will thank the Lord that He has taken care of your sinful nature, of your sinful self. He has also taken care of your transgressions, your trespasses, your wrongdoings. You will realize that you have no merit and no goodness to justify you and to cause you to be accepted by God, but Christ is your sin offering and your trespass offering. If this is your case, your prayer at the Lord&rsquo;s table will not be according to the traditional way. Because we are void of the experience of Christ we have the kind of heart to come to the meeting again and again with empty hands. Either you don&rsquo;t open up your mouth or you open up your mouth and just speak a word that is so ordinary and so much under the influence of tradition.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING WHAT IS REVEALED IN THE TYPES</h2>
<p>I hope that you will see this is the way to have Christ increased in you. Rather, I would say this is the way for you to raise Christ, just like a rancher raises cattle. If you don&rsquo;t have this kind of practice experientially, when you come to the meeting you don&rsquo;t have Christ. This is not according to the side of doctrine but according to the side of experience. In Deuteronomy and Exodus in the typologies there are not only the doctrinal things but also the experiential things. Even many of the seeking Christians have no interest to get into these things. The riches in the typology have been buried in these books for years. We have to see that these are the real contents of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and this is the reality of the contents of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>How marvelous if we could come together and sit around the Lord&rsquo;s table offering prayers and praises in this way without any of the traditional Christianity heritage. This would cause our meetings to be absolutely different from the Christian meetings of today. We have to practice what is revealed in the types in the holy Word. This will impress people. At the beginning they may be offended, but eventually they will be convinced. This will satisfy the real seekers, the real hungry ones. Let us go on to learn something and to enter into a new field and to practice what the Lord has been showing us in these days.</p>
<p>I hope that this word could help us to see how we can raise Christ to be the groceries for us to cook a course for God as either the sin offering or the trespass offering. I hope also that we could have a clear view of the difference between sin and sins, that is, between the sin offering and the trespass offering in a practical and experiential way. You have to put all these matters into your daily practice.</p>
<p>Some of the verses in the Scripture references show that Christ deals with sin as the sin offering. John 1:29 says that the Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world. Romans 8:3 says that God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, or for sin. Sin here, according to Darby&rsquo;s note, has the thought of the sin offering. Then 2 Corinthians 5:21 says that Christ was made sin, not sins, for us that we may become the righteousness of God in Him. These verses show that Christ is our sin offering.</p>
<p>Other verses listed show that Christ is our trespass offering. First Corinthians 15:3 says that Christ died for our sins, not sin. Then Peter says that Christ bore our sins on the tree (1 Pet. 2:24). He also says that Christ died for our sins (1 Pet. 3:18). These verses show how Christ deals with sins, trespasses, and transgressions as our trespass offering.</p>
<p>Hebrews 9:26 says that Christ was manifested to put away sin. This means as the sin offering. Verse 28 says that Christ made the sacrifice for sins. This is the trespass offering. So four of the verses refer to Christ as the sin offering, and four of the verses refer to Christ as the trespass offering. When you read the singular word sin you must realize that Christ is our sin offering. When you read the plural word sins you must realize that Christ is our trespass offering.</p>
