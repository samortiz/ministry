   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In resurrection Christ s humanity was sanctified, enlivened, uplifted, and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our humanity had become fallen and has been redeemed by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His humanity did not need to be redeemed, but His humanity, which died on the cross, needed to be sanctified, enlivened, uplifted, and transformed.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>B. The Sealing Spirit Saturating the Believers</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The glory of the divine life is the ink, and throughout the believers life this ink by the inking is saturating their entire being from within with the glorious life element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such a saturating will eventually result in the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ephesians 4:30 tells us that we are sealed by the Holy Spirit unto the day of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here the word unto means resulting in or for.</S>
