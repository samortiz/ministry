   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST'S DEATH AND ITS EFFECTIVENESS,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH WHICH THE SPIRIT HAS BEEN COMPOUNDED, BECOME PREVAILING IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we want to see the Spirit's application of Christ's death and its effectiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ's death and its effectiveness, with which the Spirit has been compounded, become prevailing in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If Christ's death were not in the Spirit, His death could not be prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we enjoy and experience the Spirit, His death becomes prevailing in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The death of Christ is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE COMPOUNDED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>DWELLING IN OUR SPIRIT TO DISPENSE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>CHRIST'S DEATH AND ITS EFFECTIVENESS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>FROM OUR SPIRIT TO OUR SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>AND EVEN TO OUR MORTAL BODY</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The compounded Spirit dwells in our spirit to dispense Christ's death and its effectiveness from our spirit to our soul and even to our mortal body Rom 8:6, 9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This dispensing is the anointing 1 John 2:20, 27 , and the anointing is the moving of the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those Christians who love the Lord and maintain fellowship with the Lord, always have the feeling and sensation that something is moving within them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That moving is the anointing, and that anointing is the dispensing of the Triune God, of the death of Christ, and of the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That dispensing comprises all these elements: divinity, Christ's humanity, Christ's death, the effectiveness of His death, Christ's resurrection, and the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we are under this dispensing, our natural life is killed, and our flesh is crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is under this dispensing, this anointing, this moving of the indwelling Spirit, that we experience the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we are about to lose our temper, we may stop ourselves and go to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After our prayer, our anger is over.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is because our prayer activates the moving of the indwelling Spirit, and within this moving there is the killing power.</S>
