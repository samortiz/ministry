<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">SATAN'S WEARING-OUT WORK</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Dan. 7:25</h1><p>Satan always works to attack God's children. His attacks are not sudden; they often come gradually. According to Daniel 7:25, Satan will wear out the saints of the Most High. One of Satan's strategies against the saints of the Most High is to wear them out. We must remember that Satan's work among God's children is not apparent; he works by wearing them out.</p><p>What does it mean to wear someone out? It means to exhaust a person minute by minute, some today and some tomorrow. The wearing out goes on invisibly, yet in a debilitating way; it goes on imperceptibly, yet the end is total depletion and waste. Satan works in God's children by the principle of wearing them out. He wears us out a little today and a little tomorrow. He causes us to suffer a little today and a little tomorrow. We may think that this is insignificant, yet the result of this wearing out by Satan is total depletion.</p><p>This is why the Bible says that the love of many will "grow" cold (Matt. 24:12). The girl who was possessed by a spirit of Python cried out "for many days" (Acts 16:17-18). When Festus wanted money from Paul, he sent for him "frequently" and conversed with him (24:26). Delilah pressed Samson "every day" with her words (Judg. 16:16). Satan wears out God's children gradually, repeatedly, frequently, and daily. The "evil day" in Ephesians 6:13 refers to Satan's wearing out. We must ask the Lord to open our eyes to see Satan's wearing-out work and how we can resist it.</p><h2 class="head1">WEARING OUT MAN'S BODY</h2><p>Satan is particularly good at wearing out the physical bodies of God's children. Job's body was stricken (Job 2:7-8), and Paul had a thorn in his flesh (2 Cor. 12:7). This was Satan's wearing out of their bodies. Some Christians had healthy bodies before they were saved. After they are saved they become sick, and their health deteriorates. If God opens our eyes, we will see that Satan is always plotting and planning to deal with God's children. Many of God's servants experience the same thing when they set out to preach the gospel. Before they set out to work and preach the gospel, they have no problems with their health, but once they start to work and preach, their health breaks down within a period of three to five years. This is Satan's wearing out of the saints of the Most High. He depletes men of a little food today and a little sleep tomorrow. He makes them a little tired today and a little tired tomorrow. The cumulative effect of this tiredness eventually destroys their health completely. This is Satan's work.</p><h2 class="head1">WEARING OUT MAN'S HEART</h2><p>Satan wears out not only man's body but also man's heart. When you first believed in the Lord, you may have been very happy, joyful, and peaceful. But if you are not watchful and do not know the work of Satan, you will suddenly become restless one day, unhappy another day, and depressed a third day. Little by little your peace will be lost, and your joy will be gone. You will become weary and discouraged. This is Satan's work in wearing you out.</p><h2 class="head1">WEARING OUT MAN'S SPIRIT</h2><p>Satan also tries to wear out man's spirit. He takes away your prayer little by little; he takes away your trust in God little by little. He causes you to trust in yourself more and more and believe that you are cleverer and cleverer. He causes you to trust in your gift and distracts your heart from the Lord little by little. If Satan struck God's children with a powerful blow all at once, they could withstand him because they would realize that it was the work of Satan. But his most evil work is not to strike just one blow but to wear you out over a long period of time. He causes God's children to fall behind little by little and backslide little by little. This is the way Satan wears out God's children.</p><h2 class="head1">WEARING OUT MAN'S TIME</h2><p>Satan also wears out man's time. For example, Festus sent for Paul to converse with him frequently. A man as powerful and as gifted as Paul preached to Festus for two years, yet he was still not saved. This is Satan's wearing out of man. Festus would send for Paul, and there would be no result. The next day he would send for Paul again, and there would be no result. He continually sent for Paul, but there was no result. Satan engaged Paul in work with no result. At the end of two years, there was still no result. This is Satan's wearing out of man.</p><p>If God's children do not know Satan's strategy, they will be deceived. We should redeem the time, and each hour should be counted as an hour. We must stop Satan from wearing out our time and engaging us in fruitless work.</p>
