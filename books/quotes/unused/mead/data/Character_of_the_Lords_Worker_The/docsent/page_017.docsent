   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There are some brothers and sisters who endure suffering, but they have no conception of the preciousness of the suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They go through it without any sense of gratitude to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They may even murmur and complain continually, hoping for the day when they will be delivered from their suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They pray, but they never praise.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They do not heartily accept the discipline of the Spirit which comes upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead, they pray that these days will go away quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Their attitude betrays their lack of a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brothers and sisters, if we do not have a mind to suffer during peaceful times, we will only be fit to travel on smooth roads.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once the road becomes muddy, we will stop serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This will not take us very far.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let me repeat: A mind to suffer is different from suffering itself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we have a mind to suffer, the Lord may not necessarily give us sufferings, but when we do encounter sufferings, we will be inwardly prepared, and we will not draw back.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who suffer do not necessarily have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many people are suffering, but they do not have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Among the suffering ones, some may have a mind to suffer, while others may not have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When many brothers and sisters encounter sufferings and afflictions, they complain and cry for help day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They pray for deliverance from their afflictions every day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such ones do not have a mind to suffer at all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are suffering, but they do not have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brothers and sisters who are undergoing sufferings in physical health, in financial supply, or in other matters should realize that the Lord only counts a mind to suffer as being precious.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He does not pay attention to whether we are suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not think that we are suffering for the Lord simply because we are put in trying situations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It may be true that our situations are unpleasant, but how much of a willing mind to suffer for the Lord do we have?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How much of this is by choice?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Or are we merely murmuring, begrudging, self-pitying, and self-justifying?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is possible for us to suffer a great deal of heartache and hardship without having the will to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A will to suffer is something deeper than suffering itself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who have a heart to suffer may not have any outward suffering at all, and those who are outwardly suffering may not have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brothers and sisters, do you see the difference?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is like saying that those who are poor in material things are not necessarily poor in their spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many people are poor materially, but they are not poor spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the same way, many brothers and sisters are indeed suffering, but they do not have a mind to suffer at all.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the Lord were to offer them the option of choosing, they would most definitely choose not to suffer, not just for a month or for a day, but even if it was just for a minute of their time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They have absolutely no mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a man does not have a mind to suffer, he can not go anywhere with his work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the outward demands exceed his inward ability, he will shrink back.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When a situation requires that he make an additional effort, he will find no strength to meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He cannot relinquish his own treasures and can only carry on an easy work under an easy environment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He needs the Lord to remove all hurdles before he can work in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is surprising that many servants of the Lord would have such a demand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must be clear what it means to have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A brother living in peace may have a greater mind to suffer than a brother living in tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The first one may have a mind to suffer; he is prepared to suffer for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The second one may be suffering, but he has no heart to suffer for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is little sign of hardship in the circumstance of one, while the other may be obviously in great distress.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Humanly speaking, the one in great distress is the one who is suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But in the eyes of the Lord, He values more the one who, even though he has less hardship, has a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not think that suffering alone qualifies us for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must remember that God has demands on us, and in order to meet these demands, there is the need for us to have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must arm ourselves with this mind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Without such a mind, there is no possibility for us to fight the spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As soon as we face troubles, we will draw back, and as soon as we are called upon to pay a price, we will give up.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the Lord allows a little affliction to come our way, we withdraw.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are not concerned with how much suffering a person experiences; we are concerned with how much of a mind to suffer one has.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to our natural concept, we would conclude that a brother who suffers much knows God's grace in fuller measure.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But many times, we do not receive any help from a suffering brother when we meet him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We may soon discover that he lacks the mind to suffer; he is only suffering reluctantly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If he were given a choice, he would run away from his trials at the first possible moment.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He may indeed be suffering, but he has not yielded to the suffering, and he is going through his experience reluctantly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He has not learned any lesson before the Lord, and he is filled with rebellion inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This shows us that a mind to suffer is very different from suffering itself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What the Lord treasures is a mind to suffer a conscious readiness for suffering, not the experience of suffering itself.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We cannot replace a mind to suffer with suffering itself.</S>
