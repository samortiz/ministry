   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The dispensing of the Triune God is according to His righteousness, through His holiness, and unto His glory; the ultimate goal of the dispensing of the Triune God as life is glory, the expression of God in and through the church as the Body of Christ Rom 5:17; 6:19-23; 8:18, 21; 16:27; Eph 3:16-21.</S>
