   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THE PRIESTLY GARMENTS 5 Scripture Reading: Exo 28:4-14; 39:1-7 ONYX STONES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Exodus 28:9-10 says, And you shall take two onyx stones, and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel: Six of their names on the one stone, and the names of the remaining six on the other stone, according to their birth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We, the believers, are signified by these two onyx stones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Adam was made from the dust of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After God created Adam, He placed him in front of the tree of life, from which flowed a river.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By the flow of this river there were onyx stones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As Adam stood by the river, he may have looked at himself and then at the onyx stones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Adam was altogether a composition of dust, not of onyx stone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Onyx stone signifies transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In our natural life we all are dust.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But through regeneration we have become a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now we are in the process of being transformed into the image of the Lord from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This transformation is signified by onyx stone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Exodus 28:12 says, And you shall put the two stones upon the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, as stones of memorial for the sons of Israel; and Aaron shall bear their names before Jehovah upon his two shoulders for a memorial.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On his shoulders what the high priest bore was not two piles of dust.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the contrary, there were onyx stones on his shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that what Christ as our High Priest holds is not dust; He holds the transformed saints, typified by the onyx stones on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod worn by the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When some saints hear this, they may feel discouraged, thinking that they have not been transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They may say, If Christ holds only onyx stones, and not dust, then I am through with the experience of being held by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I feel discouraged because I have not yet been transformed into onyx stone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Actually you do have the experience of being held by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, you do have some amount of onyx stone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Often you may feel as if you are falling away from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But it is the dust that is falling, not you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sometimes the Lord raises up an environment which causes us to be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may be afraid of falling away.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, only the dust is shaken away.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We ourselves as regenerated ones will never be removed, for the onyx stone in us will never fall.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The onyx stone remains, placed in the beautiful and glorious settings of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>FASTENED AND TRANSFORMED</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I admit that I am short of utterance to describe the fastening power of the divine glory and human beauty of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If I had more experience and more utterance, I would try to give more illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But because I am short of adequate experience, it is difficult to describe the holding power of Christ portrayed by the ephod.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The ephod with the breastplate and the shoulderplates portrays the fastening power of Christ through His divine glory and human beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As we have pointed out, when we read the four Gospels, we can see the Lord with His divine glory woven into His human beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can also see His heavenliness, His kingliness, and His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, every aspect of Christ typified by the materials and colors of the ephod is revealed in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we behold the Lord in His glory and beauty, we are spontaneously held, fastened, to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be fastened is to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more we are transformed, the more we are fastened.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The dust is falling away, and the transformed part of our being remains fastened to Christ and upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a result, we enjoy Him and experience Him with His fastening power.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are held not only upon Christ s shoulders, but we are also held upon His breast.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that we are fastened by His love and also by His power.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The shoulders signify power and the breast signifies love.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A MEMORIAL BEFORE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to 28:12, Aaron was to bear the names of the children of Israel before the Lord upon his shoulders for a memorial.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A memorial is a matter of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When Christ bears us on His shoulders before God, this brings joy to God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When God looks at Christ, He sees His redeemed people, who have been transformed into onyx stones held in settings of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eventually the onyx stones become a beauty added to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is both a memorial before God and also an additional beauty to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As we look at this picture, we see glory and beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This portrait is beyond the ability of human words to explain.</S>
