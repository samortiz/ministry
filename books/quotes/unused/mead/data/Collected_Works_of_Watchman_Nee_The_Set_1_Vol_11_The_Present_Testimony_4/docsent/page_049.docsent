   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING JOINED TO THE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>RESURRECTION LIFE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What we have seen thus far is that God has crucified us with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This alone, however, is not enough; there needs to be something more.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is that we "might be joined to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not only do we need a deliverance on the negative side, we also need a joining on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without this, our work is still in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this reason, God has not only crucified us on the negative side but has also joined us, who have been delivered from the law, to the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, on the one side there is an exit, and on the other side there is an entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the one side there is the severance, and on the other side there is the union.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one side we are delivered from the law, and on the other side we are joined to Christ and belong to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the resurrection that we have been speaking about.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, this is not something individual; resurrection brings all the sons into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 12:24 says, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Originally there was only one life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now this life has entered into many seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Originally there was only one organism.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now it has become many organisms.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Originally there was only one grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now this grain of wheat has become many grains of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same way, when Christ died, He dispensed His life to all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Christ, there are also two facts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first is that we have been included in the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Christ died, we also died.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The second is that we were resurrected with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God has dispensed His life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is something that every regenerated person shares in common and possesses.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I do not wish to say much about this; my emphasis is on the first fact.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We who are resurrected in Christ ought to bear fruit to glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has given us the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By this we can live out His life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The one grain that was planted is exactly the same as the thirty, sixty, or hundred grains that will spring forth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we plant barley, surely what will come out will not be wheat or cucumber.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is planted will be the same as what grows up; there will not be a change.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If what is planted is wheat, surely wheat will grow up.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How then can we live a life similar to Christ's life, a life that bears fruit to glorify God?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is only one way; we must allow Christ to be lived out of us and allow Him to live.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ has not only died for us on the cross but also lives for us within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How can we live a life of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The only way this could be done is for Christ to give His life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, we must have the life of Christ before we can bear fruit to glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today I have presented to you these things before God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>May we see that God has given up hope in us and considers us incurable.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although we think that there is hope and strength in us, God has given up hope in us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He has crucified us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever we are outside of Christ and feel that we are still alive and able, we will immediately fall.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, we can only see ourselves in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we are in Christ, there are only two facts: we have died and we have resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The resurrected part is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, God wants us to live by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the same time, everything that is in Adam has died.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we lay hold of this fact, we are dead to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Please remember that we are not only dead to the world, the self, and sin; we are also dead to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this way, we will no longer have any hope for ourselves but will stand firmly in the position where God has placed us.</S>
