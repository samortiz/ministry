   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-SIX LIFE IN THE DEPTHS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Editor's Note: The following article is translated from the Chinese series, Twelve Baskets Full, Volume 7, chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The content is similar to the second "Preparation Message" given by Watchman Nee in the Third Overcomer Conference in January 1934 see Volume 11 of The Collected Works .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since we have no assurance that this article is taken from the same spoken message, we have included it in this volume.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Scripture Reading: Mark 4:5-6, 16-17; Hosea 14:5-7; S.S. 4:12</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From the above three passages we can see the kind of Christian living that God delights in and the kind of living that is enduring and unchanging, one that survives blows and withstands tests.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why do some Christians look quite promising at the beginning of their Christian experience, yet are nowhere to be found after a period of time?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why do some drop out halfway?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why are some unable to follow the Lord to the end?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The answer is very much related to the way a Christian lives.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a Christian does not live a normal Christian life, he is shaky, and it is easy for him to drop out.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, we must not neglect this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A SHALLOW LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Mark 4:5-6 says, "And other seed fell on the rocky place, where it did not have much earth, and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And when the sun rose, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is one of the many parables the Lord Jesus spoke on the sowing of seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verses 16 and 17 the Lord explains the parable to the disciples: "And likewise, these are the ones being sown on the rocky places, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet they have no root in themselves, but last only for a time; then when affliction or persecution occurs because of the word, immediately they are stumbled."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From the Lord's explanation we see that a shallow life cannot endure or stand the test of trials.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Apparently this kind of life has a good start, but eventually, it ends miserably.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The appearance of this kind of life is that "immediately it sprang up."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since it has sprung up, the outer shell of the seed has burst, and it has sprouted.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that the word is no longer merely a doctrine to a person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It has been transformed into life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It has sprouted and sprung up immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As far as its appearance is concerned, it has advanced very fast and progressed in a wonderful way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One should be satisfied with such a growth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, its end is disappointing because it becomes scorched when the sun comes up and it withers away.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It springs up immediately but withers quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sprouts that cannot withstand the heat of the sun have little hope of ripening and wither away quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the condition of many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Shortly after they hear the word, they receive it with joy under the illusion that they have everything, understand everything, and are prepared to pay any price and embark on any way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before God they have the will and the consecration; before men they bear their testimony and zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, when trials soon befall them, they immediately shake and become dismayed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They find things to be unbearable.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They flinch through fear and eventually fall away.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brothers and sisters, as long as we are Christians, the scorching of the sun is indispensable; it helps our growth and assists our ripening.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are shaken and fall away as soon as we meet the scorching of the sun, it indicates that we are shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The scorching of the sun only exposes our true condition; it will not rob us of what we really possess.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Does the word of God wither at the scorching of the sun?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No. The problem is how we received the word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why does God's word sprout immediately and then wither away as soon as it is exposed to the scorching of the sun?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What is the reason for this?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Bible shows us three reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Shallowness of Ground</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The first reason that the word withers away is the shallowness of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means there is not much soil and consequently no depth; there is only a little soil on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A Christian with shallow ground has very little inside of him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When such a person hears the word, every sentence seems to be well received and easily comprehended.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is apt to relay the word to other people and ready to bear witness before men.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, it is just as easy for this kind of person to lose the truth, overthrow the truth, and deny what he has said to other people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is satisfied easily, and he becomes hungry easily.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is happy and sad easily; he is excited and cooled easily; he laughs and weeps easily.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Such a person is very shallow; he lives in his emotions and circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We know that if a tree is big, its roots must be deep.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some trees can reach a depth of several hundred feet.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A tree which cannot absorb water from the surface will send its roots deep until it finds a source of water.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The palm trees in the Arabian Desert survive with green foliage, despite the scorching of the sun, because they draw water from the depths, enabling them to defy the blazing sun.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If a Christian sends his roots down, he will not need to fear the scorching of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Everyone who lives by his circumstances or in his feelings is living on shallow ground.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those who are prone to be swayed by their emotions or influenced by circumstances are similarly shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, those whose lives are deeply rooted do not care about their circumstances; they do not live by feeling but solely by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They do not look to or depend upon circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Instead they look to the Lord behind the circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Such persons receive their sustenance, support, and power from God instead of from the circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If a person lives by his emotions and circumstances, instead of trusting in the Lord behind the circumstances, he will not be able to hold fast to a single truth or teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When circumstances are favorable, he will be energetic and elated, but as soon as he encounters trials, he will become disheartened and depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He will fall as soon as he is confronted with the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Brothers and sisters, if you retreat when trials come, it proves that you are a shallow person.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When the sun scorches, you will wither away immediately.</S>
