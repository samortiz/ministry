   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE CHRIST HIS PERSON 9 G. IN SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider the person of Christ in salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some do not know the difference between salvation and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Redemption is what Christ accomplished on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When this redemption is applied to us, it becomes our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Salvation, therefore, is the application of the redemption accomplished by Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Savior</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In salvation Christ is the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is the Savior in order to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning Christ as the Savior, Luke 2:11 says, A Savior was born to you today in David s city, who is Christ the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 4:42 the Lord Jesus is referred to as the Savior of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord is the Savior of fallen mankind based upon His person and His redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is the very God becoming a man to be our Savior, and He has accomplished full redemption for us the sinners, through which He may save us from God s condemnation and from our fallen condition.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What He is and what He has accomplished make Him competent to be the able Savior to save us to the uttermost from all our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Isaiah 40:3 prophesied that John the Baptist was coming to prepare the way for Christ so that He may come to be the salvation of God to all flesh Luke 3:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When Christ came and was presented to God as a child, the old, righteous and devout Simeon blessed God for Him as God s salvation Luke 2:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is not only the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the Savior He is also the salvation God prepared for us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Apart from Him there is no salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we receive Him, we receive salvation immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Zaccheus received the Lord Jesus, the Lord said to him, Today salvation has come to this house Luke 19:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Life</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In salvation Christ is not only our objective Savior; He is also our subjective life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Colossians 3:4 Paul speaks of Christ our life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The expression our life is a strong indication that we need to experience Christ in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ, not our self, our soul, should be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If Christ is not our life in our practical experience, then all He is and all He has attained and obtained will remain objective.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul s use of the expression our life indicates that we and Christ, and also God Himself, have one life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God, Christ, and the believers all have one life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The life of God is the life of Christ, and the life of Christ has become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To say that Christ is our life means that Christ has become us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is subjective to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If Christ does not become us, how can He be our life?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ must be our life in a practical and experiential way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Day by day we need to experience Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should have one life and one living with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Romans 5:10 says, If, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This verse covers both the reconciling death of Christ and the saving life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Reconciliation includes redemption and justification.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ died on the cross for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Through redemption we have been justified by God and reconciled to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now there is nothing between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, we still have a number of subjective problems.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For this reason, even after we have been reconciled to God, we still need to be saved in Christ s life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although we have been saved already through Christ s death, we still need to be saved in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the one hand, we have been saved from hell and the judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This was accomplished once for all through the death of Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the other hand, we still need to be saved from many present problems, including temper, disposition, pride, and jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although we need to be saved from hundreds of items, in the book of Romans Paul deals with seven major things from which we need to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>First, we need to be saved from the law of sin Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Within our flesh, our fallen body, the law of sin works spontaneously and automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This law of sin is the power of evil that operates spontaneously within us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The second negative item from which we need to be saved in Christ s life is worldliness Rom 12:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We were born into a worldly environment and then raised to be worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Worldliness is in our being; hence, it is a subjective matter, a matter of our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The love of the world is an element of our fallen constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The third item is naturalness Rom 12:2b .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We all have a natural life and a natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our constitution is natural.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All these natural elements are enemies to God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God has nothing to do with our natural being, our natural life, our natural strength, our natural disposition, or our natural power.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>These natural elements are deep within our being, much deeper than the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The law of sin is related mainly to our flesh, but our natural being is our self.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For the sake of God s purpose, we need to be saved in the life of Christ from our naturalness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We also need to be saved from our individualism, that is, from being individualistic Rom 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Because we all have the tendency to be individualistic, none of us naturally likes to be one with others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is not God s intention to have a group of individualistic believers.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>On the contrary, God s intention is to build up the Body for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In order for this purpose to be carried out, we need to be saved from individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The life of Christ also saves us from divisiveness Rom 16:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Our natural man does not like to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>To be one means to be restricted, bound, and eventually put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Throughout the centuries there has been a shortage of oneness among believers.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Instead of oneness, there has been division upon division.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>All divisions come from the element of divisiveness in our fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The sixth negative item from which we need to be saved is self-likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>By self-likeness we mean the appearance and expression of the natural self.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We need to be saved from self-likeness by being conformed to the image of the Son of God Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In so many respects we do not yet have the likeness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Instead, we bear the likeness of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Therefore, we need to be saved in life from self-likeness, and we need to be conformed to the likeness of the glorious Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Finally, we need to be saved from our natural body Rom 8:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Eventually, in God s full salvation our body will be redeemed, that is, glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The day is coming when our physical body will be transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>All that Christ has accomplished on the cross is an objective fact, but we still need a subjective experience of this fact, an experience in life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Christ died on the cross as our Substitute, but there is still the need for us to be identified with Him in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The only way Christ s accomplishment in substitution can be applied to us in our experience is by our having Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In the Gospel of John He said definitely and emphatically, I am the life 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>To be saved in His life is actually to be saved in the person of Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>As long as we are in Him, we are in the process of being saved in His life.</S>
