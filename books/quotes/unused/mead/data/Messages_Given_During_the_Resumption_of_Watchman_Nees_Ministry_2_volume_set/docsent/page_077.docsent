   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR MIGRATION TALKS 10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:January 21, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Prayer: Lord, do not allow us to walk in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Give us the light, and make our light shine as the dawning of the day until midday.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, we believe that our prayers will be heard and answered.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, make us healthy within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we preach the gospel tonight, may others receive mercy through seeing the love that the brothers and sisters express toward You.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, may our future be clear, and may all those who grope in darkness see the light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Forgive us for limiting Your ways.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE WHOLE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>VOLUNTARILY RISING UP TO SERVE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is a difficult thing to help the brothers and sisters to become useful before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is easy for us to go to various places to preach the gospel and to give a few messages.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But to remain in a place to serve the Lord properly, be coordinated together, and fulfill the function of each one, is a very difficult thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is something that the co-workers must pay attention to in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If this matter is carried out properly, God will have an oracle and a mouthpiece here.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not right for the co-workers to see results only when they themselves are working, but not to see results when they are not working.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A local church must be something organic; it must be on the move all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The co-workers must have an adequate amount of spiritual life, and they must have a proper view to promote this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the elders and the co-workers are not there, the brothers and sisters should still continue to work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When that happens, the co-workers are free to go to work in another place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A built-up church is one that mobilizes by itself and that functions by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>WORKING IN ONE ACCORD,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>SETTING THE MIND ON THE THINGS OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not consider our own house more than we consider God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, we should set our minds on the things of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are not here to do a scattered work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today, we have to work in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only then will the Lord have a way among us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The co-workers and the elders have to help one another, for the co-workers may be away from a locality at times, and the elders have to fill in the gap at those times.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>LEARNING TO BE A PROPER PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THROUGH DOING THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to learn to be a proper person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In serving the Lord, the main thing is not our work, but to learn to be a proper person through doing the work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One of the basic trainings in serving the Lord is to learn to be a proper person through doing the work.</S>
