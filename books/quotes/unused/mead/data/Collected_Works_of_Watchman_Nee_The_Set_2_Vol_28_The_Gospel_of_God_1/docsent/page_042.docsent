   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE WAY OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FAITH VERSUS LAW AND WORK</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>During the past few days, we have seen that all that man has is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have also seen that God accomplishes everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He has loved us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He has given us grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God has accomplished righteousness, has caused the Lord Jesus to die and resurrect for us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has even sent the Holy Spirit to convict and enlighten us and to give us the strength to accept the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let me ask a very natural question.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What must man do to be saved, now that God has finished all His work?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God has done everything on His part.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today He has laid this finished work before man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What then is the condition for us to be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God has accomplished the work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How can man now receive salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How can redemption become salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How can propitiation become substitution?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How can God's gift to us in His Son be communicated to us in the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are talking about the condition for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What should we do on our side before what is on God's side can be communicated to us?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE CONDITION FOR SALVATION FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All those who read the Bible know that the condition for salvation is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no other condition except faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because man has fallen and is corrupted, because his thoughts are crooked, and because man's flesh is of the law, he thinks that he must do something before he can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the Bible shows us that the only condition for our salvation is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Besides faith there is no other condition.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The New Testament tells us clearly at least one hundred and fifteen times that when man believes, he is saved, he has eternal life and is justified.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When man believes, he has all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In addition to these one hundred and fifteen times, the Bible says that man is justified by faith, or becomes righteous through faith, another thirty-five times.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the first instance, we have the verb to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the second instance, we have the noun faith.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The verb to believe is used one hundred and fifteen times.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once a man believes, he is saved Acts 16:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once a man believes, he has eternal life John 3:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once a man believes, he is justified.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In addition to these verses, there are thirty-five times in which the noun faith is used.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Man is saved through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He receives eternal life through faith, and he is justified by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, in the entire New Testament, at least one hundred and fifty times it says that man is saved, justified, and has eternal life through faith only.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not a matter of who one is, what one does, or what one can do.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everything depends on believing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everything depends on faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Another thing that deserves special attention is that in all these one hundred and fifty occurrences of faith and believing, no other condition is added.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These verses do not say that man must believe and then do something to receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They do not say that man must believe and do something before he can be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Neither do they say that man must believe and do something before he can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord's Word mentions faith in a clear and definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nothing else is mixed in or attached to the condition of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, the Bible shows us clearly from God's point of view that there is no other condition to salvation than to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One of the most well-read and treasured books in the New Testament is the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If one reads it carefully, he will see that John wrote this book with no other purpose than to tell us how man can receive life and be saved and how he can be delivered from condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Gospel of John mentions eighty-six times that man receives life, is justified, and does not come into condemnation by faith alone and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, the Bible shows us clearly, adequately, and simply that salvation is not based on who man is, what he has, and what he has done.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Bible shows us that when man believes, he receives John 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He receives by believing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have said that salvation and redemption are accomplished by God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even the way and plan to accomplish them are laid out by God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have also seen that grace is accomplished by God through the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have to remember that if it is grace on God's side, then it must be faith on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If I stretch out my hands to give a brother a cup of tea, he cannot receive it by stretching out his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whatever way others use to give things to you, you have to use the same way to receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The way to receive must be the same as the way to give.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If others call you on the telephone, then you have to answer by picking up the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If others write a letter to you, you have to receive the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The way something is received must be the same as the way it was sent.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>According to the Bible, God has given us grace through Jesus Christ 1 Cor 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For Him to do so is in the principle of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Since giving is in the principle of grace on God's side, then receiving is in the principle of faith on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Faith and grace are two inseparable principles.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Grace is God giving something to us, and faith is our receiving something from God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Faith is nothing other than receiving what God has given us in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is absolutely independent from work.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Only by this way can man receive God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we resort to any other means, we will not be able to receive God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Although the Bible shows us that through faith one receives God's grace, many doctrines have emerged as a result of man's misunderstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Man comes up with theories that are based on his own thoughts and darkened mind, involving what he should do before he can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Just as man has made idols with his crooked heart and has considered them gods, he has specified conditions for salvation with his crooked heart and darkened thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>For this reason, I must point out the different conditions that man has set forth for salvation and consider if these ways of salvation are trustworthy or not.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If man does not see God's truth and does not understand His Word, he will not realize that the condition for salvation is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But if a man sees God's light and understands God's truth, he will not be able to overturn the New Testament fact that salvation is through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The problem today is that after man realizes faith as the condition of salvation, he adds something else to faith.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The point of dispute between God and man is not that of believing or not believing, but whether it is believing with repentance, believing with the works of law, believing with baptism, or believing with testifying, as a prerequisite to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Word of God tells us that once we believe, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But man today adds a word with.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>According to his darkened mind, he claims that man is saved by faith with something.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>What we will consider is not if one can be saved by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>That matter is settled already.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The question today is whether or not faith is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Do we need to add with to faith before we can be saved?</S>
