   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ANSWER TO BROTHER LAN CHIH YI</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Chih Yi:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I received your letter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thank you for your words of comfort to me!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The slander of outsiders certainly means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord said, "Blessed are you when they reproach...you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you...rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens" Matt 5:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, it is a pity that the outsiders do not understand that our motivation in the Lord is to express the presence of the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They misunderstand us, thinking that we are only trying to draw people out of the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I will answer the three questions you asked me separately with the following:</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1 The church cannot help a polygamous brother by doing anything more than forgiving him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the Lord said that He loved mercy and abhorred sacrifices, He was referring to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the believers sinned in the matter of polygamy before they were saved, the Lord does not pursue the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because no matter what the sin, whatever was committed before our regeneration is under the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Of course, the sin of polygamy is under the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The question that has arisen in the church is whether the concubine he had should be driven out of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible gives us some very clear light regarding this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul told Timothy, "The overseer the elder then must be...the husband of one wife...deacons must similarly be..."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>1 Tim 3:2, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So we know that among the believers at that time, there were those who were the husband of two wives.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason, Paul said that only the husbands of one wife could be elders and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The reason the apostle said this word was to show that if a man had two wives, he could still be a believer, but he could not bear any responsibility in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, the sin of polygamy is different from other sins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are two kinds of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One kind of sin can be restituted, the other cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The sin of polygamy cannot be restituted.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, stolen items can be returned to their owner.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if you have married someone's daughter, you cannot return her.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, if you want to send this woman away, you are telling her to be an adulteress.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>So it would be better if the husband bowed down under God's government and bore this responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Old Testament, David married Bathsheba.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God did not tell David to separate from Bathsheba.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, she bore Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our Lord Jesus came out of her.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Exodus 21:7-11 speaks of the position of a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this passage, the other wife refers to the proper wife, the maidservant is a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The position God gives the concubine is that her food, her clothing, and her duty of marriage shall not be diminished.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>2 Regarding the question about Acts 19:1-7, we should first see what this passage means when it refers to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Holy Spirit is not mentioned here in reference to regeneration or indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Regeneration and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit are not obtained through the laying on of hands of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From the following portion, which speaks of tongues and prophecies, etc., we see that the Holy Spirit spoken of here refers to the gift of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The disciples at Ephesus were already regenerated and already had the Holy Spirit indwelling them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They only lacked the gift of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Gift is related to the Body 1 Cor 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The baptism of repentance causes us to be related to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The baptism into the Lord Jesus causes us to have a part in His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, it was not enough for them to receive the baptism of repentance; they still had to be baptized into the name of the Lord before they could receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>3 Regarding Revelation 3:5, it is possible to have one's name erased from the book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must differentiate between not being written in the book of life and having one's name erased from the book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A person who never gets saved or regenerated does not have his name written in the book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A person whose name is erased from the book of life is saved and regenerated, but he is not an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The former perishes for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The latter does not participate in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The last part of Revelation 20 refers to eternity; Revelation 2 3 refers to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Parts omitted.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The slave of Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Watchman Nee</S>
