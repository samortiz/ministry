   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHOKING AND KILLING THE MEMBERS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The traditional way has not only bound and annulled the spiritual function of the members of Christ but also has choked and even killed the living members of Christ for all the time in the past history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the one hand, the traditional way feeds people, but on the other hand, because of the clerical class, in many aspects it frustrates the believers from growing in life and even chokes them to death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, most of the believers are spiritually dead in their church services.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although we have left organized Christianity, its traditional way to meet and to serve still influences us to quite an extent, and we are even under its bondage, without any awareness of its damage to the Body of Christ, which we are endeavoring to build up by all its members functioning in each one s measure Eph 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>HAVING NO POSSIBILITY</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>OF BUILDING UP THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to Ephesians 4:11-12, Christ, the Head, has given us the gifted persons, such as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verses 15 and 16 say, But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Out from whom means from Christ, the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the Body includes all the members of the Body, not just the gifted ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The operation in measure of each one part means that each member has a measure for God s operation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Each one part refers to every member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every member of the Body of Christ has its own measure which works for the growth of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the traditional way, can we see the building up of the Body of Christ mentioned in verse 12 or particularly in verse 16?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the traditional way of Christianity, we cannot see the function of every joint of the supply or the operation of each one part.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the contrary, the clerical class does their job while all the other members do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Can we see any proper building up of the saints in life and in their spirit according to the traditional way?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Can we see anything of the building up through every joint of the supply and according to the measure of each one part which causes the growth of the Body that the Body might build itself up?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is impossible for these things to be realized in Christianity s traditional way of meeting and serving.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although we are in the Lord s recovery, we must admit that we have not realized very much of the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have seen many local churches set up since 1962 when I came to the Western world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since that time, mainly through the publications of this ministry, I have seen six to seven hundred churches raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many local churches have been set up in South America, Central America, and in the Philippines.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The number of churches has increased, but the number within the churches is relatively small.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Very few churches exceed one hundred members.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are twenty churches in California and the number of churches has increased, yet I did not hear that the numbers had increased in most of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The number of churches has increased because people were helped to take this way through the publications of the ministry and stand in a locality to be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But where is the proper preaching of the gospel among us in the Lord s recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A certain number of churches have been raised up on six continents, but the preaching of the gospel has not been effective or adequate in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, the way we adopted to preach the gospel was the way we inherited from Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the past two years, we studied the statistics of all the major denominations in the United States and England.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many denominations have been decreasing in numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Southern Baptists have been increasing, but the rate of increase among them has been very low.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 1964, the Southern Baptists had approximately eleven million.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By 1986, more than twenty years later, they had only gained about four million.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Their rate of increase has been less than two percent a year.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If there had been a yearly increase of only ten percent among them, within this same period, they could have had nearly a seven-fold increase to about seventy-four million members.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The big denominations in England have been more greatly reduced than those in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In our fellowship in this chapter, we have seen that the traditional way to meet and to serve is accommodating the dead man s taste.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is a way of mixture, mixing the fleshly with the spiritual and the heavenly with the earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It binds and annuls the organic function of the living members of Christ cf.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>1 Cor 12:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It also chokes and kills the members of Christ cf.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eph 4:15 , leaving no possibility of building up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The old traditional way surely does not work well.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we use it, it will kill us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why would we not endeavor to use the biblical way, the way ordained by God?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is hard, but I believe that there is a way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we would cooperate with our able God, He will surely carry out His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I believe that within ten years something will be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Let us all endeavor.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Together we all must push the old way aside by endeavoring in the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we do this, we must do it wisely.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must exercise wisdom and patience, so that we do not lose very much.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But we also must realize that in changing anything, we do lose something.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There must be a transitional period.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>During the transition, we must walk slowly, carefully, and wisely so that we do not lose too much.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must try our best to reduce our losses.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Gradually, we will arrive at our destination.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Changing our way is like preparing a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>While the meal is being prepared in the kitchen, there is a mess; so it is best not to go into the kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is better to wait in the living room until the meal is prepared and set upon the table perhaps with a very colorful arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then we will admire the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I have been in the kitchen in Taipei for these past three years.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Unfortunately, some dear saints have crept into this kitchen and have seen the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Today, however, I would invite you to go and see something else in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the United States, the mess of the kitchen is still here.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Do not be disappointed or bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Simply go back to your place and endeavor wisely, slowly, and with much grace and patience.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord will be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must know the real situation, the real hardship, and the real thing that we must do.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must endeavor positively with full assurance, knowing that nothing can frustrate us because this scriptural way is something of the Lord that He will carry out.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As long as we cooperate with Him, He surely will use us to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must have the full assurance with much faith and be exercised in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We need to pray that the Lord will have a way through us to accomplish His heart s desire.</S>
