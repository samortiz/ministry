<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EPHESIANS 2:18</H2><P>Ephesians 2:18 speaks of our access through Christ [the Son] in one Spirit unto the Father. Why can we not come to the Father directly? Why do we have to approach the Father through Christ in the Spirit? We should not forget that the very God whom we are approaching is triune. As we have seen, none of the Three in the Divine Trinity would be individualistic. If we would come to the Father without the Son and the Spirit, the Father would not be happy. The Father desires that we come to Him through the Son and in the Spirit. Through God the Son who is the Accomplisher, the means, and in God the Spirit who is the Executor, the application, we have access unto God the Father who is the Originator, the source of our enjoyment.</P><P>Again, we need to realize that the Three of the Godhead are one. When They act, They act in oneness with one another. If we want to enjoy the Holy Spirit, we must love the Lord Jesus, the Son. When we say, "Lord Jesus I love You," we enjoy the Spirit. Furthermore, when we tell the Lord that we love Him, the Lord would secretly impress us within to obey the Spirit and honor the Father. He would lead us to worship the Father. The Father is seeking those who will worship Him in the Son and through the Spirit. The Father always likes to exalt the Son, the Son always likes to honor the Father, and the Spirit always likes to testify for the Son with the Father.</P><P>Ephesians 2:18 tells us that if we come to approach God our Father, our access must be through the redeeming Son and in the guiding Spirit. Then we reach the loving Father. When we have the Father, we have the Son. When we have the Son with the Father, we have the Spirit. Therefore, we have the Three of the Divine Trinity. We can never separate Them. The divine revelation of the divine economy shows us the Divine Trinity in all His excellencies, beauties, and virtues. These excellencies, beauties, and virtues are seen in the divine coordination in the Godhead.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TITUS 3:4-6</H2><P>Titus 3:4-6 also reveals the Divine Trinity in the divine move and in our experience. These verses speak of the kindness and love to man of our Savior God [God the Father] having appeared&#151;God the Father having saved us. He saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, poured out on us richly. This was through Jesus Christ [the Son] our Savior. This portion of the Word speaks of our Savior God and of Jesus Christ our Savior. These are not two Saviors, but one Savior in two aspects. Our Savior God is Jesus Christ our Savior. Our salvation was carried out by God the Father, by God the Son, and by God the Spirit. With God the Father there was kindness and love to man. Furthermore, He poured out the Spirit on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, God the Son. Then with the Spirit there is the washing of regeneration and the renewing. The salvation of the Triune God is a complete, entire, whole salvation. It includes the forgiveness of sins, redemption, justification, reconciliation, regeneration, and renewing. This renewing includes dispositional sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification. Our glorification will be the ultimate renewing. This is all carried out by the Divine Trinity in His divine move.</P>
