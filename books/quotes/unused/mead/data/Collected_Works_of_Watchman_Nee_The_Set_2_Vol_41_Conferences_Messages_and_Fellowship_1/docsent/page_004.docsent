   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MESSAGES AND FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>GIVEN IN FOOCHOW</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN 1934 CHAPTER ONE DELIVERANCE FROM SIN</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>AND FROM THE LAW Date: July 29, 1934</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Place: Foochow</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many people pay considerable attention to deliverance from sin, but they have no idea of what it means to be delivered from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why did Paul mention deliverance from sin, that is, being dead to sin in Romans 6 and then speak about deliverance from the law in chapter seven?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why do we have to be delivered from the law after we are delivered from sin?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is the difference between deliverance from sin and deliverance from the law?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What is the relationship between sin and the law?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Is there any correlation between deliverance from the law and deliverance from sin?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>TRUE DELIVERANCE FROM SIN ONLY BEING</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>REALIZED THROUGH DELIVERANCE FROM THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Romans 6:14 says that sin will not lord it over us because we are not under the law but under grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that we are first delivered from the law and then from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we are no longer under the law, sin will not lord it over us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet many believers turn this around.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They only pay attention to the matter of deliverance from sin and overlook the matter of deliverance from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sin and the law are linked to each another.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is analogous to the principle of Chinese medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Western medicine deals with a sickness either internally by medication or externally by surgery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But in Chinese medicine there is no such thing as an external treatment, because Chinese medicine only tries to deal with the root of illnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It does not independently tackle the outward symptoms of illnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sin is the outward symptom of a sickness, whereas the law is the root of the sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man sins because he is under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The law is the cause, while sin is the effect.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is useless for anyone to just deal with the outward effect without first dealing with the root cause.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many people have been troubled by the problem of sin for years and have been struggling without any success.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They have failed because they have only taken care of the matter of deliverance from sin without understanding the need to be delivered from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Romans 6 Paul told us how we can be delivered from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In chapter seven he goes on to say that it is not enough to just be delivered from sin; we must know how to be delivered from the bondage of the law as well.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, Romans 6 is the same as Romans 7, and Romans 7 is the same as Romans 6.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Chapter seven is necessary because something is left unresolved in chapter six.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Romans 7:8 says that "without the law sin is dead."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Strictly speaking, without deliverance from the law in chapter seven, there can be no deliverance from sin in chapter six.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only after we are delivered from the law can we be truly delivered from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE DEFINITION OF THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must next ask, "What is the law?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What is the definition of the law?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many people think that being delivered from the law is being freed from the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some may think that being delivered from the law is being freed from the ceremonial ordinances of the Old Testament, such as the statutes governing the priestly services.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They may also think that being delivered from the law is being freed from moral precepts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Actually, the removal of the letter of the law cannot keep anyone from committing sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God's demand on man in the entire Old Testament is summed up in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The law is God's demand on man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Keeping the law means that God has a demand and that we try to do His will and please Him according to our own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the New Testament, God has set the law aside and replaced it with grace.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God no longer asks man to do anything to please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is a very significant word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Keeping the law is doing something to please God, whereas being delivered from the law is no longer doing anything to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God has no intention for us to do anything by ourselves to please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we cannot get through on this point, we cannot get through on the matter of sin.</S>
