Whatever He planned, whatever He has accomplished, whatever He will apply to us is all wrapped up in this compound Spirit. Divinity is wrapped up in Him; Christ's humanity is also wrapped up in Him. His death, His redeeming, life-imparting death, is wrapped up in Him. His resurrection and His ascension are also wrapped up in this one compound Spirit who reaches us. Inwardly He is our light and life; outwardly He is our power.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD</H2><P>God has given us two great gifts&#151;the Spirit and the Word. The compound Spirit is the totality of the Triune God and all His doings. This is why I say that this compound Spirit, including His Word, is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God reaching us. The divine Person and the divine Word are wrapped up in this one compound Spirit. All the blessings, all the bequests, of the New Testament have been bequeathed to God's children. These bequests are also wrapped up in this one compound Spirit.</P><P>Two verses in the New Testament indicate that the Spirit and the Word are one. In John 6:63 the Lord says, "The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit." Also, Ephesians 6:17 refers to the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God. Not only is the word of the Lord the Spirit; the Spirit is also the Word.</P><P>This is why in Romans 10 Paul says that when you hear the preaching of the gospel, the word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart (v. 8). For many years I could not understand what Paul meant. How could the word be in my mouth and in my heart? Eventually the Lord showed me that whenever the New Testament is taught, preached, read, or studied by anyone with a sincere heart, the Spirit works with the Word. Through the Spirit the Word gets into your mouth. Through the Spirit the Word gets into your heart. Without the Spirit, the printed word could not get into your mouth and into your heart. When you exercise your spirit to pray over a verse of the Bible, that verse gets into your mouth and your heart. You should not read the Bible without praying. You have to read the Bible, the holy Word, prayerfully. You should not merely exercise your mentality to study the Word. You must come to the Word with prayer. You need not use your own words; pray the Word.</P><P>We all know that when we pray in this way, the word on the page gets into our mouth and our heart. We receive enlightenment, nourishment, watering, strengthening, comfort, and life supply. Also, the Spirit is applied to us as the consummation of the Triune God.</P><P>The Spirit and the Word work together. We should always touch the Bible by touching the Spirit. We should pray by reading, and read by praying. Then we shall enjoy the Triune God. Our burden is not to argue or debate but to present the basic truth to God's people today that they may know that our God is actually the Triune God, not for us to understand but for us to enjoy. We are presenting the truth to help the saints know that our God is triune for us to partake of Him, enjoy Him, and experience Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HUMAN SPIRIT</H2><P>We also emphasize the human spirit (Zech. 12:1; Prov. 20:27; Rom. 8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22). Just as we have a mouth and a stomach for our food, we have also a human spirit, which is our spiritual mouth and spiritual stomach. In a radio the receiver is crucial. We may have a beautiful, well-made radio, but if it does not have a receiver, it is empty. We are a "radio" to receive the divine riches into the "receiver" within us&#151;our human spirit.</P><P>We strongly emphasize these two spirits, the compound Spirit of the Trinity and the human spirit within us, because the compound Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God reaching us for our enjoyment, and the human spirit is the only means for us to receive such a rich compound Spirit that we may enjoy the riches of the Triune God and experience Him daily, even hourly. We are here for a testimony that all the people of God today may have a clear vision concerning the divine Trinity and that we ourselves may partake of Him and enjoy Him all day long.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Basic Revelation in the Holy Scriptures &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
