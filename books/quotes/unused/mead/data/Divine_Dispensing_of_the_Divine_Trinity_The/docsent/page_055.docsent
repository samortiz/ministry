   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Father s Selection and Predestination</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s Eternal Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For the dispensing of the Divine Trinity the Father first selected us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We were selected not only before we were born, but even before the foundation of the world v. 4 . In eternity, before time began, God the Father selected us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then He predestinated us, determining a destiny for us v. 5 . He determined this destiny beforehand; hence, it is a predestination.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Following His selection, God predestinated us unto sonship v. 5 . This means He destined beforehand that we may be His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sonship is a matter of life-dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a father has many sons, this means he has dispensed much life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God created only one man, Adam, as the forefather of the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But Adam s descendants number in the billions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the result of life-dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As human beings, we are here by life-dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, as members of Christ, we are here by God s life-dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some may say that the term life-dispensing is not found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word Trinity also is not in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, in the Bible there is the fact of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to speak of the fact, we need terminology.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the word Trinity was coined to denote the Triune Godhead of the unique God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Likewise, when we read the Bible and see that God has predestined us before the foundation of the world unto sonship, we need a proper definition of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have seen that sonship involves life-dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have a great Father who is rich in life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His capacity is universally great, and He has much life to dispense.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No one can tell how many millions of sons God has begotten.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In all this begetting He has dispensed His life into His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have a great Father who has dispensed much life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now you can understand why I say that Ephesians 1 has the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It has the dispensing because it has the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sonship is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our destiny is sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Praise the Lord that we have been predestined unto sonship!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our predestination unto sonship is through Jesus Christ and according to the good pleasure of His will v. 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sonship results in the praise of the glory of His grace v. 6 . God s grace has a glory, and glory means expression.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, when electricity is hidden, there is no light.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the electricity shines, it is expressed, and this shining is the glory of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Likewise, God s grace has a glory, and this glory is the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do you realize that the entire globe is full of the divine sonship, with the many sons of God?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Recently I bought two maps for my living room, and I put pins in every place where there is a church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What a glorious sight!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What are the churches?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are the totality, the aggregate, of all the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the sonship, and the sonship is the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the sonship is to the praise of the glory of God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the glory of the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At one time we all were sinners and were scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But now we have been gathered together through the life-dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our Father has begotten us, dispensing His life into all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now we all have the divine life dispensed into us by our one Father.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This dispensed divine life is the factor that unites us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all are in the sonship, and this is a glory to His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the dispensing of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Son s Redemption the Accomplishment</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>of God s Eternal Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Father s selection and predestination are for God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now we come to the Son s redemption, which is for the accomplishment of the Father s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to traditional theology, the Father is the Father, the Son is the Son, and the Spirit is the Spirit, as three distinct and separate persons.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If this were the case, when the Son came, the Father would have remained in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But by reading the Gospel of John carefully, we can see that when the Son came, He came with the Father John 8:29; 16:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Son came not in His own name, but in the Father s name John 5:43 , and in Isaiah 9:6 is even called the everlasting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Son did the Father s work John 5:17, 19 , He did the Father s will John 5:30; 6:38 , He spoke the Father s word John 3:34a; 14:24; 7:16-17; 12:49-50 , He sought the Father s glory John 7:18 , and He expressed the Father John 14:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From these verses we can see that nothing was of the Son; everything was of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This means that when the Son came, the Father came.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Son and the Father are one John 10:30; 17:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Son was in the Father, and the Father was in Him John 14:10-11; 17:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When the Son spoke, the Father worked.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Son accomplished redemption through His blood and according to the riches of God s grace Eph 1:7-9a .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Son s redemption for the accomplishment of God s eternal purpose is unto a dispensation of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ Eph 1:9b-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What does it mean for all things to be headed up in the Son?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We may use the human body as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As long as we are alive, all of our members, including our feet, legs, and hands, are headed up.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But if we die, the members will become detached.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This indicates that the heading up depends on the uniting of life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The life in our body is the means by which all the members are headed up.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When the life goes, there is no longer any heading up.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After God created Adam, He put him before the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But Adam partook of the other tree, the tree of death Gen 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>At that time death came into man.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Because man was the representative of the whole creation, his death caused all of creation to lose the heading up and become scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Through the Son s redemption, the divine life has been dispensed into His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This life that has been dispensed into them unites all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Christ as the Head with this uniting life thus heads up all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This heading up is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>However, because many believers still live in the old creation, they are detached.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They have no oneness, no uniting, which means they have no heading up.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We must learn how to live by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>As long as we live by this divine life, we are united.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This uniting life is used by Christ the Head to head us up into one church life.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This heading up of the church will spread until the time of the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>At that time there will be the New Jerusalem, which will be the center of God s ultimate heading up.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Then there will be the dispensation of the fullness of time.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Dispensation here means arrangement or management.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In eternity all things in heaven and on earth will be headed up in Christ through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Many Christians today are not headed up because they are short of the dispensing of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is the reason it is our burden today in the Lord s recovery not to teach mere doctrines, but to dispense the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Through this life-dispensing, saints from many countries around the globe become one.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>What has brought about this oneness?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It is the life-dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Life-dispensing heads us up.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is the result of Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Christ s redemption takes away our sin so that death may be swallowed and that all the members may be headed up through the life-dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In Christ we also were made an inheritance Eph 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Furthermore, the Son s redemption for the accomplishment of God s eternal purpose is unto the praise of God s glory v. 12 . After the Father s dispensing in verse 6, Paul says, To the praise of the glory of His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Then after the Son s dispensing, Paul says, To the praise of His glory.</S>
