   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S CORPORATE EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God has only one image, and since His image is one, He can only have one expression.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are many thousands of Christians on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How then can so many be just one expression of God?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The answer is in God's building!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must have the building.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I do not have words to express what is on my heart concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is a vision open to me continuously day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, negatively, it is impossible for any single individual to express God in a full way; then, positively, the proper and adequate expression of God must be a coordinated, corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Remember, God's desire and purpose is that He be expressed and represented through man on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But this is possible only when we are being mutually coordinated and built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then God will be fully expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Oh, we must be built up with other Christians as a corporate expression, representing God!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's first created man failed to be His one expression, but the principle still holds: the other man created by God the new man is to be that all-inclusive, corporate man, God's real expression on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let us be more practical.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christians talk much about being like Jesus, glorifying God, and expressing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But it is impossible for any individual to glorify God or express Christ in a full way if he is not built up with other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Consider ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All of our problems are due to one thing: we are too independent and individualistic; we are disconnected and isolated from others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>So we are beset with failures and weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do you have a certain besetting sin which you cannot overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You will never surmount it or overcome it by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You must forget your own efforts and pay full attention to being built up with others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we are willing to be vitally related and built up with others, we will find that our weaknesses and shortcomings will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must learn to pay attention to one thing: being built up with other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the early years of my Christian life I did not see this building principle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I was struggling and striving, seeking and fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One day the Lord opened my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I saw that there was no need for me to struggle, fight and toil any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I need only abide in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As long as each member of my physical body abides in the body, everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose your hand is isolated and separated from your body; yet it continues with great effort to live and function, to be healthy and useful!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suppose someone should ask the severed hand, "What are you striving for ?" and it replies, "Oh, I must strive to be healthy, to overcome all the germs, etc., etc."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such a supposition is absurd in the extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yet this is the case of most Christians today, probably including yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yes, we are Christians, but we are not actually related to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are members of Christ's Body, but we are not fitly framed together.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are materials, but we are not built up together as God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Oh, we must forget our personal struggles and just abide in the Body!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A misplaced, detached hand is not only useless it is ugly and terrifying!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let us forget our striving and just pay attention to being vitally related to Christ's Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then the germs will be killed, and we will be living and powerful, healthy and functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We will not merely be useful, but fully useful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Soon after I became a Christian, I read numerous articles concerning the victorious life and how to overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I tried to apply what I learned; yet the more I tried, the more I failed!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I became very disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But one day the Lord opened my eyes to see that Christ is within me as my life, that I am a member of His Body, and that there is no need for me to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then I deeply appreciated that Christ was my life, and that I was in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From this realization I experienced victory continually.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There was no need to strive.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The whole Body enriched me and strengthened me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I realized I was a member of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the end of Scripture, as its conclusion, there is one city.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>And this city is the building, the unique, universal expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God always has only one expression.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As in Genesis 1, there is only one man, so at the end of Scripture there is only one city, built of gold, pearls and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>An independent Christian can never be a real, full expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we cut off our ear, it is an expression only of death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If I come upon a heap of ears, I will be terrified.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yet there are so many Christians today just like this, frightening people away.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They are "nice" Christians, but practically speaking they are separated and isolated from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As Christians, can we point out other definite members of the Body of Christ with whom we are related in a practical way?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is not a matter of doctrine or ethereal "spirituality"; it is a matter of practical reality.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Check yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you are an isolated member of the Body, you are burdened with many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The only way to be a victorious Christian is to be a related Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we come to the Body, we find that all the besetting sins are under our feet!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The issue is not whether we are a living, healthy, or functioning, individual Christian; but are we vitally and practically related to the Body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is a pity, but it is a fact that very little is heard today regarding the building of God and the real relatedness of the Body of Christ on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I do hope that we all may see that it is God's intention to have a corporate man as a building, a unique expression, with so many members fitly framed together, members related and built up as one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then, wherever we are, we will enjoy all the riches of the Body.</S>
