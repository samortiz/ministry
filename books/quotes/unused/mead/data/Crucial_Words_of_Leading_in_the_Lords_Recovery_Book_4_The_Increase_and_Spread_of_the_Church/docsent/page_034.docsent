   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Preaching the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Third, we should focus on the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We not only need to sustain and retain our existing saints and recover dormant saints, we also need to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning these three matters, we should not focus only on the first matter with the thought that it must be completed before we address the second matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must focus on all three matters at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Retaining existing ones, recovering dormant ones, and preaching the gospel are three things that small groups should do at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE CONTENT OF</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE SMALL GROUP GATHERINGS Mutual Fellowship The Flow of the Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The content of the small group gatherings involves mutual fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Greek the word fellowship conveys the meaning of flowing, being in agreement, linking up, and communicating.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, fellowship is a flow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, the circulation of the blood in the body is a kind of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, the electric current in a lamp is a kind of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When there is no flow of electricity, a lamp stands alone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But once a lamp is connected to the electrical current, it is connected not only to the power plant but also to other lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As believers, we have the Spirit of God and the life of God in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today the life of God and the Spirit of God are flowing within us continually.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have this flow, and even those who have not been meeting for a long time have this flow.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many dormant saints say, I have not been meeting for many years, and I am embarrassed to go back.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This sense of embarrassment proves that they still have God s life in them; they are still breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It also proves that they have the sense of life within them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, there is still hope for them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This hope is related to the flow of life, which is also the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Being Gathered into the Lord s Name</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we gather together in the groups, we should believe that the Lord is in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From the day we were saved, He came into us with His life, and He has never left.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, we can also stand on His promise in Matthew 18:20: Where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must acknowledge and grasp this privilege.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The small groups are gathered into the Lord s name, not into my name or into your name.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we are gathered into the Lord s name, we have the position to say, Lord, You must be in our midst because this is Your word in Matthew 18:20.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to learn to speak words based on the spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, if only three people come to a small group gathering, we should not say, How pitiful!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are only three people in our small group gathering tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must count the Lord Jesus and not forget Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In doctrine, we know and believe that the Lord is in our midst when we meet.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In practice, we need to count the Lord Jesus as one of the attendants.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not count Him, our understanding is based on doctrine rather than reality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From now on, when we report our numbers, we should include the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we have one hundred eighty people, we should add the Lord Jesus and report one hundred eighty-one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If there are two thousand six hundred eighty, we should add the Lord Jesus and report two thousand six hundred eighty-one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is not a small matter; we must realize that counting the Lord Jesus makes a world of difference.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is not a matter of doctrine but of practice.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we gather together, He is listening as well as speaking because He is listening and speaking in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since He is with us, we should count Him among the number of attendants.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Each time we come to a gathering, it is not to conduct business, not to eat hot pot, and not to make friends or seek assistance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We come to seek the Lord Jesus, that is, to be gathered into the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once we have this faith, we can say, Lord, we thank and praise You.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This small gathering is connected to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You are on the throne, in our midst, and even in us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must have this faith and make this declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Being Enlightened and</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Supplied through Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once we make this declaration, we are in the fellowship, just as turning on a lamp switch causes the electrical current to flow and the light to shine in all directions.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once we are in this condition, we will be in the light and not engage in idle talk; rather, we will be able to speak of our real condition spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For example, a brother may testify, I am truly blessed to participate in this small group.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord is with me every day.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In our last gathering, a brother said that we should have at least ten minutes of morning watch with five minutes of prayer and five minutes of reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I went home and practiced this, and it was truly helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Throughout the day I had the Lord s presence, and the Lord s word was moving in me continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This fellowship has been a real enjoyment to me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In particular, after ten minutes of fellowship with the Lord this morning, I had no desire to argue with my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I was truly happy, so I hurried to come here tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When the brother finishes speaking, we should not merely nod our head and smile, thinking that this testimony is good but not saying anything.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to see that fellowship is not one-way traffic.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Others should spontaneously continue to share.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need to learn in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A young sister may offer a prayer: O Lord, may You give us grace so that, like this brother, we can all grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This two-way traffic is fellowship; in this way everyone is supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Mutual fellowship is truly better than merely listening to messages.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Listening to messages is similar to eating only white rice during a meal; there is not much variety in flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we have a meal, we always have other dishes in addition to white rice.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The two-way traffic in fellowship is similar to pickled vegetables, which stimulate one s appetite during a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>After the young sister has prayed, the Spirit may lead everyone to pray one after another, or another brother may say, I can testify that this is absolutely true.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I have been practicing praying for five minutes and reading the Word for five minutes in the morning for several months.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I feel very blessed, and now I want to begin to pray for ten minutes and read the Word for ten minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This testimony will be a strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The fellowship that follows could be endless.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>There may be strengthening prayers or testimonies that follow one after another.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Following this fellowship, the entire gathering will open up.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>After half an hour of fellowship, everyone will be full and satisfied, and when they part, they will yearn for the next meeting.</S>
