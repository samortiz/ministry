   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As Mediator of the New Covenant, Executing That Covenant, Which Is the New Testament, Enacted and Bequeathed to Us by His Death</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In His heavenly ministry Christ, as Mediator of the new covenant, is executing that covenant, which is the new testament, enacted and bequeathed to us by His death Heb 9:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Greek the same word is used for both covenant and testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A covenant is an agreement with some promises to accomplish certain things for the covenanted people, while a testament is a will with certain accomplished things bequeathed to the inheritors.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The new covenant consummated with the blood of Christ is not merely a covenant but a testament with all the things which have been accomplished by the death of Christ bequeathed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First God gave the promise that He would make a new covenant Jer 31:31-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then Christ shed His blood to enact the covenant Luke 22:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because these are accomplished facts promised in this covenant, it is also a testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This testament, this will, has been confirmed and validated by Christ's death, and it is being executed and enforced by Christ in His heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The promise of God's covenant is ensured by God's faithfulness; God's covenant is guaranteed by God's righteousness; and the new testament is enforced by the resurrected and ascended Christ in His heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is now in the heavens, living, divine, and capable of executing the new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nothing can frustrate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He, the living One, is able to execute the new testament in every detail.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As He executes the new testament, He makes every bequest contained in it available and real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What Christ is executing today is not merely the new covenant but the new testament, a will that was enacted by His death and bequeathed to us through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now in His heavenly ministry He is executing this will with all its bequests.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In ourselves we would never imagine that Christ today, the Mediator of the new covenant, is working to execute this covenant, which has become the new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to see this crucial aspect of Christ's work in His heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>10.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the Surety of a Better Covenant, Guaranteeing and Ensuring the Effectiveness of the New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the surety of a better covenant, Christ in His heavenly ministry guarantees and ensures the effectiveness of the new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hebrews 7:22 says, "Jesus has become the surety of a better covenant."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The root of the Greek word for "surety" means a limb, a member of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The meaning is that a member of the body pledges itself to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, the hand may pledge itself to the arm to do everything for the arm.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This pledge is a guarantee.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word surety in Hebrews 7:22 indicates that Christ has pledged Himself to the new covenant and to all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is the bondsman, the guarantee, that He will do everything necessary for the fulfillment of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ has pledged Himself to the new covenant and to all of us who are under the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, He guarantees and ensures the effectiveness of the new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Christ who has pledged Himself to the new covenant and to us and who guarantees and ensures the effectiveness of the new testament is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He will do everything and He can do everything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is the qualified, capable, and able surety.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is always available and prevailing to fulfill whatever He has guaranteed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, His pledging of Himself is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, the new testament cannot fail, because Christ is the surety.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everything included in the new testament will be fulfilled not by us but by Christ in His work as the surety of a better covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is not only the consummator of the new covenant; He is also the surety, the pledge, that everything in it will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sometimes as we read the Bible we may have doubts concerning certain items that are bequests in the new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may wonder if it is actually possible for us to experience these things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For instance, we may question if the Holy Spirit has actually been poured out economically upon all believers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because of Christ's work in His heavenly ministry as our surety we should not have doubts regarding anything in the new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the one hand, the Bible reveals all the accomplished facts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the other hand, as our surety Christ is guaranteeing and ensuring everything that is included in the new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, whenever we say "yes" to the items in the new testament, Christ will honor our affirmation of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is part of His work in His heavenly ministry.</S>
