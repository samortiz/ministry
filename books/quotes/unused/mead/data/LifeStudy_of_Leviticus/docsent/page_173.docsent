   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Being Holy to God and Not Profaning the Name of God, for They Offer the Offerings by Fire as the Food of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Leviticus 21:6 says, "They shall be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God, for they offer the offerings of Jehovah by fire, the food of their God; therefore they shall be holy."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 8 goes on to say, "You shall sanctify him, for he offers the food of your God; he shall be holy to you, for I Jehovah, who sanctify you, am holy."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This signifies that we, the ones who minister Christ to God as food for God's enjoyment, should separate ourselves to be holy unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As God's priests, we are actually God's "cooks."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For us to offer Christ to God means that we "cook" Christ as God's food for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to eat, and God also needs to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We eat what He cooks for us, and He eats what we cook for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As God's cooks, we should be a holy people, a people undefiled, so that we would not profane the name of our holy God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>D. Being Pure in Marriage</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verses 7 and 9 tell us that the priests were to be pure in marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This signifies that we, the New Testament priests, should be pure in our closest human relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must be pure in this relationship in order to keep the status of the holy priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>E. Having the Anointing Oil for the Priesthood</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 10a speaks of the priest "on whose head the anointing oil has been poured."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This signifies that we, the New Testament priests, have the anointing Spirit for our priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have been anointed with the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today this Spirit is not only within us but also upon us for our priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>F. Wearing the Garments of Consecration of the Priesthood</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 10b speaks of the priest "who has been consecrated to wear the garments."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This signifies that we should live a life that befits our priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here "consecrated" actually means inaugurated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Exodus 29 we see that when the priests were inaugurated, they were clothed with priestly garments, and from that time onward the priests wore the garments of their consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Garments signify our living, our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For us as God's priests today to wear the garments of consecration is for us to have a living that befits our priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>G. Not Disheveling the Head</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to verse 10c, the priest was not to dishevel his head.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This signifies that we should not be disobedient, unrestrained, or disorderly in our actions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Speaking typo-logically, we should keep our hair in good order and thereby show that we submit to God's headship, that we submit to our God in His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, we should be restrained in our walk, especially in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is wrong to speak in a loose way without restraint.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One who walks in the holiness of God is one who is continually ruled by God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, he is orderly in his daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In all that we do and say, we should be in good order.</S>
