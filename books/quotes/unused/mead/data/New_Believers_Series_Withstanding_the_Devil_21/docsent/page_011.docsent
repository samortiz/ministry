   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Believing That the Ascension of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Is Far above the Power of Satan</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Fourth, we must believe that the ascension of the Lord has put Him far above the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians 1:20-22 says, "Raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all...not only in this age but also in that which is to come; and He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that the Lord Jesus is already seated in the heavenlies and is far above all the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ephesians 2:6 says, "And raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is our position, the position of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus is resurrected; He is seated in the heavenlies far above all the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are raised up together with Christ and are seated together with Him in the heavenlies, far above all the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ephesians 6:11 and 13 say, "Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil...and having done all, to stand."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Chapter two shows us that we are seated together with the Lord in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Chapter six shows us that we need to stand firm.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Chapter two says that we need to sit, while chapter six says that we need to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What does it mean to sit?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To sit means to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It means that the Lord has overcome and that we can now rest in His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is what it means to depend on the Lord's victory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What does it mean to stand?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To stand means that spiritual warfare is not a matter of assault but of defense.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To stand does not mean to attack; it means to defend.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because the Lord has overcome completely, we have no need to attack again.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The victory of the cross is complete, and there is no further need to attack.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here we see two attitudes: One is to sit, and the other is to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To sit is to rest in the Lord's victory, while to stand is to withstand Satan and to stop him from taking away our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christian warfare is a matter of warding off defeat; it is not a matter of fighting for victory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have already overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We fight from the position of victory, and we fight to maintain our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are not fighting to win a victory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We fight from victory; victory is something that is in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The warfare spoken of in Ephesians is the warfare of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do not become overcomers through fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to distinguish between these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How does Satan tempt us?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He causes us to forget our own position and our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He blinds our eyes to our own victory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we give in to his tactics, we will feel that victory is far away and beyond our reach.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must remember that the victory of the Lord is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is so complete that our whole life is included in this victory!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once we believe, we overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Satan is defeated and we have overcome in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Satan wants to steal away the victory which we have gained.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His work is to taunt us to secretly find out if we still have the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we do not know that victory is already ours, we will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if we know our victory, his work will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, we counter the work of Satan with the work of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We withstand Satan through the Lord's manifestation, death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are standing today upon the accomplished work of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We do not need to try to overcome in any way when Satan attacks us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once we have the slightest thought of trying to overcome, we have failed, because our position is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How great is the difference between a person who tries to overcome and one who withstands by knowing that he has already overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To withstand the devil means that we withstand him by the victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This matter indeed needs revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to see the manifestation of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to see His death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to know all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As Christians we must learn to withstand the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must say to Satan under all circumstances, "Get away from me!"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>May God be gracious to us so that we may all have such a faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>May we have faith toward the four things the Lord has accomplished for us, and may we exercise strong faith to withstand Satan and reject his work upon us.</S>
