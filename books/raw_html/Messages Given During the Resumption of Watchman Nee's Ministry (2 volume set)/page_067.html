<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SERVICE IN THE BODY<br>AND<br>LISTENING TO OTHERS</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TALKS (8)</H1><P>Date:Morning, January 19, 1948<br>Place:Brother Cheng's home, Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF SPIRITUAL THINGS</H2><P>Man always pays attention to methods and ways. Actually, a way is just a law. God has no intention for us to know the methods, but He intends for us to have the knowledge of the spiritual things. At present, our knowledge concerning spiritual matters, such as loving the Lord or consecration of material things, is not genuine enough. It is not sufficient for a person merely to know that there is air and light; he has to have a genuine realization of what air and light are. In the past seven or eight years, many times we have probed for ways; we hoped to find out the proper way to do things. But what God is after is our genuine knowledge concerning Him and concerning spiritual matters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE BODY LIFE</H2><P>Service is not an individual matter; it is a corporate matter. The Bible uses the body as an illustration of this matter (1 Cor. 12:12-27). Any time a member is isolated, it becomes useless. The minute we mention the members, we think of their functions. As far as our function is concerned, we are the members, not the sons, the workers, or the brothers and sisters. We can be God's workers individually, and we can be brothers and sisters or children of God individually. But we cannot be members individually. The Bible mentions the Body in at least three places. They are 1 Corinthians 12, Romans 12, and Ephesians 4.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Will Being the Body of Christ</H2><P>Romans 12 first mentions consecration (v. 1). Next, it speaks of knowing the will of God (v. 2). After this, it speaks of the Body (vv. 4-5). Today, many people talk about Romans 12, verses 1 and 2, but they separate these verses from the Body mentioned in the following verses. The period after verse 2 should be removed, because verse 3 is connected to verse 2. Verse 2 mentions the will of God, and in verse 4 we see that God's will is the Body of Christ. Chapters one through eight of Romans speak of God's work, and chapters nine through eleven speak of God's mercy and selection. Based on His work and selection, we should consecrate ourselves to Him, and the goal is the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Coordination in the Body of Christ</H2><P>First Corinthians 12 speaks of the coordination in the church. Here we do not see individual members; we see only the Body. Paul used many words to explain this fact.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Every Member Coordinated in the Body</H2><P>Ephesians 4 also speaks of the Body. There we see that all the brothers and sisters need to coordinate together. For example, the mouth may be very useful, but it can only fulfill its function when it is coordinated in the body. A member is not the whole body. Some people may be "first-class" members, great members, but they are nevertheless members only. On the other hand, other people may be small members, but they can never be so small that they cease to be members. There is much that we can say about this. You can ask a medical doctor, and he will tell you that if the coordination in the body is out of order by a little, the body will be sick. Someone has once said that sickness is caused by the malfunction of the coordination in the body. Every member has to learn to coordinate with other members. This may cause one member to feel uncomfortable, or it may cause another member to feel uncomfortable. However, even if it involves bringing discomfort to ourselves, we must nevertheless not care only for ourselves. Almost all the mistakes committed by Christians are on this point. Once the Body is not comfortable, the supply will be gone. If we want to be coordinated together, we must ensure that the Body feels comfortable.</P>
