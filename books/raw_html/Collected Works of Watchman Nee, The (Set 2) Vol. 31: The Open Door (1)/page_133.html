<h2 class="head2">Nan-ning, Kwangsi Province</h2><p>In these days, so much has happened, but our God is faithful. What God Himself has ordained, no one can change. Therefore, even though we passed through the darkest, stormiest days, the victorious Lord still led us to this place. (We arrived in the afternoon of March 28.) The situation here is that the region from Nan-ning to Tsen-Nan-Guan belongs to us. Within this area there are three or four clinics. Sisters Chou and Lee went to work in Yi-Kou on the thirtieth. I will probably stay in the main clinic in Nan-ning. In the future it is possible that I will go away briefly for short periods. These two sisters will be mobile. I will still go to Siang-Tan tomorrow to return some articles. Then I will return to Nan-ning after a few days. I will report to you after I return.</p><p>The weak one in the Lord,<br />Chien Sin-sien<br />April 2<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Ch'ang-sha, Hunan Province</h2><p>Dear Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>My uncle (Liu Jing-si) has already arrived in Kuei-yang. (He arrived on March 31.) Thank the Lord! The Kuei-yang Hospital Admissions Department gave my uncle a job. My aunt and uncle left for Ch'ang-Teh on March 12. They waited two weeks in Ch'ang-Teh for a bus. On the twenty-sixth, they were able to buy direct tickets to Kuei-yang. God's arrangements are too marvelous! Thank Him! The bus from Ch'ang-sha to Ch'ang-Teh on the twenty-fifth (which was scheduled to go directly to Kuei-yang) had only four passengers. It stopped for the night in Ch'ang-Teh because the bus broke down, so my uncle and aunt were able to get tickets the next day. They had too much luggage, and the Highway Department was not going to allow them to take it all, but the four passengers had so little luggage that my aunt and uncle were allowed to take all of theirs. We really praise the Lord because He constantly graces His children. Kuo-Siang, Mei-jen, and Yu-jen are all safe. Please do not worry. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Chu-fei<br />April 7<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Chungking, Szechuan Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear X in the Lord:</p><p>We have received every issue of The Open Door. We thank the Lord that He has established you in this work. This type of publication is necessary now. Thank the Lord for giving it to us. We are sending X dollars, X dimes, and X cents for use toward the cost of printing. It is a small amount, but it represents our oneness with you. May the Lord bless your work more deeply. May the Lord be with you always. Amen. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Representing all the brothers and sisters in the church in Chungking,</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Lee Yun-sien, Tien Bi-sin, Liu Kuo-hwa<br />April 25<br />[Address omitted]</p>
