   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AS THE REALITY OF ALL POSITIVE THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we have seen, Christ is the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit and He is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is many other items, such as the reality of the plants mentioned positively in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is the real cedar tree Lev 14:4; 1 Kings 6:9 , the real hyssop Lev 14:4; Psa 51:7 , and the real henna flower S. S. 1:14, ASV . The chorus of #171 in Hymns says,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, like the pretty henna-flower,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In vineyards blossoming Thou art;</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Incomp'rable Thy beauty is,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Admires and loves our heart!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the time the Song of Solomon was written, the henna flower was used by women as a cosmetic.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should take Christ as our beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ is also the apple tree S. S. 2:3 . The word translated "apple" in Song of Solomon 2:3 is actually the word for a juicy and nourishing tropical fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to be beautified with Christ as the henna flower and nourished with Christ as the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Moreover, we can sit under His shadow to rest, enjoy, and relax S. S. 2:3 . Christ is also the plant of renown in Ezekiel 34:29.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is the reality of everything positive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Colossians 2:16-17 says, "Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is the reality of the Sabbath and the festivals in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is also our food John 6:32-35 , our drink John 4:10-14 , and our real joy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is the air, the breath, the soil, and our good land.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to remember Him as all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every week we have at least one meeting for the purpose of coming together to remember Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the Lord's Table we display His death for the remembrance of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to improve our praises at the Lord's Table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should pray, "Lord, You are our henna flower for our beauty, and You are the fruit for our nourishment."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not praise Him in this way, it indicates that we do not have the proper knowledge of Christ from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we have the adequate knowledge of Christ, we will praise Him adequately at His table.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because Christ is so many positive items, the church also becomes many items.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 4 of Hymn #203 says,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We're Thy total reproduction,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thy dear Body and Thy Bride,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thine expression and Thy fulness,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For Thee ever to abide.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are Thy continuation,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thy life-increase and Thy spread,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thy full growth and Thy rich surplus,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One with Thee, our glorious Head.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church is all these items because Christ is so much.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must remember what the Christian life is, who we are, and who Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then day after day we will be refreshed and revived.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We will be overcoming and victorious, and we will spread Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We will bear the responsibility to dispense Him to others, not only to sinners, but also to weaker, younger Christians.</S>
