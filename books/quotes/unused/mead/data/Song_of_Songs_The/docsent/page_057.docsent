   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION FIVE THE WORK OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>7:1-13 I. THE EQUIPPING OF THE WORKER 7:1-9a A. Recapitulation 7:1-5</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Song of Songs 7:1 says, "How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now the Holy Spirit answers the question posed in the previous section through the mouth of a third party.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Apparently, these are the words of a third party.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Actually, they reveal the mind of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first thing that is mentioned is her feet.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"O prince's daughter!"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This speaks of her noble origin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She is one of many in the royal household.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Bible, "shoes" clearly refer to "the gospel of peace" Eph 6:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The emphasis is on the preparation for work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, the first thing mentioned is her shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The work of evangelism is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"Thighs" refers to the power to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It means that the power to stand comes entirely from God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we want our thighs to be like jewels, the hollows have to be touched until they are out of joint Gen 32:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The power of work forever comes from God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the meaning of "the work of the hands of a cunning workman."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 2 says, "Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The navel and the belly refer to the maiden's inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Liquor" can be translated "mixed wine."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If liquor refers to the blood of the Lord Jesus, the heap of wheat must refer to His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are indeed those who eat His flesh and drink His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Mixed wine refers to the life that the Holy Spirit gives to us through the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The heap of wheat is set about with lilies, which means that we receive this wheat by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 3 says, "Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is no mention of feeding among the lilies in conjunction with the "two breasts."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, it does not refer to her growth before God, but to her ability to feed others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Faith and love in this verse are the measure and power with which we feed others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 4 says, "Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"Thy neck is as a tower of ivory."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is different from the previous mention of a "tower," when her neck was like the tower of David.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now she has been dealt with by God; therefore, her neck is like ivory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But this does not mean that she is passive.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When she has to stand for God, she is as strong as a tower.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, this tower is a tower of ivory, which speaks of suffering and dying for the accomplishment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"Thine eyes like the fishpools."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is different from the previous description of doves' eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A pool is not hidden from light like a well, and it is not flowing like a spring.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A pool is open to the light, but it is also quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In other words, it is still water.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For eyes to be like a pool means that such a one is pure in heart before God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not only is there no more mixture, but there is complete rest.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Consequently, the maiden knows God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"Heshbon" means intelligent, while "Bath-rabbim" means the daughter of many.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The nose has not been spoken of until now.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The faculty of smell is found only with the mature ones.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In spiritual matters, many have bright eyes and sensitive ears.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But not many have a nose that can smell.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This sense does not come from spoken words or visible things; it is an inward ability that reaches beyond senses and words, which enables a person to differentiate good and bad smells.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is a kind of spiritual intuition that enables a person to identify the things that are of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is not by reason or logic, but by a spontaneous and inwardly accurate feeling, which enables a person to discern spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At the same time, this olfactory sense enables a person to identify bad smells as well.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many teachings cannot be considered wrong, and many people have nothing that others can find fault with, yet you sense that something is off.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This sense is what the nose is all about.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"Thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This speaks of its height and sharpness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today there are too many Christians with a flat nose.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Verse 5 says, "Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the King is held in the galleries."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Mount Carmel is where Elijah demonstrated his power in the presence of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There he fought for God, and God heard his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For the head to be like Carmel is for the mind and heart to be for God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The "hair of thine head" again refers to the power of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But this power is strong enough to hold the King in the galleries.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This means that the believers are empowered by the Lord and strong enough to control Him and force Him to answer their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At the initial stage of the maiden's development, she could not have this experience; God could not commit such power to her.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Only after she has been fully delivered from herself, her consecration and power of obedience have been fully put under the Lord, and she is filled with the thought of the Lord's glory to the extent that her hair becomes purple, would God dare entrust her with the power that enables her to imprison the King.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Actually, the King is not imprisoned by her, because she holds the King in the galleries for the purpose of accomplishing His own will and for the fulfillment of His own promise.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>She constantly prays to the King, "Accomplish Thy plan, and act according to Thy word."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>She has learned to sit on the throne and to control everything.</S>
