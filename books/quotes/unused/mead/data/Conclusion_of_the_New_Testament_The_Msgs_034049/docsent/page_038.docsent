   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Light in the Temple</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to Psalm 36:8 and 9 and Ephesians 5:14, Christ is the light in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Psalm 36:8 and 9 we have the fatness, the pleasures, the life, and the light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we enjoy the fatness of God s house and drink of the river of His pleasures, we are brought to the fountain of life, and this life becomes the light John 1:4 in which we see light.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Lord s light we see light.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is not some kind of natural light.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is Christ as the light in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may enjoy Christ as light outside God s house, the temple, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But we need to go into the house of God and there enjoy Christ as the inner light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today Christ as this inner light is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the church we sense that we are under the Lord s shining.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, this shining should not merely be outward; it should be a shining deep within our being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, we are the temple, and Christ is the light in the inner chamber of this temple, our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is light and in our spirit we see this light.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the fulfillment of Psalm 36:9b, Ephesians 5:14 says, Christ shall shine on you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ shines not only over us but also in us as the light of life John 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>39.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Dwelling Place of God s Chosen People</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is also the dwelling place of God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Psalm 90:1 says, Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the eternal God, Christ is our habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may find in Him our everlasting home.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To Him, a thousand years are but as yesterday when it is passed and as a watch in the night v. 4 . Such a One is the dwelling place of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First John 2:24, the fulfillment of Psalm 90:1, says, If that which you heard from the beginning abides in you, you will abide both in the Son and in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Greek word translated abide means not only to remain or stay but also dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may abide, dwell, in the Son with the Father, taking Him as our abode.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The same thought is in John 15:4, where the Lord says, Abide in Me and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This verse speaks of a mutual abiding: we abide in the Lord, and the Lord abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord s word in John 15:4 is based on John 14:23, where we have the mutual abode made by the appearing of the Father and the Son as the Spirit to the believer who loves Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This abode is prepared by the visitation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His visitation makes us His abode, and it makes Him our abode.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, He and we become a mutual abode.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the reality of Christ as the dwelling place of God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>40.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Wisdom</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Proverbs 8:1 and 12 and 9:1 speak of wisdom, the reality of which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Matthew 11:19 the Lord Jesus, referring to Himself says, Wisdom has been justified by her works.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Wisdom is Christ 1 Cor 1:24, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whatever Christ did was done by the wisdom of God, which is Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This wisdom was justified, vindicated, by His wise deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Matthew 11:19 some authorities read children instead of works see Luke 7:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Being children is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are not students of wisdom caring merely for the knowledge of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are children of wisdom caring for the life of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because we have the life of Christ we have the life of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As children of wisdom, the believers in Christ justify Christ and His deeds and follow Him as their wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First Corinthians 1:24 says that Christ is God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In God s economy the crucified Christ is God s wisdom for planning and purposing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In 1 Corinthians 1:30 Paul goes on to say that Christ has become wisdom to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once we believed into Christ and God put us in Him, Christ became wisdom to us in three vital matters: righteousness for our past, sanctification for our present, and redemption for our future.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The words to and from indicate a transmission to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the way of a living, on-going transmission Christ should continually become wisdom to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to 1 Corinthians 2:7 Christ is God s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which has been hidden, which God predestined before the ages for our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Unlike human, worldly wisdom, which is open and shallow, God s wisdom is hidden and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As God s wisdom, Christ is the hidden mystery Col 1:26-27 foreordained before the ages for our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In eternity God decided that Christ as His wisdom would be our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now day by day Christ is becoming wisdom to us from God.</S>
