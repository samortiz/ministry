        <h2 class="head1">ONLY THE LORD JESUS BEING SINLESS<br />
YET NOT CONDEMNING MAN</h2>
<p>Only the Lord Jesus is sinless and qualified to condemn man, yet He did not condemn the woman. The Lord Jesus asked the crowd who opposed Him, &ldquo;Which of you convicts Me of sin?&rdquo; (v. 46). Here we see a stark contrast. A large crowd surrounded the Lord Jesus to ensnare Him. When He countered their question by asking who is without sin, they could not stand. They sensed their sinfulness and fled. Eventually, the Lord Jesus stood before the crowd and asked, &ldquo;Which of you convicts Me of sin?&rdquo; Dare we ask such a question? If we would ask such a question, I believe that all our acquaintances would testify against us. However, when the Lord Jesus confronted His opposers and faultfinders, no one could testify of any sin in Him. This proves that in the universe He alone is sinless.</p>
<p>Since the Lord Jesus is the only sinless One, only He is qualified to condemn others. The self-righteous scribes and Pharisees condemned others, but they too were sinful before God; they were not qualified to condemn others. In the universe only the Lord Jesus is without sin; therefore, only He is qualified to condemn us. Even though the Lord is qualified to condemn us, He said to the woman, &ldquo;Neither do I condemn you&rdquo; (v. 11). God did not send Him into the world to condemn the world but &ldquo;that the world might be saved through Him&rdquo; (3:17).</p>
<p>The scribes and Pharisees left one by one because their conscience was convicted. Only the sinful woman and the Lord Jesus were left. She probably thought, &ldquo;I escaped the condemnation of one group of people, but I may not escape the condemnation of Jesus.&rdquo; She might still have been in fear and trembling, waiting for judgment. In that quiet and tense atmosphere, the Lord Jesus stood up and asked, &ldquo;Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?&rdquo; (8:10). The Lord Jesus seemed to say, &ldquo;These people caught you in order to condemn you, but where are they now? Have they all gone away because of my question to them? No one remains to condemn you.&rdquo; In response to the Lord&rsquo;s question, &ldquo;Has no one condemned you?&rdquo; the woman answered, &ldquo;No one, Lord&rdquo; (v. 11). Her reply was short, but it is very meaningful. She did not call the Lord Jesus &ldquo;Teacher,&rdquo; like the scribes and the Pharisees (v. 4). She called the Lord Jesus &ldquo;Lord.&rdquo; She must have called Him Lord because she had observed that He was extraordinary. She saw that the scribes and the Pharisees, who were respected by all, could not stand up to just one question from Jesus. She saw how they came with a haughty and imposing air to question the Lord Jesus and sentence her to death. But they all left when He questioned them. She saw that the crowd wanted to deal with Him but that instead they were dealt with by Him and had lost their footing. Therefore, she must have thought that Jesus was an extraordinary man with authority over people. Hence, she called Him &ldquo;Lord.&rdquo; When she called Him &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; she acknowledged that He is the Lord.</p>
<p>She might have thought that although those people did not condemn her, the Lord would. She must have been quite fearful, waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s condemnation. To her surprise, however, the Lord Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Neither do I condemn you.&rdquo; Please pay attention to the word <em>neither.</em> The Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, &ldquo;None of them condemned you, and <em>neither</em> do I condemn you. They did not condemn you, because they are sinful. They sinned and are sinful; therefore, they cannot condemn you. I am without sin, and I have never sinned. I could condemn you, but <em>neither</em> will I condemn you.&rdquo; This must have given such comfort and release to that sinful woman who was in fear and trembling. It was the gospel, a tiding of great joy, to her.</p>
<p>What sweet words: &ldquo;Neither do I condemn you&rdquo;! What a loving voice! This is truly the gospel. The <em>I</em> in <em>neither do I condemn you</em> is the God of heaven. He became a man, came to the earth, stood in front of a great sinner, and said to her, &ldquo;Neither do I condemn you.&rdquo; No one in the human race is qualified to condemn man but the Lord Jesus. However, neither does He condemn us. This is the gospel! Although He is able to condemn, He does not condemn. Do you sense that you are sinful? Are you grieved and sorrowful over your sins? Does your conscience convict you? Please listen to the words of the Lord Jesus: &ldquo;Neither do I condemn you.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONLY THE LORD JESUS BEING ABLE TO FORGIVE SINS<br />
AND TO SAVE MAN FROM SIN AND DEATH</h2>
<p>Only the Lord Jesus can forgive sins and save man from sin and death. The Lord Jesus&rsquo; not condemning man&rsquo;s sins is His forgiving of man&rsquo;s sins. He is the righteous God, who can condemn man&rsquo;s sins according to His righteousness, but He bore man&rsquo;s sins on the cross, suffered the penalty of death on man&rsquo;s behalf, and satisfied the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness. Therefore, He, and He alone, can forgive man&rsquo;s sins.</p>
<p>John 8 also reveals that only the Lord Jesus can deliver man from sin. The Lord Jesus could have condemned the adulterous woman, but He did not condemn her. This was His forgiving her of her sins. The Lord not only forgave her sins, but He also said, &ldquo;From now on sin no more&rdquo; (v. 11). The Lord&rsquo;s word meant that He would deliver her from sin so that she would sin no more. The Lord Jesus can set man free so that man is free indeed. He can save, release, and deliver man from sin so that he is no longer a slave of sin under the authority of sin and no longer bound by sin.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus also said, &ldquo;If anyone keeps My word, he shall by no means see death forever&rdquo; (v. 51). This is to never taste death. This means that only the Lord Jesus can save man from death. He can forgive us our sins and save us from the power of sin so that we are no longer in sin and therefore will not die in sin. The taste of death will leave us. Therefore, the Lord can save us from sin, and He can also save us from death. His salvation is perfect.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
