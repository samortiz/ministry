   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Kingdom of Christ 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Authority and Kingship of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ's victory brings in the kingdom v. 10 . Even on earth today, wherever there is a victory, there is also a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ ascended to the heavens, and there He was given all authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There He also received the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we have the divine sight, we shall see that the entire earth is the kingdom of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The nations today use Christ's calendar.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to history, the kingdom belongs to the one whose calendar is used.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The fact that the nations use Christ's calendar indicates that they are His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even the nations who oppose Christ follow His calendar.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this reason, Christ may laugh at them and say, "Although you oppose Me, you are using My calendar.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way you are recognizing Me as your King."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is the King, and everyone is under His rule.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you do not believe this, I would ask you to wait for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually you will see that the whole earth will be the kingdom of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ has been commissioned with all the authority in heaven and on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This should not be merely a doctrine to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must realize that we are under His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 10 says, "The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is correct to translate the Hebrew word rendered "scepter" as "authority."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To say that the scepter will not depart from Judah means that the authority will not depart from Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The scepter here signifies royal, kingly authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ has this authority, and we all must come under it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We, the kingdom people, are under the heavenly ruling of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We Christians also need to learn how to exercise the authority of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we face certain hardships and difficulties, there is no need to pray in a begging way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead, we should pray with the exercise of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the children of Israel were pursued by the Egyptians, the Lord told Moses to lift up his rod and stretch out his hand over the sea Exo 14:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moses did so.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That was an exercise of divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Likewise, instead of begging, we should exercise the authority of our King and command the difficulties to flee.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because we are under the heavenly ruling, we have the position and the right to speak to difficulties, hardships, and attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may say to them, "You must flee.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I do not allow you to remain."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all must learn to exercise such authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to exercise this authority we must first be under the ruling of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we are rebellious and command Satan to flee, he will say, "Who are you?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I will not obey you because you don't obey Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As one who does not obey his King, you have no position to command me."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we must be the obedient kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our obedience gives us the position to exercise the King's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the kingdom everything has been accomplished, every enemy has been defeated, and every problem has been solved.</S>
