   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE EIGHT THE GROWTH IN LIFE 4 Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2, 10, 6, 11, 13, 4 PUTTING TO DEATH THE PRACTICES OF THE BODY BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 8 speaks about the processed Triune God as the Spirit of life v. 2 dispensing Himself into the transformed tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the Spirit of life, who is the consummation of the Triune God, enters into us, He enters into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By this He makes our spirit life v. 10 . Then when our mind, the main part of our soul, is set on the mingled spirit, our mind is also made life v. 6 . When this Spirit of life in our spirit reaches through our mind to our body, He gives life to our mortal body v. 11 . This is to make our body life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 13a says, "For if you live according to flesh, you are about to die."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To live according to the flesh is to live according to what we are in our old man, whether it is good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What we are in our old man may be very good.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may be someone who loves others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, even if we love others, this love comes out from our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul did not say, "For if you live according to lust, you are about to die."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lust denotes the ugly and sinful things, the bad things of our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To drink wine excessively is according to lust.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, to drink a cup of pure water is not of lust, but it may still be out of our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the gospel was preached to us, we were dead persons Eph 2:1, 5; Col 2:13 needing to be made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because our self is death, if we live according to our self, regardless of what we do, we are about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To eat several meals a day is right, but most people eat according to their flesh, that is, according to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more they eat in this way, the more they die.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to their flesh, everyone is dying every day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The more they live, the closer they are to death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Romans 8:13b says, "But if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to put to death the practices of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To put to death the practices of the body is to crucify them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot do this by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can only do it by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One can kill himself in many ways, but one cannot crucify himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Crucifixion must be carried out by another person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is by the Spirit that we put to death the practices of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that we must hand ourselves over to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We cannot crucify ourselves, but we can hand ourselves over to another One.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This One is the one closest to us because He is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is in our spirit, and to some degree He is also in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is within us, He is one with us, and we are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we say, "I hand myself over to You, dear Lord," He will crucify us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not to be religious; it is not merely to pray and repent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By handing ourselves over to the crucifying Spirit, the killing Spirit, we are terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then we will walk according to the spirit, and the Spirit who dwells in us will give life to our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must learn to experience Christ to such an extent that we would not even allow our body to do good things apart from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When our body tries to do good things independently, we should say, "Lord, crucify the practices of the body."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not go anywhere or do anything according to our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, we should have our being according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to do everything, whether good or bad, according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should constantly hand ourselves over to the crucifying Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then we will be living, always enjoying Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Romans 8:4 says that we do not walk according to flesh but according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the issue of putting to death the practices of the body by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our walk includes all the items of our living, being, and thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must do everything according to the spirit.</S>
