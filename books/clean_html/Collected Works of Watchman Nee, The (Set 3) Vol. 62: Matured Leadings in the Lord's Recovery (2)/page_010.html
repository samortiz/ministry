<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO SERVE TODAY&mdash;THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</h2><h2 class="head2">The Brothers and Sisters<br />Handing Themselves Over and<br />the Elders Making Proper Arrangements</h2><p>Hong Kong is a big place; it needs a strong church to carry out the proper service. Recently I saw an Assembly of God Church preaching the gospel. There were not very many people in the meeting. Very close by there was a cinema packed with people. The Assembly of God Church had few people in comparison with the cinema. Hong Kong does not need a strong gospel giant, but it does need a strong church to rise up to preach the gospel. The whole Body has to rise up to serve. If the whole church rises up to preach the gospel, I believe the number in Hong Kong would increase to two thousand in half a year. In order for the whole church to rise up to serve, all the saints have to hand themselves over. After they have handed themselves over, they have to accept the arrangement of the leading elders. When all the building materials are ready, you can mobilize different departments to begin the building work.</p><p>The elders have to make a list of everything that has been handed over, including the people, things, and work. They have to make a list of personnel and match the work and personnel together. They have to find a practical way to carry out every matter. Once the work is clear, the personnel set, and the way finalized, they can proceed with the actual decisions. In carrying out the works, the elders have to exercise strict oversight. They have to set deadlines and standards. They have to decide how good a work needs to be and when it must be finished. If the elders can carry out these few things, mistakes and flaws will be minimized. If they do not know how to do something the first time, they should still try and look for a way. After they find the way, they will discover the law to doing that thing.</p><p>The way of the church is different from the way of the missionaries; it is the way of the whole Body serving. We all have a living physical body. This body works, lives, rests, and eats spontaneously. The service of the church is a Body service. It is natural and normal for it to save men and perfect them all the time. Perhaps one day you will see the church not only as a home to nurture people but as a school to train people, a factory to produce people, and a hospital to heal people. If the brothers will spend a little more time to fellowship and pray together, there will be good arrangements. Without proper arrangements, there will be setbacks, and it will be difficult to have a revival.</p><h2 class="head2">The Church Being<br />a Matter of the Entire Body Serving</h2><p>Watchman Nee: I do not want to add anything to Brother Lee's speaking for fear of diluting his words.</p><p>In the past all the churches tried to invite gifted co-workers to work, preach the gospel, and edify their saints. But I would ask a question: What is the church? The church is where everyone rises up to serve. The church is not just a few people like Witness Lee, Watchman Nee, and Peace Wang. Only when the entire Body rises up is there the church. The church is the Body of Christ, and everyone is useful. We should never think that we have the church as long as we have a wooden table to conduct the Lord's table or that we have the church as long as we have a few strong members. The church involves all the material, that is, all the one-talented ones coming together to serve. Not everyone has to be like Brother Lee before he can be a piece of material. The church is not a conglomeration of five-talented ones; it is not a corporation of two-talented ones. It is a Body composed mainly of one-talented ones. When men like you and I come together to serve, we have the church. When all the one-talented ones are coordinated together, that will be a potent force. Only by serving this way will we have a strong church.</p><p>You should not put your hope on better and stronger ones coming to join you. You can gospelize the place where you are with the number you have now. In a strong church a great evangelist would be treated just like one of the brothers. Suppose there is a church with two or three hundred people. There may not be any five-talented and two-talented ones. Perhaps all the saints are one-talented ones. You may think that something is lacking, but if all these so-called "untalented" ones would coordinate together, God would have a way to go on. Never think that you are too short. A person like yourself is more than qualified. I believe that the age of giants is over in the church life. Perhaps in the next generation, the so-called "giants" that we have now will disappear altogether. Today is the end time for giants. What God wants today is the service of the whole Body. Today God forbids any member from becoming too strong. What He wants is a strong church.</p><p>In the past when I read the Bible, I had strong doubts whether Ephesians 4 would ever be fulfilled. I was foolish to worry and be anxious for God. During the past few years, I have begun to feel that it is possible to fulfill Ephesians 4. Today God is doing the work of recovering the Body testimony. The gifts that He has given are for the perfecting of the saints for the ministry. One or two specially gifted workers no longer can fulfill the task; all the brothers and sisters can preach the gospel, heal the sick, edify the saints, and save the lost. The church can beget, be established, be trusted upon, be revived, and rise up to serve. It will be built up like the New Jerusalem and be strong.</p><p>I have never been satisfied in the matter of the whole Body serving. The church is short in everything. But one day something glorious will emerge. Our way is becoming more and more clear. Of course, our troubles will be more and more numerous. In 1939 we gathered together over thirty deacons in Shanghai and set up the deacons' office in the meeting hall. We began to have a structure or form for our service. No other place practices this yet. At that time we found in every place one man speaking and a few serving. In Shanghai we began to have over thirty people taking "shifts" in the deacons' office. Later Shanghai had some problems of its own. In 1940 the Lord continued this work in Chefoo. Although I was quiet outwardly, inwardly I kept praying. I was greatly encouraged when I saw that God worked in exactly the same way as He had spoken.</p>
