<h2 class="head1">A PROPER REALIZATION</h2><p>Whether or not we can exercise forbearance in difficult situations depends on the kind of realization and practice we have. If we realize that a particular situation is of the Lord, that it is needed to perfect us, and then thank Him for it, we shall not be anxious or threatened. We shall be able to say, &ldquo;Lord, I thank You for this. I am not threatened by this thing, because I know that I am one with You and that everything which comes to me is Your assignment. Lord, I also know that You allow this thing to remain that it may help You to fulfill Your purpose and to perfect me.&rdquo; If we realize that everything is the Lord&rsquo;s assignment and if we accept His will and thank Him for it, we shall be able to say with Paul, &ldquo;For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man is consumed, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day. For the momentary lightness of the affliction worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory&rdquo; (2 Cor. 4:16-17, lit.). Then we shall not have any anxiety.</p><p>Christians often say that the way to be freed from anxiety is simply to believe in the Lord. According to this understanding, the fact that a person is anxious means that he does not believe in the Lord. However, in 4:6 Paul does not say that it is by believing that we do not have anxiety in anything. In this context he does not say a word about believing.</p><h2 class="head1">SIX POINTS TO UNDERSTAND AND PRACTICE</h2><p>If we would be free from anxiety, we need to understand and practice the six points we have covered in the foregoing message and in this message. First, we need to realize that just as anxiety is the totality of human life, so forbearance is the totality of the Christian life. Second, we need to see that the source of forbearance is God and that the source of anxiety is Satan.</p><p>The third matter is to realize that forbearance and anxiety cannot exist together. The reason for this is that forbearance is actually a person, Christ Himself. Only when Christ is lived out of us do we have forbearance. This is indicated by the fact that in Philippians 1, 2, and 3 Paul speaks of Christ again and again. He emphasizes magnifying Christ, taking Christ as our pattern, and pursuing Christ as our goal. But in Philippians 4 he uses the term forbearance and charges us to make our forbearance known to all men. Actually, this forbearance is the very Christ revealed in the foregoing chapters. Therefore, to let our forbearance be known is to live Christ.</p><p>We have seen that God may assign certain sufferings to us. But although the sufferings are God&rsquo;s assignment, they do not come from God, but from Satan. The experiences of both Job and Paul illustrate this. The calamities assigned to us by God actually come to us from Satan. Satan is the messenger who brings these things to us. God assigned a certain thorn to Paul, and He permitted Satan to bring the thorn to him. Immediately after sending us a certain difficulty or affliction, Satan comes to cause anxiety. This anxiety is not assigned by God and it does not come from Him. On the contrary, it is always caused by Satan to frustrate God&rsquo;s purpose. If we have a full realization of this, we shall see the need for Christ as our forbearance. If we have this forbearance, we shall not have anxiety. But if we have anxiety, we shall not have forbearance.</p><p>The fourth matter we need to understand and exercise is that to have a life full of forbearance but without anxiety, we need to be one with the Lord in a practical way. To be one with the Lord experientially is to be in Him.</p><p>Fifth, we need to pray. This means we need to have a time of fellowship with the Lord and to worship Him. Prayer does not mean merely to ask the Lord for things. Prayer involves conversing with the Lord, communicating with Him in fellowship, and worshipping Him. As we spend time with the Lord in this way, we should make known our petitions with thanksgiving.</p><p>Sixth, after praying, having fellowship with the Lord, worshipping Him, and making our petitions known to Him, we shall know what the will of the Lord is. For example, if we are ill, we shall know whether the Lord intends to heal us or allow the sickness to remain. Once we know God&rsquo;s will, we should accept it, experience His sufficient grace, trust in Him, and thank Him. Then we shall have a life full of forbearance but without anxiety.</p>
