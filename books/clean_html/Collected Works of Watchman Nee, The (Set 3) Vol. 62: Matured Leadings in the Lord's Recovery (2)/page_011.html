<h2 class="head2">God's Requirement Being<br />for the Whole Body to Serve</h2><p>What I saw in 1949 was much more than what I saw in 1939. I saw that God intends for the church to become a solid and sure Body, an institution that brings salvation to men, and an entity that fights, edifies, and heals. Today the age of monumental achievements by great giants is over. God wants the whole church to rise up to serve. Today the brothers and sisters have handed themselves over to be material for the building. The elders and responsible brothers have to rise up to learn to make arrangements, to take the lead, and to build. This will make the church the multifarious serving Body to the Lord. Once this is in place, the church will be able to absorb five thousand or even ten thousand new ones. The Lord intends that each church in each locality bear the burden of the gospel as well as meet the need of the saints.</p><p>What do we mean by spiritual needs? It is the need the brothers and sisters sense within themselves when they rise up to serve the Lord. A church should never allow a brother to have this need before the Lord yet not satisfy his need. If a man is sick, you have to give him medicine, not food. If a man is without food, you have to feed him, not give him medicine. What is the church? The church is where the genuine need within the spirit of every brother and sister is truly met. The elders have to consider all the time. They have to bring the whole church to God. They have to bear all the brothers and sisters upon their shoulders and lead them to the Lord.</p><p>Today our goal is for the whole Body to serve. God's demand is great. He requires that we forsake everything to serve Him. Is there an organization on earth in which one is required to forsake everything and to sell all before he can join? Only the church requires a membership fee that comprises one's total possessions! This is an uncompromising demand. If we accept this uncompromising demand, and if we are willing to come forward and act upon it uncompromisingly, we will see uncompromising results.</p><p>In this universal service, everyone is active and aggressive. If only one person is passive, we do not have the church. Whether or not God's will is done rests entirely in our hands. Blessed are those who see and hear this word. If we see all these points clearly, we are most blessed.</p>
