   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jehovah's answer to Jeremiah, found in verses 26 through 44, is very interesting.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>into the Hand of the Chaldeans</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jehovah said that He was giving the city of Jerusalem into the hand of the Chaldeans, and Nebuchadnezzar would take it, because of the evils of Israel which she had done to provoke Him vv.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. Jehovah Gathering Israel Out</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>from All the Lands Where He Had Driven Them</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jehovah went on to say that although He had driven Israel in His wrath and in His great indignation, He would gather them out from all the lands where He had driven them and would bring them back to the holy land and make them dwell there in safety v. 37 . Here we see that Jeremiah came to know God's intention and that His intention, revealed in His word to Jeremiah, became His promise to the prophet.</S>
