I also believe that what I am going to fellowship with you in this message will be a help to all the saints in the Lord's recovery. I believe you have heard that beginning in September 1987 a group of brothers who had been among us for many years became very dissenting. In the past four years they have spoken and even written a number of things that are divisive and very misleading. During this time I adopted the attitude that I would not fight with them. Thus, I did not say much, but, on the positive side, I received a burden from the Lord to put out more and more messages on the divine Word. Beginning in the summer of 1988, after they had begun their conspiracy, my speaking increased. First, in 1988 I put out the Life-study of Leviticus. Then from 1989 through 1991, I released, consecutively, the life-studies of Numbers, Deuteronomy, Isaiah, Daniel and Zechariah, and Jeremiah and Lamentations. Presently, I am ready to finish the life-study of the Old Testament Prophets by covering the Minor Prophets in the coming summer training. During the same period, besides all the life-studies on these books of the Old Testament, I have held a number of conferences in different cities, including Seattle, Cleveland, Atlanta, Pasadena, San Diego, Taipei, Berkeley, and Anaheim. In all these conferences I passed on some crucial messages for the recovery.</P><P>In this message and the next I would like to take the opportunity to make the present situation in the Lord's recovery clear to all the saints. Then we will know where we are and will also know how to face the present situation. I say again that I have no intention to fight with anyone. For all the years of my ministry I have never done the Lord's work in the way of stressing things on the negative side. On the contrary, I have always done the work by ministering things on the positive side. Therefore, in this message what I am going to say is not something negative but something very positive.</P><P>In the previous message we covered four points of the prerequisite of the practice of the church life according to the God-ordained way. In this message we will continue with the fifth and sixth points.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. TO HAVE A CLEAR VIEW CONCERNING<br>THE PRESENT SITUATION OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>The fifth point of the prerequisite is to have a clear view concerning the present situation of the Lord's recovery. Since we are in the recovery, we should know the present situation of the recovery. We should not be indifferent but should know the real situation. This requires that we get into the intrinsic nature of every problem.</P><P>According to God's ordained principle in His creation, nothing can exist without two sides. Even a thin piece of paper has two sides. Not only so, but according to God's ordination, for many things to exist, they need not only two sides but also an outer covering and an inner reality. A walnut is a kind of fruit, but its appearance is tough and rough. The external shell of the walnut is not the real walnut. The real walnut is not the shell but the kernel. When we eat a walnut, we do not eat the shell; we eat the kernel. The shell of the walnut and the kernel of the walnut are two different things.</P><P>The book of Jeremiah may be likened to a walnut. I misunderstood this book for many years. When I first read it, I did not appreciate it. Nevertheless, there were two verses in Jeremiah that I could never forget. The first was 17:9, which says, "The heart is deceitful above all things/And it is incurable;/Who can know it?" From my youth I remembered that verse. It helped me not to trust any heart, including my heart, because man's heart is deceitful. The second verse is 13:23, which says, "Can the Cushite change his skin,/Or the leopard his spots?/Then you also may be able to do good,/Who are accustomed to do evil." This verse says that man's sinful nature is unchangeable. Jeremiah likens man's sinful nature to two things: the skin of the Cushite and the spots of the leopard. The fact that no one can change these two things indicates that man's sinful nature is unchangeable. While I was writing the outlines for the 1991 Winter Training on Jeremiah, I was forced to get into the kernel of Jeremiah intrinsically. It was then that the Lord showed me the intrinsic contents of this book.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Practice of the Church Life according to the God-ordained Way &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
