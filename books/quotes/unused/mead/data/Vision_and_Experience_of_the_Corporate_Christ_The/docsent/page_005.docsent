   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ s Corporate Body</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter 17 the Lord went on to pray that we all may be one one not in ourselves but in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 21 says, That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our oneness is the oneness in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Him we are one not only with Him but also with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our oneness is both vertical with God and horizontal with one another .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One day something very strange and marvelous happened to Saul of Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As a strong young man, he was persecuting the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He thought that Jesus had been killed and that His body had been stolen from the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, on the way to Damascus Jesus suddenly appeared to him and said, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Acts 9:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Saul asked, Who are You, Lord? v. 5 , he was saved, for Romans 10:13 says, Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then the Lord said to him, I am Jesus, whom you persecute Acts 9:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This answer probably shocked Saul because he thought that he was persecuting only the believers, not Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At that time the Lord revealed the truth to Saul that the believers are one with Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When he had persecuted Stephen, he had persecuted Jesus 7:58; 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Stephen was one with Jesus, and Jesus was one with Stephen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Likewise, Jesus is one with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the four Gospels Jesus was an individual, but in Acts Jesus became corporate, a corporate Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, Romans 12:5 says, We who are many are one Body in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God Building a City to Be His Bride</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are one Body, and we will eventually be built together as the holy city Rev 21:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to be rescued from the cage of our religious concepts and have our veils taken away so that we may see that God s purpose is not merely a matter of our being saved or even of our being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God s purpose is to marry a corporate bride, the holy city, and God is now building this city.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is gathering all His seekers together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our experience confirms that if we are serious with the Lord and are truly seeking after Him, nothing can satisfy us until we reach the point that we give ourselves to live for the building up of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we reach this point, we can say, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now I am home; I am satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the different practices among Christians can never satisfy us because God will never be satisfied with practices.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s satisfaction rests in one thing His gathering of His seekers and building them together into His corporate bride.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Most Christians think that their destiny is to go to heaven, but the Word reveals that the holy city will eventually come down out of heaven vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Christian life is not about going to heaven, nor is it merely a matter of being spiritual or holy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No matter how holy we may be, as long as we are not part of God s corporate bride, our holiness means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God s intention is not merely to gain holy people; it is to gain a corporate bride.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Bible does not say, Let us rejoice and exult, for holy people have come up to heaven!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, the Bible says, Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready 19:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ will not marry each believer individually but all His believers corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A Progressive Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The revelation in the divine book is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Genesis 1:1 God was alone.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Later, Isaiah 7:14 prophesies that this bachelor God would be born of a virgin and be called God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When this prophecy was fulfilled in the New Testament Matt 1:23 , God was no longer merely God Himself but was God-plus, God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God was incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The very God who was in the beginning became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, He was both divine and human, possessing divinity mingled with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Jesus is the most wonderful person because He is neither merely God nor merely man but a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is neither merely divine nor merely human but divinely human and humanly divine.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today this wonderful person is eatable and drinkable because He has become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever we call on Him, He comes into us Rom 10:12 , and we experience being a part of Him as branches in the vine John 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We become Him, and He becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, we are all one Body in Him Rom 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we reach the end of the divine book, the last two chapters reveal that God will not be alone for eternity but will be in Christ within the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Revelation 21:23 says, The city has no need of the sun or of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The New Jerusalem may be compared to a wheel, and God as the light within the Lamb as the lamp is the center and hub of the whole corporate entity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Throughout the ages God has been working in this direction, toward this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>His purpose is not merely that we would be saved or that we would seek after Him, love Him, fear Him, and try to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God s purpose is altogether a matter of our being built together as a corporate entity to become the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I hope that this vision will become clear to all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once we see it, we can never forget it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I hope that we could each say, Praise God, I see the vision from the first page of the divine book through to the last page.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God is always going on.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>First, He was incarnated as a man to be one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then He became the Spirit to be received by us so that He and His believers could be one and so that the believers could be one with one another in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Christ and all His believers, who are one with Him and in Him, form a corporate entity, the Body of Christ, which will become the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the New Jerusalem God will no longer be alone but will be in Christ on the throne flowing out as a river of water of life with the tree of life as food and drink for all His redeemed and regenerated people 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All that God is will be continually received by His people to be their constitution, and they will be part of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We all need to see this vision and enjoy the foretaste of this in the church life today.</S>
