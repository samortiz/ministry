   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Operating the Gifts in Each One of the Members of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit also operates the gifts in each one of the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"The one and the same Spirit operates all these things, distributing to each one individually as He purposes" 1 Cor 12:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit not only distributes and manifests but also operates.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To operate is to move, to function.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The life-giving Spirit works within us to make us proper, functioning members in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1 Corinthians 12 the Triune God is involved in three particular things gifts, ministries, and operations vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The gifts by the Spirit are to carry out the ministries, the services, for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The ministries for the Lord are to accomplish the operations, the works, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the Triune God moving in the believers for the accomplishment of His eternal purpose to build up the church, the Body of Christ, for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have emphasized the fact that the gifts in chapter twelve are much related to our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever we speak, the Spirit operates.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may think that we are the ones functioning and speaking; actually, the Spirit is the one who functions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we speak, the Spirit functions, the Lord ministers, and God operates.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our speaking, therefore, is of great importance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we do not speak, the Spirit does not function, the Lord does not minister, and God does not operate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In a very real sense, the Triune God is waiting for us to speak something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Spirit desires to function, the Lord wants to minister, and God intends to operate.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But this depends on our exercising our spirit to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our speaking is crucial to God's operation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more we speak by exercising our spirit, the more the Spirit will function, the Lord will minister, and God will operate.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we speak, the Spirit functions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Spirit functions, the Lord ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the Lord ministers, God operates.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, the functioning, ministering, and operating of the Triune God depend on our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Both in the meetings and in our practical daily living, the Triune God responds to our speaking in our spirit by functioning, ministering, and operating.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>84.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Warning Them</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Spirit also warns the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"Wherefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of trial in the wilderness" Heb 3:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This particular warning is related to the Sabbath rest.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The speaking Spirit often warns the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>85.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Speaking to the Churches</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the book of Revelation we see that the Spirit speaks to the churches 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 14:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Revelation 2:7 says, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the beginning of each of the seven epistles in chapters two and three, it is the Lord who speaks 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At the end of all seven epistles it is the Spirit speaking to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a strong indication that the actual speaker is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This proves that Christ and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First we have Christ speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then we are told that the Spirit is the one who speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The speaking Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whatever Christ speaks, that is the speaking of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ is the speaking Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Spirit is the Lord, and the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the speaker in Revelation 2 and 3 were only Christ without being the speaking Spirit, He could not speak words into our spirit, and His speaking would not be very subjective and touching.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But, as our experience testifies, if we are open in our spirit to the Lord as we read these epistles, the Spirit will speak something of Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because the speaker is not the objective Christ but the subjective Spirit, He speaks not only in the letters of the Bible but also in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once we hear His speaking, something indelible is wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is a marvelous fact that our Christ today is the speaking Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the one hand, each of the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 is the word of the Lord to a particular church; on the other hand, it is a word of the Spirit to all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, every church should give heed not only to the epistle written to her particularly but also to all the epistles written to the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because the Spirit today is speaking to the churches, not to a religion, denomination, or group of seeking Christians, we need to be in the churches in order to be rightly positioned to hear the Spirit's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we are in the church and among the churches, we have the right position and angle to hear the speaking of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now we all need an ear to listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.</S>
