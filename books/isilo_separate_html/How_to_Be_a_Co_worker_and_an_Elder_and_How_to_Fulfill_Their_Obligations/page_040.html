Not Being Conformed to the Death of Christ</H2><P>Paul said, "To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death" (Phil. 3:10). To be conformed to Christ's death is to take Christ's death as the mold of one's life. In your living, Christ's death has worked in you to such an extent that you are simply Christ's death. You have been molded into the form of His death; you are simply the form of Christ's death. If a co-worker or an elder comes to the meeting late and still struts to the front and sits on the first row, is this the form of Christ's death? Since you are late, you should be humble and not sit in the front; it is all right to sit in the back. While you are sitting humbly in the back, you should bow your head and pray to the Lord, "Forgive me, Lord, for being late in coming to the meeting." This is the form of Christ's death. As you are sitting there, you are simply the form of Christ's death. Then at an appropriate time, you may stand up and say, "Brothers and sisters, I have always encouraged you to come to the meetings early, even at least five minutes earlier than the scheduled time. Today I feel shameful because I came here five minutes late. I am really ashamed of myself; I am not worthy to sit in front. I will sit here in the back. I beg all of you to forgive me." This is the form of Christ's death. You are simply Christ's death on display. If you are late and still sit on the first row in a haughty manner, that is not the death of Christ; that is a grotesque form of pride.</P><P>Likewise, a husband and a wife should not condemn each other; instead, they should always apologize to one another. In this way both the husband and the wife are Christ's death and they live out Christ's death. Whoever sees them will be edified. The Bible tells us that even in disciplining our children we should not provoke them to anger (Eph. 6:4). To discipline our children without provoking them to anger is something that we simply cannot do in our natural man. We can do this only by being conformed to the death of Christ and by living by Him. Unless we are conformed to the death of Christ, all that we have is flesh, pride, and quarrels. If you are not conformed to the death of Christ, this means that you do not deny (put to death) your self, natural man, disposition by birth, flesh, preference, and ambition (Phil. 3:10b; Matt. 16:24; Gal. 2:20; 5:24). This is something we need to beware of.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Not Walking Strictly according to the Mingled Spirit</H2><P>We have the mingled spirit within us. This mingled spirit is the Spirit of God, that is, the Spirit of the Lord, joined and mingled with our spirit as one spirit. The spirit mentioned in Romans 8:4-6 refers to such a mingled spirit. In our living we should beware of not walking and having our being strictly according to the mingled spirit (Rom. 8:4).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> </body></html>
