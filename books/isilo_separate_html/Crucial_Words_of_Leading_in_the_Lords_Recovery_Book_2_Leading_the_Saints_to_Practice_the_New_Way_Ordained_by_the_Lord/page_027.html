<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO PARTICIPATE IN DISTRICT MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Exercising to Function in District Meetings<br />
by Praying, Choosing Hymns, Giving Testimonies, or Reading the Scriptures</h2>
<p>The most crucial point that we want to fellowship in regard to the district meetings is that we should exercise to function in the meetings. This refers not only to elders and co-workers but to all the saints. Elders and co-workers should be the head sheep who take the lead to function in the meetings of the whole church and in the district meetings. They need to function in every meeting. Every meeting lasts approximately one and a half hours, and there is plenty of time and opportunity for the saints to function. These meetings should not be the same as our meetings in the past in which one person spoke and everyone else listened. In the end, one person occupied all the time. In our meetings today, the one and a half hours are for everyone to function. Some may speak something from a hymn, others may share what they have received in their reading of the Bible, and still others may give their personal testimonies or minister the word. A saint may pray at the beginning of the meeting; then after a while, he may call a hymn or simply a chorus. He may then read two verses or speak a few words to point out their significance. It is not too much for a person to function in such a way three to four times in a meeting. The more the saints function in this way, the livelier and richer the meetings will be.</p>
<p>This kind of meeting makes it possible for everyone to function and to not sit quietly in the meetings as we did in the past. Formerly, only a few, if any, shared in the meetings; now we are divided into districts, and the condition of the sharing in the meetings has greatly improved. The functioning of the saints has become more widespread, and the ratio of saints who speak has increased to roughly forty percent. It has not yet reached a hundred percent, but it is definitely an improvement when compared to the past. In any case, an atmosphere in which everyone can function is on the rise.</p>
<p>All the elders need to function in the meetings. There is no excuse for an elder not to open his mouth in a meeting in which everyone functions. Likewise, all the full-time trainees are now learning to serve the churches. Based on the actual situation, the most important aspect in serving the churches is to open one&rsquo;s mouth and function in the meetings. Hence, whether in group meetings or in district meetings, we all need to open our mouth; opening our mouth will always be of benefit. We must exercise in this matter.</p>
<p>As a result of our continuous speaking and promoting, the atmosphere of functioning in the meetings has already undergone a big change. We can say that it has changed from winter to spring. Although it has not yet changed to summer, summer is almost here. Anything we promote will advance. I want everyone to pay attention to this matter: whether in the district meetings or in the bigger meetings of the whole church, when we come together, we need to try our best to function, either by praying, choosing hymns, giving testimonies, or reading the Scriptures; we need to practice according to 1 Corinthians 14:26.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Needed Function in District Meetings<br />
Being to Prophesy&mdash;to Speak for the Lord<br />
and Speak Forth the Lord</h2>
<p>The most needed function in district meetings is to prophesy, that is, to speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord; prophesying is not mainly for prediction. We need to know that our speaking in the meetings is not something ordinary; we are neither chatting nor talking about the world situation, much less about the weather; rather, we are speaking things related to God and the Lord. This is to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord, to minister the Lord. Hence, this kind of speaking is not ordinary.</p>
<p>Some saints are bothered by brothers and sisters prophesying in their local accents. This should not be a problem. When the apostles of the New Testament were carrying out their ministry, they spoke with a Galilean accent, and they were marked out by their accent (Acts 2:7). I believe that on the day of Pentecost, Peter still spoke with a heavy Galilean accent. On the day of Pentecost, after the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, his Galilean accent did not disappear, and he did not begin to speak with the accent of Judea or the accent of Jerusalem. According to the New Testament principle, God and man work together; that is, God and man are mingled.</p>
<p>For the Chinese translation of the Recovery Version of the New Testament, we referenced different English and Greek versions and entered into the depths of the text. Through this, we realized that Peter&rsquo;s proficiency in Greek could not compare with Paul&rsquo;s or even with James&rsquo;s. However, he still spoke for the Lord and wrote two Epistles. Hence, we should not think that someone who speaks with a local accent is ordinary and unable to be a prophet; this kind of thinking is not correct. Local accents do not affect the taste of what is spoken.</p>
<p>We need to endeavor to prophesy; to prophesy is to release God&rsquo;s word. Christianity has no way in this matter, so seminary students are hired to be preachers and pastors to speak for half an hour or even to take the entire time. However, this is not according to the biblical revelation. The Bible says, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:26). Psalms and teachings are ordinary, whereas tongues and interpretations are miraculous. Concerning tongues, Paul says clearly in 1 Corinthians 14, &ldquo;I would rather speak five words with my mind, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue&rdquo; (v. 19). When a person speaks in tongues, what is spoken must be interpreted in order to build up the church; otherwise, tongues should not be spoken in the meeting. To prophesy is to speak for God and to speak forth God, which is different from speaking in tongues.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 14:1 says, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.&rdquo; Here Paul says that prophesying is the highest gift. At the end of the chapter, he charged the Corinthian believers again, saying, &ldquo;So then, my brothers, desire earnestly the prophesying&rdquo; (v. 39). In verse 12 he was even stronger, &ldquo;Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church.&rdquo; This verse is difficult to render, and many Bible translators have been troubled by Paul&rsquo;s words because he uses the plural form of <em>spirit</em> when he says, &ldquo;Zealous of spirits.&rdquo; This causes many Christians to wonder why Paul spoke in such a way.</p>
<p>There was a background to Paul&rsquo;s word in verse 12. At that time, the Greeks were very superstitious, and according to history, people in Corinth were superstitious to the uttermost. Among them there was even the practice of consulting spirits. People practiced necromancy because of superstition; this was the condition of the Greeks at that time. Although some were later saved and had a new life, they still had such a background among them. Hence, Paul told the Corinthian believers that they were not involved with the unique Spirit but with various spirits. Since they were zealous of spirits, he exhorted them to seek to excel for the building up of the church and not to bring in things that might be related to the spirits. Paul wanted the Corinthian believers to know that they all had the Holy Spirit within them and that they needed to speak from the Holy Spirit; such a speaking is excelling.</p>
<p>When Paul wrote 1 Corinthians 14 concerning speaking in tongues, he was inwardly concerned that speaking in tongues might invite in evil spirits. In England, when speaking in tongues was first introduced, Mrs. Penn-Lewis warned the believers in her writings that to speak in tongues might invite in evil spirits and bring in Satan&rsquo;s attack. Concerning this point, I had a thorough conversation with Brother Nee; however, even to this day, I still do not understand this matter. Brother D. M. Panton, who was believed to be the most accurate Bible expositor of this century, once said that he had tested over eighty people who spoke in tongues and found that a result of their speaking in tongues was always to say that Jesus is accursed. Brother Nee told us about this after he read the article. One day, Brother Nee and I talked about this matter, but it was difficult for us to understand it. Brother Panton personally had contacted those who spoke in tongues and charged them to say whether Jesus is accursed, and all answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo; without exception. Mrs. Penn-Lewis and Brother Panton were more or less of the same era, but Brother Panton outlived Mrs. Penn-Lewis for nearly three decades. During the flourishing period of tongue-speaking in England, these two pillars had great influence among the believers; hence, the Pentecostal movement did not spread much within England.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1900, the Pentecostal movement came from England to the United States and began in Massachusetts. Soon it reached the West Coast, in the vicinity of Los Angeles. The Pentecostal movement had a great impact in the United States and was prevailing for a time. Out of that movement many groups were produced, and one of them was a group of brothers led by Brother A. B. Simpson. Although they joined the movement, in the end they saw that some matters in the Pentecostal movement were not according to the truth. For example, the Pentecostal people said that a person is not filled with the Holy Spirit until he speaks in tongues. Brother Simpson did not agree with this. The Pentecostal movement went even further to claim that if a person did not speak in tongues, he was not regenerated. The group of brothers with Simpson felt that they could no longer stay with the Pentecostal movement, so they withdrew and formed the Christian and Missionary Alliance. Of all the missionaries who came to preach in China, those from the Christian and Missionary Alliance were the best. Furthermore, today the best Christian group in Hong Kong is the Christian and Missionary Alliance; their headquarters are in New York.</p>
<p>Concerning the Pentecostal movement, there is much confusion among the Pentecostal groups; the most stable group is the Assembly of God, which was founded in 1915. This group is stable and proper. When we visited Brazil in 1965, we saw their work. For half a century, from 1915 to 1965, the Assembly of God had the highest rate of increase in the world. This is a brief review of the situation within the Pentecostal movement.</p>
<p>Regardless of its origin, by the time the Pentecostal movement reached northern China, it indeed involved evil spirits. Because of this kind of situation, Paul charged the believers in Corinth to not merely desire spiritual gifts but to earnestly desire a higher and excelling gift, that is, to prophesy. Prophesying is the most excelling gift, but not in reference to foretelling, tongue-speaking, or interpretation. Rather, prophesying excels in regard to using normal human language to speak of God, speak for God, speak forth God, and speak God into man to supply man. This is the most excelling gift.</p>
<p>We have read 1 Corinthians 14 for many years, but we have never been as clear as we are today. From now on, we must prophesy more in the meetings; especially the young full-time trainees must all practice to prophesy. Moreover, we need to see that the principle of the New Testament is incarnation; prophesying requires man&rsquo;s cooperation. If we do not cooperate, God will have no way to speak. The Triune God has been consummated as the Spirit, and this Spirit is now within us. The Spirit who indwells our spirit desires that we speak for God; that is, the Spirit is mingled with our spirit to speak for the Lord. We may use a three-legged race as an illustration of the mingled Spirit. When I was a young boy, I always liked to tie my leg to another boy&rsquo;s leg, and then we would walk together with three legs. This was quite difficult because if one person were too quick, he would cause the other person to stumble, and there could never be the proper coordination. Today God and we have become one spirit. He always desires to move, yet we may not move. Likewise, if we do not speak in the meetings, God is limited. God and we are tied together; if we do not move, God will be limited, and it will be difficult for Him to do anything.</p>
<p>Throughout church history, fundamentalists do not encourage people to speak; they want only one person to speak and everyone else to listen and to keep their mouth shut. The Pentecostal movement encourages people to shout, but in the end, their shouting brings in the spirits. Hence, Paul says that when a person prophesies, he must discern or judge (v. 29). At the time 1 Corinthians was written, it was prevalent to consult the spirits, and sometimes the spirits would speak; therefore, Paul charged the Corinthians believers to discern. According to our observation, Taiwan does not have much problem in this regard, and the situation is rather simple.</p>
<p>We all must practice to speak for the Lord in the meetings. For this reason, prior to the meetings, we must first pray, confess our sins, have proper fellowship with God, and allow the Holy Spirit to have the ground within us; in this way, when we come to the meetings, we will be able to cooperate with God. If we are people who truly have God and the Spirit of God within us, we will surely open our mouths and let the Spirit come out in the meetings. Not only will our spirit come out, but the Spirit of God in our spirit will also come out. Hence, the proper way is for everyone to open his mouth but not in the way of senseless shouting, such as speaking in tongues, because it is rather dangerous.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> </body></html>
