   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 Expression the Tent a Because All the Things He Had Were for God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and He Trusted in God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After Abraham built an altar, he pitched a tent 12:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At Babel, the people firstly built a city and then erected a tower.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But Abraham firstly built an altar and then erected a tent.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that Abraham was for God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first thing he did was to take care of the worship of God, of his fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Secondly, he took care of his living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The tent was for Abraham's living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Abraham did not take care of his living first.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That was secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With Abraham, the primary matter was to consecrate everything to God, to worship and serve God, and to have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only then did Abraham pitch a tent for his living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Abraham's dwelling in a tent indicated that he did not belong to the world but was a testimony to the people Heb 11:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>b At the Place of Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Abraham firstly pitched his tent at the place between Bethel and Ai 12:8; 13:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That was the place where God's house was and where he began his testimony in expressing God by fellowshipping with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His altar was the beginning of his testimony for God to the world, whereas his tent was the completion of his testimony to the world for God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His tent was a miniature of the tabernacle built by his descendants in the wilderness, which was called the "tabernacle of testimony" Exo 38:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since his tent was pitched by Bethel, in a sense it may be considered as the house of God for God's testimony on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>c At the Place of Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Later, Abraham removed his tent to Hebron, which means fellowship 13:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His tent firstly was a testimony for God to the world and then it became the center where he had fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is strongly proved by what occurred in chapter eighteen when God came to stay with him in the tent at Mamre in Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By Abraham's pitching a tent God had a place on earth where He could communicate and fellowship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His tent brought God from heaven to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All of us, God's called ones, should pitch a tent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the one hand, such a tent is a testimony of God to the world; on the other hand, it is a place of fellowship with God to bring God from heaven to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not think that this matter of a tent is a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Later, when Abraham's descendants were called out of Egypt and entered into the wilderness, God commanded them to build a tent and in front of the tent He commanded them to build an altar Exo 26:1; 27:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There, in Exodus, we see an altar with a tent, a tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That tabernacle was God's house on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Abraham's tent was also God's house on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Genesis 18 we can see that God came and stayed with Abraham in his tent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that time, Abraham was a priest offering sacrifices to God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His building an altar and offering sacrifices to God proved that he functioned as a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God's intention is that all of His called ones should be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are priests.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not need others to offer sacrifices for us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must do it ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Abraham was feasting with God in his tent, he was the high priest, and the inner part of his tent was the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God was there.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By this we can see that Abraham's tent was a prefigure of the tabernacle built by Abraham's descendants in the wilderness as the dwelling place for God and for the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here in Genesis we see a priest named Abraham who lived with God in his tent.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the side of this tent there was an altar.</S>
