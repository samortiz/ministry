THE DISCIPLINE OF THE LORD</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Result of Not Proving and Discerning</h2><p>In verses 30 and 31 Paul says, &ldquo;Because of this many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep. But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged.&rdquo; By &ldquo;this&rdquo; in verse 30 Paul means not discerning the body. Being weak and sick in this verse is the discipline, the temporary judgment of the Lord, on the unworthy participants in the Lord&rsquo;s body. The Lord first disciplined them so that they were weak physically. Then, since they would not repent of their offense, they were further disciplined to be sick. Because they still would not repent, the Lord judged them by death. To die this way is equivalent to being strewn along in the wilderness in 10:5. The word sleep in verse 30 means die (1 Thes. 4:13-16).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Discerning Ourselves That We Are Not Judged</h2><p>In verse 31 Paul says that if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged. To discern ourselves is to distinguish matters that concern ourselves, to form an accurate estimate of ourselves. The purpose of being judged is that we may be brought back to God&rsquo;s administration. Those who are astray need judgment from God to bring them back under His administration.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Disciplined That We May Not Be<br />Condemned with the World</h2><p>In verse 32 Paul says, &ldquo;But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined that we may not be condemned with the world.&rdquo; If we keep ourselves under God&rsquo;s administration, we shall not be judged, corrected, disciplined, to be brought back to His administration. The discipline in verse 32 is also a matter in God&rsquo;s administration. This discipline is temporary so that we may not be condemned with the world, that is, condemned forever.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Coming Together to Eat the Lord&rsquo;s Supper</h2><p>In 33-34a, Paul says, &ldquo;So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another. If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, that you may not come together for judgment.&rdquo; The charge to wait for one another is due to the condition described in verse 21. Waiting requires patience. Waiting for one another indicates that we are truly under God&rsquo;s administration.</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Remaining Matters to Be Set in Order When the Apostle Comes</h2><p>In verse 34b Paul concludes, &ldquo;And the remaining matters I will set in order when I come.&rdquo; This indicates that the apostle did not give instruction for everything concerning the practice of the church. For the &ldquo;remaining matters&rdquo; we need to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading, based upon the principles which have been set forth in the New Testament and governed by these principles.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_165.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_167.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 Corinthians &nbsp; pg 166</div><br></body></html>
