   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN EPHESIANS 1 Scripture Reading: Eph 3:8b, 10-11, 16-17a, 19b; 1:13b-14; 4:30; 5:18b; 6:17-18 THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Almost everyone knows that the subject of Ephesians is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How does the Body of Christ come into being?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may say that it comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But Paul did not say it in such a brief way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He says that the church comes into being out of the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ Eph 3:8b .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The source from which the Body of Christ comes into existence is the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN OUR HEART</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How then can we realize, experience, and enjoy all of the riches of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul tells us clearly that our inner man must be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power by His Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may make His home in your hearts by faith Eph 3:16-17a .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our inner man must be strengthened not by any knowledge, but by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And this is according to the riches of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The issue is that Christ may make His home in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many Christian teachers have written volumes on the book of Ephesians, but most have not seen that the central point is Christ making His home in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Have you ever read a book that says the key point in Ephesians is the indwelling Christ making His home in our heart?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So many Christians today talk about the Body of Christ, but we know that any body without the life of a person is a corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A corpse is short not only of life, but of a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The difference between a tree and a man is that a tree has only life, but a man has life plus a person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A body is a vessel that contains a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>People talk about the Body of Christ, but where is the living person of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He must be making His home in our hearts; otherwise, the church which is supposed to be the Body of Christ is only a corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>FROM CENTER TO CIRCUMFERENCE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How we praise the Lord that today Christ is the life-giving Spirit, living in us!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And He is going to make His home in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all must come back to the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ not only lives in us, but He also must make His home in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is not something general, but so specific.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the past we have pointed out, according to the New Testament, that our heart is bigger than our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our heart is the circumference, and our spirit is the center.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ as the life-giving Spirit comes into our spirit as the center, and from the center He is spreading Himself into all the parts of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is wonderful that we can say that Christ is in us, but we may only have Christ at the center, in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There may not be any spreading of Christ into our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why Paul prayed for the believers that their inner man might be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit is our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our inner man needs to be strengthened and made strong; then Christ will be able to make His home in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>STRONG IN TALKING, WEAK IN PRAYING</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Most Christians, even those who love the Lord, are not strong in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are strong in talking, but if you ask them to pray, they are silent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The best way to silence others is to ask for a time of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the time of prayer is over, however, everyone begins to talk.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that they are strong in their mind, but weak in their spirit, which is their inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we are living in the presence of the Lord, we don t like to talk so much.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, we would prefer to pray and to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are strong in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, the Apostle Paul prayed for us that our inner man might be made strong.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The result, then, is that Christ will spread within our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For Christ to make His home in our heart means that He will saturate and permeate every part of our heart with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then our whole being will be a home to Him, and He will be the dweller.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He will not only be our life, but the living person who is the dweller of our being.</S>
