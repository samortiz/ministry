<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Acts 16:30-31</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Who is the Lord Jesus?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>He is the Lord who created the universe. He is also the God who is our Savior.</li>
	<li>He is Jesus who is God become a man. He is the One who is God and also is a man.</li>
	<li>He became man to bear our sins. And because He is God, He is also able to forgive our sins.</li>
	</ol></li>

	<li>He resurrected from the dead in order that we might have life.</li>
	<li>Because of His death and resurrection He became the Savior of our whole being.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>What should we do with the Lord Jesus?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">

	</ol></li>
<li>The unit of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation<br />
<span class="normal">Even though the salvation of the Lord comes to an individual, God&rsquo;s intention is that the entire household unit receive salvation. The salvation of the Lord comes not only to an individual, but also to the whole household. Therefore the Word says, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house.&rdquo;</span></li>
<li>The result of salvation
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Sins are forgiven.</li>
	<li>Eternal life is obtained.</li>
