<h1 class="title">COME, GO, COME</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:19-20; Acts 1:8; 13:2-3; 26:16-20; 20:24, 34-35; 1 Cor. 9:7-15; 1 Tim. 5:17-18</h1>
<p>The Bible is consistent from its beginning to its end. In order to understand the Bible, one must know the lines in the Bible, such as the line of life, the line of the kingdom, and the line of the church. In this chapter we will consider the line of &ldquo;come, go, come.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LINE OF &ldquo;COME, GO, COME&rdquo;<br />
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>There is the line of &ldquo;come, go, come&rdquo; in the Bible. The entire New Testament concerns these three words: <em>come, go,</em> and <em>come.</em> When the Lord Jesus came forth to carry out His ministry, He called people to come to Him. He said, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink&rdquo; (John 7:37), and &ldquo;Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest&rdquo; (Matt. 11:28). The word <em>come</em> almost covers the entire scope of the four Gospels. In the four Gospels the Lord repeatedly called people to come to Him: come and rest, come and drink the living water, come and be saved. The thought of &ldquo;come&rdquo; is also in the Epistles. Hebrews 4:16 says, &ldquo;Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help.&rdquo; The Lord wants us to come to Him because our experiencing grace, salvation, power, love, light, holiness, and righteousness depends on our coming to Him. When we come, we receive grace, salvation, power, love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the first word in the Lord&rsquo;s calling is <em>come.</em> Every believer has come to the Lord at least once. We cannot say that those who have come once to the Lord do not need to come to Him again. We need to come to the Lord again and again. Coming to the Lord can be compared to breathing, because no one can graduate from breathing. If someone graduates from breathing, he is finished. Likewise, we cannot graduate from coming to the Lord. In eternity we will still need to continually come to the Lord. Therefore, we have to come to the Lord day after day. We can come to the Lord numerous times in one day. We can come to the Lord in the morning, at noon, and in the evening by calling on His name so that we may receive grace, life, and the life supply.</p>
<p>After we come to the Lord and receive grace, the Lord will ask us to go. In Matthew 28:19 the Lord said, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations.&rdquo; This going may be a &ldquo;great&rdquo; going or a &ldquo;small&rdquo; going; it may be to go to a faraway place or to a nearby place. For example, after the Samaritan woman in John 4 drank the living water from the Lord, she immediately went away into the city and testified to the people (vv. 28-29). We may come to the Lord at night and go and testify to people the next morning, or we may come to the Lord at noon and go and testify to people in the afternoon, spreading the good news. To go and testify to our parents or siblings is a small going to a nearby place. To go and testify to all the nations is a great going to a faraway place.</p>
<p>The entire New Testament involves these two words: <em>come</em> and <em>go.</em> The New Testament involves coming, and it also involves going. To come is to receive grace, and to go is to impart grace into people. By our coming and going, we will eventually express a desire to the Lord. We will say, &ldquo;Come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo; (Rev. 22:20). Therefore, the second &ldquo;come&rdquo; is connected to the Lord&rsquo;s coming again. Hence, the entire New Testament is concerning these three words: <em>come, go,</em> and <em>come.</em></p>
<p>The first &ldquo;come&rdquo; is continual, and the &ldquo;go&rdquo; is also continual. We continually come to the Lord, and we continually go until the final &ldquo;come,&rdquo; when we will be with the Lord for eternity and will no longer need to go. May the Lord strengthen both our coming and our going. If we daily come to the Lord in the morning, at noon, and in the evening, we will surely go and testify to people. The issue of such coming and going is that we desire and yearn for the Lord to come back.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COMING AND GOING BEING<br />
A CHRISTIAN&rsquo;S BREATHING, LIVING,<br />
AND FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>We should not understand this coming and going as something religious or organizational. After a person is saved and receives the Lord&rsquo;s life, he needs to come to the Lord daily. Our physical body needs to breathe, drink, and eat daily. Likewise, we need to come to the Lord daily. The more we come to the Lord, the more we have the burden to go. No one comes to the Lord and does not go afterward. This going is the result of receiving a commission from the Lord and going with the Lord and His salvation. In the past two thousand years of church history, thousands of Christians have had a living of coming and going. These Christians had such a walk.</p>
<p>If we come to the Lord, He will ask us to go and preach the gospel and to go and impart His grace into people. This going is not a trend or a movement; it is not a religious enterprise, an organizational operation, or a political movement. Rather, this is a person coming to enjoy the Lord, gain Him, and be filled with Him, and then going by the Lord&rsquo;s being in him, bearing him, and supporting him. Such a going is spontaneous.</p>
<p>In Christianity the Lord&rsquo;s charge to go and disciple all the nations has become a religious enterprise. Hence, Christianity organizes missions and sends out preachers to carry out a missionary work. This kind of going is an organization and a movement, a missionary enterprise. However, according to the Bible, going does not refer to a missionary enterprise, an organization, or a movement. Rather, going is as natural and spontaneous as breathing. When we breathe in, we must breathe out. To come and go is our spiritual breathing. To come and draw near to the Lord in the morning but not go and speak to people about the Lord&rsquo;s grace afterward is the same as holding one&rsquo;s breath. We must remember that to come and go is not a movement or an enterprise. To come and go is the normal spiritual life of Christians.</p>
<p>It is not right for us to come to the Lord but not go, nor is it right for us to go without coming. After we come, we must go, and if we want to go, we must come. We come to the Lord no matter what our condition may be; we may be weak, in darkness, defeated, sinful, or empty. However, we go with the Lord and His grace. We come empty-handed but go filled with the Lord. Such a coming and going is spiritual fellowship.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Age of the One New Man &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
