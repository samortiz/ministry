   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But now things have greatly changed!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Just as some in Christianity have been deceived by Satan and have called themselves modernists, in the same way there are the same kind of people in Judaism.</S>

   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How can we remove one word of it?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If the Jews who return to their own country are now in such unbelief, no wonder that in the future they will make a covenant with Antichrist and will recognize him as king!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although they are now boasting of their intellectual capacity, from the Scripture we can see their end already!</S>
