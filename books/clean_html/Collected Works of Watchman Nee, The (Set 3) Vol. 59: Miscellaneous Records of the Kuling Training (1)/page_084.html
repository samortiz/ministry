<p>Sister Wang Shu-ging: If some schools insist on cutting the girls' hair, what should we do? Can we sue the school?</p><p>Watchman Nee: The Bible does not permit believers to sue anyone (cf. 1 Cor. 6:1-2). If others sue us, we can respond to the suit, but we cannot initiate a lawsuit. When problems arise between believers and unbelievers, the unbelievers can be the plaintiff. Believers can defend themselves, but that is all they can do. A believer cannot turn around and file a suit. It is all right for Christians to be defendants, but never plaintiffs. This applies to a Christian's personal affairs. As citizens of a state, however, we have the right to enjoy the freedom guaranteed by the constitution. Christians can enjoy the same freedom as others. If a school forces girls to cut their hair, the parents can sue the school, and we can help the parents in their fight against the schools. It is the freedom of individual citizens to keep their hair. There is no law that says that a person cannot be a citizen of the Republic of China if he or she keeps long hair. A school principal cannot say that a girl can no longer be a student if she has long hair. This is a matter of personal liberty. If someone asks me to intervene in this matter, I will. Nevertheless, we have to be proper in our attitude. We may invite those for a meal, go to the court together, and then drive them home afterward. In such matters we should be free from personal feelings. We are here to fight for the truth only. If the post office writes a letter saying that they will not deliver Bibles, we can invite the postmaster to a meal and still sue him. A Christian can fight for his right under the constitution. Yet we are fighting for the truth, not for personal conflicts.</p><p>In territories occupied by the Communists, some members of the party confiscate property and possessions and distribute them to others. If a Christian receives such distributed goods, he has no choice but to keep them. But when the situation changes, he can inform the original owners to come and retrieve their goods.</p><p>It is more serious for a school to demand its girl students to cut their hair than to cut their fingers. Cutting one's finger only involves individuals, but cutting the hair involves the truth and the Lord. If a sister is not clear about the truth and has cut her hair already, she should cover her head with a scarf. When her hair grows back, she can take the scarf off.</p><p>Question: Some time ago the church in Swatow excommunicated a co-worker. Was that right or wrong?</p><p>Watchman Nee: Concerning this matter I need to say a word to the brothers in Swatow. I have been in the work for over ten years. I have to apologize to the brothers with respect to a few things related to the excommunication of that co-worker. After that incident Swatow sent Brother Wen-kwang to Shanghai and asked us to excommunicate the same brother from the work. We were reluctant to assume the burden of others in our work, but this was wrong on our part. The real matter did not involve whether or not the brother should have been excommunicated. There was no question about the rightness or correctness of the act itself. Unfortunately, the church in Swatow was in the position of rebellion when it excommunicated him. The co-workers should have been the ones to excommunicate that co-worker from the work. It should not have been handled through the church in Swatow. When the brothers in Swatow executed the excommunication, it exposed them to a position more precarious than that of "The Lord rebuke you" in Jude. If the co-workers had handled the situation then, the issue of authority would not have been involved. I admit that I was wrong in leaving the brothers in Swatow in a quandary. I did not have the opportunity to make this matter clear before; I wish to take this opportunity today to make this clear.</p><p>The church's excommunication can only be applied to six kinds of people, as spoken of in 1 Corinthians 5. Others who are not clearly wrong in conduct, but who are wrong only in attitude or motive, should not be excommunicated, because there is no absolute standard for such things. The church can only exhort the various parties. If the parties choose to ignore the church, at the most the church can turn its head the other way and consider them as Gentiles. As for the case spoken of in Matthew 18, it involves offenses against individuals; it is an entirely different matter altogether.</p><p>Question: If a person commits an error with respect to submission to authority, can we point out his error to him?</p><p>Watchman Nee: If a person has never touched authority, it is useless to point out his error to him. For example, if you work in the Public Works Department and a few of your colleagues speak defiantly against their superior, it is useless to point out their error to them. They are unbelievers who are totally in the realm of rebellion. If you point out their error, at the most they will nod their heads; they will not change their heart. What use is it to do this? You must first help a person to see authority. Whether or not you point out the error is not that crucial. In pointing out others' error, you should be like one who is touching contamination and defilement. When such things come to you, you should recoil. You have to exercise extreme care in such things. You should not be sucked into the tide of rebellion and should not fall into the realm of rebellion. The basic problem with a rebellious person is that he has not seen authority. Suppose a man smokes. What use is it to help him merely stop smoking? He needs some basic dealings. He needs to touch authority. Miscellaneous dealings are not very effective. You have to bring a man face to face with authority. Only after you have done this can you say, "The way you just acted was wrong. Those few words amounted to rebellion." You have to learn to fear God. God is never loose with you in such matters.</p><p>Suppose a person is very lazy. He invites himself to this and that house for dinner but never takes up any job. You have to announce his name to the brothers and sisters and forbid anyone to invite him to their home. If you do this, you will stop his habitual ill. Some idle ones may criticize you, but in a nice way you can say, "Sorry, I do not have the time to listen to you." The problem today is that many people love to play politics. This makes the situation worse. There is so much gossip because so many like to hear such gossip.</p><p>We have to grow in faith and in love. We should rebuke the brothers and sisters who should be rebuked. The best way is, of course, to exhort them with love. At any rate, we should not play politics in dealing with the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Question: How should we muzzle a person who loves to speak and spread rumors?</p><p>Watchman Nee: Brother Miao made the best remark of his life when he said, "The ears are a trash can. No one throws good things like gold, silver, flour, or rice into a trash can." If anyone comes to you with gossip, you should say, "Sorry, my ears are not trash cans." They will have no choice but to take their trash elsewhere. Those who cause divisions should be marked out, and no one should have any communication with them. We should maintain our purity in our fellowship. If any word is to go out, we must first examine it and see if there is any element of rebellion or gossip in it. Much so-called fellowship among believers is actually gossip. We must quarantine all rebellions. Titus 3 says that we should refuse a factious man after a first and second admonition (v. 10). This refusal does not mean an open excommunication. It is a measure that aims at preserving the purity of fellowship. Many times measures taken among the brothers and sisters have nothing to do with love; they are a matter of dealing with infection. If a man speaks in a rebellious way, the best way to love him is to separate him from others. This is the greatest love one can give to him, because this will bring him profit and save others. Quarantine is exercised under the principle that it is an effort of recovery for the quarantined and a measure of prevention against infection for others.</p>
