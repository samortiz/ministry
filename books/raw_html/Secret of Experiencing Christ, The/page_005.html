<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Having the Father Always with Him</H2><P>The Bible tells us that the Father was always with the Son. While Christ was on this earth, He told people that the Father was always with Him and never left Him alone (John 8:16, 29; 16:32). In John 16:32 the Lord Jesus told His disciples that when the persecution came, they all would leave Him alone. However, although they would leave Him, He was not alone, because the Father was with Him. He was always in the Father, and the Father was in Him. Therefore, He was always with the Father, and the Father was with Him.</P><P>This knowledge helps us to experience Christ. When we experience Christ, we do not experience Him alone, but we experience Him with the Father. We experience Him with the Father in Him and with Him in the Father. This makes our experience of Christ very rich.</P><P>First John 2:23 tells us that when we confess the Son, we have the Father also. Therefore, when we have the Son, we have the Father also. To have the Father means that we possess Him and are now participating in Him. We are now enjoying, not the Son alone, but the Son with the Father.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Giver and Sender of the Spirit</H2><P>In the Triune Godhead there are the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Thus far, based on the Bible, we have seen that the Son and the Father are one. When we have Him, we enjoy Him with the Father. At this point we need to see further that Christ is the Giver of the Spirit (John 3:34) and also the Sender of the Spirit (John 15:26).</P><P>John 15:26 says, "But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me." According to this verse, Christ sends the Spirit from the Father. However, we must point out again that the Greek preposition para, translated "from" twice in this verse, carries the sense of both from and with. Actually, the basic thought of this Greek preposition is "with." Therefore, it is correct to translate para in this verse as "with," indicating clearly that the Son will send the Spirit with the Father. The Lord's word in 15:26 does not mean that He will send the Spirit and the Father, but it means that He will send the Spirit with the Father. The Father always comes with the Spirit.</P><P>How wonderful that when Christ sent the Spirit, the Spirit proceeded from the Father and came with the Father. When Christ gives the Spirit and sends the Spirit to us, the Spirit comes with the Father. If we read only John 15:26, it may seem that the Spirit comes with the Father, but not with the Son. But if we read John 15:26 carefully with 14:26, we can see not only that Christ sends the Spirit and the Spirit comes to us with the Father, but also that the Father sends the Spirit in the name of the Son. According to John 15:26, Christ sends the Spirit and the Spirit comes with the Father, and according to 14:26, the Father sends the Spirit in the name of the Son. When the Spirit is given, He is given with the Father, and the Father also gives the Spirit in the name of the Son.</P>
