   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He felt that we needed to worship the Lord in the way of everyone being quiet and praying slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a self-made religion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Another brother may feel that he must go out to the foreign field to be a missionary.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This also may be a self-made religion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Far East, a British brother once asked me why the men sit together among themselves and the women sit together among themselves in our church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He said that this was not the right way to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is also a self-made religion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This religion immediately becomes a veil, veiling him from seeing Christ, veiling him from the real life in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many of us may be unaware of the fact that we have our own self-made religion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all have to be delivered from the veil of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"The Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom" 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to live in the spirit and meet the Lord in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I do not care how the saints sit in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I only care for one thing whether or not I am in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord is the Spirit in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22; Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we keep ourselves in the spirit, the veil is gone immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We will have an unveiled face, not the outward physical face, but the inward spiritual face.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We will become a beholding and reflecting mirror of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A man living in the spirit must be a captive of Christ, a letter of Christ, and a mirror turned to the Lord with an unveiled face.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then this man will behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, and he will be transformed dispositionally in his very being into the image of Christ from one degree of glory to another degree.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This transformation proceeds from the Lord Spirit and has nothing to do with any religion, with any forms, with any regulations, with any different teachings, or with any dead knowledge.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As we solely take care of the Spirit living within us, day by day and hour after hour, we will be transformed into the same image of Christ.</S>
