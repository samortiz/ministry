[1]  Crucial Aspects of the Experience of Christ Revealed in Paul's Epistles CONTENTS
[2]  Being Filled with Christ to Live and Express Christ
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST IN US Scripture Reading: Col 1:24-27; 2:2; Eph 3:4; John 20:22; 1 Cor 15:45 THE BIBLE CONTAINING A MYSTERY
[4]  The Bible, the greatest book on earth, is the most complete book, revealing many things concerning God, the universe, and man.
[5]  As the embodiment of God, Christ is the mystery of God v. 9 . Because Christ is in us, God is in us.
[6]  The Word is Christ v. 14 . It is wonderful that, as the Word, Christ was with God and also was God.
[7]  TO LIVE AND EXPRESS CHRIST Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 13:14; Col 1:27; Gen 1:26; Rom 9:21; Gal 1:14-16; 2:20; Phil 3:7-14; 1:20-21 THE CENTRAL LINE AND GOAL OF THE BIBLE BEING THE DISPENSING OF GOD INTO MAN
[8]  The Bible reveals to us that God had a good pleasure in eternity past Eph 1:5 .
[9]  When the Bible first mentions man, it says that God made man in His image and according to His likeness Gen 1:26 .
[10]  CHAPTER THREE WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 2:11-12; 6:17; 15:45b; John 7:39; Rev 22:17; Rom 8:4
[11]  God has revealed in His Word that He wants to dispense Himself into man.
[12]  When we were saved, something of God was added into our spirit through regeneration.
[13]  But when we are saved, Christ regenerates us by giving us God s divine life and nature.
[14]  Similarly, when we were regenerated, we received God s life and nature, the effectiveness of Christ s all-inclusive death, His resurrection power, and the Spirit.
[15]  Religion has made the Christian life a life of work, but according to God s economy, which is revealed in the Bible, God wants us to live a life of enjoyment.
[16]  CHAPTER FIVE CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN OUR HEARTS Scripture Reading: Eph 3:4, 8-10, 16-19
[17]  Thus, Christ and the church are the great mystery 5:32 .
[18]  God, who is a mystery, has been embodied in Christ and is therefore expressed through Christ.
[19]  To see, touch, and gain Christ is to see, touch, and gain God, for Christ is the embodiment of God.
[20]  The fourth matter in Ephesians 3 is the church, which is mentioned in verse 10.
[21]  When we enjoy Christ, and He is dispensed into each of us, the church will be produced.
[22]  The apostle Paul goes on in the second part of the chapter to pray for the saints that they would gain more of Christ by allowing Christ to make His home in their hearts.
[23]  CHAPTER SIX MINGLING, GROWING, AND RENEWING Scripture Reading: Eph 4:4-6, 11-24 EPHESIANS 3 EXPERIENCING CHRIST
[24]  Ephesians is a particular book in that it gives us a full revelation of the church and also shows us the way to experience the church, which is to experience Christ.
[25]  In the previous chapters we have seen that Christ is the mystery of God and that the church is the mystery of Christ.
[26]  Paul composed Ephesians 3 with seven main points: the mystery, the unsearchable riches of Christ, the economy of the mystery, the church, Christ making His home in our hearts, the dimensions of Christ, and the fullness of God.
[27]  The church should be not only the fullness of God and the Body of Christ with Christ as its life but also the new man with Christ as its person.
[28]  As the Body of Christ, the church lives Christ and expresses Christ, but as the new man, the church is Christ.
[29]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE WASHING OF THE WATER IN THE WORD Scripture Reading: Eph 5:26-27, 29 THE WASHING OF THE WATER IN THE WORD BEING NECESSARY FOR THE CHURCH LIFE
[30]  Ephesians 5:26-27 says, That He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish.
[31]  If we all have Christ making His home in our hearts, realize the mingling with the Triune God, grow in life by the increase of Christ, and are renewed by taking Christ as our person, we will have the proper church life.
[32]  BY MEANS OF PRAYER Scripture Reading: Eph 6:10-19
[33]  Ephesians 6:17-18 says, Receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit.
[34]  Ephesians, a book on the church, ends with a particular kind of prayer by which we receive the word of God.
[35]  This indicates that in order to have the proper church life, we must practice to receive the word of God by means of prayer.
[36]  Another result of pray-reading is that we will pray for all the saints.
[37]  After reading the previous chapters concerning Ephesians, we might pray, Lord, bring all the saints into the proper church life so that they may experience Christ and have Christ make His home in their hearts.
[38]  In 1:17-23 he prays, That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him, the eyes of your heart having been enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of His calling, and what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come; and He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.
[39]  Then in 3:16-19 Paul prays, That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[40]  The mystery of the gospel is God s economy, the dispensing of Christ in His unsearchable riches into the believers to produce the church for the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose.
[41]  Human language is not adequate; we need divine utterance to speak concerning Christ as God s mystery, the church as Christ s mystery, and God s heart s desire, economy, and dispensing.
[42]  He needs a group of people who see the great mystery of Christ and the church and who experience Christ to the uttermost so that corporately they become the expression of Christ, His organic Body as His fullness.
