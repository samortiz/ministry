   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The River of Water of Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do not think that in eternity God merely sits on His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Out of the throne proceeds a river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By this river, God will continue to dispense Himself into us for our eternal enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The river, as typified by the rivers in Genesis 2:10-14, Psalm 46:4, and Ezekiel 47:5-9, signifies the abundance of life in its flow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is one river, flowing through the four directions of the holy city like the four heads of the one river in Genesis 2:10-14.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This one river with its riches becomes many rivers in our experience, as indicated in John 7:38.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The water of life is a symbol of God in Christ as the Spirit flowing Himself into His redeemed people to be their life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is typified by the water that came out of the cleft rock Exo 17:6; Num 20:11 and is symbolized by the water that flowed out of the pierced side of the Lord Jesus John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here, this water of life becomes a river, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb to supply and saturate the entire New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the city is filled with the divine life to express God in His glory of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>C. The Tree of Life</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Revelation 22:2 says, "And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The one tree of life growing on the two sides of the river signifies that the tree of life is a vine, spreading and proceeding along the flow of the water of life for God's people to receive and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It fulfills, for eternity, what God intended from the beginning Gen 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The tree of life was closed to man due to his fall Gen 3:22-24 , but opened to believers by the redemption of Christ Heb 10:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life is the believers' common portion John 6:35, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the millennial kingdom the overcoming believers will enjoy Christ as the tree of life as their reward Rev 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, in the new heaven and new earth, for eternity, all God's redeemed will enjoy Christ as the tree of life as their eternal portion 22:14, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The tree of life is Christ as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First, Christ was the Lamb of God for our redemption John 1:29 , and then the tree of life for our life supply John 6:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ redeemed us to impart Himself into us as the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is not only the Lamb of God, but also the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Revelation 21:9 says, "Come here, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Who is this Lamb?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This Lamb is Christ, the Lamb-God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is the Bridegroom of the bride John 3:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But notice that Revelation 22:17 says, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It does not say the Lamb and the bride; it says the Spirit and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These two verses together prove that Christ, the Lamb, is just the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This Spirit is the consummation of the entire Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Spirit as the Bridegroom is the totality and the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is qualified to be such a husband to marry the wife, who is the consummation of all the redeemed and regenerated people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a universal couple with divinity marrying humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here are two consummations.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Divinity has gone through a process through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to become the Spirit, the totality, the consummation, of the Triune God to be the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Humanity also has gone through a process through redemption, regeneration, and transformation to become the consummation of God's chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people to be the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The consummation of the Triune God and the consummation of God's chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people become one in a universal marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The processed tripartite man will match the processed Triune God forever for His full expression and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What a destiny we have!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Yet, we need not wait to enjoy Christ as the Lamb, the river, and the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today, as we are still in the process of transformation, we can enjoy a foretaste of our eternal enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ's process is complete, but ours is not.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are the children of God, being transformed that we may be built up as the Body to express Christ eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May we go on each day in the experience and enjoyment of Christ's wonderful Person and work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>QUESTIONS Fellowship with your companions about the various aspects of the New Jerusalem, such as, the redeeming God, the river of life, the tree of life, etc. Write a ten minute prophesy on how Christ's person and work brings sinners like us into a coinherence with the Triune God to produce the New Jerusalem.</S>
