After singing this hymn, we should not say, \u201cWhere are the \u2018boundless riches\u2019? This hymn should say \u2018limited riches.\u2019 What good is it to have one dollar? This is not enough even [424] to pay for a bus ticket. A gift of a thousand dollars would be more acceptable.\u201d I believe that the author of this hymn might have often received a supply of only several British pence, yet she still had such great faith. Therefore, we must learn to have faith. Do not be proud and say, \u201cI will not rely on the church or on the saints; I will learn to depend on God.\u201d To depend on God in the matter of material supply is very practical, because God is truly trustworthy. However, you should act properly and maintain a proper attitude. This requires much learning. "}]}
