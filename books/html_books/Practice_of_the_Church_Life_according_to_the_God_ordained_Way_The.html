</div><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PREREQUISITE OF<br>THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE<br>ACCORDING TO THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 1:4b; Eph. 3:16-19, 8-9; 1:23, 4, 5, 11, 13, 14, 22; 4:3-6; Col. 1:15-19; 3:4a; Acts 9:31; 14:23; John 17:11, 22-23; Matt. 16:16-18; Eph. 5:25-27; Rom. 16:17; Titus 3:10; 1 Cor. 1:13</H1><P>Prophesying, in the sense of speaking for the Lord and speaking forth the Lord, is very high. Most Christians today are not qualified to touch the matter of prophesying. The church is built up by means of gospel preaching, the teaching of the Bible, prophesying, and many other things, but according to an objective view of the New Testament, the highest of these things is prophesying.</P><P>Many Christians hold the concept that to prophesy is to predict. However, to understand a word such as prophesy in the Bible, it is helpful and even necessary to consult the writings of those who have studied the Bible over the past twenty centuries. If we attempt to read the Bible without the help of others' writings, we may not see the light concerning the divine revelation in the Bible. Concerning the matter of prophesying, in his expanded translation of 1 Corinthians 14, Kenneth Wuest, a highly regarded student of the Bible, rendered the Greek word for prophesy as "impart to others the divine revelations." Thus, Wuest said that to prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14 is not to predict but to impart the divine revelation to others.</P><P>To reach the high standard of prophesying unveiled in the Bible, there is a prerequisite, a condition that must be fulfilled first. This is similar to the requirement that a person finish high school before he can be admitted to a university. In this message we will consider four items as a prerequisite of the practice of the church life according to the God-ordained way. Without the fulfilling of these four items there is no possibility to have the genuine prophesying among us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. TO SEE THE ECONOMY OF GOD</H2><P>The first item of this prerequisite is that we must see the economy of God (1 Tim. 1:4b). Although the economy of God is mentioned clearly and strongly in the Bible, many Christians do not know anything concerning God's economy. In 1 Corinthians 9:17 and Ephesians 1:10, the King James Version renders the Greek word oikonomia as dispensation. Although this rendering is not wrong, the proper significance and denotation of the word dispensation has been lost in the English language. Among Christians this word is generally understood to refer to an age, or a period of time in which God deals with man according to a certain principle. Thus, it is difficult for any reader of the Bible to understand the correct meaning of the word oikonomia.</P><P>The Greek word oikonomia means household law and denotes a household management, a household administration, a household government, and, derivatively, a dispensation, a plan, or an economy for administration (distribution). The economy of God is God's household economy, His household administration, which is to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people that He may have a house to express Himself, which house is the church (1 Tim. 3:15), the Body of Christ. In speaking of the dispensing in God's economy, I prefer to use the gerund dispensing rather than the noun dispensation, because the latter is somewhat ambiguous. When we speak of God's dispensing of Himself, the meaning is clear, but if we speak of God's dispensation, the meaning is obscure.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. For an Organism to Express God in His Trinity</H2><P>If we are going to prophesy, we must see what God's economy is. God's economy is for an organism, and this organism is not for our interest, benefit, or attainments; it is for God's expression in His Trinity (Eph. 3:16-19). Apart from His Trinity, there is no way for God to express Himself. For a human being to express himself adequately, he needs a body with every part functioning properly. He also needs a mind and an emotion. When a person speaks, he must exercise his emotion, and he also needs a considerable exercise of the mind. Before I minister the Lord's word, I often pray, "Lord, infuse me with Your riches. Infuse my mind with Your thought, with Your thinking, and infuse my emotion with Your affection, with Your feeling." Without praying in this way, it would be difficult for me to express the Lord in my speaking. It is not sufficient merely to have power or impact in our speaking. We also need to be infused with the Lord's thought and His feeling.</P><P>For God to express Himself, He needs His Trinity. Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all." I sometimes wondered why this verse is so complicated in its expression. It seems to me that it would have been more brief to say, "God's grace, love, and fellowship be with you all." Why does God need to be so complicated? The grace of Christ is not simple. It involves Christ's incarnation, His humanity with His human living, His death in His humanity, His resurrection, His ascension, and His pouring Himself out on His Body. Likewise, the love of God and the fellowship of the Spirit involve many things. This is for God's expression. God is expressed in the Father's love, in the Son's grace, and in the Spirit's fellowship, that is, in His Trinity. Thus, in order to express Himself, God needs His Trinity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. With the Unsearchable Riches of Christ</H2><P>In order to prophesy, we need to see that in the universe there is such an economy of God, and according to His economy God desires to have an organism to express God in His Trinity with the unsearchable riches of Christ. In Ephesians 3:8-9 Paul put the economy of God together with the unsearchable riches of Christ. He said that he preached the unsearchable riches of Christ for the producing of an organism, that is, the church. If we have never seen this, we will not have any aspiration to prophesy, because only prophesying can build up such an organism. If we have not seen this organism, we do not have the feeling of the need for prophesying. This is the reason few Christians have any heart to consider the matter of prophesying. They are content merely with soul winning so that sinners may go to heaven. They have no heart, no ear, and no attention to hear anything about prophesying. But when we see the economy of God, we realize that without prophesying, it is impossible to build up the church as an organism. To build up the church as a religious organization is easy, but to build up the church as an organism through prophesying, we all need to see the economy of God for an organism that is constituted with the unsearchable riches of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. TO KNOW THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>Second, we must know the Body of Christ. To see is one thing; to know is another thing. To know something, we must get into it, practice it, experience it, and make it real in our knowledge. We need to know the Body of Christ in such a way. Knowing always follows seeing. First we see; then we know.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Constituted with the Divine Dispensing<br>and Transmitting of the Triune God<br>into the Believers as the Church</H2><P>The Body of Christ is constituted with the divine dispensing and transmitting of the Triune God into the believers as the church. The matters of God's dispensing and God's transmitting are seen in Ephesians 1:4, 5, 11, 13, 14, and 22. These six verses are crucial.</P><P>There is a difference between dispensing and transmitting. When we eat, we take food into our body; this is not a transmitting but a dispensing. In contrast, when a doctor gives a person a shot, this is not a dispensing but a transmitting. Thus, eating is a dispensing, whereas injecting is a transmitting. Things such as God Himself must be dispensed, but things such as power and strength should be transmitted. Electricity is not dispensed into a building; rather, it is transmitted into the building. The current of electricity is a transmission, but the current of blood within our body is a dispensing. While the blood flows within our body, it dispenses nutrients to our body. Dispensing is finer than transmitting. The Triune God is dispensing and transmitting Himself and His power into us as the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Mingling of the Processed and<br>Consummated Triune God with the Believers<br>as the Unique Body in the Universe</H2><P>The Body of Christ is the mingling of the processed and consummated Triune God with the believers as the unique Body in the universe (Eph. 4:3-6). In November 1991 I gave six messages on "The Intrinsic View of the Body of Christ," which were later published as a book by that title. In those messages I spoke on the high and deep view of the Body of Christ in the first four chapters of Ephesians. The content of those messages shows that in one sense I do have a certain amount of understanding concerning the Body of Christ. However, in some senses, I must say that even today I still do not know the Body of Christ.</P><P>In his earlier ministry in China, Brother Nee spoke a great deal on the normal Christian life. In 1938 he went to Europe. He stayed mainly in England, but he also visited Denmark, Norway, Germany, and Switzerland. Some of his messages spoken during that time were compiled by Angus Kinnear to form the book The Normal Christian Life. After returning to China in the summer of 1939, he gathered us for a conference. In that conference his emphasis was on knowing the Body. Brother Nee continued to speak on knowing the Body of Christ until 1942. Immediately after those three years, a turmoil rose up in the church in Shanghai that caused Brother Nee to be unable to minister for six years.</P><P>During the period of Brother Nee's speaking on knowing the Body, he conducted a four-month training. In every meeting he asked one of the trainees to give a testimony concerning how he came to know the Body of Christ. Nearly everyone was exposed by him for their inadequate knowledge of the Body.</P><P>The Epistle of 1 Corinthians speaks first concerning the Body in chapter twelve. Then, in chapter fourteen, Paul used an interchangeable term, the church. In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul did not use the term the Body of Christ; he spoke only of the church (vv. 4-5, 12, 19, 23, 28, 33-35). The Body of Christ is somewhat abstract and far away to our senses. The church, however, is practical and near to us. The church as the Body of Christ can be built up only by prophesying. Merely to preach the gospel to get people into the church does not build the church as an organism. At the end of the synoptic Gospels&#151;Matthew, Mark, and Luke&#151;the Lord commanded the disciples to go and preach the gospel (Matt. 28:19-20; Mark 16:15; Luke 24:46-49). But in the Gospel of John the Lord told the disciples to go forth and bear fruit (15:16). Bearing fruit is for the building up of an organism. This involves not only getting people saved but also bringing them into the Body of Christ.</P><P>Ephesians 4:3-6 speaks of one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one Father. This depicts a mingling of the Triune God&#151;the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father&#151;with the church as the Body. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are divine, but the Body is human. Four parties are mingled together: the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father (three parties on the divine side) and the Body (one party on the human side). What is depicted in Ephesians 4 is not three-in-one but four-in-one&#151;one entity comprising the Spirit, the Lord, the Father, and the Body. These four are mingled together to be one entity. This entity is a marvelous consummation. In the whole universe there is such an entity: the Triune God&#151;the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father&#151;mingled with a group of men. This is the church as the Body of Christ.</P><P>If the Triune God were not mingled with this Body, it would be a corpse, not a body. But because the Triune God is the life element to this Body, it is not a dead corpse but an organic entity, an organism. In order to build up such an organism, we must be able to prophesy. Even today our prophesying is still not very much in the nature of prophesying, but very much in the nature of a testimony or in the nature of giving a word of exhortation. To prophesy is to convey the divine element into people. When we read Paul's fourteen Epistles, we sense that in every page there is the dispensing of life into our spiritual being. Thus, Paul's writing was a prophesying.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. TO REALIZE THE RECOVERY OF THE LORD</H2><P>In order to practice the church life according to the God-ordained way, we also need to realize the recovery of the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Recovery of Christ and of Christ as Life to the Believers for the Church</H2><P>The first major item of the Lord's recovery is the recovery of Christ and of Christ as life to the believers for the church (Col. 1:15-19; 3:4a; Matt. 16:16-18). Christ is the central item of the entire Bible. Christianity has the name of Christ, but the reality of Christ in today's Christianity has been lost. The situation of today's Christianity is like that of the church in Laodicea in the Lord's epistle in Revelation 3:14-22. According to verse 20, Christ was outside the door of the church in Laodicea. Likewise, in today's Christianity the name of Christ is there, but the person and the reality of Christ are absent.</P><P>Throughout the centuries, especially from the end of the sixth century, when the papal system was fully established in the Roman Catholic Church, Christ has been put out of the church. This is the reason that Paul wrote the book of Colossians. In Colossians 1:15-19 Christ was revealed by Paul as the preeminent and all-inclusive One, the One who occupies the first place and also every inch of space in all things. These verses unveil Christ as the centrality and universality of God's economy. Not only in Paul's writings, but also in the Lord's recovery among us, from the time Brother Nee was raised up, Christ has been gradually recovered. In 1934 Brother Nee gave us a conference on the centrality and universality of Christ.</P><P>Also through Brother Nee, the matter of Christ being life to us was very much recovered. Even the group of seeking Christians who were called the inner life people did not recover Christ as life as much as we have in the Lord's present recovery. Thus, in the past years we have recovered Christ as everything and also Christ as life to us, the believers, for the church. Many books have been put out by us on Christ and on Christ as life to us for the church. This is the first main item of the Lord's recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Recovery of the Local Church Life</H2><P>The second main item of the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the local church life (Acts 9:31; 14:23). Brother Nee stressed this very much. In one of his publications Brother Nee said that he had a dream in which he saw that in every city of China there was a local church. This indicates how much Brother Nee was for the local church. Although he saw the local churches in his dream, under the Lord's sovereignty he was not allowed to see the fulfillment of that dream. I believe that if he were alive today, he would be happy because he would see that, not including the churches in mainland China, there are more than twelve hundred local churches on the earth. In Southern California alone there are forty-three local churches. Although a number of these churches are small, all of them are practicing the local church life.</P><P>This has caused some Christians to wonder how many pastors we have. To their thinking, we must be short of pastors to care for all the local churches. However, in the Lord's recovery, we are not short of pastors; on the contrary, we have many pastors. In our consideration every member in the recovery is a pastor, including the sisters. If you have never considered yourself a pastor, you are not in the recovery. In the Lord's recovery we do not have so-called pastors who speak, pray, and do everything for the other members in the churches.</P><P>Everyone in the Lord's recovery should consider himself a pastor. Every saint in the recovery is a pastor to the other saints, and the other saints are pastors to him. Every saint is a pastor who pastors others, and every saint is one who is pastored by others. I pastor you and you pastor me. I need your pastoring, and you need mine. If this were not our situation, the recovery would be the same as the denominations. Therefore, we all need to see that in the recovery, that is, in the local churches, we are all pastors and we are all pastored ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Recovery of the Unique Oneness<br>of the Body of Christ</H2><P>The third major item of the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the unique oneness of the Body of Christ (John 17:11, 22-23; Eph. 4:3-6). The recovery of the oneness of the Body of Christ is a crucial matter. In Christianity every difference in teaching produces a division. The Southern Baptists boast of their revelation concerning baptism by immersion; thus, they even name themselves according to this revelation. Likewise, the Presbyterian church is proud of their seeing of the presbytery, that is, the ruling of the church by the elders; the Lutherans have denominated themselves according to Luther and his teaching concerning justification by faith; and the Methodists have formed a denomination and named themselves according to Wesley's teaching regarding the method for living a proper life.</P><P>According to Paul's teaching, differences among Christians are unavoidable, but no difference is qualified to be a factor of division. In Romans 14 Paul pointed out that there were differences among the believers, using the matters of eating and the observing of days as examples (vv. 2-6). Although Paul taught that such differences should not be factors of division among the believers, some Christians have used differences to build up divisions as their glory. However, to us this kind of practice is a shame.</P><P>In 1987 some dissenting ones among us began to create divisions. They claim that my ministry has become a system that has subjected under the ministry all the churches built up by the ministry, making them "ministry churches" and no longer genuine local churches. They also say that the emphasis of my ministry has changed, and that this has changed the nature of the Lord's recovery. These dissenters have taken this as an excuse to separate themselves to form a number of divisions. Although I strongly deny these allegations concerning my ministry, even if they were true, it would not justify any division.</P><P>The dissenting ones also said that a local church is not under any kind of apostle. According to them, once the apostles establish elders in a locality, the apostles should keep their hands off the church there. However, Paul did not teach this, nor did he practice this. Paul appointed the elders in Ephesus, and then Paul stayed in Ephesus for three years (Acts 19:1, 8-10; 20:17-20, 27, 31). Similarly, from 1927 to 1952, Brother Nee remained in Shanghai, and the church in Shanghai was under his leading for twenty-five years. Not only so, but in 1948 he established me as an elder in Shanghai. He did not stay away from the church there; rather, in his caring for the church, he appointed me as an elder. The next year, 1949, because of the political situation, Brother Nee sent me out of China to Taiwan.</P><P>According to Paul's Epistles, the oneness of the Body of Christ covers many differences without any division. At the present time in the recovery, we practice baptism by immersion. However, if someone insists on baptizing people by sprinkling, this would not be a justification for anyone to make a division. Suppose that today there is a local church in a particular city that practices the Sabbath. They practice having the Lord's table on the seventh day, on Saturday, instead of on the eighth day, the Lord's Day, which is also the first day of the week. Would you consider them a division? Would you take the Lord's table with them? I would participate in the Lord's table with them. If they were to reject me because my practice is to take the Lord's table on the eighth day instead of on the seventh day, they would be divisive. Likewise, if I were to say that because I take the table on the eighth day, the Lord's Day, I would not take the Lord's table with them on the seventh day, then I would be divisive.</P><P>To say that we overcome the divisive things is easy; to practice this is not easy. According to the New Testament, nothing can qualify as a reason for division. Whether we like certain things in the church life or not, it is not up to our taste. What a marvelous thing it would be if some among us would keep the Sabbath, some would keep the eighth day, some would be sprinkled and some immersed, and some would even follow Mrs. Penn-Lewis, who did not practice water baptism at all but believed only in Spirit baptism. If we could have people with such differences sitting together and saying, "Hallelujah, Praise the Lord," that would be a sign that the genuine oneness is among us. We all need to realize such a recovery of the unique oneness of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. TO AVOID CHURCHLESSNESS AND DIVISION</H2><P>Another item of the prerequisite of the practice of the church life according to the God-ordained way is to avoid churchlessness and division. To be churchless is to not have the church. Today millions of Christians have no consideration for the church. They do not care for the church at all. In their consideration, as long as they believe in the Lord Jesus, love Him, and are zealous for soul winning, that is sufficient. This kind of thinking is seriously in error.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Not Neglecting the Goal<br>of the God-ordained Way&#151;the Church</H2><P>If we would practice the church life according to the God-ordained way, we must not neglect the goal of the God-ordained way&#151;the church (Matt. 16:16-18; Eph. 1:22; 5:25-27). The goal of the God-ordained way is the church. If we are a churchless people, we are not qualified to take the God-ordained way. The God-ordained way is for reaching its goal, which is the church. We must have the church. Furthermore, division annuls the purpose and goal of God's ordained way. Hence, we must avoid these two things: churchlessness and division.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Turning Away from Those Who Make Divisions</H2><P>We also need to turn away from those who make divisions (Rom. 16:17; Titus 3:10; 1 Cor. 1:13). Even if a close relative such as our husband, wife, father, mother, brother, or sister is a division-maker, we must turn away from their division. The same applies to our intimate and close friends. Although it is difficult to turn away from those who are our intimate friends, we must realize that friendship is one thing, and the fellowship in Christ and in His Body is another thing. When Moses' sister, Miriam, became leprous, she was quarantined in Moses' presence (Num. 12). To quarantine is a medical term that means to separate. To separate, or to quarantine, a leper was not to give him up or to cast him away; it was simply to keep the leprous one separate from the rest of God's people so that they would not be contaminated by the leprosy. Once the leprosy was healed, that man was declared clean, and he could come back into the fellowship of God's people. According to Leviticus 13 and 14, to discern whether or not a person was leprous or was cleansed from leprosy was a difficult thing. This could not be discerned by ordinary people; it could be discerned only with great care and by a proper priest. We all must do our best to avoid churchlessness and division.</P><P>To summarize, the prerequisite of the practice of the church life according to the God-ordained way is first to see the economy of God, to know the Body of Christ, to realize the recovery of the Lord, and to avoid churchlessness and division.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PREREQUISITE OF<br>THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE<br>ACCORDING TO THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:16-17; 3:14; 1 Cor. 14:29b; Acts 2:42a; Eph. 4:14</H1><P>In this term of training I have a deep consideration for all the trainees, especially the young ones. I also believe that what I am going to fellowship with you in this message will be a help to all the saints in the Lord's recovery. I believe you have heard that beginning in September 1987 a group of brothers who had been among us for many years became very dissenting. In the past four years they have spoken and even written a number of things that are divisive and very misleading. During this time I adopted the attitude that I would not fight with them. Thus, I did not say much, but, on the positive side, I received a burden from the Lord to put out more and more messages on the divine Word. Beginning in the summer of 1988, after they had begun their conspiracy, my speaking increased. First, in 1988 I put out the Life-study of Leviticus. Then from 1989 through 1991, I released, consecutively, the life-studies of Numbers, Deuteronomy, Isaiah, Daniel and Zechariah, and Jeremiah and Lamentations. Presently, I am ready to finish the life-study of the Old Testament Prophets by covering the Minor Prophets in the coming summer training. During the same period, besides all the life-studies on these books of the Old Testament, I have held a number of conferences in different cities, including Seattle, Cleveland, Atlanta, Pasadena, San Diego, Taipei, Berkeley, and Anaheim. In all these conferences I passed on some crucial messages for the recovery.</P><P>In this message and the next I would like to take the opportunity to make the present situation in the Lord's recovery clear to all the saints. Then we will know where we are and will also know how to face the present situation. I say again that I have no intention to fight with anyone. For all the years of my ministry I have never done the Lord's work in the way of stressing things on the negative side. On the contrary, I have always done the work by ministering things on the positive side. Therefore, in this message what I am going to say is not something negative but something very positive.</P><P>In the previous message we covered four points of the prerequisite of the practice of the church life according to the God-ordained way. In this message we will continue with the fifth and sixth points.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. TO HAVE A CLEAR VIEW CONCERNING<br>THE PRESENT SITUATION OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>The fifth point of the prerequisite is to have a clear view concerning the present situation of the Lord's recovery. Since we are in the recovery, we should know the present situation of the recovery. We should not be indifferent but should know the real situation. This requires that we get into the intrinsic nature of every problem.</P><P>According to God's ordained principle in His creation, nothing can exist without two sides. Even a thin piece of paper has two sides. Not only so, but according to God's ordination, for many things to exist, they need not only two sides but also an outer covering and an inner reality. A walnut is a kind of fruit, but its appearance is tough and rough. The external shell of the walnut is not the real walnut. The real walnut is not the shell but the kernel. When we eat a walnut, we do not eat the shell; we eat the kernel. The shell of the walnut and the kernel of the walnut are two different things.</P><P>The book of Jeremiah may be likened to a walnut. I misunderstood this book for many years. When I first read it, I did not appreciate it. Nevertheless, there were two verses in Jeremiah that I could never forget. The first was 17:9, which says, "The heart is deceitful above all things/And it is incurable;/Who can know it?" From my youth I remembered that verse. It helped me not to trust any heart, including my heart, because man's heart is deceitful. The second verse is 13:23, which says, "Can the Cushite change his skin,/Or the leopard his spots?/Then you also may be able to do good,/Who are accustomed to do evil." This verse says that man's sinful nature is unchangeable. Jeremiah likens man's sinful nature to two things: the skin of the Cushite and the spots of the leopard. The fact that no one can change these two things indicates that man's sinful nature is unchangeable. While I was writing the outlines for the 1991 Winter Training on Jeremiah, I was forced to get into the kernel of Jeremiah intrinsically. It was then that the Lord showed me the intrinsic contents of this book.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. By Thorough Prayer</H2><P>The way to have a clear view concerning the present situation of the Lord's recovery is by thorough prayer (Eph. 1:16; 3:14). When you hear the things spoken by the dissenting ones, do not take them at face value. These sayings in themselves are only the "shell"; they are not the "kernel." When you hear anything concerning the Lord's recovery, you should not receive it immediately. Instead, you should bring it to the Lord in prayer. You should not pray only once but should pray again and again concerning what you have heard, until you have prayed thoroughly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In a Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation</H2><P>In order to have a clear view concerning the present situation, we need to have a spirit of wisdom and revelation. Paul desired to help the Ephesians to know God's economy intrinsically. Concerning this, he prayed twice. In Ephesians 1:17 he prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation. He did not pray concerning the mind or the emotion; he prayed concerning the spirit, and this spirit is not a spirit of knowledge and understanding but a spirit of wisdom and revelation. To know God's economy intrinsically, we need more than knowledge and understanding; we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</P><P>Then, in Ephesians 3:14-19 Paul prayed for "this cause": that we may know Christ in such a way that He will be able to make His home in our hearts. For this particular cause Paul did not pray lightly; rather, he prayed in an earnest and formal way, bowing his knees to the Father.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Without Prejudice</H2><P>To have a clear view concerning the present situation of the Lord's recovery, we must be without prejudice. We should not say anything out of prejudice. Rather, we should learn to be quiet and bring every problem to the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Without Partiality</H2><P>In order to have a clear view of the present situation, we must also be without partiality; that is, in any controversy we should not take sides.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Without Personal Affection</H2><P>We must also learn to view the situation without personal affection. We should learn not to express our personal likes or dislikes concerning anything. We need to know who we are. We are nothing. We are small slaves of the Lord, and in His great house we should not say that we like or dislike certain things. We should say, "If the Lord shows me so, I will take it."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Without Self-opinion<br>but Full of Spiritual Discernment</H2><P>Finally, we must be without self-opinion but full of spiritual discernment (1 Cor. 14:29b). The English letters o, c, and e are sometimes difficult to distinguish. If we do not exercise discernment, we may read something wrongly. In the Chinese language a number of characters differ only slightly in form. For example, the character for heaven and that for monster are nearly the same. Thus, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish them.</P><P>When we attempt to get into the intrinsic nature of the twenty "problems" raised by the dissenting ones, we can see that none of them is simple. Every one is very crucial. And these twenty items show clearly that there must have been a conspiracy among the dissenting brothers. Without a conspiracy, no one could have put forth all these items. To enter into the intrinsic nature of all these items, we must not have any opinion but must be full of discernment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. TO DISCERN THE PRESENT PROBLEMS<br>RAISED BY THE DISSENTING ONES</H2><P>Because of the rebellion in these past four and a half years, many negative things were spoken by the dissenting ones. A number of these things were distributed in writing, and some have even become slogans. In this message and the next, my intention is to fellowship with you concerning twenty "problems" raised by the dissenting ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Problem of Control</H2><P>The first problem is the problem of control; this problem comprises four items. The main thing for which the dissenters condemned me is that I and the Living Stream Ministry office control the churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. "The Centralization of Control"<br>by the Training Center</H2><P>The dissenting ones used the term "the centralization of control." When their conspiracy began in September 1987, I was in Taiwan conducting a training for full-time serving ones. In December of that year I came back to the United States. Shortly thereafter, four of the dissenting ones came to speak with me. The first one to speak used this term "the centralization of control." Prior to that time I had never heard such a term. While I was waiting to discover the meaning of this term, this brother expressed that my training center in Taipei was considered by them to be a center to control all the churches on this earth. He said that this control was to such an extent that all the churches on the earth had to report their meeting times to my training center in Taipei. I had never heard of such a thing. He said that this was my way to control all the churches. He then said that I trained the young people in my training center in Taipei, and eventually they were all instructed and charged to go back to their churches to control the churches for me. Then the fourth brother continued, saying strongly that the training in Taipei should be dismantled into pieces.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Control by the Trainings, Conferences, Messages, Tapes, Etc.</H2><P>The dissenting brothers also accused me of controlling the churches by my trainings, conferences, messages, tapes, etc. On March 19, 1989, in a word spoken to the church in Anaheim upon his resignation from the eldership, one of the dissenters said, "There has been a pervasive control exercised over the church...The control has not been exercised so much directly, but very much indirectly, through videos, conferences, trainings, and elders' meetings." This word implies that whatever I do in my ministry&#151;teaching, training, publishing, and distributing audio and video tapes&#151;is all for the purpose of controlling the churches.</P><P>In a very positive sense, I would say that my ministry does "control" people. If you are going to take drugs, my trainings will "control" you. If you are going to lose your temper with your wife, my books will "control" you. It is true that my trainings, conferences, publications, and tapes exercise a considerable "control" over thousands of people around the globe. Without such "control," many people might have done certain things that would have damaged themselves and their families. In this sense, it is true that my ministry "controls" people.</P><P>Any kind of edification exercises some amount of "control." All the schools, classes, teachers, and professors control their students. Although the "control" exercised by my ministry over the saints and the churches is very positive, the dissenting ones speak of control in a very negative way to undermine my ministry. This is why I say that when you hear these things, you should not merely react to the outward appearance, to the "shell." You must bring what you hear to the Lord; then the Lord will lead you to see what the intrinsic thing is within the shell.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. "A King," "the Philosophy of a King"</H2><P>Third, one of the dissenters said that among us there is the problem of "a king." He also said that there is the problem of "the philosophy of a king" (see The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion, published by Living Stream Ministry, pages 100-101). This means that in their conspiracy the dissenting ones wanted to put down the philosophy of a king. In using the term "the philosophy of a king," the dissenters mean that in the recovery there is a strong teaching concerning a definite leader among us. The word philosophy here means logic or teaching, and the king here refers to a leader.</P><P>In the New Testament, in one sense, there is the philosophy, or teaching, of a definite leader among God's people, and in another sense, there is not such a teaching. Of the twenty-seven books in the New Testament, fourteen were written by the apostle Paul. In his Epistles he was very strong to emphasize the leadership. In 1 Corinthians 4:16, 11:1, and Philippians 3:17, Paul entreated the saints to imitate him because he imitated Christ. In Hebrews 13:17 he charged the believers to "obey the ones leading you and submit to them." Verses such as these indicate that there is teaching in the New Testament concerning the leadership. However, neither the New Testament nor my ministry teaches anyone to be a king. Although the apostle Paul taught strongly concerning leadership, in 2 Corinthians 4:5 he said that the apostles preached Christ Jesus as Lord, and themselves as the believers' slaves for Jesus' sake. This indicates that we are not kings but are slaves to serve the saints.</P><P>In speaking of "a king," no doubt the dissenting ones are referring to me. I have been with the saints and the churches in the United States for more than thirty years. To whom have I been a king? Such a statement concerning me is a reviling, not merely a defamation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Control of the Churches<br>by the Living Stream Ministry Office</H2><P>Fourth, the dissenters have accused the Living Stream Ministry office of controlling the churches. But I would ask, which church has the office controlled? They say that the office gave orders to the churches, commanding the churches to do certain things. However, this kind of accusation is false. The Living Stream Ministry office serves hundreds of churches. The office does not give orders to the churches, but it does ask the churches to coordinate with the office. For instance, in printing our books, it is difficult to decide how many copies we should print. In the initial years we did not have a proper way to make this decision; consequently, we printed more copies of some of the books than were needed. Eventually, the office asked the churches to submit standing orders for books and tapes. This has been a great help to the office. Sometimes, when a church has not submitted its standing order, the office asks the church to turn in its order. This is not the issuing of a command to that church but merely an asking of that church for its cooperation. The ministry office has also had to coordinate among the churches the procedure for the distribution and viewing of the video tapes of the semiannual trainings. It is mainly concerning these kinds of things that the office has communicated with the churches to coordinate with them. Besides these things, I cannot find any evidence that the Living Stream office controls any church. After hearing such an accusation, I asked any church who felt that they were under the control of the office to inform me of this, but to this date no church has confirmed this accusation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Hierarchy Built Up by the Ministry<br>and the Ministry Office</H2><P>After I returned to Anaheim from Taipei in December 1987, a letter from one of the dissenting ones was waiting for me in my home. In this long letter the writer rebuked me, saying that the nature of the Lord's recovery had changed and that he had no alternative but to withdraw from the work. In a second letter to me he accused me of building up a hierarchy to subdue and control the churches (see The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion, pages 56-57). At the end of December I went to Irving to take care of the winter training there. During the winter training, on a Lord's Day I invited this brother to my apartment. In the presence of approximately six or seven brothers I said to him, "Brother..., in your letter to me (of December 16, 1987) you blamed my office for building up a hierarchy. Please point out to me a real case. Where is such a real hierarchy? I would be the first one to tear it down." He hesitated for awhile and did not speak. Then he answered, "There is the tendency" (see The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion, pages 59-60). In his letter he did not say "there is the tendency." He said emphatically that a hierarchy had been built up. Now he changed and said that there is the tendency. There is a tendency on this earth for everything. I have not died yet, but there is the tendency that I will die. This is the way that the rebellion was going on, without any ethical standard.</P><P>Today, outside mainland China there are approximately twelve hundred churches around the globe. I would ask all the churches: If you are a church that is under a hierarchy built up by me or by my office, please tell me. Thus far, no one has pointed out such a thing to me.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The System of the Ministry</H2><P>The dissenters have also said that the ministry is a system, and all the churches have been systematized into this entity. The church in Rosemead declared that they would not be in the "system" of Witness Lee. The hall in Rosemead was built with funds from the sale of Elden Hall in Los Angeles, which was bought through my hand. In addition, the Living Stream Ministry gave the church in Rosemead $100,000 as a gift. Eventually, the rebellious ones in Rosemead took over the meeting hall and evicted in writing the two bona fide elders, Francis Ball and John Kwan. These two brothers were properly appointed elders who had been accepted by the saints, but at the time the rebellious ones were going to take over the hall, they wrote letters to the two elders, telling them that they could no longer set foot on the premises of the church in Rosemead and that if they attempted to do so, they would be forcefully evicted (see The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion, pages 52-55).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. "Ministry Churches," No Longer Local Churches</H2><P>The opposers also say that the churches that follow the ministry are "ministry churches" and are no longer local churches. The leading ones of the church in Raleigh, North Carolina, came to contact me. They came with a number of books in which they had underlined certain paragraphs. One section they had underlined was in Brother Nee's book The Normal Christian Church Life (published by Living Stream Ministry). There Brother Nee said that the missionaries who went to China built up mission churches instead of local churches. Every mission built up churches under its own name. Brother Nee said that it was right for the missionaries to go to China to preach the gospel, but it was wrong for them to build up their denominational churches. They should preach the gospel and build up only local churches. (See The Normal Christian Church Life, pages 135, 138-140, 162-164.) Then the leading ones from Raleigh applied this to me, saying that I do not build up the local churches but churches to my ministry. They should not "take the hat from a condemned one and put it on my head."</P><P>I have never built up any "ministry church." I have been in the recovery for sixty years, laboring continually. I was also with Brother Nee for twenty years. Neither Brother Nee nor I ever built up a church to ourselves. The churches built up through the Lord's ministry are not "ministry churches." Although Paul's ministry built up a number of churches, it is not right to call any of these churches "Pauline churches." Some of the Corinthians said, "I am of Paul," others said, "I of Apollos," and others, "I of Cephas" (1 Cor. 1:12); but eventually Paul said that he, Apollos, and Cephas were of the Corinthians, for all were theirs (3:21-22). The missionaries went to China and built up their mission churches, but our ministry has built up not "ministry churches" but local churches. Today it is difficult to find any local church on this earth that has not been built up by our ministry. Therefore, their accusing of me is not fair.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Autonomy of the Local Churches</H2><P>From the spring of 1988 the dissenting ones began to teach the autonomy of the local churches. Their teaching was based on G. H. Lang's book The Churches of God. They even purchased copies of this book and distributed them to the saints.</P><P>The teaching of the autonomy of the local churches is surely erroneous. The church cannot be absolutely autonomous. The United States is a federal country with fifty states. In a sense each state, having its own state government, is an autonomy. Even so, it is not altogether autonomous. All the fifty states have one ministry for the national defense, one ministry of foreign affairs, one constitutional law upheld by the Supreme Court (a federal court), one currency, one postal practice, and a federal highway system that runs through them all. In many things it is impossible for the fifty states to be autonomous.</P><P>It is ridiculous to say that the local churches could be absolutely autonomous. All the churches are the one Body of Christ (Eph. 4:4a). Can the parts of our physical body be autonomous? Could the hand be a small autonomy, the shoulder a large autonomy, and the thigh an even larger autonomy? If so, this would kill the body. All the parts of the body have only one circulation of blood. Thus, it is impossible for the Body of Christ to be autonomous. Beginning in the summer of 1988 and continuing through the remainder of that year, I spoke a number of messages exposing the fallacy of the teaching of autonomy (see A Timely Word, pages 29-30; The Body of Christ, pages 17-19; A Timely Trumpeting and the Present Need, pages 33-34; The Building Up of the Body of Christ, pages 30-32; and Further Light concerning the Building Up of the Body of Christ, pages 29-30, published by Living Stream Ministry). After that, I did not hear much of this wrong teaching out of the dissenters' mouths. This may indicate they have realized that they do not have the truth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. After Appointing the Elders,<br>the Apostles Keep Their Hands off<br>the Local Churches</H2><P>The dissenting brothers also said that after appointing the elders, the apostles should keep their hands off the local churches. However, after the apostle Paul appointed the elders in Ephesus, he did not keep his hands off the church there. Rather, he went back again and again to contact the church, and he also wrote the church an Epistle. At one point he remained in Ephesus for three years (Acts 19; 20:31). When he was journeying to Jerusalem in Acts 20, he passed through the region that was close to Ephesus, and he called for the elders from Ephesus to come to him at Miletus (vv. 17-38). There he told the elders that while he was in Asia he was with them all the time and did not withhold from them anything that was profitable, but for three years declared to them and taught them publicly and from house to house, admonishing them with tears (vv. 18, 20, 31). After appointing the elders in Ephesus, Paul certainly did not keep his hands off the church in Ephesus.</P><P>If, after setting up the churches and appointing the elders, the apostles keep their hands off the churches, eventually the apostles will have nothing to do. But Ephesians 4:12 says that the apostles are for the perfecting of the saints. To support their teaching, the dissenting ones used Brother Nee's writing in The Normal Christian Church Life, page 66: "Once a church was established, all responsibility was handed over to the local elders, and from that day the apostles exercised no control whatever in its affairs [italics added]." Later, in another book, Church Affairs, Brother Nee corrected this misuse of his words. On pages 14-26 Brother Nee dwelt on this one thing: he told his co-workers that after they appointed elders in a local church, they had to stay there to teach the elders, to train the elders, to show the elders, how to care for the church. (See A Timely Word, pages 27-29, and A Timely Trumpeting and the Present Need, pages 15-18.)</P><P>The church in Shanghai was raised up in 1926, not by Brother Nee. The following year Brother Nee went to Shanghai to strengthen and establish the church in Shanghai. From that year, 1927, he never left Shanghai; he stayed there for twenty-five years, until 1952, when he was put into prison. All that time the church in Shanghai was under his hand.</P><P>The dissenting ones also said that during the apostles' time there were only twelve apostles: the eleven appointed by the Lord Jesus (not including Matthias), and the twelfth, Paul. Then I began to speak that this was an old teaching put out by the Brethren. Brother Nee adjusted this teaching in The Normal Christian Church Life. In that book Brother Nee gave a long word concerning the apostleship (see chapter one, "The Apostles"). Then the dissenters adjusted their speaking, saying that according to God's Word, the apostles are always plural in number. One of them said that there are many apostles today and that he could give the names of a number of these apostles. Later, he gave the names of certain brothers to one of the saints. After I heard this kind of speaking, I went to Taipei, and there I gave a message entitled "The Different Kinds of Apostles and the Relationships between Them" (see A Timely Trumpeting and the Present Need, chapter two). In that message I pointed out that in the Bible there are only three kinds of apostles: (1) those appointed directly by the Lord and those constituted directly through the Lord's revelation, such as Peter, John, and Paul; (2) those perfected by others, such as Apollos; and (3) those produced by the Lord's directly appointed apostles, such as Timothy, Silas, and Titus. I also pointed out that according to the Bible the apostles of the third kind, those produced by the Lord's directly appointed apostles, are led and directed by those who produced them. Timothy, Silas, and Titus were not apostles of the first kind but were apostles of the third kind. Likewise, those brothers named by the dissenting one as today's apostles are all my students. Thus, they too are not apostles raised up and appointed directly by the Lord. Eventually, the dissenters changed their speaking again, saying that today there are no apostles.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Since 1984 the Ministry Has Changed<br>from Life and Life Supply to Budgets, Numbers, Activities, and Other Practices, and This Change Has Affected the Nature of the Recovery</H2><P>The dissenting ones also said that since 1984 the ministry has changed from life and life supply to budgets, numbers, activities, and other practices, and this change has affected the nature of the recovery. This kind of word was sounded out the most strongly in Europe. They told people that before 1984 Witness Lee was right, but after 1984 he is wrong because he does not teach anything concerning life. Then, at the end of 1988, one of the four leaders of the conspiracy spoke the same words to a group of brothers in San Diego. Those who have heard my speaking since 1984 can testify what a lie this is. Such a lie was part of the strategy of the dissenting ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Concerning the Teaching of the Ministry</H2><P>The dissenting brothers also raised a problem concerning the teaching of the ministry. In Acts 2:42, Luke, the writer of that book, used the expression the teaching of the apostles. Our interpretation of this expression is that the teaching of the apostles comprises the four Gospels, the Acts, the Epistles, and the book of Revelation; that is, the entire New Testament is the teaching of the apostles. Whatever we teach must be according to the New Testament, which is the teaching of the apostles. If so, our teaching also is the apostles' teaching. However, the dissenting ones said that the teaching of the apostles mentioned in Acts 2:42 refers only to the four Gospels, to what the Lord Jesus taught the twelve apostles and charged them to teach to the future new believers. My response to this is that the teaching of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels is a part of the teaching of the apostles, but it is not the totality of that teaching. In John 16, while the Lord Jesus was teaching the disciples, at one point He said that He had yet many things to say to them, but they were not able to bear them at that time; but when the Spirit of reality came, He would disclose these things to them (vv. 12-15). This indicates that the Lord had many things to teach Peter and the others, but that was not the proper time. The Lord waited until the Spirit came to disclose the deeper things to some of the disciples. To whom were these deeper things disclosed? Surely they must have been disclosed mainly to the apostle Paul. In Colossians 1:25 Paul said that his ministry was to complete the word of God. God's plan, God's economy, was not revealed mainly to Peter. It was revealed mainly to the apostle Paul and recorded in his fourteen Epistles.</P><P>If the four Gospels are the teaching of the apostles, all the Epistles should also be the teaching of the apostles. This is the proper interpretation of the Bible. Now, if whatever we speak is according to the New Testament, our teaching also is the apostles' teaching; it is not our teaching. If it is our own teaching, then it is something other than the apostles' teaching. In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul told Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach different things, things that are different from God's economy. In their deviating speaking concerning the teaching of the ministry, the intention of the dissenters is nothing else than to put my ministry aside.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Concerning the Leadership</H2><P>The dissenting ones also raised questions concerning the matter of leadership. In 1986 I gave a series of messages that were misunderstood and misused by them (see Elders' Training, Book 7, One Accord for the Lord's Move, published by Living Stream Ministry). They thought that I meant that I am the leader in the Lord's recovery. Then, in the 1987 Summer Training I gave additional messages to point out that, actually, the New Testament leadership is not a person but is the teaching of the apostles (see The God-ordained Way to Practice the New Testament Economy, chapter nineteen, especially pages 172-173, published by Living Stream Ministry). Paul's teaching, the teaching of the New Testament, not Paul himself, was the actual leadership. Today, among us the teaching of those who teach the New Testament apostles' teaching is the leading. The leadership in the Lord's recovery is actually not according to anyone's teaching, but according to the apostles' teaching, which is the teaching of the New Testament.</P><P>Today, the saints in the recovery should not follow me; they should follow my teaching, if my teaching is according to the apostles' teaching. In 1934 Brother Nee encountered much opposition in his ministry, and I went to see him. I said to him, "Brother Nee, from the first day that we began to have contact, there was no personal affection between you and me. Nevertheless, I have followed you absolutely, and I do have the assurance that I am following the right way because you have the Lord's revelation. The revelation you pass on is according to the New Testament. Actually, I am not following you personally; I follow the revelation you have released." Then I said, "Brother Nee, even if from today you would give up the way of the Lord's recovery, I would remain in this way."</P><P>Do you believe that you are in the Lord's recovery following a man? One of the dissenting ones repented to the uttermost that he listened to only one man. He said that in doing so he had committed a great sin before God. I would like to ask you all: Do you listen to one man's word? Actually, you do not listen to one man; you listen to the teaching of the apostles. I have the assurance that since I began to speak for the Lord, I did not speak anything that was not according to the New Testament principles. Therefore, to follow the ministry is absolutely right; it is not wrong.</P><P>The Lord's recovery was raised up in China through Brother Nee's teaching for exactly thirty years, from 1922 through 1952. In those thirty years there was no one else who put out the New Testament teaching. In the 1950s I was sent to Taiwan. Because of his imprisonment in 1952, from that time Brother Nee's speaking ceased. I had no intention to stand up to replace him. I only knew to labor. I put out teaching after teaching, but I did not have the intention that I would be the only one who would teach the churches. After we moved into the hall in Anaheim, I gathered the leading co-workers in the country to have a writers' conference. I encouraged all the co-workers to write something, and they all took my charge to go back to write. Eventually, I found out that very little writing came out of them directly. Nearly all of their writing was a reprinting of my messages. Several localities put out magazines, but most of the messages in those publications were a reprinting of my teaching, with some being a repeating of Brother Nee's teaching. Realizing that this was the situation, in 1986 I encouraged all the brothers to stop this kind of repetition, and they all complied. Speaking honestly, in the forty years from 1950 through 1990, whose teaching has been available to raise up the church, to build up the church, to feed the saints, and so forth? Of course, the foundation was laid by Brother Nee's teaching, but by whose teaching has the building up been carried out?</P><P>In my home I still have a book published by the top theological school in Taiwan. In that book, which encourages people to study the Bible and teaches people how to study the Bible, there is a brief word that says that for the past forty years, counting from 1949, among the Chinese Christians the expounding of the Bible could never go beyond the realm of the teaching of the "Assembly Hall people," that is, the teaching in the Lord's recovery. If we were to take away Brother Nee's teaching and my teaching, where would the church be today? By this we can see the enemy's subtlety, which is just to smear the ministry.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PREREQUISITE OF<br>THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE<br>ACCORDING TO THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:16-17; 3:14; 1 Cor. 14:29b; Acts 2:42a; Eph. 4:14</H1><P>In the previous message, we saw that we need to have a clear view concerning the present situation of the Lord's recovery to discern the present problems raised up by the dissenting ones. In this message we want to address more of the items raised up by these ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Concerning the One Accord</H2><P>Can we be in one accord if we have differences? The answer to this question is "yes." We must be in one accord in spite of the differences. Both in the Gospels and in Acts, we are taught to be in one accord (Matt. 18:19; Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:24; 5:12; 15:25; Rom. 15:6). Some would say that we must get rid of all the differences among the believers in order to be in one accord, but this is only to make everything uniform.</P><P>In the New Testament churches, there were many differences. In Romans 14 Paul said that we must receive both those who regard a certain day and those who do not (vv. 1, 5-6a). Paul said that we must receive the believers who may differ from us in their doctrinal concepts or religious practices because God and Christ have received them (14:3; 15:7). Since both God and Christ have received them, how can we not receive them? Paul said that some ate only vegetables, while others ate all things (Rom. 14:2-3). We must receive both because God and Christ have received them. In receiving the believers, Paul was very broad and liberal. He was not narrow-minded.</P><P>More than twenty-five years ago, there was a sister among us who was Jewish. One day she told me that even when the dishes and forks used for eating pork were washed with detergent, she could still smell the pork on them. There are all kinds of people in the church. We all have been saved, yet we have many differences. Some practice foot-washing or head covering. Some baptize by immersing one time, while others baptize by immersing three times. If all of these different believers were among us, could we have the one accord? I would love to see church meetings of believers in one accord with all kinds of differences. That would be marvelous!</P><P>In 1963 in the church in Los Angeles, there were at least four different groups meeting together. In the previous year, I held the first conference in the Lord's recovery in the United States, and I spoke from Deuteronomy 8 concerning the all-inclusive Christ. These messages attracted many people. When others heard about these messages, they invited me to hold conferences in their places. Therefore, when the first conference ended on December 31, the next day I went to Whittier, California and spoke to a group that was composed mainly of Brethren believers. Eventually, they asked me to go to speak to another group in Las Vegas. The group there was an independent Bible church. I visited them on about four different occasions. Eventually, that whole congregation decided to move to Los Angeles in order to join the church there.</P><P>This group and at least three other groups came to Los Angeles. One day they all agreed to come together. In the place where we met jointly in Los Angeles in 1963, I put up two banners. The first banner read&#151;"Unity versus Uniformity," and the second banner read&#151;"Unity with Variety." At the beginning in Los Angeles, this was our situation. We had much variety, but we also had the unity.</P><P>Later I went away to New York. In my absence, the slogans on the banners did not work. During a meeting, one of the young sisters began to play the tambourine. One of the brothers from the Brethren group told the sister to stop playing it. I received a phone call about this incident while in New York. When I arrived back in Los Angeles, I spoke with the brother from the Brethren group. I asked him to compare the tambourine with the piano, and he said that he preferred the piano. I said, "Brother, in the eyes of God, what is the difference between these two musical instruments?" He agreed that there was no difference in the eyes of God. I continued by saying, "Since these two instruments are the same in the eyes of God, they should also be the same in our eyes." The brother responded by saying that he could not take the playing of the tambourine. I said, "Brother, since you cannot take the playing of the tambourine, you are unable to live the church life."</P><P>The church life must be of unity with variety. To be in one accord does not mean to get rid of all the differences. If this were the case, we could never have the one accord in this age. We must be exercised to such an extent that we keep the unity without caring to have uniformity. We should be happy to see a meeting full of differences, yet without any discord.</P><P>In the early days in Los Angeles, some tongue-speakers came into one of the meetings. When they began to speak in tongues in the meeting, some of the brothers looked at me to see what I would do. Eventually, the brothers motioned to me that I should stop them when these ones began to interpret their tongue-speaking. But I said quietly to the brothers that we should let them go ahead. We can take such differences.</P><P>A number of years ago, some brothers took the way of the Lord's recovery, but they would not practice the Lord's table. When this matter was referred to me, I said that there was no problem. Whether they liked to have the Lord's table or not, they had been received by the Lord, so we had to receive them. The church in their locality kept this practice of not having the Lord's table for a good number of years. In spite of this, the saints there were really one with the saints in the other localities. There was one accord in spite of the differences. Gradually, the brothers and sisters who did not practice the Lord's table heard about it and wanted to practice it. Today they have the Lord's table regularly. This is an example of keeping the unity with variety.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Concerning the Ground of the Church</H2><P>The extract of the definition of the church ground is to keep the oneness of the Spirit inwardly and to take the differences outwardly, not allowing anything but the locality in which we live to separate us into local churches. Ephesians 4:3 says, "Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace." Keeping the oneness of the Spirit is inward, whereas the differences are outward. If one brother is a Sabbath keeper and another brother practices meeting on the Lord's Day, the differences between them are outward. We have to keep the oneness of the Spirit inwardly, and we have to take the differences outwardly. This is the essence of the church ground.</P><P>The ground of the church involves not allowing anything but the locality in which we live to separate us into local churches (Rev. 1:11). Baptism, speaking in tongues, sprinkling, immersion, and dietary preferences are all differences. But none of these differences should separate us. We should be separated only by the localities in which we live. If we live in Anaheim, we cannot meet together regularly with the saints in New York. This is impossible. If we are in Anaheim, it is also difficult for us to meet with the saints in Los Angeles. Our locality spontaneously separates us. We are separated outwardly, but we are still one inwardly. We are one in the Spirit with the saints in New York, London, and Taipei.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. All the Trainings by the Ministry<br>Should Be Stopped</H2><P>The dissenting ones demanded that all the trainings by the ministry be stopped. This was their opinion, but I have my burden. Those who have caused divisions among us have accused me of using the trainings to control the churches.</P><P>The rebellion with these ones began in September 1987, while I was in Taipei. Shortly after I came back to the United States in December 1987, four of the dissenting ones came to see me. They made some demand of me and warned me that they would cut off my publications and tapes if I did not comply with their demand and that the church in Anaheim would take the lead. One of them said to me with a furious tone that the training in Taipei should be dismantled into pieces.</P><P>Again I say, they have their opinion, but I have my burden. It is not right to interfere with another person's burden by your opinion. The more I prayed about the training, the more burdened I became. Consider what the situation among the churches in the recovery would be if the trainings were taken away.</P><P>When I went to Shanghai for the first time in 1933, Brother Watchman Nee talked with me about the need for a training. A number of us were under his continual training. Eventually, he had two big trainings. In 1948 over eighty people went to his place on a mountain to be trained by him for nearly half a year. In 1949 he had a second big training, and I was there.</P><P>The apostle Paul stayed in Ephesus for three years (Acts 20:31). For two years he spoke the word of the Lord in the school of Tyrannus in order to teach people (19:9-10). Tyrannus might have been a teacher, and Paul might have rented his school and used it as a meeting hall to preach and teach the word of the Lord. I consider his teaching of people in that school to be something like a training. Surely there were church meetings in Ephesus. But if Paul did not do something in addition to the church meetings, why would he have needed to use a place which was like a school? If there were no need for the saints to be trained, why would Paul stay in the city of Ephesus for three years? We have had our trainings mainly based upon Paul's example. We have a burden to train the seeking saints and young saints with the word of the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>M. Concerning the Nature of the Oneness<br>of the Body, re: Denominations</H2><P>When the dissenters began to cause trouble in 1987, they claimed that I had changed and that my change had affected the nature of the recovery. I admit that I changed from the old way of gospel preaching to the scriptural way of visiting people. I also told people to turn from having church meetings with one man speaking and the rest listening to meetings in which all can prophesy according to the revelation of 1 Corinthians 14. I changed in these matters, but my change did not affect the nature of the oneness of the Body.</P><P>The opposing ones have said that I was right before 1984 but not since then. They said that I used to minister life but that now I minister budgets, numbers, and activities. From September 1987 until now, I have given many messages and conferences. These messages have not been concerning budgets, numbers, and activities, but they are full of the unveiling of the divine truths and the ministry of the divine life.</P><P>The opposing ones also said that we have applied the teaching concerning the ground of oneness in a divisive and sectarian way so that we separate ourselves from other Christians. Actually, we receive all the Christians, but we cannot accept the divisions in which they meet. The denominations are not just differences; they are divisions. Hence, we cannot take them. We differentiate, however, between the saints and the denominations. The denominations are one thing, but the saints in the denominations are another thing. We receive the saints who are in any of the denominations and also those in the Catholic Church, but we cannot receive the organization of the denominations.</P><P>I spoke concerning this matter many times, and my speaking has been printed. These dissenting ones heard my speaking and have also read the books, but they have neglected these things. They have said that we are too narrow, that we feel that only we are right, and that we do not receive other Christians. This is not a fair statement. We receive all of the Lord's children, the genuine believers in Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>N. Concerning the Apostles' Existence<br>and How They Relate or Work Together</H2><P>The dissenting ones have also raised an issue concerning the apostles' existence and how they relate with one another or work together. The existence of the apostles should be under the Lord's sovereign arrangement, and their existence, relation, and work should keep an excellent order in the Body according to the organic function. My working together with Brother Nee was not according to my choice but was under God's sovereign arrangement. There was always an excellent order between us. I fully realized that according to the organic function in the Body, I should be under him.</P><P>The organic function can be illustrated by our physical body. When one moves his arm, the shoulder, elbow, hand, and fingers move by keeping an excellent order according to their functions. Suppose the fingers would form a conspiracy and say to one another, "Why should we fingers be under the shoulder?" This would be the same as saying that the fingers should be cut off and placed above the shoulder. This would kill the fingers.</P><P>When I came into the work, from the very beginning, all I knew was to labor without any opinion. I realized that I was under Brother Nee according to the organic function in the Body. The dissenting ones who have claimed to be something have cut themselves off. Suppose the eyes said that they no longer wanted to be under the eyebrows. That would be terrible. It not only would destroy their function, but also would destroy the beauty of God's creation. In the Body of Christ a kind of order is spontaneously manifested according to the organic function. This function is not according to any organizational arrangement. Rather, this function is organic. The apostles and all of the saints exist according to God's sovereign arrangement.</P><P>You may feel that the church where you are is too difficult. Because of this, you may consider going to another place. But wherever you go, troubles will be there and hardships will be your portion. There is only one place for you to go&#151;the place under God's sovereign arrangement. Anyone who exercises his choice concerning the place for his existence will receive trouble.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>O. Deputy Authority<br>versus the Direct Headship of Christ</H2><P>The opposing ones have also rejected the truth concerning deputy authority, claiming that they are under the direct headship of Christ. This is nonsense. All of the people ruling in the government are deputy authorities under God (Rom. 13:1-7). If a country existed in which the people said that they did not want to have any man ruling over them, but that they just wanted God to be their Ruler, that country would be full of chaos and anarchy. There must be a government with the rule of law through the police and the courts. Deputy authority is not versus God's headship.</P><P>In our physical body, there is order. The arm can be considered as a deputy authority to the hand and fingers. The arms are not versus the head. On the earth among human beings, deputy authority is everywhere. In the family there are parents. Even between the parents, there is the father and the mother. These two are not equal. Even among the brothers and sisters in a family, there is an order. Something in our nature tells us that there is such an order. A principal is the head of a school, the teachers are under the principal, and the students are under the teachers. The good students stay in their position, keeping the proper deputy authority.</P><P>Throughout society there is deputy authority. To talk about getting rid of deputy authority is nonsense. The police who regulate traffic on the roads are an example of deputy authority. Because of policemen, the traffic is controlled and kept in a good order, thereby reducing traffic accidents and deaths.</P><P>According to the divine revelation in the holy Word, there is also deputy authority in God's economy, both in the Old Testament, such as with Moses and the priests who taught the people the divine oracle, and in the New Testament, such as with the elders, who take care of the church (1 Tim. 3:5; 5:17; Heb. 13:17), and the apostles, who establish the churches and teach the saints (2 Cor. 10:8; 13:10; 1 Cor. 4:21). In Hebrews 13:17 Paul said, "Obey the ones leading you and submit to them."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>P. Federation of Churches</H2><P>The opposing ones have taught the autonomy of the local churches and have accused us of trying to federate the churches. We need to see that the church is not an organization but an organism. In an organism, you cannot have autonomy or federation. The members of our physical body are organically united as one; they are not federated into one.</P><P>To say that all the local churches are separate in administration, in a certain sense, is right, but this is only one side. The church has its local aspect, but it also has its universal aspect, the aspect of the universal Body. Both are needed. I need the universal Body, and I also need the local church. When I stressed that all the churches should be the same and that they should be one, the dissenting ones said that such oneness meant federation.</P><P>The Brethren had a dispute concerning this. G. H. Lang taught the autonomy of a local church and condemned J. N. Darby for teaching federation. The local churches, however, should not be independently autonomous because they are all the unique, one organism of the processed and dispensing Triune God. If the church in Anaheim declared that it was a local church, standing independent from and not caring for the other churches, the church in Anaheim would immediately become a local sect. A local church must be one with all the other churches in the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Q. The Present Churches Being Old<br>and Filled with Problems</H2><P>The opposers also have said that the present churches are old and full of problems. We need to see that the churches mentioned in the New Testament all had problems. The church in Jerusalem was a young church, but it also had the problem of Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5:1-11) and the problem concerning the distribution of food to the widows (6:1). One does not need to be old to have troubles or to become sick. The elders who take care of the churches have to deal with problems continually. As long as you are a living, organic person, each day there is the possibility of sickness.</P><P>The Epistles in the New Testament were written to churches with problems. If these churches had not had any problems, we would not have these New Testament Epistles today. Thank the Lord, because the churches had problems in the early days, we have the New Testament Epistles which have become a great help to us today. First Corinthians is a long Epistle of sixteen chapters. Every chapter deals with problems. In 1 Corinthians 11:34, after dealing with a number of problems, Paul said, "And the rest I will set in order when I come." By this Paul was saying, "In this Epistle I addressed eleven of your problems. But there are still a number of other problems. I cannot cover them now, but I will when I come."</P><P>I was in the church in Chefoo in 1932 at the beginning of the Lord's recovery in northern China. Basically we knew only that we had to leave the denominations and meet together. We did not have our own hymnal, and we did not know how to choose a hymn. We did not know the proper way to have the Lord's table. We also did not know how to praise the Lord in a high way. Today, however, our practice, our praises, and our hymns are higher. The churches today are much higher than they were sixty or even thirty years ago.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>R. Reality versus the Doctrine and<br>Systematized Teaching of Brother Lee</H2><P>The dissenting ones have said that reality is versus the doctrine and systematized teaching of Brother Lee. To their opinion, I have been teaching too much. They have condemned my teaching, my training, and my conferences because they said that these are the means for me to control the churches. Actually, my teaching does not control anyone, but it does regulate us, including me.</P><P>One brother in the past pointed out that if a speaker cannot speak something higher than himself, he is a poor speaker. We must learn to teach and preach things which are higher than what we are. Our reality can never match our revelation. Did Paul's reality match his revelation? Did Paul's experiences come up to his revelation? The Lord Jesus Himself is the only one whose reality fully matched His teaching. Apart from Him, no one on this earth can have the real experience to fully match his own teaching. The dissenting ones have also said that my teachings are systematized. This is not true. I have never taught anything in a system.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>S. The Church of the Saints&#151;Democracy</H2><P>In 1988 the dissenting ones claimed that there should be democracy among us since the church is the church of the saints. In the Old Testament with Israel and in the New Testament with the believers, the government among God's people is neither democracy nor autocracy. It is theocracy, which is government by God Himself. Democracy is better than autocracy in the political realm, but among God's people, neither of these ways should have any place. God's people should have only theocracy. Theos (God) is our Ruler. He is living, and today He is the all-inclusive Spirit within us and among us. We have to learn to listen to Him. The church should be under God's ruling.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>T. All of the Above Points<br>under the Teaching of the Dissenting Ones<br>Becoming Winds of Teaching Which Have Caused<br>Divisions in the Lord's Recovery</H2><P>All of the above points under the teaching of the dissenting ones have become winds of teaching which have caused divisions in the Lord's recovery (Eph. 4:14). These winds of teaching have caused divisions in the following places in California&#151;Rosemead, Anaheim, Huntington Beach, San Diego, South San Francisco, Cupertino, and Lomita. There is also a division in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. According to the Bible, there is no base, no reason, no excuse, no justification, and no vindication for any kind of division.</P><P>There are three things the church cannot tolerate: division, heresies, and immorality. Divisions damage the Body of Christ. Heresies insult the person of Christ and damage the work of Christ. Immorality damages the humanity of people who were made by God to be the members of the Body of Christ. In Romans 14 and 15 Paul charged us to receive all the believers, embracing all the differences. But in Romans 16 he said, "Now I exhort you, brothers, to mark those who make divisions and causes of stumbling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them" (v. 17). Concerning the divisive ones, Paul was very definite and strict. His teaching concerning these divisive ones was also very straight. He exhorted the saints to turn away from anyone who made divisions.</P><P>Ephesians 4:14 says, "That we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error." Any teaching, even a scriptural one, that distracts believers from Christ and the church is a wind of teaching that carries believers away from God's central purpose. The only way to escape the waves that are stirred up by the winds of teaching is to grow in life, and the safe way to grow in life is to stay in the proper church life with Christ and the church as the safeguard.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRACTICE OF PROPHESYING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Heb. 1:1-2a; John 1:1; Gen. 1:6-7, 9, 11, 14-15; Psa. 33:6a, 9; John 5:24; 14:10b; Num. 11:29b; 1 Cor. 14:31; 1 Thes. 5:20; Amos 2:12b; 7:12-13; Jer. 11:21; 15:19; 1:8-9; Psa. 73:28a; 25:14; 73:17; Acts 6:4; 1 Thes. 5:16-20; Col. 3:16; Acts 19:6</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. GOD BEING A SPEAKING GOD</H2><P>Our God is a speaking God (Heb. 1:1-2a). Since God is our Father, we as His children must follow Him to speak. We should speak all the time, but we should not speak in the way of murmuring or gossiping. Instead, we should speak the word of life (Phil. 2:16).</P><P>Hebrews 1:1-2a says, "God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son." In times of old God spoke to the fathers in the prophets, but now He is speaking in His Son. Actually, "the Son" mentioned in verse 2 is corporate. Today we believers are a part of the Son. God is still speaking in the Son. Throughout the past twenty centuries, the speaking of those who spoke forth the Lord according to the New Testament and its principles has been the Son's speaking. In the New Testament, the apostle Paul is an example of one whose speaking was the Son's speaking.</P><P>We have stressed that the entire New Testament is the teaching of the apostles (Acts 2:42). Therefore, if we teach the same thing as the New Testament teaches, our teaching is also a part of the apostles' teaching. Some dissenting ones have said that the apostles' teaching comprises only what the Lord Jesus spoke in the four Gospels and what He charged His disciples to teach others. They have neglected the Lord's word in John 16 which says, "I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming" (vv. 12-13). No doubt, the place where the Lord declared the "many things" is in the Epistles.</P><P>Some Christians also consider that only the words spoken directly by the Lord Himself in the four Gospels are the Lord's word. They do not believe that what was spoken after the four Gospels in Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation is the Lord's word. This is not according to the truth. In Colossians 1:25 Paul said that he was commissioned to complete the word of God. This indicates that before Paul's writings, the holy Word in the Bible was not yet complete. The holy Word was not complete in regard to God's economy and the mystery of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. GOD EVEN BEING THE WORD</H2><P>God is even the Word (John 1:1). We must receive grace that we ourselves also would become the word, that is, God's speaking. Some may ridicule us by saying that "you are the word of God." They say this because we speak the word of God to them. In a sense, we are the word of God to people. We are the ones from whom they hear the word of God. Thus, we are the word of God to them. When we go to visit sinners, we must not forget that we are the word of God to them. Our going to visit them means that the word of God is also going to visit them. When we visit sinners, we must utter something of God's word to them. Therefore, we must learn to speak.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. GOD CREATING THE OLD CREATION<br>BY HIS SPEAKING</H2><P>God created the old creation by His speaking (Gen. 1:6-7, 9, 11, 14-15; Psa. 33:6a, 9). Psalm 33:9 says, "For He spoke, and it was; / He commanded, and it stood." In Genesis 1 God spoke and it was done. God said, "Let there be light: and there was light" (v. 3). Psalm 33:6 says, "By the word of Jehovah the heavens were made." God works by speaking.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. GOD CREATING THE NEW CREATION<br>ALSO BY HIS SPEAKING</H2><P>God created the new creation also by His speaking. John 5:24 says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life." Those who hear the Lord's word will be regenerated. They will be made a new creation. In John 14:10 the Lord said, "The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works." By this word the Lord indicated that the Father worked in Him; hence, His speaking was the Father's working. The Father worked through the Son's speaking.</P><P>When He was on the earth, the Lord Jesus traveled and performed many miracles. But in the four Gospels, He spoke more than He performed miracles. The Gospel of Matthew records the Lord's lengthy speaking on at least three occasions in six long chapters. Chapters five through seven cover the Lord's teaching on the mountain; chapter thirteen covers the Lord's teaching of seven parables beside the sea; and chapters twenty-four and twenty-five cover the Lord's prophecies given on the Mount of Olives. The Lord's speaking is also prominent in the other synoptic Gospels of Mark and Luke.</P><P>In the Gospel of John, nearly every chapter contains the Lord's speaking. But the Lord's speaking in John 14&#151;17 is very particular. His speaking to His disciples on the night before He was crucified was recorded in chapters fourteen through sixteen, and His prayer to the Father was recorded in chapter seventeen. The Lord's speaking in these chapters of Matthew and John reveals the depths of God in a very profound way. The depths of God in the Gospels cannot be seen through the miracles but through the Lord's speaking.</P><P>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, His work was carried out mainly through His speaking. Today the New Testament work of saving sinners, edifying the saints, perfecting the saints, and building up the Body of Christ is also being carried out by speaking.</P><P>By the Lord's mercy and grace, we intend to complete the life-study of the entire Bible by the end of 1994. In the summer training of 1992, we intend to cover the Minor Prophets, and in the winter training, we will study the book of Job. In the summer training of 1993, we want to cover the historical books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth. Then we will cover 1 and 2 Samuel in the winter training of 1993. In the summer of 1994, we will cover 1 and 2 Kings, and in the winter we will cover 1 and 2 Chronicles. From 1992 through 1994 there will also be six terms of the full-time training. During this time, we will use a weekly meeting to cover the remaining books of the Old Testament. We will take three terms of the training to cover the Psalms; one term to cover Proverbs; one term to cover both Ecclesiastes and the Song of Songs; and one term to cover Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther. Thus, by the end of 1994, if the Lord wills, the life-study of the entire Bible can be finished and will have taken twenty years to complete. Then the entire Bible, which has been written and translated, will be interpreted by us.</P><P>We need the proper interpretation to understand the Word of God. The book of Joel speaks of four kinds of locusts (1:4). How can we understand what these locusts are without the proper interpretation? To study the Old Testament prophecies, we need the historical facts. Daniel 2 reveals a great human image. Its head of gold, corresponding to the first beast in Daniel 7:3-4, signifies Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. The breast and arms of silver, corresponding to the second beast in 7:5, signify Medo-Persia. The abdomen and thighs of bronze, corresponding to the third beast in 7:6, signify Greece. The legs of iron and feet partly of iron and partly of clay, corresponding to the fourth beast in 7:7-8, signify the Roman Empire and its last ten kings. In Revelation 18 Rome is referred to as Babylon the Great. Because the head and feet of the great image signify Babylon, we may say that the entire human image is Babylon in four stages, four empires.</P><P>The four kinds of locusts in Joel refer to these four empires. All of these empires carried out the Lord's judgment, considered in the book of Joel as "the day of Jehovah" (1:15; 2:11, 31; 3:14). Thus, the four parts of the great human image in Daniel 2, the four beasts in Daniel 7, and the four kinds of locusts in Joel 1 refer to the same thing. The Babylonian locusts, the Medo-Persian locusts, the Greek locusts, and the Roman locusts did not let the nation of Israel have any peace.</P><P>I am sharing this to show us that we cannot understand the Word of God without the proper interpretation. In Acts 8 the eunuch from Ethiopia was reading Isaiah 53. When Philip asked him if he understood what he was reading, the eunuch responded, "How could I unless someone guides me?" (v. 31). This shows again that we need the interpreted Word. To speak forth the Lord in the proper interpretation of the Word is to prophesy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. MOSES DESIRING ALL OF GOD'S PEOPLE<br>TO BE PROPHETS FOR PROPHESYING</H2><P>Moses desired all of God's people to be prophets for prophesying (Num. 11:29b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE APOSTLE PAUL TEACHING<br>THAT WE ALL CAN PROPHESY</H2><P>The apostle Paul taught that we all can prophesy (1 Cor. 14:31). God desires that each of the believers prophesy, that is, speak for and speak forth Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. PAUL CHARGING US<br>NOT TO DESPISE PROPHESYING</H2><P>Paul charged us not to despise prophesying (1 Thes. 5:20). Those who have rejected the Lord's ministry, the Lord's speaking, today are despising prophesying. Some opposing ones have said that we can simply read the Bible itself without the help of the Recovery Version or the Life-study Messages. However, if you merely read the Bible in that way, you will not receive much. The Bible has been interpreted by the seeking saints for the past twenty centuries, beginning from the so-called church fathers, who spoke concerning the Divine Trinity. Without their interpretation, how could we understand the Trinity today? The words Trinity and triune are not written in the Bible; but the fact of the Trinity was discovered by the church fathers. They did a marvelous job concerning this matter, and through the centuries their interpretation has come to us. We need the interpreted Word.</P><P>The Recovery Version with the Life-study Messages can be considered as the crystallization of the understanding of the holy Word, which the seeking saints have interpreted throughout the past twenty centuries. This is the reason that I am burdened to have the life-study of the entire Bible. If we do not understand a certain part of the book of Genesis, we can go to the Life-study of Genesis for help. We may not be able to understand the Minor Prophets today, but once the Minor Prophets are properly expounded, we will be able to enter into the divine thought in these books.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. TO PROHIBIT PROPHESYING<br>BEING A SIN BEFORE GOD</H2><P>To prohibit prophesying is a sin before God (Amos 2:12b; 7:12-13; Jer. 11:21). Amaziah the priest charged Amos to stop speaking, to stop prophesying. Because of this, Amaziah suffered a curse. The Lord said through Amos that the wife of Amaziah would become a harlot and that his children would be killed (Amos 7:16-17). Those who stopped Jeremiah from prophesying also suffered calamity (Jer. 11:21-23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. TO PROPHESY IN FUNCTION<br>BEING HIGHER THAN TO BE A KING<br>OR TO BE A PRIEST</H2><P>To prophesy in function is higher than being a king or a priest. In both the Old and New Testaments, only three kinds of ministries were ordained by God&#151;the ministries of the prophets, the priests, and the kings. In Genesis 20:7 Abraham was called a prophet. At that time among God's people, there were no kings and no official priests. Abel, Noah, and even Abraham functioned as priests by offering sacrifices (Gen. 4:4; 8:20; 12:7, 8), but the office of the priest was not ordained until Moses led the children of Israel out of Egypt to Mount Sinai (Exo. 19:6). The office of the king was not ordained until Saul's time (1 Sam. 8). In the Old Testament, God first recognized the function of the prophet, then the function of the priest, and later the function of the king.</P><P>In the New Testament, all of the believers are regenerated to be priests and kings (1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:6). We are regenerated into a royal family, and as the King's children, we also are kings. As believers we all are born priests and kings, but to be a prophet depends upon our seeking. First Corinthians 14:1 says, "Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy." If you do not desire earnestly and seek to prophesy, you cannot be a prophet. All those who desire to prophesy are like the Nazarites in the Old Testament (Num. 6:1-21), who voluntarily separated themselves unto the Lord for the priestly service.</P><P>Among the three functions of the prophet, the priest, and the king, the function of the prophet is the highest. The reason for this is that all three of these functions depend upon God's word. The kings in the Old Testament time could not receive God's word directly. The priests could receive God's word, but not directly. They received God's word indirectly through the breastplate with the Urim and the Thummim (Exo. 28:30). But the prophets, even in the Old Testament time, received God's word directly. For this reason, the prophets could reprove, instruct, and teach the kings (2 Sam. 12:1-14), and they could also teach the priests (Hag. 2:10-19; Mal. 1:6&#151;2:9). Because they can receive and secure the word of God directly, the prophets have the highest function.</P><P>In the Old Testament, Jeremiah and Zechariah were priests (Jer. 1:1; Neh. 12:1, 16) who eventually became prophets. As prophets, they received God's word directly. One day as Jeremiah spoke with his mother, God used him to speak His word (Jer. 15:10-11). At first, there was a conversation between two parties, Jeremiah and his mother. Eventually, a third party, Jehovah, came into the conversation. The third party, Jehovah, used the mouth of the first party, Jeremiah, to speak His word. This shows that the word of God came to the prophet Jeremiah directly.</P><P>We all were born to be priests and kings, but we should not forget that another function, the function of the prophet, is waiting for us. In order to participate in this function, we must seek it. We did not receive this function by birth; therefore, to be a prophet is not our birthright. We must gain this function by our seeking. In 1 Corinthians 14:1, the word desire is a strong word. We must have a desire to speak for God. Of the three functions of the prophet, the priest, and the king, the most useful function for the building up of the church is that of the prophet. As priests, we certainly can build up the church. But 1 Corinthians 14 tells us that the most useful function for building up the church as the Body of Christ is prophesying (vv. 3-5).</P><P>According to the New Testament, there are three kinds of prophets: the prophets mentioned in Ephesians 2 and 4, the prophets mentioned in Acts 21, and the prophets mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14. Ephesians 2:20 says, "Being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets." Ephesians 4:11-12 says, "And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ." The prophets mentioned in these verses are those particularly ordained by God. The second kind of prophet is one who can predict, like Philip's daughters (Acts 21:8-9). The third kind of prophet is one who speaks for God and speaks forth God in the meetings of the church for the church's building up (1 Cor. 14:3-5).</P><P>The first kind of prophet has been ordained by God. Not all of the believers are this first kind of prophet. In speaking of this first kind of prophet, Paul said in 1 Corinthians 12:29, "Are all prophets?" Not all of the believers are prophets particularly ordained by God. However, all of the believers can be the third kind of prophet (1 Cor. 14:1, 5, 31). First Corinthians 14:31 says, "You can all prophesy one by one." Chapter twelve indicates that not all believers are prophets, but chapter fourteen indicates that all believers can be prophets. This apparent contradiction is solved by the realization that there are different kinds of prophets.</P><P>Prophesying is not mainly to predict. Wuest, in his New Testament translation, renders the word prophesies as "imparts divine revelations to others" (1 Cor. 14:4b). To prophesy is to impart divine revelations to others. This function is higher than the function of a king or a priest. A prophet can receive and can secure the word of God directly and then speak this word for the building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>X. THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR PROPHESYING</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Taking the Precious from the Vile</H2><P>The first qualification for prophesying is to take the precious things from the vile, or worthless (Jer. 15:19). God said to Jeremiah, "And if you bring out the precious from the worthless,/You will be as My mouth." In order to speak the word of God, we have to separate all the vile, worthless things from the precious things. We have received many precious things. If we do not keep the precious things separate from the vile things, we will lose the position to be the mouthpiece of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Loving the Lord, Being Close to Him,<br>and Being One with Him</H2><P>To love the Lord, to be close to Him, and to be one with Him is another qualification for those who would prophesy (Jer. 1:8-9; Psa. 73:28a). All of the prophets loved the Lord, were very close to the Lord, and were one with the Lord. We must have the same experience; otherwise, we cannot be prophets.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Intimate Counsel of Jehovah<br>Belonging to Those Who Fear Him, and<br>His Covenant Being Made Known to Them</H2><P>The intimate counsel of Jehovah belongs to those who fear Him, and His covenant He will make known to them (Psa. 25:14). In order to prophesy, we must have an intimacy with God. Furthermore, we should not think that because we are intimate with God, we can be loose. On the contrary, we must also have a fear that matches our intimacy. In this way we are qualified to be God's mouthpiece.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Until I Went into the Sanctuary of God,<br>and Considered...</H2><P>In Psalm 73 the psalmist was bothered at the prosperity of the wicked (v. 3). Then in verse 17 he said, "Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end." He could not understand until he went into the sanctuary of God, that is, until he contacted God. This shows that he did not want to solve any problem apart from God. He went into the presence of God to get his problem solved; then he received the word from God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Praying for the Ministry of the Word</H2><P>In Acts 6:4 Peter said, "But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word." In order to prophesy, we must pray for the ministry of the word. Without prayer, the ministry of the word will not be enlivened and empowered.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Always Rejoicing, Unceasingly Praying,<br>Giving Thanks in Everything, and<br>Quenching Not the Spirit concerning Prophesying</H2><P>Another qualification for prophesying is to be one who is always rejoicing, unceasingly praying, giving thanks in everything, and quenching not the Spirit concerning prophesying (1 Thes. 5:16-20). Some of the sisters quench the Spirit simply by being quiet according to their female disposition. But we all, brothers and sisters alike, have quenched the Spirit too often. The prophesying among us should eventually become a noise. When we speak in good order, the sound is a voice. But when everyone speaks, the sound is not a voice but a noise. We first should practice to have a noise; then we gradually will be able to speak in a proper order so that our sound is a voice.</P><P>We are children of a speaking Father, so we all must speak. Many would say that they do not know how to speak. The way to learn how to speak is to speak. Some have the problem of speaking too little. Others may have the problem of speaking too much. Hence, a balance is needed in our speaking. Nevertheless, we all must speak. The most victorious, overcoming, and successful Christian is a Christian who is a speaking one. The more you speak, the more you overcome. The purpose for us all to meet together is for all of us to speak.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Letting the Word of Christ<br>Dwell in You Richly in All Wisdom,<br>Teaching and Admonishing One Another<br>with Psalms and Hymns and Spiritual Songs,<br>Singing with Grace in Your Hearts to God</H2><P>In order to prophesy, we must let the word of Christ dwell in us richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in our hearts to God (Col. 3:16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Being Filled with the Spirit</H2><P>To prophesy we must be filled with the Spirit. The Ephesian believers in Acts 19:6 were outwardly filled with the Spirit, and they prophesied. The Chinese version of the New Testament has a note on this verse, indicating that prophesied means preached. To prophesy is to speak for God, to impart the divine revelations to others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XI. THE PRACTICE OF PROPHESYING</H2><P>The practice of prophesying includes at least five items: exercising your spirit, speaking with your mouth open, speaking audibly, speaking in the proper speed, and speaking with the purified and accurate word. You need to exercise your spirit in a definite way with an open mouth. To speak audibly is to speak loud enough for the entire congregation to hear. To speak in the proper speed is not to speak too slowly or too rapidly. To speak with the purified and accurate word is to speak without any wasted words, avoiding "sea stories."</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRACTICE OF PROPHESYING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>LEARNING, EXERCISING, AND PRACTICING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:1, 3, 4; Eph. 4:12, 16; 1 Cor. 12:7</H1><P>Today God's speaking is in the Son. In the Old Testament time God spoke through the prophets, but in the New Testament time God speaks in the Son (Heb. 1:2). This Son today is a corporate Son, the Head and the Body (1 Cor. 12:12). The corporate Son includes all of the New Testament speakers; hence, it is the totality of the New Testament speakers. The first speaker is the individual Son, and the speakers who follow are the members of the Son, the members of His Body. In Hebrews 1 Christ is presented as the firstborn Son of God (vv. 5-6). Then in Hebrews 2:10 God brings many sons into glory. These verses give us strong ground to say that God's speaking in the Son is not just in the individual Christ, but also in all the members of Christ. The Son in whom God speaks is the corporate Son, the firstborn Son with the many sons.</P><P>Christ is the Word of God (John 1:1). As the Word of God, He also makes us His word, His speaking. Every Christian should be a part of the word of God. God is speaking; He is also the Word. Today He speaks through us. As a part of His word, we should be speaking, expressing, and explaining Him all the time.</P><P>God has made us a part of His word, and when this word is spoken, it becomes the oracle. The church today should be God's word and should also become God's oracle. Christianity has been used by the enemy of God to take away the speaking of God from the majority of the members of the church. Thus, the speaking in the church is no longer a corporate oracle among the saints; it has become the job of certain professionals. These professionals dedicate their time to attend seminaries in order to obtain degrees. After graduation they get jobs as preachers. Eventually, a hierarchy is built up with the clergy and the laity. The clergy is the speaking class, and the laity is the nonspeaking class. In this way, Satan kills the functioning of the members of the Body of Christ. The professionals, the clergy, monopolize the right to speak among God's people, annulling the speaking function of all the rest of the members of the Body of Christ, and the Body of Christ is killed.</P><P>We left Christianity not only because of the denominations, the divisions, but also because the functioning of the members of the Body has been killed. Today we are standing as the Lord's recovery, yet we are surrounded by the background and environment of Christianity. This strong background and prevailing environment are very difficult to overcome. An item of this background and environment is the meeting with only one speaker. Even today some who are reading this message may still prefer to have big meetings with only one speaker.</P><P>In human society, nearly everything is carried out by speaking. Today many candidates are seeking the presidency of the United States. Their way of seeking to be elected is by speaking. They speak day after day in many different states. They realize that if they are defeated in their speaking, their candidacy will be annulled. Nearly everything in human society is done by speaking. An attorney's job is to speak both verbally and in writing. Whoever wins in speaking will win the case. The principle of advertising and the principle of the newspapers is speaking. During the time of the Reformation, many felt the need to spread their ideas through the printed word, through articles and papers.</P><P>We must realize that speaking is a strategic matter. If we do not speak, we are unprofitable to the Lord. In 1984 I went to Taiwan to fight against the killing practice of annulling the speaking function of the members of the Body of Christ. I have not yet fully succeeded, so I am still fighting. My fighting depends upon my speaking. Before giving a message, I pray much about my speaking. My speaking has not yet fully convicted or convinced all the saints in the Lord's recovery. I have stressed that in the meetings of the church, there should not be just one man speaking. Everyone should prophesy one by one (1 Cor. 14:31). However, eight years have passed since I began to speak concerning this matter of having the church meeting in mutuality with all speaking, and this practice has still not been fully recovered.</P><P>Christianity is a total loss to the Lord in the sense of annulling the functioning of the members of the organic Body of Christ. Revelation 3 says that Christ is standing outside the degraded church, knocking at her door (v. 20). Today Christ is outside the door of Protestant Christianity. Revelation 17 reveals that the Roman Catholic Church is a great harlot (vv. 1-6). Eventually, Antichrist will annihilate the Roman Catholic Church in the avenging judgment of God (vv. 16-17).</P><P>There is nothing of the Lord's interest in either Protestantism or Catholicism, but how about the Lord's recovery? Even in the Lord's recovery, the Lord has gained too little. The crucial point, the key, in the Lord's recovery is our speaking. The Lord's intention is to save a people and make this people His oracle. All of them should be speaking ones. However, many among us do not like to speak. On the other hand, some are ambitious, hunting for the chance to speak. These ambitious ones abuse the right to speak. They do not need to speak that much. In the recent turmoil, some of the so-called gifted ones rejected my ministry because the God-ordained way to meet took away their platform in the Lord's Day morning meeting. They said that my intention was to kill all the prophets. This was certainly not my intention at all. Rather, the God-ordained way of meeting gives everyone the opportunity to speak.</P><P>If you have the portion and the capacity, you should speak more. But there is no need to hunt for a speaking opportunity. All the church meetings are open to everybody. Our situation today is this: on the one hand, some ambitious ones are hunting for an opportunity to speak, and on the other hand, many saints who have been properly and rightly privileged to speak do not speak. Your keeping silent becomes Satan's victory over the Lord.</P><P>In Psalm 8 the Lord boasted to Satan&#151;His adversary, His enemy, and His avenger&#151;that He had established praise out of the mouths of babes and sucklings (v. 2). The Lord has perfected, established, or completed praise in the youngest ones, the smallest ones, the weakest ones, among His redeemed people to stop the enemy. Yet today among the Lord's people, most are silent. The Lord cannot display His victory over Satan if we are silent. When we come together, why would we not speak one by one? To speak one by one for two hours would be wonderful. Then the Lord Jesus, sitting in the heavens, could say, "Satan, look at the saints in the church speaking for Me. Their speaking is My victory!" We must fulfill our duty to prophesy. We must try our best to speak something for the Lord within three minutes. If you have something extra, the Spirit will give you more time to speak.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE BENEFITS OF PRACTICING TO PROPHESY</H2><P>To practice to prophesy brings in many benefits. You have to treasure your speaking for the Lord, because the Lord treasures your speaking. You have to hate your silence. In Numbers 11:29 Moses desired that all the Lord's people would be prophets. Then in 1 Corinthians 14:31 Paul said that we all could prophesy one by one. Surely both Moses and Paul would like to see church meetings on earth in which everyone speaks for the Lord.</P><P>Today, however, in our present situation, the speaking may be exhausted in less than one hour. The elders then have to consider what to do. When two hundred people meet together and their speaking is exhausted in less than one hour, is this not a shame to the Lord? Therefore, we must endeavor to prophesy one by one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Promoting the Believers' Interest<br>in the Lord's Service</H2><P>Practicing to prophesy promotes the believers' interest in the Lord's service (1 Cor. 14:1). Sometimes the saints are forced to speak by being asked to speak, yet this does not stir up the interest of the believers as much as when someone volunteers to speak. When you volunteer to speak, you will be stirred up to speak more. If you speak in a meeting, that meeting, to you, is in the third heaven. If you do not speak in the meeting, and another brother or sister asks you about the meeting, you may say that the meeting was poor. The reason you say that the meeting was poor is because you did not speak. But if you had spoken in the meeting, you would say that the meeting was in the third heaven.</P><P>Furthermore, if you would just say "Amen" three times in a meeting, that meeting would also be in the third heaven to you. If you would say "Amen" three times, at the beginning, middle, and end of the meeting, you would be stirred up. But if you attend the meeting and sit without saying "Amen," you will say that the meeting was poor. This shows that the practice of speaking and prophesying promotes the believers' interest in the Lord's service. It stirs up your interest, and it also stirs up others' interest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Developing the Believers' Capacity<br>in the Divine Life</H2><P>Practicing to prophesy also develops (cultivates) the believers' capacity in the divine life (Eph. 4:16b). A boy may have many capacities by birth, but if he were restricted to lying on a bed, these capacities could not be cultivated. When we practice prophesying, our capacity in the divine life is cultivated, developed.</P><P>The first step in learning to prophesy is to be prepared. Each Lord's Day morning, all of the saints should come together to practice to prophesy. You have to consider what you will prophesy. For each of the messages I have given in this series, I have prepared an outline. Sometimes I prepare the outline a week in advance. When I have some free time, I pick up the outline and read it. This is part of my preparation for speaking. Sometimes I read the outline for a message before going to bed, so that if I am awakened during the night and cannot get back to sleep, I can continue my preparation. As I am preparing to speak, I may discover that I need to use certain words, so I use a dictionary in order to find the proper usage of these words. All of this is my preparation for speaking. To labor to prophesy in this way is a real cultivation of our capacity in the divine life.</P><P>It is a tragedy that a number of Christians in the denominations do not even know how to pray. While I was in the Philippines in the 1950s, three brothers from among us went to a hospital to visit a sick person. This sick person had relatives who were in the denominations, and they were present when the three brothers arrived to visit. While visiting the sick person, the three brothers prayed for him in a prevailing way, full of freedom. After the brothers finished their prayer, the relatives from the denominations asked whether the brothers were preachers or pastors. The brothers replied that they were merchants. The relatives were surprised that merchants could pray so well, and they also admitted that they did not know how to pray. They said that if they needed prayer, they would call their pastor and ask him to pray. This is the poor situation of today's Christianity. The capacity of the regenerated saints has been suppressed. There is little development, or cultivation, of their capacity in the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Manifesting the Believers' Spiritual Function<br>to Enrich the Church's Service<br>in the Lord's Economy</H2><P>Speaking manifests the believers' spiritual function to enrich the church's service in the Lord's economy (1 Cor. 12:7). Without the believers' speaking, there is no way to enrich the church's service. If the saints do not speak, the riches of the Body of Christ will not be manifested and used. In the poor, degraded practice of Christianity, all the functions of the believers are covered. But among us in the Lord's recovery, the believers' spiritual function should be manifested to enrich the church's service in the Lord's economy.</P><P>Some would say that they are not like other brothers who have been manifested to be very useful in the church's service. Rather, they may feel that they are useless. Therefore, they do not like to become manifested. Actually, it is better for everyone to be manifested, whether they seem to be useful or not. When someone is manifested to be somewhat weak, this will cause the perfecting ones to spend more time on this one in order to make him useful.</P><P>In the full-time training, we are doing this kind of work. We are laboring to transform the weak speakings into wonderful speakings. As the trainees come and speak, making all kinds of mistakes, their weaknesses are manifested. Then we know what kind of medicine to prescribe for them. As a result, the trainees will go back to their respective churches as different people. When they stand to speak, the whole church will receive the benefit of their function.</P><P>I have a concern for all of the churches. The trainees should go back to their churches in a proper way. They should not go back to direct the church. They should not have the attitude that the church should listen to them and do what they feel to do. That kind of behavior would be ugly. They should not go back claiming or proclaiming anything. They should simply attend the church meetings and at the right time stand up and speak a word for the benefit of the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Building (Edifying) the Believers<br>in Life and in Truth</H2><P>Practicing to prophesy is for building (edifying) the believers in life and in truth (1 Cor. 14:3). Every kind of speaking should have some amount of life and truth. Silence ministers nothing of life and truth to anyone. But if you speak something for the Lord, by the Lord, in the Lord, and with the Lord, there will surely be something of life and truth in what you speak. This edifies the believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Building Them Up<br>into the Body of Christ, the Church</H2><P>Prophesying builds the believers up into the Body of Christ, the church (1 Cor. 14:4). On a building site, there may be many pieces of material lying around, which may be close to the building but have not been built up into the building. If you have never spoken in the church meetings, you have never been practically built up into the Body. The more you speak properly for the Lord, the more you are built up into the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Keeping the Believers to Live in the Body<br>and to Not Be Detached from the Body</H2><P>By speaking we are built up into the Body. By speaking we are also kept so that we can live in the Body and not be detached from the Body (Eph. 4:16a). Many saints among us are detached. As long as you do not speak, you are detached. Many have never been attached because they have never spoken. This is why you should exercise to speak for the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Carrying Out the God-ordained Way<br>for the Building Up of the Body of Christ<br>in the Annulling of the Old Way<br>Related to Christianity</H2><P>If we practice to prophesy, we will carry out the God-ordained way for the building up of the Body of Christ and annul the old way related to Christianity (Eph. 4:12). The way to defeat the old way of Christianity is to speak. If we have a meeting full of everyone speaking, such a meeting defeats the old way of Christianity and is the victory of the Lord's Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE LOSSES OF NOT PRACTICING TO PROPHESY</H2><P>We have seen the benefits of practicing to prophesy. Now we must see the losses of not practicing to prophesy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Cooling Down the Believers' Interest<br>in the Lord's Service</H2><P>Not practicing to prophesy cools down the believers' interest in the Lord's service. I am afraid of a meeting in which very few speak. Such a meeting will scatter the audience. Those who come to a meeting of silence will be discouraged from coming to a meeting again. This is because they are cooled down by the silence. Silence cools down, but speaking always stirs up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Annulling the Believers' Capacity<br>in the Divine Life</H2><P>The practice of one man speaking and the rest listening has annulled the capacity of the believers in the divine life. Every life has a capacity. All believers have the divine life, but if they do not speak, their capacity will not be developed. This is the reason for the poverty of today's situation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Burying the Believers' Spiritual Function,<br>Making the Church's Service to the Lord<br>Poor in the Lord's Economy</H2><P>Not practicing to prophesy also buries the believers' spiritual function. This makes the church's service to the Lord poor in the Lord's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Leaving the Believers Unedified<br>in Undergrowth and in Ignorance</H2><P>Another loss of not practicing to prophesy is that the believers are left unedified in undergrowth and in ignorance. When children are being raised, they need to speak all the time. Otherwise, they will be left in undergrowth and ignorance. Without the practice of speaking, there is no growth. But the more the children speak, the more they learn and are instructed by their parents.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Frustrating and Even Tearing Down<br>the Building Up of the Body of Christ<br>with the Believers</H2><P>The building up of the Body of Christ is with the believers. If all the believers do not speak, it is the same as tearing down the building. Not speaking frustrates and tears down the building up of the Body of Christ with the believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Leaving the Believers Unattached<br>in Individualism</H2><P>Not practicing to prophesy leaves the believers unattached in individualism. When I see certain brothers, I have a deep concern for them because they remain unattached in their individualism. They come to the meetings week after week, but they keep themselves in their individualism. The elders dare not touch these unattached brothers because they realize that they are very fragile, like thin glass, and are easily broken. As a result, they remain in their untouched individualism. They may have been kept in their untouched individualism for their entire life. If you remain in your untouched individualism, you will remain unattached to the Body. The only way to be rescued from this sickness is to speak.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Repeating the Story of Degraded Christianity to Annul the Function of the Members of Christ and to Build Up Hierarchy instead of<br>the Body of Christ</H2><P>If we do not speak, we repeat the story of degraded Christianity to annul the function of the members of Christ and to build up hierarchy instead of the Body of Christ. The silence of the saints may promote some ambitious ones to build themselves up as a clerical class, a hierarchy. Hierarchy is just the clergy.</P><P>If we speak, there are benefits; if we do not speak, there are losses. Our speaking for the Lord is a great thing. Therefore, we all must learn to speak.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRACTICE OF PROPHESYING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>LEARNING, EXERCISING, AND PRACTICING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 2:4; Heb. 5:12-14; 2 Pet. 3:18; 1 Pet. 2:2-3; Eph. 4:13-16</H1><P>According to God's creation, our mouth has many purposes. Our mouth is used for breathing, drinking, and eating, yet the ultimate use of our mouth is for speaking.</P><P>Our speaking can be of three categories. The first category is prophesying. The second kind of speaking is that which is proper and upright. The third kind of speaking is in the category of evil speaking. This includes gossiping, criticizing, reasoning, quarreling, and expressions of anger. To prophesy is something from the heavens, to speak in a proper way is something on the earth, and to gossip is something from Gehenna (Matt. 5:22). In today's society, most of the speaking is not from the earth but from Gehenna.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. LEARNING</H2><P>Among us, there must be the first category of speaking, the category of speaking from the heavens. Prophesying is this kind of speaking. To speak for God, to speak God forth, and to speak Christ into people, ministering the riches of Christ into another person's being, is the highest speaking. But in order to prophesy, we must learn. Every kind of speaking comes out of learning. Proper speaking requires proper learning.</P><P>Because prophesying is the highest speaking, we also need the highest learning. We cannot carry out the highest speaking without learning the highest language. On the one hand, in the training meetings I urge, charge, and encourage all the saints to prophesy. But on the other hand, I sympathize with the saints because I know that to prophesy is really not easy. Prophesying is the highest speaking. To gossip or to lose one's temper is easy. There is no need of preparation to gossip or lose one's temper. But prophesying requires preparation.</P><P>In society to be a very good speaker requires much learning. When a person speaks, his educational level can be discerned. If a person were thirty years of age and had only finished junior high school, his ability would be limited. There is a difference between ability and capacity. Capacity is something by birth; but ability is something by birth plus learning, training, and practice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Truths</H2><P>In this message, I want to point out twenty-two major points of the truths which we need to learn.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Concerning the Person of God</H2><P>The first item we all must learn is the truth concerning the person of God. This is the most puzzling truth in the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Elohim, God in Plural,<br>the Faithful Mighty One</H2><P>To learn the person of God, we must first know that God's name in Hebrew is Elohim (Gen. 1:1). This word is a noun which is plural in number. The meaning of this divine title is that God is the faithful, mighty One. God is mighty and faithful. Hence, He is altogether trustworthy. Because He is mighty, He can do everything for us. Because He is faithful, He will do everything for us according to His word, according to His promise, and according to His covenant.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit</H2><P>God is unique. He is uniquely one, and yet He is also three. He is the Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Gen. 1:26-27; Matt. 28:19). The word triune comes from Latin. Tri is three and une is one. Thus, triune is three-one. God is the three-one God. In mathematics, there is no such number as three-one. Nevertheless, our God is three-one. He is one yet three, and He is three yet one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) The Godhead of the Divine Trinity</H2><P>Many preachers, ministers, pastors, and Bible teachers unconsciously believe in three gods. According to theology, they are taught that God is one, yet they may have difficulty concerning God also being three. He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19). Some have said that there is one God in three persons. But the term person is not found in the Bible in regard to the Triune God. W. H. Griffith Thomas, one of the founders of Dallas Theological Seminary, said that the term person must not be pressed too far, or it will lead to tritheism. The term person can be borrowed temporarily in order to describe the three of the Godhead. But most theologians agree that the proper word to describe the three of the Godhead is hypostases. The Greek word for hypostasis, the singular form of hypostases, refers to a support under, a support beneath, i.e., something underneath that supports, a supporting substance. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the hypostases, the supporting substances, that compose the one Godhead.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) The Essential Trinity</H2><P>There are also two aspects of the Divine Trinity: the essential Trinity and the economical Trinity. The essential Trinity refers to the essence of the Trinity. In order to understand the aspect of the essential Trinity, we have used the three words substance, element, and essence. Each of these words has a particular denotation. The essence is the finest part of any substance, item, or entity. Within the substance, there is an element, and within the element is the essence.</P><P>An orange can be used to illustrate these three things. An orange itself is a substance, and in the orange is the element. In order to get the essence, you must press the orange. The orange juice is the essence of the orange. When liquor is produced by distillation, the essence is called the spirit. The finest part, the intrinsic part, of liquor is the spirit. This spirit is actually the essence.</P><P>John 4:24 says that "God is Spirit." There is no article between the words is and Spirit. Hence, this verse refers to God's substance. Within this divine substance, there is the divine element, and within the divine element is the divine essence. Ephesians 4:4-6 says, "One Body and one Spirit...one Lord...one God and Father of all." The Spirit, the Lord, and the Father are the Divine Trinity. In the three of the Divine Trinity, the Father is the source, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence. The Father is the source of the divine substance, the Lord is the element of that divine substance, and the Spirit is the essence in the element of the divine substance. The substance has a source. In the substance, there is the element, and in the element, there is the essence. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit as the source, element, and essence are the essential Trinity. This essential Trinity is for the Triune God's existence and living.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) The Economical Trinity</H2><P>The Triune God not only exists and lives but also works, moves, and acts. His move is very great, and His work has become a great activity. Any kind of move or activity involves some kind of economy, plan, arrangement, or way to carry out a certain purpose. The economical Trinity concerns God's economy for His move, for His activity, to fulfill His plan. Hence, the Triune God has His essential aspect&#151;the essential Trinity, and His economical aspect&#151;the economical Trinity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Concerning God's Creation</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. With Man as the Center</H2><P>In our practice of prophesying, we must also learn the truth concerning God's creation with man as the center (Gen. 1&#151;2). God's creation has billions of items, but the center of this entire creation is man. Man as the center of God's creation bears God's image (1:26). A photograph of a person is the image of that person. In this aspect man is like God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Man Created in Three Parts&#151;Body, Soul, and Spirit</H2><P>Man as the center in God's creation was created in three parts&#151;body, soul, and spirit (Gen. 2:7). Because man is so crucial in God's creation, he corresponds to God. God is triune and man is tripartite. The Third of the Triune God is the Spirit, and the third part of the tripartite man is also the spirit. These two spirits correspond with each other, communicate with each other, and are mingled with each other to be one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Man to Take God as Life</H2><P>The man created by God in three parts was supposed to take God as life (Gen. 2:9). God created man and brought him to the tree of life, indicating that man should take in the tree of life. The tree of life is a symbol of God as life to man. The God-created man should take God as his nourishment, so that God could be man's life and life supply.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. Man to Be Increased with a Counterpart</H2><P>Man was also to be increased with a counterpart, a wife (Gen. 2:18-24). God also desires a counterpart, a wife. In eternity past, God was a bachelor. He was alone, yet He wanted to be increased. He wanted to have a counterpart. Christ also wants a counterpart. His counterpart is the church (Eph. 5:25). In Genesis 2 Adam received Eve as his counterpart. Before Eve came into existence, Adam was single. Eve was the increase of Adam.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Concerning Man's Fall</H2><P>We also must learn the truth concerning man's fall (Gen. 3; 4; 6:1-13; 11:1-9). Our understanding concerning the fall of man in Genesis has been printed in the Life-study Messages of Genesis.</P><P>Beginning from 1974, I spent fourteen years to finish the life-study of the New Testament. I am now working on the life-study of the Old Testament, and by the Lord's mercy, within another three years, I hope to finish it. My burden in having the life-study of the entire Bible was to open the Bible to the Lord's children by interpreting it. Today you may have the Bible in your hand, but it may not be open to you. The holy Word has been inspired, written both in Hebrew in the Old Testament and in Greek in the New Testament, and translated into other languages. Now the inspired, written, and translated Bible must be interpreted and defined.</P><P>The Life-study Messages are intended to be a guide. In Acts 8 the Ethiopian eunuch was reading the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah in his chariot (vv. 28, 32-33). The Spirit told Philip to join himself to the chariot, and as Philip ran up to the chariot, he heard the eunuch reading the prophet Isaiah. Philip then asked the eunuch if he understood what he was reading. The eunuch answered, "How could I unless someone guides me?" (v. 31).</P><P>One of my burdens in completing the life-study of the entire Bible was to solve the common and hard problems in the Bible and to open up every book of the Bible. If you have a question and turn to the notes in the Recovery Version or the Life-study Messages, you can get the answer. When the life-study of the Old Testament is finished, the Bible will then be an open Bible. At that time the Bible will not only have been inspired, written, and translated, but will also have been entirely interpreted. We should spend our time and energy to study the Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Concerning God's Redemption</H2><P>Our learning should include the truth concerning God's redemption in type (Gen. 3:20-21; 4:4) and in prophecy (12:3; 22:18). In Genesis 12 and 22, God prophesied to Abraham that in him and through his seed, all the nations would be blessed. His seed was Christ (Gal. 3:16). This prophecy to Abraham, according to Galatians 3, was God's preaching of the gospel to Abraham concerning His redemption (v. 8).</P><P>At this point I would like to list more truths that we need to spend our time learning in order to prophesy. If you do not know the truths, you will be short not only of material but also of the proper terminology when you prophesy. These truths have been covered in the many messages we have spoken and printed throughout the years, so I will just list most of them here and comment briefly on some of them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Concerning Christ<br>6. Concerning Christ's Redemption<br>7. Concerning the Holy Spirit's Sanctification<br>8. Concerning God's Forgiveness of Sins<br>9. Concerning God's Justification in Christ<br>10. Concerning the Believers'<br>Reconciliation with God<br>11. Concerning the Spirit's<br>Regeneration of the Believers<br>12. Concerning God's Full Salvation<br>13. Concerning the Spirit's Sanctification,<br>Renewing, and Transformation of the Believers</H2><P>The truth concerning the Spirit's sanctification is of two steps. Many teachers made the mistake of considering that the sanctification of the Spirit is only of one step. The first step of the Spirit's sanctification is before man's repentance (1 Pet. 1:2). Without the Spirit's move in sanctifying and separating man, no one would repent. After our repentance and regeneration, the Spirit continues His sanctifying work (Rom. 6:19, 22). This is the second step of sanctification. This step of sanctification continues through the process of renewing and transformation. We must also study the items of renewing and transformation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>14. Concerning the Conformation and Glorification of the Believers<br>15. Concerning the Church<br>as the Body of Christ, as the New Man,<br>as the House of God, and as the Kingdom of God<br>16. Concerning the Economy of God<br>and the Divine Dispensing<br>17. Concerning the Rapture of the Believers,<br>the Great Tribulation, and<br>the Second Coming of Christ<br>18. Concerning the Reward and Punishment<br>of the Believers at the Judgment Seat of Christ<br>and in the Coming Kingdom<br>19. Concerning the Kingdom, Millennium,<br>and the Age of Restoration</H2><P>The kingdom is the millennium, and the millennium of one thousand years is the age of restoration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>20. Concerning the New Jerusalem<br>and the New Heaven and the New Earth<br>21. Concerning the Principles of the Holy Scriptures</H2><P>In order to be helped concerning the principles of the holy Scriptures, I would recommend our reading message eight of the Life-study of the Psalms.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>22. Concerning the Way to Cut Straight<br>the Word of the Truth</H2><P>We must learn the truth concerning the way to cut straight the word of the truth. In 2 Timothy 2:15b Paul charged Timothy to cut the word straight. To cut the word straight is like a carpenter cutting a piece of wood. A skilled carpenter can cut the wood in the exact shape of the design. When we interpret the Word, we need to unfold it in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Experiences of Life</H2><P>In order to practice prophesying, we not only need to learn the truths, but also need to have the experiences of life. Our prophesying should be enriched with much truth and many experiences of life. We would like to point out twenty-two items of the experiences of life which we need to learn.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Of the Spirit's Sanctification<br>That Leads the Sinners to Repent</H2><P>The initial experience of life is the experience of the Spirit's sanctification that leads the sinners to repent (Luke 15:8; 1 Pet. 1:2a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Of Repentance and Confession of Sins</H2><P>In addition to this, we must have the experience of repentance and confession of sins. Though we have been saved and regenerated, we may never have made a thorough confession of sins. In 1935 Brother Nee came to my town, Chefoo, and stayed in my home for over one month. He caused us to aspire and desire to learn how to live a victorious life by Christ. One morning I went to the meeting hall to have a time with the Lord. While in the hall, I knelt down and began to confess. I had been saved ten years earlier in 1925, and I made a confession at that time. But the confession I made in 1935 was much more thorough. It took me more than two hours to make this confession of all my failures and sins. That confession was like a thorough shower, washing away every bit of dirt within me. We all need the experience of repenting and confessing our sins before God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Of God's Forgiveness and<br>Cleansing of Sins</H2><P>After making that thorough confession, I was thoroughly forgiven and cleansed. Because I have had that experience, my prophesying can have the element of the repentance and confession of sins.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Of God's Justification<br>through the Redemption of Christ</H2><P>We need to have the experience of God's justification through the redemption of Christ. Many Christians do not know what justification and redemption are and what the difference is between these two items. Redemption was completed by the death of Christ through the shedding of His blood. Justification is God's application of Christ's redemption upon us to make us righteous in Christ, to justify us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Of Reconciliation with God<br>through Justification<br>6. Of the Spirit's Regeneration</H2><P>We must not only be able to tell people the doctrine of regeneration but also be able to share our experience of regeneration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Of God's Full Salvation in Christ</H2><P>To prophesy we must have the experience of God's full salvation in Christ. God's salvation is not a partial salvation, but a full salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Of the Assurance of Salvation<br>and the Clearance of the Past</H2><P>Many believers do not know that they are saved. They do not have the experience of the assurance of salvation. Based upon the assurance of salvation, we have the experience of the clearance of the past. After we are saved, having the full assurance of this, we have to clear up our past.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Of Positional Sanctification and<br>Dispositional Sanctification by the Spirit</H2><P>We also must have the experience of positional sanctification and dispositional sanctification by the Spirit. Positional sanctification is objective. Dispositional sanctification is subjective, in our disposition. We must experience these things; then our prophesying will be rich.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. Of the Spirit's Renewing,<br>Transforming, and Conforming</H2><P>We must experience the Spirit's renewing, transforming, and conforming. The Spirit conforms us to the image of the glorious Christ (Rom. 8:29).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. Of the Dealings with Sin, with the World,<br>with the Flesh, with the Self, with the Natural Life,<br>and with the Natural Strength</H2><P>The book The Experience of Life covers all of these different dealings. This book comprises messages given in a training in Taipei in 1953 and 1954. I would encourage all of us to read it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>12. Of the Killing of the Subjective Death<br>of Christ and the Life-imparting<br>of the Resurrection of Christ</H2><P>We must experience the death of Christ, and we must also experience the life-imparting of the resurrection of Christ. The death of Christ is for killing, and the resurrection of Christ is for life-imparting.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>13. Of the Abiding in Christ, the Fellowship<br>with the Lord, and the Leading of the Spirit<br>14. Of the Infilling of the Essential Spirit<br>and the Outpouring of the Economical Spirit<br>15. Of the Living and Walking<br>by and according to the Spirit<br>16. Of Praying and Interceding<br>17. Of the Reading, the Studying,<br>the Understanding, and the Receiving of<br>the Enlightenment from the Bible<br>18. Of the Obedience and Submission to God<br>and the Breaking of the Outer Man</H2><P>We may have obeyed God, but we may never have submitted to Him. We must have the experience of obedience and submission to God and the breaking of our outer man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>19. Of the Knowing and Experiencing<br>of the Body of Christ</H2><P>This is a great lesson for us to experience.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>20. Of the Church Life in a Locality</H2><P>Many Christians do not have a local church life. We must have the experience of the church life in a locality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>21. Of the Practice<br>of the God-ordained Way in Its Four Steps</H2><P>The practice of the God-ordained way in its four steps should be our experience. The first step is to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel. To preach the gospel is to get sinners saved to be members of the Body of Christ. The second step is to nourish and feed the new believers in the home meetings. The third step is to perfect the saints through the group meetings. Here we do not say small group meetings, but group meetings. The word small is not needed. Actually, the group meetings should not be that small. The home meetings may be small, with two or three persons taking care of a new one. But the group meetings should take care of a group of believers. The fourth and last step of the God-ordained way is prophesying in the church meetings for the building up of the church, consummating in the organic building up of the Body of Christ. We should endeavor to build up the local church. Eventually, this building up will consummate in the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>22. Of the Watchfulness and Readiness<br>for the Pre-tribulation Rapture and<br>the Expectation and Preparation<br>for the Secret Appearing of the Lord<br>as the Morning Star</H2><P>For the practice of prophesying, we should have the experience of the watchfulness and readiness for the pre-tribulation rapture and the expectation and preparation for the secret appearing of the Lord as the morning star. The morning star appears before the sun rises. We must get ourselves ready for the secret appearing of the Lord as the morning star.</P><P>We should endeavor to learn all of the foregoing items of truth and the experiences of life. This learning will enrich our speaking, and we will prophesy in the heavens, from the heavens, and with the heavens. To gain all of these items requires time and labor. But we should not be disappointed; rather, we should be encouraged and burdened to get into all these things. In a sense, all of these items are like subjects in graduate school. In the 1940s I was working in Chefoo. One of my former classmates, who was a Christian, came to stay with me. He told me that if someone were to meet with us for four years, he would have a degree in theology. This should be our situation in the church life. We need to learn all the truths and the experiences of life enumerated in this message.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRACTICE OF PROPHESYING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(4)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>LEARNING, EXERCISING, AND PRACTICING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Luke 1:47; Psa. 16:9; 108:1; Acts 2:26; 1 Cor. 14:7-11; Acts 6:10; 7:55; 4:31</H1><P>In this message we will continue our fellowship concerning the practice of prophesying. To prophesy is to speak for the Lord and to speak Him forth.</P><P>All of us need to speak Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ. But the matter of speaking has two problems. On the one hand, most of the saints are too silent, but on the other hand, some are too released. Those who are too released should exercise to restrict their speaking. By doing this they will save the church from being frustrated by their over-exercise. On the other hand, those who are silent must speak because the church meetings have been killed by their silence.</P><P>The principle in the New Testament is that God the Spirit desires to see all of His people speak for Him (1 Cor. 14:1, 31), yet Satan always goes alongside the Lord's move in order to frustrate Him. God wants all of His people to speak, but Christianity has produced the clergy as the speaking class and the laity as the nonspeaking class. The Lord's recovery today is for the overthrow of the clergy-laity system.</P><P>Over the past few years, we have endeavored to build up the practice of all the saints prophesying for the building up of the Body of Christ, but this has been a very difficult job. When asked why they do not speak in the meetings, some may say, "I do not know how to speak, and I do not have anything to speak, so I dare not speak. I like to be a proper member in the church life. I do not like to speak loosely." This is one of the factors which causes many saints not to speak in their meetings.</P><P>In general, I am glad to see that a number of the saints have the boldness to speak, but I am concerned that in the long run, the constant, bold speaking on the part of some saints may kill the appetite of others. Because the other saints do not hear the riches of Christ or receive the proper enlightenment from certain bold ones, they will lose their appetite for the speaking of these ones. In the long run, this kind of speaking will cause others to become disinterested. This is another factor which frustrates the speaking of all the saints in the meetings.</P><P>A small number of saints among us do not care whether or not their speaking is received. Even if someone were to ask them to stop, they would still go on speaking. This is a situation in which their boldness in speaking has developed into their "joy." Such "joy" eventually becomes their "toy." Speaking in the meeting has become their toy. For these ones to over-exercise in the meetings by speaking too much is not good.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. EXERCISING</H2><P>In the previous message, we fellowshipped that in order to prophesy we need to learn the truths and the experiences of life. Without learning the truths and the experiences of life, we have nothing to speak. This is why we need to labor. According to Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12 and 14, to be a functioning member of the Lord's Body is not an easy thing. As members of the Body of Christ, we all must speak, and in order to speak, we have to learn. Furthermore, even if we have learned the truths and the experiences of life, there may still be other problems with our prophesying. There may be problems in our speaking with regard to the exercise of our spirit, our mouth, our voice, our speed, our gesture, and our accent.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Exercising Your Spirit</H2><P>In the exercise of your spirit (Luke 1:47; Psa. 16:9), you must exercise your mouth and your voice at the same time. When someone exercises his spirit in speaking, he may shout. But do not consider that mere shouting is the release of the spirit. You must learn to exercise your innermost being when you speak. To lose your temper is a good illustration of releasing your spirit. When you speak in anger, without any consideration, without any fear, and without any care, you spontaneously release your spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Exercising Your Mouth (Your Tongue)<br>and Your Voice (Your Sound)</H2><P>When you prophesy, you must exercise your mouth, your tongue (Psa. 108:1; Acts 2:26), and your voice, your sound (1 Cor. 14:7-11). When you speak in the meeting, you should not forget that you are speaking to the entire congregation. You are not speaking just to yourself or to the person next to you. For this reason, you must exercise your mouth and your voice. After I give a message, I often stress that in the time for testimonies the saints should speak loudly. I have stressed this matter again and again, but I have seen very little improvement among the saints over the years. Many of the brothers and sisters still remain unchanged.</P><P>We should not forget that when we come to a meeting, we are coming to speak. Our singing and praying are also a kind of speaking. Even to say "amen" is a kind of speaking. Whenever we enter through the threshold of the meeting hall, we should learn to exercise our spirit. We should realize that to exercise our spirit and to exercise our mouth are part of our job whenever we come to the meetings. Whenever we meet together, we must exercise our spirit. Not only when we cross the threshold of the meeting hall, but also beginning from our homes and on the way to the meeting, we should exercise our spirit to speak to the Lord, to sing, to pray, and to praise.</P><P>In the Psalms, the exclamation "O" as in the phrase "O Jehovah" is often used (3:3, 7; 5:1, 3, 8). There is a great difference between the phrases "O Jehovah" and "Jehovah." When you say, "O," immediately your spirit rises up. If while driving your car on the way to the meeting, you say in an exercised way, "O Lord! Amen! Hallelujah!" your spirit will be stirred up.</P><P>When we speak, we must exercise our mouth to match the exercise of the spirit. We must learn to do this and practice it. We must also realize that when we come to the meeting, our job, our duty, is to speak. We are not in Christianity where pastors are hired to speak and to pray for the entire congregation. Even some denominations have so-called ministers of music to do the singing for everyone. This kind of practice is not the God-ordained way. The God-ordained way is for all of the believers to speak in the meetings.</P><P>If we all exercise to speak in the meetings, the meetings will be in the third heaven. But if we come to the meetings without any stirring of the spirit and without any speaking, the meetings will be dead and will deaden everyone. When we do not speak in the meeting, we actually kill the meeting. Such a situation will leave the meeting to those who are over-exercised. Then the meeting not only will be killed but also may become chaotic. Eventually, the entire meeting will be annulled and confiscated.</P><P>We all have to learn to exercise our spirit, our mouth, and our voice. When we speak, we should exercise our voice, our sound, in a proper way. When someone does not exercise his voice in a proper way, he may speak without a definite direction, without striking a clear point, and in a halting manner. There may also be a number of obscure points in his speaking. If we exercise to speak with the proper sound and tone, the meeting will not be cooled down; rather, it will be stirred up by our speaking.</P><P>The standard of speaking in the church meetings is the highest. To speak in the meetings, we must exercise our spirit, our mouth, our voice, our speed, our gesture, and our accent in a proper way. To play basketball, in contrast, is a small thing, yet even for such a small thing, the players must exercise and practice every day for many hours. How much more do we need to practice speaking in the meetings!</P><P>The Christian meeting requires a high practice, because the Christian life is a high enterprise. Often, however, we despise the Christian life and the church life. We must remember that when we meet together or contact people by visiting them that we are carrying out our kingly duty. In Matthew 28:19, the Lord Jesus as the King-Savior charged us, saying, "Go therefore and disciple all the nations." When we contact others, we must speak in a way that fulfills the Father's heavenly calling. This explains why there is a result when some brothers and sisters contact people, and why there is little result when other saints contact people. In the God-ordained way to practice the church life, we all have to learn to speak for the Lord.</P><P>Some may think that the New Testament does not teach us how to speak, but this is wrong. Ephesians 5:19 says, "Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs." To speak in such a way is not a natural way of speaking. To speak in a natural way does not fulfill a spiritual purpose. Therefore, we must learn to speak in a trained way.</P><P>Our learning to speak for the Lord for the building up of the church never ceases. Many times after I gave a message, I had some regret because I felt that my speaking was not up to the proper standard. In 1933, the second year after we began to have the Lord's table in Chefoo, Brother Nee came to visit us. Some in the denominations heard about Brother Nee's visit and invited him to speak in a meeting of a conference they were holding. Brother Nee went to that meeting and spoke. According to my feeling, he gave a good message, but when he came back to my home after the meeting, I noticed that he was not very happy. Eventually, he indicated to me that he felt his speaking was poor. This shows that our learning to speak in a meeting for the Lord is endless. If we can be successful in speaking for the Lord, the church will be revived.</P><P>The way that we speak is important. In a hymn the rhythm is more important than the rhyme. It is the same in speaking. With some brothers, their voice, or sound, is good, but their speaking may be short of rhythm. If there is not the proper rhythm, our speaking will be difficult to understand. For this reason, there is the need of a few "selahs," that is, a few short stops, when we exercise our voice to speak.</P><P>By the fellowship in this message, we can see that we need instruction, learning, and exercise to speak for the Lord in the most effective way. If we pay attention to all the points in this message, our meetings will be greatly enriched. If we speak in a natural way, this will frustrate, cool down, kill, or annul the meetings. We all have to learn how to avoid the shortcomings which we have pointed out in this message and exercise our entire being to speak for the Lord for the building up of the church.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRACTICE OF PROPHESYING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(5)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>LEARNING, EXERCISING, AND PRACTICING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(4)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Luke 1:47; Psa. 16:9; 108:1; Acts 2:26; 1 Cor. 14:7-11; Acts 6:10; 7:55; 4:31</H1><P>In the past six years we have received much teaching concerning the God-ordained way. This way, no doubt, has been ordained by God, but it has not been practiced adequately by us. Although I appreciate and value the teaching concerning the God-ordained way very highly, at the present time what we need is the practice with the proper coaching. In the playing of any kind of sport, a coach should give his players lectures, and then he should go onto the playing field with his players to coach them. In the practice of the God-ordained way, we are short of the proper coaching. In order to coach you, I myself must be coached. Thus, I also must practice.</P><P>A coach may coach his players, but when they practice, often they are able to play the game much better than the coach. I do expect that when you practice my coaching, your  practice will be much better than mine. According to my knowledge, very few coaches have ever been star athletes; nevertheless, many young men and women under their coaching have become stars. A coach can teach his players, but he cannot play as well as his players. I hope that some who pick up my teaching, my coaching, and practice it will become "stars."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. EXERCISING</H2><P>In the previous message we covered the exercising of our spirit, our mouth (our tongue), and our voice (our sound) in the practice of prophesying. When you practice what you received in that message, you practice the coaching. We need to exercise our spirit, our mouth, and our voice in all the church meetings.</P><P>In the New Testament, especially in Paul's writings, the need for practice is mentioned. In 1 Timothy 4:7-8 Paul used the word exercise. In verse 8 he spoke of bodily exercise. No doubt, this was a reference to the exercise of athletes in the Olympic games, for in Paul's time the Olympic games were prevailing. No one can be an Olympic athlete without being trained. Do not think that we are merely common persons, sinners, who have been accepted and regenerated by God to remain in our present state. On the contrary, we must be changed, not merely in a moral or ethical way. We must be changed in everything to be according to the Scriptures.</P><P>We need to come to every meeting like a team of players ready to play. Many Christians, when they come to a Christian meeting, do not consider it important to bring a Bible, and most do not like to come early. If a meeting is scheduled to begin at 7:30, very few would begin to come to the meeting at 7:00, a half hour before the meeting. However, if we would come to the meeting early and exercise ourselves to pray, sing, and praise the Lord, this would burn the meeting. When the scheduled time comes and the others come into the meeting, the atmosphere of the meeting will be uplifted to the third heaven already. This uplifts the spirit, stirs up people's inner being, and causes the meeting place to become a "furnace" to "burn" people. Everyone, even the coldest one, who comes into such a meeting will be warmed up. This is the proper way.</P><P>The main thing, the top thing, in the Christian life is to meet. If we do not know how to meet, we are not proper Christians. Thus, the way to meet is a crucial matter. First Corinthians 14 is an entire chapter on how to meet. According to this chapter, in order to have a proper meeting, we must learn (vv. 1, 12, 31, 39). Our coming to the meeting should start at our dining room table. Beginning at that time we should get ourselves adjusted. We should consider, "Now I am preparing myself to go to the meeting. First, we must eat an early meal, because we do not know whether the traffic will be heavy or not. We must arrive at the meeting place not only on time but much earlier than the scheduled time. Furthermore, we must prepare our spirit, and we must pray for our meeting." If we all practice in such a way, the meetings among us will be high and living, and people will be convinced, subdued, and captured by the way in which we meet. Many positive things will result just by our meeting in a proper way.</P><P>We should not be actors in the meetings. Actors live one way and act another way. We Christians should meet in the same way that we live. We should conduct ourselves in the meetings in the same way that we conduct ourselves at home. This applies to group meetings, to home meetings, to feeding people, and to preaching the gospel. In everything, we act, work, move, and live in the same way. For this, we must be changed. This kind of change is part of our transformation. We need to be transformed in the way that we act, the way that we move, the way that we work, the way that we speak, the way that we have our being, and the way that we meet.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Exercising Your Mouth (Your Tongue)<br>and Your Voice (Your Sound)</H2><P>At this point I would like to say a further word concerning the exercising of our voice. Our speaking should not have a weak beginning; rather, it should have a strong start. If we begin our speaking in a weak voice, that will be a poor start. We must learn to exercise our voice to begin our speaking. To begin our speaking, our voice should be loud and our speaking should be somewhat slow. Otherwise, we will be merely shouting. The beginning of our speaking must be very sweet and very pleasant.</P><P>Some saints like to begin their speaking by saying "amen" loudly. This should be avoided. It is unpleasant to the hearers' ears because it is meaningless. It is not easy to begin our speaking in a proper way. After we get our spirit exercised and prepare our mouth with our tongue, we must utter something. The utterance, or the uttering, is the practice of our speaking. In our utterance we need to begin with a good voice.</P><P>In giving a message, the most difficult thing is not only to find a subject but also to find the proper way to begin the speaking. If a speaker begins wrongly, that wrong start will lead him astray in the entire message. This is similar to driving a car. To begin our driving, we must be careful to get on the correct freeway. If we get on the wrong freeway, we will be in trouble because it is difficult to turn around on a freeway. If a speaker has a good beginning, his entire message will be victorious.</P><P>Even in our prayer, the first sentence is crucial. In the 1991 Thanksgiving Conference in Reston, Virginia, before the beginning of the fourth meeting, I had a burden to pray. I talked with the Lord concerning how I should open my prayer and how my prayer should be carried out. Before the message, I offered a very living, prevailing prayer. My opening sentence was, "Lord, this morning we ask You to give us a trance that transfers us from the visible circumstances into the invisible scene." After concluding my prayer, I opened my message with a word concerning our need to be in a divine trance (Acts 10:9-10) in order to see the intrinsic view of the Body of Christ (see The Intrinsic View of the Body of Christ, chapter four, published by Living Stream Ministry). In a trance we see something not in an ordinary way but in an extraordinary way, not in the physical universe created by God but in the invisible scene behind the visible scene. This illustrates how we all need to learn how to begin our speaking and our prayer.</P><P>In Chefoo, in Shanghai, in Taiwan, and here in Anaheim, a number of times the atmosphere in the prayer meeting was low. Then I prayed just a short prayer, and immediately the meeting was uplifted. Sometimes the prayer meeting becomes dead. In such a situation, we need to learn to pray in a way that raises the dead meeting from the dead atmosphere and brings the meeting into resurrection.</P><P>We must learn to begin our speaking and prayer with a strong voice and a proper thought. In the Lord's table meeting some of the saints may offer praises to the Lord six or seven times. To praise the Lord six or seven times at the Lord's table is not too much, but it all depends on how we exercise. When we pray a number of times in the Lord's table meeting, we need to consider how we will begin and how we will carry out our prayer. Otherwise, many times our praising will become a burden on the meeting. What is important is not the number of times we pray. What matters is our skill, our way, in praying. Thus, we all need much exercise.</P><P>God's salvation is not simple. When I was young, I thought that everything concerning God was simple. Now, the longer I go on with Him, the more I realize that God is not simple. In the old creation God did not do anything; He just spoke, "Let there be light," and there was light (Gen. 1:3). He spoke and it was done (Psa. 33:9). But in His salvation, God abandoned that way. In relation to God's salvation, we may prefer God's way in the old creation, because it is so simple. We may think that because God is almighty, He can simply say, "Let the whole world be saved," and it will be so. In 1 Timothy 2:3-4 Paul said that "God..desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth." At times I have thought, "God, if this is Your desire, You just say it, and it will be. If You say, `Let all men be saved,' all men will be saved. If You say, `Let all men come to the full knowledge of the truth,' it will happen. We do not need to labor to bring people to salvation, or to set up a training or a meeting to teach people the truth." However, in the new creation it is not so simple.</P><P>God's first step in the new creation was to become incarnated. As God, He was free, without any limitation. But He intentionally entered into humanity to conceal Himself in a human shell. He remained in the womb for nine months. After being born, He lived as a man for thirty years, apparently doing nothing that was noteworthy. After the three and a half years of His ministry, He went to the cross and died an all-inclusive, complicated death. He entered into death, and He remained there. Then He came out of death and entered into resurrection. In His resurrection, as a man in the flesh, the last Adam, He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). How many troubles He experienced in the "tunnel" of His process!</P><P>Not only so, God's angels are millions, perhaps even billions, in number. Furthermore, all the angels are mighty. Why would God not use the angels to visit all the corners of the backward countries to proclaim the gospel to them? The angels do not need transportation. They do not need cars or trains, and they do not need to learn a language. How easy it would be if God would use the angels to preach the gospel. But God would not take the easy way. For the preaching of the gospel, God put all the angels aside. He prefers to use dumb human beings, who are slow to act and stupid in learning.</P><P>We need to remember that whenever we come together, we are playing like a team. Whether the number of saints gathered is one thousand or only ten, every attendant is a member of the team. None of us should hide himself so that he becomes a spectator. Whenever we come to a meeting, we must act, behave, and move in the meeting as a transformed person. Some of the saints are very clever by birth. Such clever ones like to hide themselves in the meetings. Others are stupid by birth. Eventually, it is the stupid ones who act, who shout, in the meetings. Actually, the stupid ones should learn to restrict their activity. They need to realize that they were born stupid under God's sovereignty. God did this for a purpose.</P><P>I have been handling the English language for more than seventy years, but still my speaking in English is poor. I do not know why God came to me and charged me with a commission to speak His Word. Often I have prayed, "Lord, You know that my speaking in English is poor." Eventually, I realized that this was of the Lord. If I were eloquent in speaking English, my ministry would be different. The "color" and weight of my ministry would be changed. God purposely chose a stupid speaker.</P><P>Giving a message does not depend on our eloquence. To be eloquent is one thing; to be able to present the truth to people is another thing. You may be very eloquent, smart, and excellent in speaking, yet after your speaking you may not have released the truth. On the other hand, a person may be very stupid, but in giving a message he may do a good work in presenting the truth. After hearing one of my messages, a young man stood up and said, "Yes, Brother Lee is not eloquent, but after his speaking, we always have a clear view concerning a certain truth." Although we may be stupid ones who were born stupid, God will use us. But we need to learn. Realizing that we are stupid, we should not act so much and so easily. Rather, we should desire and endeavor to learn.</P><P>Those who were born smart, on the other hand, must learn to put their cleverness to death. The compound Spirit applies the Lord's death to us. All the clever ones need the compound Spirit to apply the Lord's death to their cleverness. Some of the clever ones hide themselves in the meetings. They would not do or say anything until they are certain that they would be a "star." That is wrong. God uses the clever ones, and He also uses the stupid ones. But we all need to be terminated; we all need to be crucified, to be crossed out. Both the clever ones and the stupid ones need to be dealt with. If the clever ones allow their cleverness to be crossed out, they will no longer perform in the meetings like actors; they will simply live, act, work, move, and do things in a normal way.</P><P>When we come to the meetings, as Christians we must move as transformed persons, not as persons who act. When he acts, an actor dresses himself and conducts himself in a manner that is different from what he is normally. When a young actor portrays an old man, he alters his appearance so that he looks like an old man, and he moves, gestures, and speaks to people like an old man. That is acting. But we need to drop everything that is false and simply be what we are. However, we should not be what we are in the natural life. We should be what we are in transformation. Formerly, we might have been a clever person who hid himself all the time, but the Lord has transformed us, so we act, move, walk, and work as a transformed member in the Body. Thus, when we come to the meeting, we must be active; this is not only our duty and our responsibility but also our obligation. This is the reason that we all need to be trained.</P><P>When they prophesy, those who are timid must get out of their timidity. However, their speaking in a bold way should not be a performance. They should conduct themselves in this way all the time.</P><P>Some saints like to begin their speaking by saying, "Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!" This has become a slogan in the recovery. We should avoid this, especially in the beginning of our speaking. To begin our speaking we should have a fitting noun as a subject and a proper verb as a predicate. This will make our speaking more meaningful.</P><P>As an illustration of the proper way to begin a speaking, we may open in this way: "As Christians we need to be transformed in everything. Formerly, we thought that in the matter of meeting we did not need to be transformed. Actually, we need to be transformed even more in the way of meeting." This is a good beginning. With such a proper beginning, many things will come out in the remainder of our speaking.</P><P>At times we may have a proper thought with the proper line and the proper points for our speaking, but we also need to learn how to compose our speaking. The opening word in our speaking is very crucial because it controls the speaking that follows it.</P><P>If we use an outline in our speaking, when we stand up to speak, we should not drop our head to look at our outline. That kills our speaking. Before 1974 I did not use an outline in my speaking. I began to use an outline when I conducted the life-study trainings. For each of those trainings I wrote a set of outlines. Brother T. Austin-Sparks always spoke from points he had written in a notebook. Once while I was interpreting for him during a visit he made to Taiwan, I noticed that he spoke everything according to his notes, but a person sitting far off could not realize that he was using notes. He had a skillful way to use the notes but not let people notice. When we speak with an outline, we should avoid dropping our head and looking down at the outline before speaking.</P><P>We all have our natural way, and we not only allow our natural way to act, but we also trust in our natural way. In learning how to meet, we should continually annul our natural way and learn the God-ordained way. It is easy to meet in a natural way. To do this we do not need to learn or be dealt with. However, to meet in the God-ordained way, we need to be dealt with; our natural way must be dealt with. We need to drop our natural way and learn to be crucified in relation to speaking by our natural way. Then we will be transformed.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRACTICE OF PROPHESYING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(6)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>LEARNING, EXERCISING, AND PRACTICING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(5)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Luke 1:47; Psa. 16:9; 108:1; Acts 2:26; 1 Cor. 14:7-11; Acts 6:10; 7:55; 4:31</H1><P>Prayer: Lord, we worship You for all that You are to us, and we thank You for this time that we all could come together to seek after You in Your Word. While the whole world is busy with worldly things, we are separated unto You. What a privilege, what a blessing, and even what an enjoyment! We trust in You for Your blessing. Lord, bless us. Without Your blessing we are nothing and we can do nothing. But now we do believe that You are with us. We do have the sense that You are with us. We treasure Your presence. Give us a seeking heart and, Lord, a sober mind, even an open spirit, open to You and to Your way, to Your economy, to Your speaking. Help us in the speaking. We are nothing; without Your presence, without Your anointing, we are dead persons. Yet we thank You that the ointment is within us. We trust in this. Lord, give us a new word, the up-to-date word, and a new speaking full of Your interest and full of Yourself, Your riches, Your secret, Your economy, Your dispensing. Lord, be with us. Shame the enemy. Amen.</P><P>God's economy is, first, to carry out something in the principle of incarnation. Before Christ was born, God was God and man was man. Although God came to visit man and came down upon man as the Spirit of Jehovah, God still remained by Himself, leaving man alone. However, in His incarnation, He came to bring divinity into humanity. We all need to learn and never forget the phrase to bring divinity into humanity. In the universe an extraordinary "career" was accomplished, that is, the mingling of God with man. How marvelous this is!</P><P>The history of the universe consists of nine major items. The first four are the Triune God, the universe created by Him, man, and incarnation to mingle God with man. The issue of incarnation was a wonderful person, a person with two natures&#151;the God-man, Jesus Christ. In my estimation such a God-man is much greater than the entire universe. Then, this One went to the cross and accomplished a wonderful, all-inclusive death, terminating all the old things and germinating the new creation. Jesus Christ as the God-man and His all-inclusive death are the fifth and sixth major items in the history of the universe.</P><P>After His death Christ also accomplished His resurrection. In John 11:25 He said that He is resurrection. Before His death He was resurrection already, but that resurrection was not consummated, was not processed. After His death He entered into a consummated resurrection, which produced the church. The church will consummate in the New Jerusalem. Christ's resurrection, the church, and the New Jerusalem are the last three of the nine major items of the history of the universe. We need to learn this history and endeavor to speak it to others.</P><P>First, God did a wonderful thing to make Himself one with man. Since that time, concerning His economy God would never do anything apart from man. He will never do anything merely by Himself. Without man, we may say that God is crippled; He cannot "walk" or do anything without man. God must do everything in the principle of incarnation. The Old Testament says Jehovah's Spirit came upon the prophets (1 Sam. 10:6, 10; 19:20; 2 Chron. 20:14-15; Ezek. 11:5) or that the burden of Jehovah's word came upon them (Zech. 12:1). Today many Pentecostals follow the Old Testament in their practice of prophesying. In their meetings it is common to hear someone say, "Thus saith the Lord." However, Peter never said this, nor did Paul. In 1 Corinthians 7:12 Paul said, "I say, I, not the Lord," and in verse 40 he said, "...according to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God." Although Paul gave his own opinion, we must take Paul's word as the word of the Lord. We need to realize that the entire Christianity has been and still is wrong in one basic principle: they have not seen that the New Testament economy is the economy based on the principle of incarnation. In His New Testament economy, apart from man, God cannot do anything. Even the all-inclusive death of Christ was accomplished by a God-man who died a vicarious death for us. The One who died on the cross was not only man but also God, not only God but also man. This is incarnation, and this is the incarnated One.</P><P>Today this incarnated God-man is in His consummated resurrection. Fifty years ago a co-worker told me definitely that he could not believe that after His resurrection Christ still has humanity. To his opinion Christ left His humanity in the tomb. However, although Christ did leave the old linen cloths in the tomb (John 19:40; Luke 24:12), He did not leave His humanity in the tomb. When He came to His disciples on the day of resurrection, He came with a body that could be touched by their fingers (John 20:27). Furthermore, when Stephen saw Christ in His ascension, he saw Him as a man, even the Son of Man (Acts 7:56). In Revelation 1:12-13 John saw the Son of Man, after His resurrection and ascension, walking among the golden lampstands. When the Lord spoke to the chief priests at His judgment, He told them that they would see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven (Matt. 26:64). After His coming back, Christ will remain in His humanity for eternity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. EXERCISING</H2><P>Prophesying is a matter of incarnation, but most Christians have made it a miraculous thing, like the speaking of human words by Balaam's donkey (Num. 22:28-30). However, this view is absolutely wrong. In 1 Timothy 4:13 Paul charged Timothy to "attend to the public reading, to the exhortation, to the teaching." Paul told Timothy that he needed to exercise himself to practice these matters. This word was spoken not in the principle of "thus saith the Lord" but in the principle of incarnation. In his fourteen Epistles Paul never told us that the Spirit of God or the word of God came upon him. Rather, Paul said, "I solemnly charge you..." (1 Tim. 5:21; 2 Tim. 4:1) and "I exhorted you [Timothy], when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things" (1 Tim. 1:3). Thus, the matter of prophesying, or speaking for God, in the principle of incarnation is seen clearly in the writings of Paul. Without Paul's writings, it would be difficult to have a clear view of this matter in the New Testament.</P><P>The matter of speaking in the principle of incarnation is not just for a few gifted persons. First Corinthians 14:31 says, "You can all prophesy." Dear saints, as long as you are a human being who can speak, you should prophesy. God's New Testament economy is to carry out everything in the principle of incarnation. If we do not do anything, God is finished. If we tell God that we are tired and do not want to do or speak anything, God may say, "I am so pitiful. Without you I am finished. I cannot do anything; I am crippled." This is today's situation. God is "crippled" by Christianity. This is why we are here. We are here to carry out God's economy by every saint speaking in the principle of incarnation. We need to shout, "Hallelujah, Satan, I do not have a gift, but I have a spirit with a mouth plus a tongue. Therefore, I can speak." If we do this, God will be happy.</P><P>I am glad that last year the Lord led us to make a quick decision to go to Russia. The decision was made quickly, but the decision could be carried out only through the full-time training. Without the training it would have been impossible to send sixty brothers and sisters to Russia in less than six months. Only a few of those sent to Russia are capable speakers. These speakers are used in the conference meetings. But every day all sixty go out to visit people, to speak to individuals, families, and groups. The Russian believers are very intimate. They do not like to see the saints come to visit them for only an hour. Rather, they prefer to keep our saints in their homes for half a day. During this time, they like to hear the saints speak concerning the Bible, God, Christ, and the church, which consummates in the New Jerusalem. In Moscow, we have baptized more than two thousand new believers. Now we have several hundred in the church life attending the church meetings. These new ones need a lot of speaking. The meetings during the week and the meeting on the Lord's Day are not adequate. The new ones need someone to go to their homes to speak to them again and again.</P><P>We do not trust much in gifted speakers. In our going to Russia we determined not to take that way. We prefer not to have large gatherings of tens of thousands of people. In both Moscow and St. Petersburg there are only thirty full-timers to serve. How could so few care for thousands of new believers? Rather, the large number becomes a frustration. We prefer to baptize a smaller number and then raise them up to be the church. Through such a work, at present in Moscow we have a church with more than one thousand members.</P><P>I hope that all you dear saints will pick up the understanding that the Lord needs you. He needs you to live with Him, to live by Him, to live in Him, to live in oneness with Him. You are a God-man. Day by day you should learn the truths in the Bible. These truths concern mainly God, Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church according to God's economy. Do not speak anything else. Any knowledge other than the knowledge of God, Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church is the knowledge of good and evil from the tree of knowledge, which brings death.</P><P>Today a number of dissenting ones in the recovery are speaking something different. They say that Brother Lee is wrong in certain matters. Even if I were actually wrong in those things, none of those things could be a base for them to make divisions. The dissenting ones are deceived, and they also have become a deceiving factor to deceive others. They say that my work has now become a system and that the saints need to come out of that system. This kind of speaking is something that Paul called the teaching of "different things," things that differ from God's economy, which is in faith (1 Tim. 1:3-4). God's economy in faith comprises only God, Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. We all need to know these things.</P><P>If you know all these truths and you know how to exercise yourself in keeping the principle of incarnation, wherever you go you can speak. You can speak to people without end concerning God, telling them that God is triune&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;and that the Son is the embodiment of the Triune God. You should not say, "I don't feel led by the Spirit; the Lord didn't give me one word, and this morning I am empty." The fact is that you are not empty. And do not be overly concerned about the leading of the Spirit. When you become "super-spiritual," you are not genuinely spiritual. We do have the leading of the Spirit within us. This leading is the indwelling Spirit as the compound ointment moving, anointing, and dispensing within us unceasingly. Every minute and every second the leading is here. He is ready, and He is waiting for us. When we speak, surely He is happy. We can speak because our "Companion" works with us. Thus, we can speak for Him without end. If we all would exercise ourselves to speak for the Lord, our speaking would change the entire world. When we are silent, God is crippled. When we speak, God leaps like a deer. He is happy.</P><P>In 1 Thessalonians 5:19 Paul said, "Do not quench the Spirit." The Spirit causes our spirits to be burning (Rom. 12:11) and our gifts to be flaming (2 Tim. 1:6). Hence, we should not quench Him. However, nearly every day, every week, and every month we quench the Spirit. The Spirit likes to speak. He is a speaking Spirit, yet we do not like to speak. Thus, we often quench the Spirit. I would encourage the quiet ones among us to speak in every meeting, even to speak many times in each meeting. After speaking many times in each meeting for half a year, they can reduce their speaking to allow others to have more time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Exercising Your Speed</H2><P>In the previous two messages we have seen that we need to exercise our spirit, our mouth (our tongue), and our voice (our sound) in the practice of prophesying. In prophesying we also need to exercise our speed. In our speaking, we must adjust ourselves. We should not speak too fast or too slow; rather, we need to speak with a good rhythm and a proper speed.</P><P>Some of the saints speak much too rapidly. Thus, it is difficult to "catch" what they are saying. However, some of the brothers have learned to insert a "selah," a brief pause, at certain points in their speaking, thus affording their listeners an adequate opportunity to receive their word. This is an example of learning to exercise our speed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Exercising Your Gesture</H2><P>In prophesying we also need to exercise our gesture. Although I have been speaking for more than sixty years, I feel that I still have not learned adequately to speak with a proper gesture. This is a difficult matter. To learn to have a proper gesture requires a lifetime of exercise. Having the proper gesture is a great benefit to our speaking. If we speak with little or no gesturing, our speaking will appear to be unnatural and lifeless, and it will not be attractive. If we speak with too much gesturing, our speaking will seem to be peculiar. We all need to learn to speak with a gesture that is very spontaneous.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Exercising Your Accent</H2><P>In the practice of prophesying, we also need to learn to exercise our accent. In our speaking we must have some crucial points with some crucial words. We need to learn to accent our speaking. Shouting loudly is not always a proper accent to our speaking. Sometimes we should speak a certain point slowly to make it a crucial point that can catch people's attention. In our speaking we should care not only for our rhythm, our speed, but also for our accent. We should learn to speak with a proper rhythm and a proper accent so that our listeners can hear every word. In speaking we must take care of others' ears. Exercising to have a proper speed, gesture, and accent is a great help to our speaking.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. PRACTICING</H2><P>In addition to learning and exercising, we also need to practice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. By Pray-reading a Portion of the Holy Word</H2><P>In our practice, first we need to learn to pray-read a portion of the holy Word. We should not merely read the Word, nor should we merely pray it. We must pray-read the holy Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. By Paraphrasing a Short Portion<br>of the Scriptures</H2><P>In our practice we also need to learn to paraphrase a short portion of the Scriptures. For instance, John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." In this sentence there are three independent clauses. In order to make these three clauses into a prophecy, we should first pray-read: "Lord, in the beginning. Amen. In the beginning was the Word. Oh, the Word! How wonderful! The Word, the Word. The Word was in the beginning." This is pray-reading. This is also a good paraphrasing. In our pray-reading we can expound the Word a little: "And the Word was with God. Thank You, Lord, You are with God. You even were with God there in eternity past." However, in doing this we should not go too far. We should come back to the Word and pray, "Lord, You are God. The Word was God." If we desire to prophesy, we must surely practice this.</P><P>In recent years we have found a way to use a portion of the Word for morning revival. The practice of pray-reading and reading portions from The Holy Word for Morning Revival has been a great help to many of the saints. Many have testified that in the past, when they came to the meeting, they did not want to prophesy, they did not want to speak for the Lord, because they had no inspiration and no subject on which to speak. But since they began to use The Holy Word for Morning Revival, their spirits have been stirred up, their thoughts have been inspired, and they now have a subject on which to speak, with some material to eat, to digest, to paraphrase, and to pray-read.</P><P>The most helpful way in reading the Bible is to paraphrase. In my writing of the training outlines on the Minor Prophets, I had to give the subject of each book, the central thought of each book, and the revelation concerning Christ in each book. I have found that the best way to receive the proper understanding of each book is to paraphrase. When I paraphrased every verse of every chapter of every book, the light came. The Word itself is light. Psalm 119:105 says, "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path," and verse 130 of the same psalm says, "The entrance of thy words giveth light." The best way to enter into the Word and receive the light of its shining is to paraphrase the Word. Simply to repeat the words of the Scripture again and again, using the same wording, does not help much. We need to paraphrase: "O Lord, in the beginning. Oh, the beginning. Lord, in the beginning You were the Word. Oh, the Word. You, Lord Jesus, You were the Word." This is to paraphrase. To paraphrase is to touch the "switch" and to turn the light on. When we paraphrase we "switch on" the light. This helps us to understand the Bible, to receive light, and to prophesy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. By Composing Your Inspirations<br>into a Short Message for Your Speaking<br>in the Practice of Prophesying</H2><P>We also need to practice by composing our inspirations into a short message for our speaking in the practice of prophesying. If we will pray-read a portion of the Word and paraphrase it, we will surely receive inspiration. When I wrote the training outlines by paraphrasing the Word, new light came to me at a rapid pace. To pray-read and to paraphrase the Word are the best ways to receive inspiration.</P><P>In the Old Testament the practice of meditating on the Word is mentioned a number of times (Josh. 1:8; Psa. 1:2; 119:15, 23, 48, 78, 97, 99, 148), but in the New Testament there is no reference to meditating on the Scriptures in the Old Testament way. The Old Testament saints did not have the indwelling Spirit; thus, they had to meditate on the written Word. But today we not only have the Bible in our hands outwardly, but we also have the indwelling Spirit within us. When we pray-read the Word, we exercise our spirit, and the indwelling Spirit is stirred up by our pray-reading. The same thing takes place when we paraphrase the Word. In contrast, if we sit down to meditate on the Word, in not too long we may become sleepy. To meditate "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God" is altogether an exercising of the mind. But when we say, "In the beginning. Oh Lord, in the beginning was the Word. Amen. The Word. Hallelujah, the Word!" this stirs up our spirit. Then the indwelling Spirit leaps within us, and the inspirations come.</P><P>It is good always to keep a small notebook in which to write the inspirations we receive. We should write something immediately after receiving an inspiration, even writing only one crucial word to use as a reminder when we do not have time to write more. After that, for our practicing of prophesying, it is good to compose a prophecy of no longer than three minutes from the inspirations we have received. If our prophecy is longer than three minutes, we can shorten it. If it is too short, we can insert something. We can even work together with other saints to practice and to learn.</P><P>When Mary, the mother of the Lord, came to see Elizabeth, her relative, both of them prophesied (Luke 1:39-55). Mary's prophecy was a composition of short quotations from the Old Testament. This proves that Mary was very familiar with the history, the wording, and the points in the Old Testament. Her speaking did not result from an instant "inspiration" but issued from an accumulation of the word that had been stored in her being. If we have such an accumulation of the word, while we are speaking, all that we have stored within us can come up within our being to meet our need.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. By Praying the Message You Write<br>for Prophesying</H2><P>We also need to practice by praying the messages we write for prophesying. After we write a message for prophesying, we need to pray-read our writing. By doing this, it will become constituted into our being. Then, we should go to the meeting and prophesy. I have the assurance that such a prophesying will be very good.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. By Seeking the Infilling<br>and the Outpouring of the Spirit</H2><P>Finally, we all need to seek the infilling of the Spirit and the outpouring of the Spirit upon us as power from on high to be our impact (Acts 6:10; 7:55; 4:31). For this we must pray. Even while we are in the meetings, on the one hand we are listening to others, and on the other hand we should pray to get ourselves filled with the Spirit and to have the outpouring of the Spirit upon us to be our power and authority.</P><P>In this message I have passed on to you the way that I have learned. I hope that in your homes you all can practice at least once a week according to these few points. If you will do this, I believe that your speaking will be even better than mine. Then we will see that all the riches stored in the saints will come out.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CARING FOR THE PRESENT NEED<br>IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 12:22-25; 14:26</H1><P>First Corinthians 12:22-25 tells us that every believer, every member of the Body, is needed. We have been greatly influenced by Christianity to think that among all the saints, only a few are useful and have some capacity to serve the Lord. I believe that this kind of psychology still remains among us. At times we might have considered the saints and concluded that most were not useful or capable. This is the reason that the majority in Christianity have accepted the concept that not all Christians can serve God. Thus, most Christian groups select only a small group of believers and send them to a seminary to become educated according to their theology. Then they build these up as a system, the so-called clerical system, which has become a hierarchy in Christianity. This kind of psychology, this kind of thought, is the very source of hierarchy.</P><P>However, in 1 Corinthians 12 God gives more honor to the weak members of the Body (vv. 23-24). Verse 23 says that God adorns the uncomely ones with more abundant comeliness to beautify them. Since 1984 I have been burdened by the Lord to adorn the weaker members of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED OF THE LORD'S MOVE IN RUSSIA</H2><P>In Moscow, after five weeks of gospel conferences, we baptized approximately two thousand new believers. Then, in April 1992, after five weeks of conferences in St. Petersburg, we baptized more than five thousand. By the end of 1992 we may baptize more than ten thousand Russians. In contrast, in the United States, if we are able to get one person saved and baptized and brought into the church life, we become very excited. After thirty years of my ministry in the United States, the number of saints in the local churches throughout the United States is approximately fifteen thousand. With the exception of Taiwan, this is better than in other places. In Germany the work of the Lord's recovery began in 1971. After twenty years we were able to bring less than one thousand saints into the recovery in Europe. At the present time, the number in the recovery in Europe is only a few hundred. The situation is the same throughout the denominations of Christianity. The denominational leaders today do not know how to go on. Their membership has not increased but instead has decreased in the past thirty years.</P><P>In the Lord's recovery we are taking the narrow way (Matt. 7:13-14). Hence, we should not expect to gain large numbers of people. However, in Russia something different is taking place. Before April 1991 we had no thought concerning the Lord's interest in Russia. Even after we received the leading of the Lord to go to Russia, we had no thought that we could baptize more than seven thousand people in less than six months. In 1974 the church life spread to Orange County in Southern California. For the past eighteen years it has been difficult to gain an adequate increase, especially among the Caucasians. Today the United States is in an unhealthy condition in relation to the Lord's interest.</P><P>Since the changing of the political situation in Russia, a number of Christian and non-Christian groups have gone to Russia to attempt to gain the Russian people. However, it appears that none of these groups has the capacity to raise up the church life there. Our work in Russia surpasses that of any other group because our work is particular. Our work is not merely to hold conferences; it is to set up churches. In two cities, Moscow and St. Petersburg, our work has resulted in the raising up of churches. In both cities we have thirty full-time serving ones laboring to visit people, to feed people, to nourish people, and to perfect people. No other group would do this; they all still employ the old way of one preacher taking care of one congregation.</P><P>Russia is a country of more than three hundred million people. Because of the current situation there under the Lord's sovereignty, whenever we have advertised that we are holding meetings to teach the Bible and preach God and Christ, hundreds and even thousands of people have come. When they come, eighty to ninety percent in each meeting stand up to pray to receive the Lord Jesus. However, in the United States, after thirty years of labor, our number is still comparatively small. In view of these facts, why would we not go to Russia and labor there?</P><P>Brother Nee once said that the work of the Lord should "follow the rain." Where the rain is, there we should go to sow. Compared to Russia, the United States today is like a desert. In relation to the Lord's interest, the entire United States is sleeping, is dormant, in the night. Perhaps after ten years thousands of Russians may come to the United States to re-evangelize this country. The Lord will not tolerate the present situation; He has a way to do something. If we expect that eventually the Russians will come to the United States, we who are in the United States should go there first to light the fire.</P><P>In Moscow we recently held a conference with more than one hundred twenty college students. The promise, the hope, of the Lord's recovery in Russia is not with the older people but with the college students. Today the college students in Russia are under twenty-one. It may be that after ten years they will be prepared to come to the United States to re-evangelize this country. Therefore, I fully agree that we should go to the campuses to gain the Russian students.</P><P>We cannot give up the United States, because the United States is the base of the Lord's move in His recovery. However, I would propose that some of the brothers from America go, perhaps in a three-month rotation, to join the work in Russia. Whoever would go there would surely be stirred up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BECOMING USEFUL BY BEING IN THE RIGHT PLACE</H2><P>Some of the sisters may say, "I am only a small sister; I am not so useful." However, 1 Corinthians 12:24 says that God has given more abundant honor to the weak ones. In the United States some of the saints may feel that they are not very useful. However, if these saints would go to Russia, they would be very useful. I would like to see forty more go to Russia by the end of 1992. This will make the total number of those laboring in Russia approximately one hundred. Then, next year we will need even more to go to meet the great need there.</P><P>All the saints are very useful in the gospel preaching. The thought that you are not useful is a lie. However, it may seem that you are not useful, because you may be in the wrong place with the wrong concept. In Russia there is a great need for brothers and sisters who can go to visit people and speak to them about Jesus. Many of the saints in the recovery have a good deposit of the Lord's word. They have been sitting under the ministry for many years, listening to the messages on the books of the New Testament and the Old Testament. If you remain with a wrong concept in a wrong place, you may feel that you are not useful, but if you go to the right place, a place where the people need you, you will be very useful.</P><P>For many years mainland China was closed to Taiwan, but in recent years mainland China has been opened to Taiwan. In response to this, hundreds of saints from the churches in Taiwan have gone to mainland China. Many of these were "useless" in Taiwan. But everyone who went to China became useful. One brother baptized several hundred people in one city. When he left to take the plane back to Taiwan, the mayor of the city came out to send him off. That brother was "useless" in Taiwan, but when he went to mainland China, he became very useful.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BECOMING USEFUL BY<br>PREACHING THE GOSPEL REGULARLY<br>AND CARING FOR THE NEW BELIEVERS</H2><P>If you desire to be useful, you first must learn to function, and your functioning must be of four steps. First, you must be regular in preaching the gospel. You must go out to contact people. You need to consider and pray concerning whom you should contact. No one of us can say that he or she has no acquaintances. We all have some friends, classmates, colleagues, neighbors, and relatives. Why would we not go to them? Why do we not preach the gospel to them? We should not preach the gospel occasionally, but regularly, with a burden.</P><P>In preaching the gospel, we should not expect to have a quick result as in Russia. The result in Russia is extraordinary. But we must believe that with regular, constant, year-round labor, we can gain one or two every year. However, I have noticed that nearly all the saints who have practiced the gospel preaching according to the new way have become disappointed because they went out regularly for six months with no result. Because of this, they gave up. This is wrong. We should not give up; rather, we should continue to go out to contact people with the gospel. If for a number of months there is no result, we should still go. Even after one year without any result, we should still go. Within two years I am quite sure that we can gain one. To gain one person in two years is not too little. If all the saints do this, the church will have a yearly increase of fifty percent. However, we do not do it, because we like to see a quick result. We like to eat "fast food"; but "fast food" is often unhealthy.</P><P>After we get one saved, we need to consider him our spiritual babe, our spiritual child, and we should consider ourselves his nursing mother. We need to nourish and care for him, not merely for one month but even for as long as three or four years. If we do this, we will be able to bring people in, and we will keep people. We will gain the remaining fruit because we care for them as our spiritual infants. We need to show love to them and help them, just as we help ourselves. If we do this, we will have a success.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRESENT CONDITION OF THE UNITED STATES</H2><P>From my youth I loved the United States, but all I knew of that country was by hearing others speak of it. All the things I heard were very positive. Then I came to this country. I have been here for more than thirty years. In the beginning, wherever I went my ministry was very warmly welcomed. Nearly all the places I visited were inhabited mainly by Caucasians, and a good number of them were brought into the recovery. But later on, I found out that Americans are seeking too much for pleasure, amusement, and entertainment.</P><P>My first visit to the United States was in 1958. At that time a number of brothers came to me and expressed their concern for the United States. They were concerned that this country would fall just as the Roman Empire fell, because of its decadent and luxuriant living. However, I told these brothers that this would not happen, because from the beginning all the worldly powers were invaders, invading others' countries to rob their people and take their riches. There has been only one country in all of human history that did not rob others. That country is the United States.</P><P>The United States has the resources, and all these resources have been developed. The entire country has been built up. The United States has the territory, the resources, and a people who have been educated in high technology. It is difficult for such a country to collapse. Nevertheless, I must say that, according to my observation, the moral situation in this country is definitely declining. Although I believe that the United States is the country that the Lord raised up for His recovery, the present situation of immorality in this country concerns me very much.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>KNOWING THE LORD'S MIND AND HIS WAY TODAY</H2><P>Even though we may have the financial support, we do not have enough people to send to Russia. If we could now send twenty thousand, in a very short time we could have more than one thousand churches raised up in the cities of Russia, with each city having twenty serving ones. Everywhere among the three hundred million Russians, the people are ready. They have a desire to know God and the Bible, and they are very open to Americans. But we do not have a sufficient number of people to go. The denominations have a much larger number, but not many would go, because to go involves paying a price.</P><P>I believe that the recent political change in Russia was something of the Lord. No human being could have caused such a thing to happen. Since this was of the Lord, we need to consider what the Lord's mind and the Lord's way are. Perhaps the Lord's way is to gain the Russians who are open and train them for ten years and then send them back to the United States to re-evangelize this country. We surely need to pray over and consider all these matters before the Lord.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ELEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TAKING THE DEFINITE STEPS<br>OF THE PRACTICING AND LEARNING<br>OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Col. 1:28-29; 1 Cor. 15:58</H1><P>We all need to learn to take the definite steps of the practicing and learning of the God-ordained way. Since October 1984 I have spoken message after message concerning the God-ordained way. However, to my realization very few have practiced this way in definite steps. I do hope that from now on, when you listen to the messages concerning the God-ordained way, you will make a definite decision to take the definite steps to practice this way.</P><P>As I have mentioned in previous messages, there are four steps in the way that God ordained according to the entire New Testament. The first step is to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:9). The priesthood in the Old Testament was not a priesthood of gospel preaching, but a priesthood of offering the sacrifices. Every day the priests did one thing: they offered the sacrifices. This was the priesthood in the Old Testament. For years I wondered what the New Testament priesthood is and what the New Testament priests do. I was told that the function of the New Testament priests is to offer praises to God. However, I was not satisfied with this kind of answer. Recently, I found out that in Romans 15:16 Paul said that he was a laboring (energizing) priest of the gospel of God. It seems that this contradicts the priesthood of the Old Testament, but actually it does not; rather, it corresponds with the priesthood in the Old Testament.</P><P>Most Christians consider the preaching of the gospel as soul-winning. Although this is not wrong, it is not the real significance of gospel preaching. In the Old Testament priesthood the priests got cattle from the herd and sheep from the flock in order to offer them to God. Likewise, the goal of our preaching of the gospel is to get some saved sinners as "cattle" that can become our offering. Paul offered the Gentile "cattle" to God. All the Gentiles gained by Paul through his preaching of the gospel became saved and regenerated sinners as members of Christ. Paul offered these members of Christ as his offerings to God (Rom. 15:16).</P><P>All the sacrifices and offerings in the Old Testament are types of Christ. Thus, in God's eyes the Old Testament priests Offered Christ to God. Today we, the New Testament priests, also offer Christ to God by offering saved sinners as members of Christ. Eventually, what we offer to God are the members of the corporate Christ. The Old Testament saints offered the individual Christ, typified by all the animal sacrifices. Abel was accepted by God because he offered Christ, in type, to God. Cain was rejected by God because he did not offer Christ to God; rather, he offered his own work, typified by the fruit of the ground (Gen. 4:1-5). Today we offer the corporate Christ; we offer the members of Christ, the parts of Christ, to God. This is the New Testament priesthood. If we do not go forth to gain people, we will have no "cattle" for our offering. As long as we are regenerated, we are New Testament priests. The main thing the New Testament priests must do is to offer to God the parts of Christ, the members of Christ, that is, the sinners who have been saved and have become members of Christ.</P><P>Throughout the past seven years I have been bothered by the fact that all the saints have welcomed my messages concerning the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, and they have also prayed concerning this matter, but who has practiced the New Testament priesthood of the gospel? Beginning from the day of Pentecost, every day new members were added to the church (Acts 2:47b). However, among us there may be a period of a month or longer when no newly saved ones are baptized. The Lord told Peter that He would make him a fisher of men (Matt. 4:19). That means that Peter had to go and "fish" for men.</P><P>One day the Lord bothered Peter because Peter said something wrong concerning the Lord's person, concerning His paying of the tax for the temple (Matt. 17:24-27). When asked whether the Lord paid the temple tax, Peter said yes. After pointing out to Peter that, as the Son of God, He did not need to pay the temple tax, the Lord charged Peter to go to the sea and cast a hook and take the first fish that came up. When he opened the fish's mouth, Peter would find a stater, equal to one shekel. He was to take that stater and give it to the temple tax gatherer, half for Peter and half for the Lord. Eventually, Peter did as the Lord told him. If we do not go to the seashore and throw out our hook, we will not catch any fish. I have been watching over the situation in the churches, and I have observed that many of the saints do not go out to the "water" to catch "fish." In the prayer meeting there is much prayer for the gospel preaching and the fruit-bearing, but the saints do not go out. If we mean business to practice the God-ordained way by taking definite steps, at least one-third of the church should go out weekly to contact people for the gospel.</P><P>On the Lord's Day the church in Taipei has over one hundred district meetings, with more than five thousand attendants. They heard my messages for years, but they did not take action. Until about two or three years ago they did not take the definite step to go out for the practice of the New Testament gospel priesthood. One brother was touched by the Lord, and he considered that the situation in Taipei was not right. He became burdened for this matter, and he told the church in Taipei that one-third of the present Lord's Day morning attendants should practice the priesthood of the gospel of the New Testament. As a result of his speaking, one-third, or more than seventeen hundred saints, were stirred up to practice the going out. This is an example of taking a definite step to go out to contact people for the gospel.</P><P>When he was young, D. L. Moody, the founder of Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, made a decision before the Lord that he would contact at least one person daily for the gospel. One day he forgot to do this. Late in the night he remembered that he had not contacted anyone that day. Then he made the decision that he had to fulfill his duty. So he went out in the night to contact one person. Of course, it was not proper for him to knock on others' doors at midnight. The only person he saw was a policeman. He went to him and told him that he needed to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. The policeman scolded him and told him to go away. But the next day the policeman began to wonder why a man would come to him at midnight. Later, the policeman found Moody, and eventually he was saved. This is another example of the practice of the New Testament gospel priesthood.</P><P>The second step in the practice of the God-ordained way is to feed, to nourish, the spiritual children (John 21:15). In Song of Songs 1:7 the seeking one asked the Lord where He fed His flock. The Lord's answer was that if she did not know, she should follow the footsteps of the flock and feed her kids beside the shepherds' tents (v. 8). Here the shepherds' tents signify the church. We should not simply seek the Lord by ourselves; as we pursue the Lord, we should bring our "kids," our spiritual children, with us. We should be spiritual nursing mothers with two or three spiritual infants (1 Thes. 2:7).</P><P>As a seeker of the Lord, we must have some spiritual kids who need our feeding. When we come to the Lord's table meeting, we should have one kid on our right and another on our left. How wonderful it would be if we would bring at least two kids to the meeting to feed them. Such feeding is the nourishing and the cherishing (Eph. 5:29). This kind of feeding can best be carried out through the word (1 Pet. 2:2) in meetings held in the new believers' homes.</P><P>After baptizing a new one, you can tell him that two days later, in the evening, you will come to his home to have a home meeting with just him and his family. It is better to take such a step not by yourself alone. The Lord's way is to send His disciples two by two (Luke 10:1; Acts 13:1-3). Thus, it is better for you to go to that home meeting with a companion. You should not wait to begin the meeting after you enter through the door. Even while you are knocking on the door, you can sing. Those inside may hear your singing and open the door. That will be the beginning of the home meeting. Although I have been speaking on this matter for quite some time, not many of the saints have practiced this. This is why I say that we must take a definite step in practicing the God-ordained way. We cannot practice all the steps at one time. It is better to take just one definite step.</P><P>Then, third, after one has been saved and nourished for several months, he surely will have a certain amount of growth in life. At that time he will have entered into another stage, a stage in which he can be perfected. The perfecting of the saints takes place in group meetings (Heb. 10:24-25). For the group meetings, we can group together a number of the saints who have grown in life by being nourished. This should not be something done officially and formally by the church. This kind of grouping of the saints does not work well. To group the saints together in a spontaneous way is another definite step in the practice of the God-ordained way.</P><P>The last definite step in the practice of the God-ordained way is to prophesy. Some of the saints may not have the burden to take up the step of offering the saved sinners as members of Christ, or the step of feeding the young believers, or the step of taking care of the grouping of the grown saints, but they may have a burden to practice prophesying. Those who have such a burden should dive into this matter, learn it, and investigate it day and night. Before giving a message, I often consider how to give the message for two or three days, morning and evening, before writing the message outline. Some of the saints need to dive into and become soaked with the matter of prophesying, leaving the other steps of the God-ordained way to others. They need to pick up the definite step of studying, improving, and carrying out one thing, that is, to prophesy in the Lord's Day morning meeting. Some of the young people need to take the lead to set up a model, an example, of how to prophesy in the church.</P><P>The elders, especially, should take a definite step in the practice of the God-ordained way. One elder should set up a pattern to be a gospel preaching priest. Such an elder must still take the responsibility of caring for the affairs of the church, but he should have the attitude that he cannot sleep well or eat well or even pray well unless he contacts sinners. Everywhere in America there are "ponds" full of "fish." Every city in America is a fishing pond. Therefore, it is certainly wrong to say that in the United States there are no people to whom we can preach the gospel. Everywhere there are fish. In carrying out the gospel priesthood, we should not do anything in a formal way. We must do something in a desperate way; then we will see the result.</P><P>To get people saved, you must have "thick skin"; that is, while you are preaching the gospel, you must have no sense of shame. When people reject you, you need to say, "Thank you. Good-bye. Perhaps I will see you next week." One day Brother Nee told us publicly that if we did not have thick skin, we were finished in the matter of gospel preaching. If we are going to preach the gospel, we must not be shy. Some saints were born shy, but they need to learn to have a thick face. In China, Peace Wong was such a person. I was saved through her preaching. I was twenty years old at the time, and she was about twenty-five. Although she was naturally a shy person, when she stood on the platform before a thousand people, she had the power and the boldness. When she spoke to people, regardless of their social status, she spoke with boldness.</P><P>Some of the elders should take a definite step to feed the new believers. Often those who are very good in carrying out the first step of the God-ordained way, the step of gospel preaching, are not suitable for the second step, the step of feeding the new believers. They have the interest to get people saved, but they are not qualified to nourish the new ones. To take the second step, you must have a genuine love and concern for people. A good mother knows how to cherish her children. To cherish children is to make the children happy. When a child is naughty and will not eat, a mother should do something to make the child happy. Then he will be willing to eat. If we do not know how to make a new believer feel comfortable and happy, we will not be able to feed him. To nourish and cherish people, we must have patience, we must have love, and we must give them whatever we want to give ourselves. If we are not able to give people what we want to give ourselves, we are not qualified to nourish the new ones. If you have a good Bible in your hand and you are feeding a new one, and the new one sees the Bible and says, "This is a good Bible," you should be able to say, "This Bible is yours." This is the way to feed the new ones.</P><P>Some of the elders should also take a definite step to practice the group meetings. The most difficult among the four steps of the God-ordained way is to group people together. When we practice this step we will find that there are many things that we must do. We may need to be a medical doctor, a teacher, a carpenter, and even a shoe repairman. In the groups we will find many people with different needs. Thus, the members of our group will need our care in many different ways.</P><P>Finally, some of the elders should take a definite step to practice prophesying. Concerning the way to practice this step, I hope that all the saints will apply the principles in the messages given earlier in this series.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. TO BRING THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY ON ITS TRACK</H2><P>Although I have been speaking on the God-ordained way for seven and a half years, the "train" of the God-ordained way is still not on the track. In order to bring the God-ordained way on its track, we need to be those who take the definite steps of the practicing and learning of the God-ordained way, practicing each step one by one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Not by Promoting</H2><P>The way to bring the God-ordained way on its track is not by promoting. In our practicing and learning of the God-ordained way, we should not promote anything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Not by the Church's Arranging</H2><P>The way to bring the God-ordained way on its track is also not by the church's arranging. The church's arranging kills rather than enlivens. Hence, I advise the elders not to arrange anything. The church's arranging may seem to be a benefit, but it will not work for the long run.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Not by Big Meetings</H2><P>The way to bring the God-ordained way on its track is also not by big meetings. The elders should not call a meeting to give a lecture or a message to the audience. That does not work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. But by Individuals with Small Groupings</H2><P>The way to bring the God-ordained way on its track is by individuals with small groupings. The elders should take the lead and set up a pattern. They should be the head sheep in the flock. When the few head sheep take a certain way, all the flock follows. Likewise, when the head sheep stop, all the flock stops. In the practicing of the God-ordained way, there is a need to have the head sheep.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. TO BEGIN BY PRACTICING ONE STEP ONLY</H2><P>The way to bring the God-ordained way on its track is to begin by practicing one step only. We are not able to take more than one step at a time. We cannot take the four steps all at once. This is impossible. Thus, we should limit ourselves to just one step.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. To Dive into It</H2><P>The way to practice one step of the God-ordained way is to dive into it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. To Find Out and Learn the Secrets</H2><P>In practicing any step of the God-ordained way, we need to find out and learn the secrets. Two people may drive the same car, but each has his own secrets concerning his driving. Everyone who drives a car has his own secrets in handling the car. The secrets can be found only by more practice. Some people enjoy driving; to them, driving is like a hobby. Thus, if they encounter difficulties in their driving, they are not bothered or troubled. Nothing related to their driving is a problem to them, because they have learned the secrets of driving. In the practicing of the steps of the God-ordained way, we need to find out and learn the secrets.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Not Caring for Problems, Hardships,<br>and Frustrations</H2><P>In our practicing and learning of the God-ordained way, we should not care for problems, hardships, and frustrations. If we would begin to practice one step of the God-ordained way, after a short time we may encounter a number of problems. However, if we care for these problems, we are finished. In doing anything we should not care for problems. If there is a will, there is a way. If this is our attitude, we will succeed. The more we care for problems, the more problems we will have. However, if nothing is a problem, a hardship, or a frustration to us, we will get through; we will have a way. We need to learn to believe this. This means that we are trusting the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. With Faithfulness, Endeavoring, Patience, Endurance, and Much Prayer</H2><P>In practicing the definite steps of the God-ordained way, we must do so with faithfulness, endeavoring, patience, endurance, and much prayer (Col. 1:28-29; 1 Cor. 15:58). Then we will reach our goal.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWELVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LABORING WAY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rom. 15:16; 1 Cor. 15:10, 58; Col. 1:28-29; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Acts 2:46-47; 4:24; 5:12; 6:4</H1><P>In this message I would like to speak something very practical concerning the practice of the church life according to the God-ordained way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY BEING THE LABORING WAY</H2><P>The God-ordained way is the laboring way (Col. 1:29; 1 Cor. 15:10, 58). To labor is more than to work. Without our laboring, there can be no practice of the God-ordained way. The New Testament tells us clearly that Paul was a laboring apostle. In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul said that he labored more than all the other apostles. In Colossians 1:29 Paul used a word that is even stronger than the word labored. There he said that he was struggling according to God's operation, which operated in him in power. In his use of these terms, Paul was probably alluding to the competing of athletes in the Olympic games. In every event in the Olympics, the athletes are struggling to gain the crown (1 Cor. 9:25).</P><P>In Romans 15:16 Paul said that he was a laboring priest of the gospel of God. In that verse the word laboring has the same root in Greek as the word energizing. Energy is the noun, whereas energize is the verb. There Paul said that he was energizing himself. To energize yourself is to use the last ounce of your strength. In other words, it is to pour out the last drop of your blood. It also means to exhaust yourself. In carrying out his ministry for God's economy, Paul exhausted himself. If we do anything by taking the way of laboring, struggling, and energizing ourselves, we will surely have a success.</P><P>I have participated in the Lord's work in His recovery for more than sixty years. In this work I have never suffered a defeat. I would not be defeated. I may be defeated today, but I will persevere in the same thing for another period of time.</P><P>My ministering on the God-ordained way has been like a coach's instructing of his players. At the present time there is the need for some to develop my teaching into a practical, detailed way. One of the points that I stressed repeatedly is that every local church should have one-third of its members going out in a regularly scheduled way to visit people for the gospel. In Taipei one brother picked up a burden for this matter. Within half a year he stirred up the entire church in Taipei, which has over five thousand regular attendants each Lord's Day morning. Through this stirring up, one-third of the saints began to practice the regular going out for the preaching of the gospel. That was a great help to Taipei. Now Taipei has seventeen hundred people going out regularly in a scheduled way to gain people. If they do not gain one within a year, surely they will gain one within two years. If we would go to visit people according to a regular schedule, we cannot care for our "climate." Whether we are happy or full of anxiety, whether we are victorious or defeated, we still must go. I doubt that many of us have ever practiced this way. We are all easily directed by our "climate." Just a little "rain" and we stop going. We may intend to go out to contact people, but then something may happen to stop us. We do not go, because the "weather" is not good. This causes us to change our schedule.</P><P>In my ministry concerning the God-ordained way, I also stressed very much that we need to learn how to prophesy, and we need to train the saints how to prophesy. Another brother in Taipei picked up this burden, and today the saints in his district in Taipei are excelling in the matter of prophesying.</P><P>Recently eleven full-time co-workers who had been trained in Taipei and had been sent to the countryside in Taiwan to raise up new churches were charged to return to Taipei and take care of the work among the students on the university campuses. There are more than twenty universities in Taipei, and several of these are very large. The academic standard in these universities is quite high. First, these co-workers studied and investigated to find the way to gain the young people on the campuses. They found out that the church had some young people studying in the universities already. Then, they also found out that in the summer, before the beginning of fall classes, the government held an examination for the high school graduates to determine their qualifications for entering into different kinds of universities. After that examination, all the schools announced who had been accepted. They made available a list of names with addresses. The co-workers succeeded in getting the names and addresses of the entering students, and they began to contact each one through the brothers and sisters who were students in the different schools. The brothers and sisters offered to help these incoming students in various ways. They made an appointment with them to contact them when they arrived at the universities and to help them with the various matters related to their getting settled. This was a very good beginning.</P><P>Then, second, they convinced them to stay not in the school dormitories but in the brothers' and sisters' houses. Taipei has almost sixty brothers' and sisters' houses, with nearly four hundred college-age young people living in those houses. A considerable effort is required to convince the new ones to stay in those houses. Their parents also must be convinced that our intention is positive. Later, after their children have stayed in the brothers' and sisters' houses for three or four months, the parents observe a change in the lives of their children. Because of this, the parents are no longer apprehensive about their children; rather, they appreciate their living in the brothers' and sisters' houses.</P><P>Third, the eleven co-workers, along with some mature ones in the Lord, work on the new ones every day from 6:30 in the morning to help them to practice the morning revival. Throughout the day they prepare many things and do many things for the new ones. They help the new ones to schedule their time. Finally, every evening before going to bed they have an evening prayer time, along with some fellowship concerning the truth. Twice a week this prayer and fellowship time lasts one hour. In that hour the co-workers train the students how to compose a prophecy from the morning revival points. The students are also assigned a spiritual book to read. During the evening time they come together and fellowship concerning what they gained from that book. They do this every week, week after week. The co-workers also share with the students concerning how to be a priest of the gospel by contacting people and preaching the gospel to them. The students also meet in groups with different families in the church. Although the meetings are in the saints' homes, they are carried out mainly by the students. Because they are so burdened for their group meetings, once a week the students fast and pray for the new ones in the group. The full-timers in Taipei have been successful mainly because they have transferred the burden of the work to the students. The students themselves have picked up the burden, but they are under the perfecting of the full-timers. Eventually, when these students graduate, a number of them will be ready for the full-time training.</P><P>All of us who are now in the recovery should pick up a burden to practice certain steps of the God-ordained way. In order to have a definite beginning in the practice of the God-ordained way, each one should pick up a particular item as a particular burden. The first step is to get people saved to become members of the Lord's Body. We must study this matter and get into it, and we also need to cooperate with others. We also need to pick up the further item of feeding and cherishing the new ones. This will require much learning. We should not consider this as something common. Merely visiting the new ones, speaking to them concerning the Lord, and teaching them some portions of the Bible are too common and too natural. We must study the situation and find the proper and particular way to carry out our burden.</P><P>We should endeavor to practice the group meetings with no formality, no religious service, and no religious worship. We should meet together simply as believers in Christ coming together to fellowship, making everything so natural. However, we also need to practice the main points of a group meeting. The main thing is to carry out the mutual teaching. We do not need a teacher to come to teach us; we should teach one another. All the attendants in the group meetings have the right to ask questions mutually, and everyone has the right to answer mutually. In this way the saints' knowledge of the truth will increase every week, and they will be educated and perfected. Those who are burdened for the practice of the group meetings can come together to pray and even fast for the group meetings. They can study together and find out the secrets, and then they can go to the groups to give them some instructions and help them to practice, without doing anything to replace the other members of the group.</P><P>Those who have a burden to improve the prophesying in the church meetings must bear the burden and get others to work with them. They must study and learn the secrets. Then with what they have learned they should instruct others. They also need to pray concerning whom they should go to and fellowship with concerning prophesying. During their fellowship with others they should pass on to them their own experience. They should teach others face to face, allowing them to practice and correcting them so that they can improve. In this way our prophesying meetings will be very much uplifted. Those who are burdened for the prophesying can gather a number of brothers and sisters and come together each week to investigate how to improve the prophesying and how to teach others to prophesy. This is worthwhile.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE UNIVERSAL PRIESTHOOD OF THE GOSPEL</H2><P>As we have mentioned previously, the first item in the practice of the God-ordained way is the universal priesthood of the gospel (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9). In the Bible the priesthood is the priesthood of the gospel, and the priesthood is also universal. That the priesthood is universal means that every believer shares in the priesthood. We have no clergy, nor do we have any laymen. We have only priests. Every brother and every sister is a priest to serve God. However, because of age or physical weakness or some other circumstances, many saints are unable to go out regularly to contact sinners. So, generally speaking, at least thirty percent of the saints in a local church are able to go out for the gospel. For this the elders must work on the saints and stir them up. The elders should not merely announce that one-third of the church members should go out to preach the gospel. The elders themselves must go out. Then they should contact all the saints who have the capacity to go out. These still may not have the heart to go out, so the elders need to fan their hearts into flame. They can ask some to be their partners in preaching the gospel. There must be such a beginning among us for the gospel preaching.</P><P>After begetting the new believers through the gospel, the next step is to feed them. For this we need to learn how to warm people up by cherishing them. If we do not know how to cherish people, we could never nourish them. When a nursing mother feeds her baby, she first does something to make the baby happy. Many children are naughty and refuse to take their food, but if the mother dances with them and gives them something to play with, they will be happy; their hearts will be warmed. In such a situation, whatever the mother gives them, they will eat. Like a nursing mother (1 Thes. 2:7), we need to exercise our patience, our endurance, and our love to feed the newly saved ones. Then, after a period of time we can group the new ones with other believers for mutual teaching and perfecting, and we can also help them to practice prophesying in the Lord's Day meetings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. NEEDING WISDOM IN EVERY WAY</H2><P>The practice of the God-ordained way requires wisdom in every way. As we have pointed out, in Colossians 1:28-29 Paul told us that he labored, struggling according to God's operation in all wisdom, to present every man to God full-grown in Christ. That indicates that to bring one sinner to God perfected in Christ is not a simple thing. For this we need to labor and struggle, not foolishly but with the exercise of all wisdom.</P><P>Wisdom is needed to find out the secrets in every step of the God-ordained way. For this we need to study. A number of saints can spend time to come together to study the situation and the need and to find out the secrets. They can practice, and then they can go to teach others and help others to practice. It is not wise to promote or to merely make a general announcement. What is needed is a definite step with a definite, wise beginning.</P><P>In contacting people, we need to exercise wisdom in every way. We need wisdom to discern whether we should speak to them quickly or slowly, or whether we should be stern or mild in our tone. We need to learn by studying every detail. None of us can do this by ourselves. We need two or three to help us by correcting us, adjusting us, and balancing us. Otherwise, without others' correcting, adjusting, and balancing, we may be laboring in vain.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. NEEDING COORDINATION WITH ONE ACCORD</H2><P>To carry out any step of the God-ordained way, there is a need for coordination with one accord (Acts 2:46-47; 4:24; 5:12). If a group of saints are coordinating together, they all must be one. When they lose the one accord, they also lose the impact. We do not need to stress the power of the Holy Spirit. Instead, we should pay attention to the coordination with one accord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. NEEDING MUCH PRAYER</H2><P>Finally, the practice of the God-ordained way in its definite steps needs much prayer (Acts 6:4). To pray is not only to entreat the Lord to do things for us but also to cause our spirit to be exercised and strengthened. Hence, prayer should precede every step in our practice of the God-ordained way. Without such prayer our practice will not be enlivened and empowered.</P><P>I would encourage and even entreat all the saints to pick up one item of the four steps of the God-ordained way and to practice it with others in a definite and specific way according to what has been presented in this message.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>BEGETTING, NOURISHING,<br>PERFECTING, AND PROPHESYING<br>TO BUILD UP THE DIVINE ORGANISM,<br>THE BODY OF CHRIST</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S DESIRE TO HAVE AN ORGANISM VERSUS<br>MAN'S DESIRE TO HAVE A RELIGION</H2><P>The Bible reveals that God's intention is to produce an organism for Himself. An organism is an entity that is living. Christ is the embodiment of God, and this God needs a living organism. This organism is the Body of Christ, which is also called the new man (Eph. 2:14-16).</P><P>However, another entity has existed on this earth for nearly two thousand years, an entity that is called Christianity. Christianity cares for a religion, an "anity"; it does not care for God's organism. Within every human being there is a seeking after God. In every man created by God there is something hidden, that is, the desire to seek God. If we contact people in society, we will find that a great number of people like to have a good religion for them to rest on. They realize that to be a proper human being man needs a religion. Without religion man is lacking something. Religion is something on which man can rest. If man does not have a religion, he has nothing on which to rest. Thus, on the one hand, man has a heart to seek after God; on the other hand, man has a need for something that can be called religion. Today's Christianity seemingly meets this need within man because it preaches God, whom human beings are seeking, and it preaches Christ as the Savior, who can be relied on as man's rest. According to the teaching of Christianity, if a person has some trouble, he has Someone, a Savior, to whom he can go. Furthermore, he has a place, a "church" or a cathedral with a good teacher and a good choir, in which he can rest.</P><P>At the time of their wedding a number of young couples do not care for religion. However, after living together for two or three years, they both realize that they need a religion. Hence, they consider joining a proper religion. Many of these couples are knowledgeable and highly educated. After comparing the different religions, many choose Christianity. Fairly speaking, Christianity is the top religion. After talking among themselves, many couples choose to go to an attractive "church" or cathedral where there is an interesting pastor, a good choir, and pleasant people as a congregation. It is easy to attract people into such a religion, especially in a wealthy and highly developed country like the United States. However, I would like to impress you with the fact that this is altogether against the Bible. Even the way those in Christianity preach God and Christ is far off from the Bible. The focus of the Bible is to gain an organism for God, that is, to gain a Body for Christ.</P><P>Every believer is a member not of a club, a society, or a religion, but of Christ's Body. The membership of the believers in the Body is not like the membership in an organization. Every member of the Body of Christ has the life of Christ, which is the life of the Triune God. Our membership in the Body is in this life; as long as we have this life, we are members of the Body.</P><P>Christianity has misled people into having a kind of religious life. Furthermore, it has annulled all the members of Christ, making them nearly not members of Christ but members of the religious organization. From the beginning we have never done that kind of work. For this reason, we anticipated that our work would be difficult. To make a mechanical man out of wood or steel is relatively easy, but to produce a member of Christ is not easy. What we speak is altogether heavenly; it is altogether foreign to human thought. Because of this, it is difficult to contact unbelievers. If we go to them to speak with them according to the heavenly view, they may think that this is something foreign. They may think that since they do not understand it, they do not need it, and therefore they may have no interest in what we speak.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BIBLICAL WAY TO GAIN PEOPLE FOR CHRIST</H2><P>The best way to gain people for Christ is the biblical way. The biblical way is, first, to pray for people (1 Tim. 2:1-4). Second, it is to get the proper word in the Bible digested into our being so that we can use what we have digested of the Word to cherish and to nourish others (1 Tim. 4:6; 2 Tim. 3:15-17). Third, we ourselves must be persons living on this earth with no other interest but Christ with His Body. Our interest on this earth must be simply to live Christ with His church (Phil. 1:21; 3:8; 2:20-21). Of course, we need to make a living, get married, and have children, but all these are not our main interests. Our main interest is in Christ and the church. This is not just our work or our conduct; this is our life and this is our living. We need to be such a person.</P><P>Once we possess these three qualifications, we must know that we need to bear fruit (John 15:1-8, 16); we need to produce some members for Christ. Every day we need to pray for the people around us, including our relatives, our in-laws, our schoolmates, and our neighbors. Then we should digest the Word within us to become a person filled and even constituted with the holy Word. If we are such persons, we will gain the proper persons, and we will bring them directly to Christ. Furthermore, it will be easy for us to bring such people on with the Lord. Those who are seeking for God, yet merely in a natural, human way, and those who like to have a religion will not come to us. In society, among so many people, everyone has his own taste. We should not spend our time on those who are seeking for a religion so that they can have some rest. It is difficult to bring such people to seek after Christ. Something in their natural being prefers to have religion.</P><P>It is God who created us. I believe that I was created by God to be what I am. I am a person who desires to sacrifice everything for Christ. I was made that way by God. I love the Bible. In knowing the Bible I have a very good memory. It seems that I could never forget the Bible. Quite often I may forget a name, but it is difficult for me to forget one verse of the Bible. I believe that I was made in such a way by God.</P><P>When I was a young man I was very fond of playing soccer. One day after I was saved, all of a sudden I repented, thinking that I should not play soccer any longer. This took place sometime after I heard the gospel. On the day that I heard the gospel, I was caught by the Lord. The gospel message I heard on that day concerned the children of Israel's being usurped by Pharaoh, who was a type of Satan. I responded to that word, saying to myself that I would not be usurped by Satan. We who have believed in the Lord Jesus did not do so because we ourselves are capable of believing. We were created that way by God. Before we were born, God chose us (Eph. 1:4; 1 Pet. 1:1-2). God created us in such a way that we feel happy to be what we are today. If you were to give me the entire world, making me a king, I would not take it. This was my prayer that afternoon when I got saved. When I walked out from that meeting, I stopped on the way home and prayed, "Lord, even if I could possess the whole earth and be a king, I would not want this. I want to follow Jesus. I would be willing to carry a Bible and travel through the villages to preach the gospel." Today I am still the same.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OVERCOMING BY BEGETTING, NOURISHING, PERFECTING, AND PROPHESYING</H2><P>We need to realize that the Lord's recovery today is absolutely different from Christianity. To be an overcomer, we must overcome three "isms"&#151;Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism. In Revelation 2 these three "isms" are represented by the teaching of Balaam, the teaching of the Nicolaitans, and the teaching of Jezebel (vv. 14-15, 20). We must overcome these three kinds of teachings. Revelation 2 and 3 do not say that we must overcome sin, our temper, or the love of money. These things are mentioned in other books, but not in Revelation 2 and 3. The satanic chaos that we must overcome has arisen from these three sources&#151;Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism. These three sources as three "isms" have captured a great number of people and have usurped and spoiled God's chosen ones.</P><P>In the Lord's recovery the first thing that must be recovered is Christ with His Body. The second thing to be recovered is the function of every member of Christ's Body (Rom. 12:4-8; 1 Cor. 12:12-22; Eph. 4:11-12, 16). The God-ordained way is to recover the function of every member of the Body of Christ. Although those in Christianity preach Christ and teach people concerning Christ, they do so in a very shallow way. They have the term church, but they do not have the reality of the Body of Christ. Thus, the first item of the Lord's recovery today is to recover Christ with His Body, and the second item is to recover the function of every member. In the recovery we desire to see all the dear saints become living and functioning members of the Body. When we function we cannot get away from these four things: begetting, nourishing, perfecting, and prophesying. This is why I would like to see every college graduate spend at least one or two years to be trained to function and to be a living member of Christ. Then, if they get a job to make a living in order to maintain a family, that should not be their primary interest. Their interest should be Christ and His Body. If they live such a life and are such a person, every day they will be involved with these four things: begetting, nourishing, perfecting, and prophesying. To do these things is to proclaim the word. In 2 Timothy 4:1-2a Paul said to Timothy, "I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom: Proclaim the word; be ready in season and out of season." To do this is to live a life that is Christ for the church.</P><P>When the Lord Jesus comes back, the first thing He will check with us is concerning how we lived our life. I do not believe that He will be concerned mainly with our overcoming various negative things. The Lord Jesus may ask us, "What kind of life did you live? How many members have you begotten for Me? How many members in My Body have been nourished by you? How many members in My Body have been perfected by you? To what extent has My Body been built up through your prophesying?" I am very concerned that many of the saints may not be approved at the Lord's judgment seat. I do not believe that the number of overcomers will be large. We all need to see that one day we will stand before Him to answer these four questions. Thus, we must endeavor to get into these four things: begetting, nourishing, perfecting, and prophesying. This is vital. These four things are crucial.</P><P>We suffer defeats in our Christian life because we do not live this kind of life. If we live such a life, we will be fully occupied with begetting, nourishing, perfecting, and prophesying. We will not have any time to consider anything else. After reading this message, I hope that many will pray, "Lord Jesus, have mercy on me and help me every day to find some way to beget someone, to feed someone, or to perfect someone, and every week to prophesy by speaking You to my fellow saints, that they all may be built up as Your organic Body." If we endeavor to get into these four things, we will have no time and no interest to care for anything else. We will be a person who is absolutely for Christ and His Body, and we will be occupied with knowing the crucial points of the Lord's word so that we can be well trained, equipped, and furnished to do these four things. Then every day and everywhere we can beget members for Christ; and every day and everywhere we can feed the newborn believers and perfect the saints; and in any kind of church meeting we will be able to prophesy. We will not need any special preparation, because we will already have been well trained, disciplined, equipped, and furnished to speak the Lord forth to others. Every day we will know only one thing: to live Christ for His Body.</P><P>Begetting, nourishing, perfecting, and prophesying are not easy; therefore, we need to learn. At times we may fast, not letting others know, for the sake of our learning. We need to be desperate with the Lord. We all have been drugged by Christianity, thinking that it is all right for us to remain the same year after year, without learning and advancing in our function as members of the Body. When the Lord comes we will all stand before Him (Rom. 14:10b). He will ask us how many we begot, how many we fed, how many we perfected, and how much we prophesied. According to Matthew 25:14-30, all the Lord's slaves who have received one, two, or five talents from Him will have to come before Him to answer to Him. We need to live Christ; we need to be genuinely for His recovery; and we need to mean business to build up the Lord's Body. If we are like this, we will surely endeavor to carry out the four crucial items of the God-ordained way. However, if we continue in our present situation, we will delay the Lord and set up a poor pattern for the new ones.</P><P>We all need to see that God wants an organism and that this organism is produced and built up through our begetting, feeding, perfecting, and prophesying.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE NEED FOR A PROPER BEGINNING<br>IN THE PRACTICE<br>OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</H1><P>Thus far we have been speaking concerning the new way, or the God-ordained way, for at least seven years, beginning from 1985. Every endeavor, if it is taken seriously, requires our proper practice. After a coach instructs his players, they eventually must practice what he has taught them. In my speaking concerning the God-ordained way, I have instructed you like a coach. I did not have the way to practice with you.</P><P>In November 1987 the church in Taipei, the largest church in the Lord's recovery, dropped the practice of one man speaking. They did not do this to carry out any proposal offered by me. The elders and the co-workers were under my instruction concerning the God-ordained way for thirty-seven months, beginning in October 1984. In my teaching I stressed the need to stop the practice of one man speaking, and the elders and co-workers in Taipei responded by making a decision to terminate that practice. I was strong in my teaching concerning this matter, saying that to have one man speaking in the church meetings is devilish. Brother Nee said that to practice one man speaking is to follow the customs of the nations (2 Kings 17:8, NASB; see Church Affairs, chapter four, published by Living Stream Ministry). The customs of the nations, that is, of the Gentiles, are all devilish. In the context of 2 Kings 17:8, the term the customs of the nations refers to the worship of idols. Verses 9-12 of that chapter say that the nations worshipped idols on every high hill and under every green tree. In Deuteronomy 12, before Israel entered the good land, Moses was charged by God to tell the children of Israel that when they entered the land, they were to tear down all the high places and were to worship only in the place chosen by God to put His name and His habitation there. Eventually, that one place became Jerusalem. Jerusalem was the place chosen by God, the place where God's name and habitation were (1 Kings 11:36; 2 Kings 23:27; 2 Chron. 6:6a). Throughout the centuries God has never allowed Israel to build the temple in any other place. If Israel could have two temples, that would mean division. Division is related to the worship of idols. On this earth wherever idolatry exists, division also exists. Today Christians worship God in many different "temples," that is, in many divisions, according to their own tastes and according to their own choice. According to Deuteronomy 12 this kind of practice is strictly forbidden by God. The children of Israel had no choice; in order to worship God, they had to go to the place chosen by God, where God's name and habitation were. This keeps the oneness of God's people. Thus, the practice of one man speaking is a condemned thing. In Church Affairs (page 81), Brother Nee said that this practice is difficult to overthrow, but he said that we all can "push against it day after day." If everyone pushes, Brother Nee said that one day we will push this practice away.</P><P>Although I was teaching these things to the church in Taipei, I did not propose to the brothers that they change their practice. Eventually, they came to me and spoke with me concerning dropping the practice of one man speaking. I told them that that was not the proper time to make such a change. Then I gave them an illustration. Suppose we are on the top floor of a five-story building, and we find out that we should instead be on the first floor. How shall we go from the fifth floor to the first floor? If we jump from the fifth floor, we will commit suicide. The proper way to go from the fifth floor to the first floor is to build a series of stairways. First, we should build a stairway from the fifth floor to the fourth floor. Then we need to build another stairway from the fourth floor to the third floor, and then from the third floor to the second floor. After reaching the second floor, we still should not jump down to the first floor. We must build another stairway from the second floor to the first floor. After building these four stairways, we can proceed safely from the fifth floor to the ground floor. After thirty-seven months the necessary "stairways" had been built in Taipei. Then in November 1987 the church in Taipei dropped the one-man-speaking meeting. Thus, they arrived safely on the ground floor.</P><P>With regard to the God-ordained way, it seems that we all have come down safely from the top floor to the bottom floor. No doubt all the faithful saints in the Lord's recovery have realized that the God-ordained way is the biblical way, and because they love the Lord, they all have the heart to take this way. However, I have been watching over the situation among the churches, but I have not yet seen an adequate beginning in the practice of the steps of the God-ordained way. To have an adequate beginning in anything requires time, energy, and the exercise of wisdom to study it. Although we have begun somewhat to practice the God-ordained way, up to the present time we have not made sufficient progress.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OVERCOMING THE THREE "ISMS" HATED BY GOD</H2><P>The Lord's recovery is for the producing of the overcomers. We should not think that to overcome is merely a matter of overcoming our temper. In Revelation 2 and 3 the overcoming of matters such as our temper is not mentioned. Revelation 2 and 3 cover the entire situation of Christianity, including Catholicism and Protestantism, and also the situation of Judaism. Throughout human history these three big "isms" have been God's real enemies. To overcome is to overcome these three "isms," which God hates to the uttermost.</P><P>God is still dealing with these three "isms." In carrying out His dealing, God is very patient. God has dealt with the "ism" of Judaism for almost twenty-six centuries. God's instrument in dealing with the Jews has been the four great empires&#151;Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome&#151;represented by the four sections of the great human image in Daniel 2:31-33. The Jews have been under God's dealing since 606 B.C. At that time they lost their country through the Babylonian invasion. From that day the Jews have never fully regained their country. Although in 1948 the nation of Israel was reestablished, the number of Jews living in Palestine is still very small. Even today the Jews are still under God's dealing.</P><P>At the same time God is also dealing with Catholicism. In Revelation 17 we are told clearly that near the beginning of the three and a half years of the great tribulation, after Antichrist begins to oppose and exalt himself above all that is called God or an object of worship (2 Thes. 2:3-4), he will burn the Roman Catholic Church (Rev. 17:16), which is the great harlot mentioned by the apostle John in Revelation 17:1 and the evil woman mentioned by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 13:33. The woman in Matthew 13 who took the leaven and put it into the fine flour, the woman Jezebel in Revelation 2:20, and the harlot in Revelation 17 all refer to the same entity, that is, Catholicism. Even some Catholic scholars recognize that the harlot in Revelation 17 refers to the Catholic Church.</P><P>God is also dealing with Protestantism. In the Protestant churches a prominent thing is the "tares," the nominal Christians (Matt. 13:24-30, 36-42). In Matthew 13:30, 40-42 the Lord said that when He comes back, the first thing He will do is bind the tares together and put them into the lake of fire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PRACTICING THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY<br>IN FOUR DEFINITE STEPS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Practicing the New Testament<br>Priesthood of the Gospel</H2><P>To those who love the Lord and have the intention to live an overcoming life for the Lord's recovery, I would like to give some solemn advice: You must study to enter into the first step of the God-ordained way&#151;the priesthood of the gospel. We are the priests of the gospel (Rom. 15:16). Today the New Testament priesthood is a priesthood of the preaching of the gospel to get sinners regenerated to make them members of the Body of Christ. As New Testament priests, we offer these members of Christ to God as our sacrifices. In the Old Testament the priests offered cattle as sacrifices. These sacrifices were merely types. Today we need to offer as our sacrifices not cattle but the regenerated, saved sinners.</P><P>We have all been chosen to be God's priests (1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:6). The New Testament eventually tells us that this priesthood is a priesthood of the gospel. This is clearly stressed in Romans 15:16. There Paul said that he was a laboring priest, an energizing priest, of the gospel of God. Then he said that he offered to God as New Testament sacrifices all the Gentiles whom he converted into members of Christ. For this one step of the God-ordained way you must have a beginning. You yourself must study it and get into it and practice it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Being Built Up Together<br>to Be a Priesthood, a Priestly Body</H2><P>Romans 15:16 tells us that the New Testament believers are the New Testament priests and that we, the New Testament priests, are priests of the gospel. Then 1 Peter 2:5, 9 says that we as priests should be built up together to be a priesthood, that is, a priestly body. Thus, if we are going to convert sinners into members of Christ, we must do it in a corporate way. Two or three priests must be built up together as a priesthood. As used in the Bible, the word priesthood bears two denotations. First, it denotes the priestly service, and second, it refers to the priestly body, a group of priests built together to become a priesthood. Merely to go out to preach the gospel by yourself is not adequate. You must be built together with others. However, it would not be effective to call together the entire congregation in your locality to promote the priesthood of the gospel. You should simply contact two or three of the saints and be built together with them as a priestly body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Going Out to Contact People</H2><P>Then you must go to contact people. You should not excuse yourself by saying that you do not have time to do this. You may feel that you do not have time to contact people for the gospel, but you may have time to speak at length on the telephone or to watch television. If you account for your time, you will see that every day you waste a certain amount of time. Especially in speaking on the telephone, we need to learn to shorten our conversations, speaking only what is necessary, in order to save our time.</P><P>Saving money is not as important as saving time. Hence, just as we count our dollars and cents in order to save money, we need to count our hours and minutes in order to save time. From the moment we rise up in the morning, we need to budget our time. Then we will see that we do have time to visit people for the gospel. At least two days a week we will be able to spend two hours a day for gospel preaching. We can write to our friends; we can call our friends; we can go to visit people; or we can invite them to our home, either for tea or for dinner. There are many things that we can do to contact people and bring them to the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Telling Out the Virtues of Our God</H2><P>First Peter 2:9 says that the priesthood of the gospel is to declare, or tell out, the virtues of our God. Here Peter does not directly speak of preaching the gospel; rather, he speaks of declaring, proclaiming, or telling out, the virtues of God. The virtues of our God are many. God's love is one of God's virtues. His mercy, His grace, His forgiveness, and His dying on the cross for our sins also are His virtues. You and your companions in the gospel priesthood should study all these things and become familiar with them. Then, whenever you meet someone, you can declare to that one some virtues of God, some virtues of Christ, not in a legal way but in a very particular way according to what the Bible reveals.</P><P>If you have the heart to begin to practice the priesthood of the gospel, you must study, budget your time, and go to contact people. You can knock on "cold" doors, and you can also knock on "warm" doors. To knock on people's doors does not necessarily mean that you literally go up to a door and knock on that door. That is not the only meaning of knocking on doors. Your writing a letter to your schoolmate can be considered your knocking on his door. To call people on the telephone also is to knock on doors to contact people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Endeavoring Patiently without Excusing Ourselves</H2><P>Some saints have said that they went to knock on people's doors, but they did not gain anyone. Thus, they said that the door knocking does not work. When asked how long they had gone out, they said that they had done it for only half a year. That is too short a time. It is better to spend five years, or even fifteen years, to go out to contact people for the Lord. Surely after such a time you will gain someone.</P><P>In Matthew 25 the one-talented slave attempted to excuse himself by saying to his master, "Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow" (v. 24). To this his master replied, "Evil and slothful slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not winnow" (v. 26). In this parable the Lord did not deny that He is strict in what He demands of His slaves for His work. The Lord recognized that to gain people is not easy.</P><P>In fishing, if the fish swallow the bait but do not take the hook today, the fisherman must go back home to study the situation and to improve the hook that he is using. Then he must go again to try to catch some fish. If the next time is a failure, he must go a third time, then a fourth time, and perhaps even a tenth time. After the tenth time, on the eleventh day he may catch ten fish. If there is a will, surely there is a way.</P><P>You must budget your time, and you must go out to contact people. You can even stay home and use your telephone, your pen, and your prayer to contact people. There is a way. Then you need to learn how to speak to people by proclaiming to them the virtues of the Lord who saved you out of darkness into His marvelous light. To tell people the virtues of this One, you need to learn by studying. Do not "take it easy." We need to realize that nothing in the Lord's service is easy.</P><P>This is the first step in the practice of the God-ordained way. I encourage you to put the points in this message into practice for one or two years. I believe that in many localities there will be a result in only six or eight months. Through your practice, the example, the model, set up by you will stir others up. Then, gradually, in your church a habit will be built up to practice the New Testament gospel priesthood.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Nourishing and Cherishing the New Believers</H2><P>The second step in the practice of the God-ordained way is to feed the new believers. In John 21:15 the Lord said to Peter, "Feed My lambs." To feed the Lord's lambs is to nourish and cherish the new believers, just as a nursing mother cherishes and nourishes her infant. In order to feed the new ones, you need to learn how to make them happy. This is to cherish them. At times nearly every child is naughty. Instead of spanking or rebuking a child, a mother should learn to make her child happy. By dancing to her child or playing with her child, a nursing mother can make her child happy. After the child has been cherished, the mother can nourish the child. Likewise, after cherishing the new believers, we can nourish them. If we do not cherish them, they may not be willing to receive the nourishment from us.</P><P>I encourage you not to take my word lightly but to put it into practice. You might have brought some new ones to the Lord, yet eventually they did not become your remaining fruit. The reason may be that you did not know how to cherish and then nourish your new ones. In caring for the new believers you must learn how to render them some genuine help concerning their physical needs. Do not use any gimmicks. Gimmicks are falsehoods. Be diligent, be honest, be loving, and be sincere in helping people. Many people have physical needs, and many have problems. By caring for them you must learn how to help them.</P><P>Again I say, take my word and go back to study. I cannot tell you yet how to do these things, because I myself have not learned adequately. You must study the situation. If a certain way does not work, find another way. Learn to fulfill your own responsibility by studying and endeavoring to find a way to do it. In a secular occupation, you dare not go again and again to your supervisor to ask him how to do your job. You yourself must find a way. If you cannot find a way, you may be sent home and may lose your job. In carrying out our service to the Lord, we are too easy on ourselves.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Practicing the Group Meetings</H2><P>Concerning the practice of group meetings, many principles have been set forth in previous messages. You need to apply these principles and group together the dear ones who are under your care. In your group meetings you should not have any kind of religious service or form of worship. Furthermore, you should not conduct yourself as if you are going to teach others. All these ways you must drop. Just come together with your group in a natural way to have a mutual fellowship with them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Practicing to Prophesy</H2><P>Then, from the group meetings you should go on to prophesying. The most difficult of the four steps of the God-ordained way is prophesying. However, we all can learn to prophesy if we will have a definite beginning and also take the time to practice.</P><P>Some dissenting ones have proclaimed that 1 Corinthians 14 is not written to all the believers. They say that it is directed only to a certain class of believers who are considered prophets. This is a wrong teaching. First Corinthians 14:1 says, "Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy." The first verse of 1 Corinthians 14 does not refer only to the so-called prophets; rather, it refers to all the saints, including us. Then verses 23 and 24 say, "If therefore the whole church comes together in one place, and...all prophesy..." These verses show that in the church meetings, all the believers can prophesy (v. 31). Therefore, we should not listen to the erroneous teaching of the dissenters. Rather, we should receive the apostles' teaching in 1 Corinthians 14.</P><P>I beg you to take my word. From now on you yourself must do something. You must begin by studying the first step of the God-ordained way: how to get people regenerated. Then, you must find the way to practice it with your companions. I do believe that you will see some results. Especially the elders, those who take care of the churches, must themselves have a practical beginning with some companions. They should not promote this to the entire congregation; that way does not work. The elders themselves must take the lead to do it.</P></body></html>
