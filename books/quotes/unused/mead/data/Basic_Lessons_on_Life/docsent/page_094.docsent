   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A CONTRITE AND HUMBLE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A contrite and humble spirit is very close to a broken spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Isaiah 57:15 and 66:2 both indicate the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They indicate that even heaven is not a joyful place to God for His dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God desires to dwell with people who have a contrite and humble spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we are contrite and humble in our spirit, we are broken in our spirit, and we can enjoy God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God is then with us and even dwells with us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If our spirit is proud and we keep ourselves complete, perfect, and whole, being unwilling to repent and confess, we will lose the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In a certain sense, according to our experience, the Lord's presence would leave us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So we need a contrite spirit, which is humble and broken, a repenting spirit to confess our sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we are in this kind of spirit, the Lord will be with us and will dwell with us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Isaiah 57:15 and 66:2 are wonderful verses to point out to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>V. A MEEK AND QUIET SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We also need a meek and quiet spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First Peter 3:4 says that the hidden man of our heart is a meek and quiet spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Galatians 6:1 says that we need to restore a fallen brother in a spirit of meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1 Corinthians 4:21 Paul asked the Corinthians if they wanted him to come to them with a rod or in a spirit of meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The New Testament mentions the virtue of meekness a number of times.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Matthew 5:5 the Lord said, "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Based upon this verse, we can look into the real meaning of being meek in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The world's way is to fight, to strive, and to defeat others to gain some possession, some inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the Bible says that if you are going to inherit anything, you have to be meek.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be meek means not to resist the world's opposition but to suffer it willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Regardless of the situation, we should be meek, not fighting against others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Meekness means not fighting for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need a meek and quiet spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you fight for anything, you cannot be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The only way that you can be quiet is not to fight for yourself or seek anything for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>BEING POOR IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Matthew 5:3 the Lord said, "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may say we need to have a rich spirit, but we should not say we need to have a poor spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If someone has a poor spirit, his spirit is not a right spirit, a proper spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here in Matthew 5:3 to be poor in spirit means we have nothing preoccupying us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the Pharisees, the scribes, the priests, and the elders among the Jewish people were not poor in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They were preoccupied.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That was the reason the Lord Jesus said that the first blessing was to be poor in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Pharisees could not participate in the kingdom because they were not poor in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We always need to be poor in our spirit, not letting our spirit be preoccupied, filled up, with things other than the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to empty our spirit, to pour out all the preoccupying items, so that we may be poor in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>KNOWING OF WHAT SPIRIT WE ARE</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Luke 9 tells us that a certain village of the Samaritans would not receive the Lord and His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>So James and John said, "Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?" v. 54 . The Lord turned and rebuked them, saying, "You do not know of what kind of spirit you are" v. 55 . We always have to learn to know what kind of spirit we have.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In other words, with God and with man we always need a proper spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If our spirit is improper, we are through with God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to know what condition our spirit is in. The Bible tells us to consider our ways Hag 1:7 , and we also have to consider our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should consider not only our outward ways, our outward behavior, and our outward attitude but also our inward spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need a proper spirit.</S>
