<P>Since the Reformation, the disputes that we have heard among the Protestant churches are not of different views concerning the gospel. Rather, they are on the church and the government of the church. If in this aspect we would allow the Bible to speak instead of allowing the Protestant churches to speak, the question of church government will be as clear as the gospel is. Whether or not we are willing to do it, we should allow the Bible to solve all problems. If we do this, we will see that neither the teachings of Luther, the teachings of Calvin, the Anglican Church, nor the Genevan Church, has brought us back to the initial position of the church. The Body of Christ and the spiritual house built with living stones are the truths that they are ignorant of. We know that the churches then were all "national churches." This means that the churches had as their boundaries the national boundaries and were thus national churches. At the time of the Roman Catholic Church, all the nations had become Christianized already. Those who had left Jezebel were now taking Christianity as the state religion. All that the Reformation gave them was a new creed. It did not give them a new organization. Almost all the Protestant churches were national churches. This is, of course, an imitation of the work of the Roman Church. We cannot find such a method of church organization in the Bible. If believers take the Reformation as the standard of truth, they are fully wrong at least in the matter of church organization. When Luther stood up personally to oppose the Pope, we see him fearless in power and bold to contend with the strong forces. We have to admit that this is God's work manifested in a weak human being. The Reformation is truly a work of faith. On the other hand, however, we have to admit that there were elements of politics in the Reformation. Those who rose up to support the Reformation probably did so more for the reason of opposing the domination of Rome than with a zeal for the Word of God. In the end, soldiers, politicians, nations, and believers were standing on the same ground and were engaging in the same struggle. After this period of history, there was, of course, no hope for the post-reformation Protestant churches to be the same as the churches in the first century.</P><P>With such mixed elements involved, the power of God's Holy Spirit was surely not willing to join in. Under such conditions, organization becomes crucial. But how is the church to be organized? If the true church is to be preached, all the soldiers, politicians, and nations must be dissociated from it. However, to do so would invite greater persecution and shame; it would allow Rome to prevail and would take away all possibility for Rome to be removed. This was a difficult problem facing the Reformers of the day. If they excommunicated their supporters, how could they stand up to the enormous military and financial power of Rome? However, if they wanted to establish a genuine church, they had to relinquish these politically oriented helpers. I dare not say that they had never thought about what a genuine church should be, but I dare say that their joining hands with the arms of flesh had at least prevented them from seeing the genuine church. We rejoice because there was the Reformation, but we are sorrowful because the Reformation was not thorough. This inevitably brought in the national churches, the necessary creeds, and the power of politics as the backbone of the church.</P><P>This is very obvious. If creeds were necessary, God's wisdom surely would have prepared an infallible one. God's love would surely not have forgotten such a thing and would not have held it back from the church. The fact that God did not give us such a creed shows that such a creed is useless. On the contrary, God has given man a Bible. From this we should know the mind of God. Even if man's creeds are infallible, they cannot be complete. If the Protestant churches would not act according to the man-made creeds but would take the whole Bible as their guide in faith and conduct, they would not be so wrong. They would, on the contrary, have more perfect works and conduct. Why do men want creeds? It is because they want a simpler and clearer outline of the doctrines than what the Bible provides! The Bible is unlimited, but the creeds are specific. With the Bible, different people may have different views concerning it, but with the creeds, the meaning is unified. Whether to the church or to the world, the creeds provide no variable interpretations. However, we consider the words of the Bible to be more obvious and easier to understand than human words. The content of the Bible is most comprehensive; it meets the need of all ages. All the creeds of Protestantism, with all their bylaws, constitutions, and charters of organization, written or verbal, tend to lead men away from the Bible. Even if these things are scriptural, they still tend to present man's word as the standard of truth. All the creeds and constitutions of the church were drafted from the beliefs of those who established these constitutions and creeds. To do this causes many scriptural truths to become hidden. In many cases, man is even able to keep the creeds while opposing the Bible. However, the apostle said, "All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work" (2 Tim. 3:16-17). The condition for understanding the Bible is not great knowledge, great wisdom, or profound study, but a single-hearted desire to be a man of God. Even the poorest and the most foolish man can do this. As a result, it is possible even for him to understand the Word of God. If believers would be men of God in position and in conduct, it would not be difficult for them to understand the Bible.</P><P>What man wants now is not the Bible but the creeds. The creeds are there to verbalize the doctrines believed. But the Bible cannot be crystalized into a few or a dozen articles of faith. Rather, it has to be expressed as a real living in those with the spiritual life. The words of 1 Corinthians 2:14 are real. No wonder man replaces the Bible with the creeds, and no wonder the Bible is not adhered to as much as the creeds are among the national churches. Since the Bible and the creeds are basically different, it is impossible for God to have a mind for the creeds. It is not God's will to have churches with nations as units. The Lord considers spirituality as the foremost thing in the understanding of His will, but man wants to replace His wonderful Word with the shallower creeds, with the hope that those without any spiritual life would also understand the truth and would become nominal members. This is the difference between God's mind and man's mind.</P>
