   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE NEED FOR TRAINING DIRECTION FOR THOSE CONSIDERING JOINING THE FULL-TIME TRAINING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Taiwan almost all of the brothers who graduate from college are required to render two years of military service.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus, if they want to join the training upon graduating, they would have to simultaneously remain in school for another year.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then they would have to prepare for examinations while attending the training and would be unable to focus on the training.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, after graduating from college, many of them do not know whether they should first join the Full-Time Training and then serve in the military or first serve in the military and then join the Full-Time Training.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For those of you who are in this situation, this is a practical matter that you must thoroughly consider before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, you need to consider whether you will still have the opportunity to be trained after serving in the military for two years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since the present training in the church is a special training, once you miss this opportunity, you may not have such an opportunity again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If this is the case, then it would be worthwhile to consider deferring the military service to join the training for one year.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Otherwise, you should join the military service right after your graduation from college.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nonetheless, this is a personal affair that you yourself must clearly consider.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I would suggest that unless there is a special reason, you should do first things first.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You should first join the military service to fulfill your obligation and afterward devote yourself wholeheartedly to be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nevertheless, if you feel that your present need is to be trained, then you should grasp this opportunity and consider attending the training for one year.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>LEARNING TO BE A PERSON WHO SEIZES THE TIME</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some of the trainees have said that in the training there are too many things to do.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They are required to have small groups, to equip themselves with the truth, to pursue life, to preach the gospel, and to learn languages.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They also have to go to the campuses to contact, nourish, and take care of people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, they have asked how they are supposed to manage their time with only twenty-four hours in a day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, the training requires them to offer two years to be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Afterward, depending on the trainers observations of them, they may go on to serve full time if they are qualified, or if they are not qualified to serve, they may find a job.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some feel very anxious, not knowing how to make use of the two short years in a serious way that will decide the path that they will take.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may say that the training has too many requirements, but according to my observation, there are actually not that many.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is true that we have only twenty-four hours in a day and that no matter how we use them, we still have only twenty-four hours of time each day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You may feel that the class curriculum is very full and has many requirements, but in my opinion it is not that full.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not think that only those who are being trained are required to exercise; those who are not being trained also have to exercise in the matters of pursuing to know the truth and growing in life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Concerning the matter of carrying out the group meetings, you do not need to purposely spend time to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Simply devote your whole heart to the meeting when you are there, and endeavor to learn something while doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The same principle applies to the campus work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As long as you abide by the schedule, there should not be any problems.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You may feel that the schedule is too busy because you are not used to it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, you must make a schedule according to the practical situation and abide by it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you do not make a schedule, time will not wait for you and will pass by very quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you stop to take a few breaths and a rest, your time will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, you have to learn to grasp the time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While you are still the master of your time, do your best to learn and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Let me use myself as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You are all younger and stronger than I am, yet I do more than you each day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not only do I have to lead the meetings and visit the churches, I also have to help the literature work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Living Stream Ministry prints almost two hundred pages of messages per month in English alone, and I am the one who finalizes the manuscripts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our literature work consists of four lines, one of which is the life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are other books for publication that I also need to finalize.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In addition, I still have to prepare all the messages for the conferences and trainings, write the truth lessons, and be responsible for the finalization of the Chinese books.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If I gave these tasks to someone else, I do not think anyone would be able to do them all.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The reason I can do all this is because I have a schedule, and I work according to this schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, you must learn to manage your time and to do things in a logical order.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then you will not feel that the schedule is too full or that you are tired.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We human beings are living beings and therefore have a certain degree of flexibility.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can be either too loose or too rigid.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once you set your schedule, even when you relax, you will not be fully relaxed because you will know what step to take next, and you will naturally be ready.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, if you do not have a schedule, you may waste two hours just by being a little bit loose, or you may use up half of your day chatting with people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the past six months, what has been the result of your pursuit of the truth every morning?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How many books have you studied carefully?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you value this matter and set a definite time for your pursuit of the truth, the result will be better than it is at present.</S>
