   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Duration of Such Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How long should this kind of prayer last?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We know that for some prayers we need only pray once.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But there can never be too much of the prayer that opposes Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The purpose of the Lord's parable in Luke 18 is to teach men "to pray and not lose heart" v. 1 . The judge avenged the widow, not because of justice or any other reason, but because he could not tolerate her wearing him out.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He said to himself, "I will avenge her, lest by continually coming she wear me out."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, this kind of prayer should be unceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should have this kind of Satan-opposing prayer not only when special circumstances befall us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, in our daily life, even while there is nothing happening, we should maintain in our spirit an attitude of unceasing opposition to Satan and should utter unceasing prayer against him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After the Lord Jesus spoke this parable, He said that if God's people would cry to Him day and night, He would surely avenge them quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, this kind of prayer must go on day and night without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must accuse our enemy before God day and night unceasingly, because Revelation 12 tells us that Satan accuses us before God day and night unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since he accuses us day and night without ceasing, should we not accuse him also day and night without ceasing?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is vengeance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As he deals with us, so we deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This cry of the widow did not stop until the opponent was judged and punished and she was vindicated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, as long as Satan is still reigning, as long as he is not shut up in the abyss, as long as he is not cast into the lake of fire, and as long as God has not yet avenged us, we must not cease our opposing prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is when Satan falls like lightning out of heaven that our prayer can stop, for by then, God will have begun our avenging.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Alas, how God desires that we have a deeper hatred of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have suffered enough under his hand!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He has set himself against us step by step, and at every turn he has persecuted us physically and spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why then are we still silent and tolerant of his persecution?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why do we not rise up to accuse him before God with our words of prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should seek revenge and require vengeance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why do we not come often before God to accuse him and thus air our grievances?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus is calling us particularly to oppose Satan with our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Effect of Such Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is the effect of this kind of prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The effect occurs in two instances.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, there is the present effect.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every time we accuse the enemy, he is limited by God from harming us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although he will come to us again later, while we are accusing him, he is afraid and will not exercise his violence recklessly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every time we invoke the victory of the cross, this victory becomes real to us once again.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every time we pray to oppose Satan, his work is once again annulled, and he is once again rebuked by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we pray one more time, Satan suffers loss one more time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When God hears our prayer one more time, Satan's interest is stripped away one more time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, this effect is not limited to the present time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus mentions a final vindication here.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every time we pray, the Lord rebukes and annuls the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But this is not accomplished once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is restricted only for a while and has not yet met his final and complete destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord says, "And will not God by all means carry out the avenging of His chosen ones, who cry to Him day and night?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Luke 18:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This speaks of the final annihilation of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We know that in the millennium Satan will be shut up in the abyss and that after the millennium the Lord Jesus will cast him into the eternal lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is to avenge the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For this reason, the believers should pray more prayers that oppose Satan now, so that they can be fully avenged.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now is the time when God is patiently enduring.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although He hears the believers' prayer and limits the devil's work, He has not yet removed him completely nor stopped his menacing permanently.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now is the time for the believers to pray so that that day may come soon.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It seems that our prayer can hasten God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The widow cried continually, for she did not know when the judge would avenge her.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Her crying hastened the day of his avenging.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is the same with us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord says, "I tell you that He will carry out their avenging quickly" v. 8 . The Lord seems to be saying that the speed of God's work depends on our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our constant Satan-accusing prayers will hasten God's avenging of us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Satan will lose his authority when he is cast out of heaven at the coming of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The prayer that accuses Satan will hasten the day of the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many times we think that God works according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is true, but this is only one side of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is not the complete truth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God works according to His will; this is His principle.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, God cannot actually set out to work until His children have responded to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God wants man to work with Him.</S>
