They interpreted prophesying in chapter fourteen as foretelling, and they practiced this kind of prophesying in their meetings
Usually their prophecies began in a similar way and ended with, 'Thus saith the Lord,' in the style of the Old Testament prophets
To prophesy in the sense of 1 Corinthians 14 denotes to speak for God and Christ and to speak forth God and Christ
It is possible for a waiter to offend people in such a way that they will not eat the food that he ministers to them
In speaking forth God and Christ we should not only minister God and Christ to people but also dispense into them what we are speaking forth
The word 'dispensation' refers to this arrangement, whereas the word 'stewardship' refers to the service of God's dispensing
In the Old Testament, Isaiah, with sixty-six chapters, and Jeremiah, with fifty-two chapters, are two long books of prophecy
Most of Paul's writings consist of speaking for God and speaking forth God, that is, speaking to dispense God and Christ into the believers
For the church we need the building up, for the work we need the encouragement, and for our daily life we need consolation
Verse 24 says, 'But if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all'
For one man to speak while all the others listen is a form of prophesying, but it is carried out in a wrong way
Verse 12 says, 'So also you, since you are zealots of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the building up of the church'
Romans 12:6-8 mentions seven gifts, including prophecy, and says that these gifts differ according to the grace given to each member
If we go to visit people for the gospel and are not able to speak well, we can simply say, 'I love Jesus because He is so good
We all must bring our new ones together to form a group for fellowship, mutual care, shepherding, and mutual teaching
When one person in such a group does not understand something, all the others will teach him by speaking to him
The phrase 'if all prophesy' indicates that all the believers have not only the capacity but also the obligation to prophesy
We receive the benefit of others' speaking, but we often forget that we also are obliged to speak for others' benefit
Dear saints, the speaking of the Lord concerning the new way has continued in the recovery over the past five years
We all have the capacity and the obligation to prophesy, and we all should pursue, seek, and desire earnestly to prophesy
If we are going to prophesy, we must have some knowledge and experience of God, Christ, and the spiritual things
Many among us are not clear about the intrinsic contents of the present turmoil in the Lord's recovery, and some prefer not to be clear
Their attitude is that others should be clear about the situation, but that they should take care only of enjoying Christ
When we exercise our spirit, the Holy Spirit who is indwelling our spirit will be moved by us, and we will have the inspiration
He will rise up, and we can speak according to our experience with the utterance we have gained and with the enlightenment that we have
In 1937 Brother Nee saw the revelation in 1 Corinthians 14 concerning all the saints prophesying in the church meeting
We began to have separate meetings with the brothers in the church on Saturday morning in order to encourage them to learn how to speak
In that meeting there was no designated leader to call a hymn or offer a prayer; the meeting was open to everyone
The Lord's recovery came to America in 1962, but at that time we still were not clear concerning the matter of prophesying in the meetings
As descendants of the Old Testament saints they were still in the Old Testament atmosphere but they prophesied according to a high standard
The items of these divine facts have not been brought into our speaking, and we do not commonly hear them in our prayer and service
For this reason we are still forced to publish books containing the 'ABCs,' the elementary things, of the holy Word
Because Elizabeth lived in fellowship with the Lord, it is doubtful that she was able to speak in a loose or gossiping way
Some may say that they are too busy and tired to pray, yet they are able to spend a long time on the telephone gossiping
Whenever a word of gossip comes to our mouth, we will remember that our mouth has been presented to the Lord for speaking Him
She was so concerned for the Lord's move on the earth at her time that she did not care for her own well-being
Such an expression of blessing shows that Elizabeth was fully in her spirit, not caring for the things of the mind
In the meetings often the brothers and sisters do not speak with boldness that is they do not speak loudly with the exercise of their spirit
Elizabeth's prophecy, the only portion in the Word that tells us that Christ is the fruit, completes the figures concerning Christ
Blessing Mary in this way indicates that Elizabeth had the sight under the divine enlightenment concerning Mary's situation
To compose a proper prophecy, we must have the sight under the divine enlightenment to know the situation and environment in which we are
If we are under the light and have the sight to see through the environment, we will know what each person's situation is
In verse 45, Elizabeth said concerning Mary, 'There shall be a completion of the things spoken to her from the Lord'
Elizabeth's insight helped her to confirm, by foretelling their completion, the things that the Lord had spoken to Mary through the angel
Although Elizabeth was older and more experienced than Mary, the spiritual content in Mary's speaking is higher and deeper
The verb tenses used in this sentence indicate that first Marys spirit exulted in God her Savior then her soul followed to magnify the Lord
Although both Mary and Elizabeth were females, they both had gained a great deal of knowledge from the Old Testament
The utterance of Marys prophesying was based also upon her knowledge and experience of God that is on what God had done over her and for her
God overshadowed her in her low estate, in her humble situation, and selected her to be the vessel for His incarnation
In verses 51-52 Mary said, 'He has done mighty things with His arm; He has scattered those who are proud in the understanding of their heart
In view of the principles revealed in these verses concerning God's dealing with people, we should not be proud
Hitler in his arrogance broke his promise to the British prime minister and invaded Czechoslovakia and Poland in 1939
God has filled us with good things, and the rich He sent away empty not merely empty-handed, but empty inwardly and subjectively
In Matthew 53 and 6 the Lord Jesus spoke according to this principle Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens
In her speaking Mary covered her own experience of God Gods dealing with people in a general way and Gods merciful doing to her forefathers
Another brother or sister can continue, 'Lord, this cup signifies the covenant which You enacted for us with Your blood'
If three saints would pray in this way in the Lord's table meeting, the meeting would rise to the third heavens
Not many among us, including the elders and the co-workers, have sacrificed enough time and energy to learn the spiritual lessons
We all need to learn not only to speak in the meetings, but also to speak something meaningful according to an improved capacity
We should also memorize verses such as John 3:6, 16, and 36; John 14:26 and 15:26; and John 15:16 and Romans 15:16
In addition, we need to devise a particular way that will enable us to remember the book, chapter, and verse number of the crucial verses
Many people can understand certain verses such as John 3:16 superficially, but they do not know the deeper denotations in these verses
The Lord's understanding of Exodus 3:6, revealed in Matthew 22:31-32, is an illustration of knowing the deep denotations of the word of God
The phrase 'crowned him with glory and honor' implies something very high and very deep that is difficult to comprehend
These verses speak of One upon whose head is a crown of glory and honor and under whose feet all things are subjected
The Jewish teachers might have said that these verses refer to Adam, but Paul realized that they must have a higher and further meaning
In His ascension Christ was crowned with glory and honor, and in His kingdom and in eternity God will subject all things under His feet
We can also see Paul's knowledge of the deep denotations of the Word of God in his understanding of Psalm 2:7, as revealed in Acts 13:33
Christ was the only begotten Son of God when He came to be incarnated, but He was born the firstborn Son of God in His resurrection
Christ's being born as the firstborn Son indicates that many others would follow Him to be born of God and become the many sons of God
The deep denotation of the Scriptures can be found also in John 316 which has been understood superficially by many believers for centuries
The marriage of the Bridegroom and the bride will take place in Revelation 19, but the preparation for the marriage is seen in John 3
To have the personal knowledge of the Scriptures, we must also know the spiritual significances of the Word of God
According to the letter of Genesis 16:15 and 21:2, we can see two women: Sarah, Abraham's wife, and Hagar, his concubine
Paul's knowledge of the spiritual significances of the Word of God can also be seen in his interpretation of Psalm 68:18 in Ephesians 4:8-10
Almost every Christian who reads 1 Corinthians 14 sees nothing in that chapter regarding the meeting of mutuality
Joseph was a steward appointed to carry out Pharaoh's economy in dispensing the rich store of daily supplies to his people
Many truths in the Bible have been lost, but since the second century, the Lord has been recovering what was lost
The first is the personal experiences of the Lord's doings and blessings in physical things and environmental occurrences
Many saints experience the Lord's merciful doings and the Lord's blessings to them in physical or material things
We should also stay away from our reactions to our spouse, our neighbors, the elders, and the brothers and sisters
To prophesy, in principle, is not to speak for oneself, not to speak forth oneself, and even the more, not to dispense oneself into people
Often we may dispense ourselves to people in our speaking in order to impress them with our experiences and affections
Elizabeth, Mary, and Zechariah were saints in the final part of the Old Testament age, yet they prophesied in a marvelous way
By means of their manpower, time, knowledge, technology, money, and patience, the Americans landed on the moon in 1969
Eventually, we will come up to the standard of prophesying with the basic constituents as revealed in the holy Word
Some did give an adequate definition of the word prophesying, saying that to prophesy is to speak for, to speak forth, and to foretell
To prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14 is to speak building up for the church encouragement for the Lords work and consolation for our daily life
Verse 24 says, 'But if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all'
In 1937 Brother Nee saw a vision concerning prophesying as speaking for God and Christ and speaking forth God and Christ
He saw that prophesying is the basic factor of a church meeting in mutuality and that there should not be only one speaker in a meeting
If we learn to prophesy in a proper, adequate way according to 1 Corinthians 14, we will take a big step for the Lord's recovery
We have the basic knowledge concerning prophesying, and we have seen the patterns of prophesying and the constituents of a prophecy
The highest and greatest speaking in the universe is the Bible, which contains sixty-six books of God's speaking
If all the millions of Christians in the United States would speak for God and Christ every day, the whole earth would be overturned
We should be heard singing and praising not only in the meeting hall, but also on the streets and in the parking lot
The Spirit is always ready and expects to speak with us and through us, but we always would not cooperate with the Spirit to speak
If a child is quiet all day, the parents will be bothered and will worry about him, but when he begins to speak, the parents will be happy
For many years our Father in heaven has not seen us speak much in the meetings, and this should have bothered Him
Our natural man, our disposition, and our habit form a deceitful 'trinity' that works within us to annul our function and our usefulness
We may feel that we should speak only if we can be the top speaker; thus, we refrain from speaking because we do not like to lose face
Even if we overcome all the foregoing factors, our obstacle in cooperating to speak with the Spirit may be in our speaking inaudibly
If we are quiet persons, we must be against our natural man with its quietness; that is, we must be against ourselves
The way to overcome our obstacle is also to exercise our spirit and to learn how to utter what we want to speak for the Lord
If we still cannot learn how to speak what we want to speak, we should go to an experienced brother and ask for help
Educating a child takes at least eighteen years, and longer if he studies for a college degree, a master's degree, or a Ph
It is not right for anyone to be in the church for many years yet not know how to speak for the Lord in the meetings
