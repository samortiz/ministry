   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Letter from Sister Huang Yu-mei,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Cebu, Malaysia</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sister X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Your letter arrived in twenty-four days.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One can come here by boat directly from Hong Kong, Amoy, Swatow, Canton, or anywhere in the coastal region.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you take a ship from Hong Kong, the fast ones only take four days and nights to get to Singapore.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The slow ones take a day longer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From Singapore to Cebu takes another three days and nights by boat.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the end of the year, the trip from Singapore to Cebu can be very stormy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I know that it is the Lord's will that I should give up teaching and serve God full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The people here all desire salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although many are called X, they unfortunately do not know the slightest thing about salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are two church districts here, Cebu and Shi-Li Street, with a total of forty-eight chapels.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One chapel covers a great area.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sometimes one must walk half an hour between houses.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Most people take the steamboat to go to church, but they still must walk a great distance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The mountain roads are difficult to travel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When it rains, one almost always has to take off his shoes before he can negotiate the mountain roads.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If it were not for the Lord, no one would want to travel through them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thank the Lord, I have already been to eleven places.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the Lord is willing, I plan to visit them all.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>My elder sister likes to come with me, but she does not have anyone at home to take care of things for her.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She plans to hire someone to keep house for her.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is a new sister from Shing-Hwa who also feels the Lord's leading to go with us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We started last week with our luggage, but I was sick, and it seemed that we should not go.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>My sister was caught up with some things and had to go back.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We plan to go to Hsia-Po this time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is a sister there from Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Her last name is Lin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the Lord is willing, we will go to her house.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>She is a friend of my brother-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have heard that Sister Ding has come south.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are already five or six brothers and sisters who have come from China.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I believe that the Lord has already opened the door here, but there cannot be any meeting other than gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Please help us with your prayer for all these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sister Fang Chiung-ying wants to come.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Unfortunately, she cannot get a visa.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I do not have a copy of the first issue of The Open Door.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>May the Lord give grace to you and to all the brothers and sisters who are working for Him in the coastal regions, the central region, and the western regions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I believe the feeling is true everywhere that the harvest is great and the workers few.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May the Lord send people out!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must pray that the Lord will give me a co-worker who can speak the Foochow and Malayan dialect and can teach the people to sing hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Peace in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Greet Sister Wang and Sister Chang for me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Your sister,</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yu-mei</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>January 7</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Address omitted</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All Things in God's Hands, Hankow One</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When I took the manuscripts for the fifth issue to the Spiritual Book Publisher to be typeset and printed, the first thing they told me was that there was a lack of paper, and the price had risen dramatically.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At that time a roll cost twenty-three dollars, and people were still buying it frantically.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I was troubled about the problem, but I also thought that the Lord would be responsible for His own work, so I decided not to buy the paper in advance.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I just prayed earnestly and waited until the manuscripts were typeset and the paper was needed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The typesetting was finished today, and fifty rolls of paper had been sent to Hankow, so the price had fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is now fourteen dollars a roll.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Ordinary businessmen might think that this is very common in the marketplace, but we cannot help but praise the Lord because it is His doing!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God led us through a special conference during the past week.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This week there is a sisters' conference which is also of God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Lan Tsi-yi</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>March 16</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God is now leading me to watch His working day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He is the Lord of works.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I am resting in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I only need to stand aside to watch His glory and works.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Lan Tsi-yi</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>March 24</S>
