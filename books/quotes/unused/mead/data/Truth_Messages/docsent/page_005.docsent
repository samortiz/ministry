   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE DEFINITION OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall devote our attention to the definition of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we all recognize, truth is the opposite of falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many also regard truth as meaning certain true, reliable principles, such as the principle that honesty is the best policy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After speaking recently on the subject of the truth, I was approached by a learned man who said that truth referred to principles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As an illustration, he said that John 3:16 is a standing principle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This understanding of truth is worldly, an altogether natural concept different from the understanding of truth presented in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we would know the meaning of truth in the Bible, we need to get into the depths of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE WORD, THE TRUTH, AND THE LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In John 8:12 the Lord Jesus said, I am the light of the world, and in 14:6 He said, I am...the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John 17:17 tells us that the Word is also the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the Bible, the Lord is the light, the truth, and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Word, which is also the truth, gives light, for in the Word there is light.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, the Word, the light, and the truth are one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John 1:14 says, The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and truth, and verse 17 says, The law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we believe in the Lord Jesus, we receive grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In his first Epistle, John says that God is love and that God is light 1 John 4:16; 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When God comes to us, we receive grace; but when we go to God, He is love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Grace is the realization and expression of love.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Love is the source, and grace is the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Likewise, truth is the realization and expression of light.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Light is the source, and truth is the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The expression of light is the shining of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When light is concealed from us, it is merely light, but when it shines upon us, it becomes truth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>TRUTH THE SHINING OF THE LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many Christians think that the word truth in the Bible denotes doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if we change truth in the Gospel of John into doctrine, it sounds absurd.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let us take several examples.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Grace and doctrine came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am the way, and the doctrine, and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You shall know the doctrine, and the doctrine shall set you free.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sanctify them in doctrine; Your word is doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But when He, the Spirit of doctrine comes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How absurd!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Bible truth does not denote doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It firstly means the shining of the light, the expression of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In other words, truth is light expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God never comes to us without shining upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When God comes to us as light and shines, we immediately have the sense of truth, of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A VISION TELEVISED INTO OUR BEING</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Television is a very good illustration of this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose there is a parade in Washington, D.C. Without television, you could not be on the West Coast and receive a vision of the parade.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although you could read about the parade the next day in a newspaper, the newspaper account would not make the parade real to you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many Christians today use the Bible like a newspaper, but they do not have the vision of what is written in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, the pastors of the Lutheran Church in China believed strongly in justification by faith, and they trained others to preach and teach this doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, some of these very pastors were not themselves justified by faith, and consequently they were not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One such pastor was a man named Ai.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although he fought for the truth of justification by faith, he was an opium smuggler.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He had the doctrine of justification by faith, that is, the newspaper account of it, but he did not have the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He had never received justification by faith through believing in the Lord s redeeming blood.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One day this pastor heard a Norwegian missionary named Miss Monson preach on regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Miss Monson preached not merely the doctrine of regeneration, but the reality of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After her message, she greeted Pastor Ai at the gate and asked him if he had been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He angrily asserted that he had.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But Miss Monson replied that by the tone of his voice and by the expression on his face, she knew that he had not truly been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Pastor Ai was insulted by having such a word spoken to him in the presence of members of his congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That night, filled with hatred for this Norwegian missionary, he plotted to kill her.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As he was making his evil plans, the Holy Spirit said to him, See how evil you are!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Holy Spirit worked upon him, and he repented with tears, even rolling on the floor as he made confession to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>That night Pastor Ai did not have merely a newspaper account of regeneration; he saw a vision of regeneration by means of the heavenly television.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The vision was televised into him, and he was regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The next morning he was happy, and he praised the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the meeting he stood up to give a testimony of his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Through that one testimony, given by a pastor who had been an opium smuggler, hundreds of students turned to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Through the experience of Pastor Ai we can see what truth is.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many preachers give messages that are nothing more than newspaper reports.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Such messages do not convey the heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But thank the Lord for the speaking that televises a vision to us!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The vision that is televised into our being is the truth, the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the New Testament truth denotes this kind of heavenly television.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Truth is not merely a report, not simply words written in the Bible; it is a heavenly, spiritual vision televised into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We all need to learn to differentiate the speaking that gives merely a news report from the speaking that televises a vision into us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Most of the sermons preached in the so-called churches today are like newspaper reports.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Because many preachers use the Bible like a newspaper, there is very little of the heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Every vision is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Suppose a meeting of the church in Anaheim is televised to Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The saints in Taipei would not receive a news report; they would see a vision of what is taking place in our meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In God s economy there are many visions.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>For example, when Christ died on the cross, He shed His blood for us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If this is merely a doctrine to us, we cannot be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But as soon as the reality of the death of Christ is televised into our being and we see it as a vision, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When I was a child, I was taught that Christ died on the cross for my sins and that He shed His blood for me.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This was nothing more than a doctrine to me until I was nineteen; then the heavenly vision of Christ s death was televised into me.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>At that time I could see Christ dying on the cross for me, shedding His blood for my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When I saw this, I wept, I worshipped, and I thanked the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>That experience was the vision, the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We all have had experiences similar to this.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Take the example of Christ as our holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Perhaps you have heard many messages about holiness, but as far as you are concerned, these messages are only news reports.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Therefore, you have the knowledge of holiness, but not the vision of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But one day, perhaps during morning watch, you have a vision of Christ being holiness to you, and the vision of holiness is televised into your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Because we all need to see the heavenly vision, in Ephesians 1 Paul prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Actually, such a spirit is simply the vision televised into our being by the Spirit.</S>
