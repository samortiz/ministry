<h2 class="head2">For the Completion of the Mystery of God</h2>
<p>The Triune God was also embodied in Christ for the completion of the mystery of God (Col. 2:2b). Christ is the mystery of God, and the mystery of God as God&rsquo;s very expression has been completed by Christ&rsquo;s being incarnated. Before the New Testament times, it would not have been possible to talk to Abraham or David about the mystery of God. One day God was incarnated to be a man. Paul invented this term <em>the mystery of God</em> to describe this God-man. Jesus Christ on this earth was the mystery of God. The mystery of God was completed in Christ&rsquo;s incarnation. God is altogether a mystery. At Abraham, David, and Malachi&rsquo;s time God was a mystery, and this mystery was not known by the sons of men until one day God was incarnated to be a man. This Man is the mystery of God. Paul described the event of the incarnation with the expression <em>the mystery of God.</em></p>
<h2 class="head1">TO DISPENSE THE RICHES OF CHRIST<br />
INTO GOD&rsquo;S CHOSEN PEOPLE</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is also to dispense the riches of Christ into God&rsquo;s chosen people (Eph. 3:8). The riches of God became the riches of Christ. Before the incarnation, the riches of God were not the riches of Christ. Regardless of how rich God was before His incarnation, He did not possess humanity among His riches. After the incarnation, another item was added to His riches&mdash;humanity. The riches of God became the riches of Christ because Christ has humanity. Today the very God, who has both divinity and humanity, is Christ.</p>
<p>God is different from what He was before His incarnation. Hebrews 13:8 tells us that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and forever. Some opposers have used this verse wrongly to say that Jesus Christ does not change. But we have to remember that Paul wrote this verse after the Lord&rsquo;s ascension, that is, after He had passed through the necessary processes to be completed. When Christ was being completed, He took two major steps, which were two major changes. John 1:14 tells us that the Word <em>became</em> flesh, and 1 Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam <em>became</em> a life-giving Spirit. The word <em>became</em> indicates a change and is applied to Christ twice. As the very God, He became flesh, and after thirty-three and a half years in the flesh, He became a life-giving Spirit. These are two wonderful changes. God changed to be the flesh, and the flesh changed to be the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>If God had not changed to be the flesh, we could not have been redeemed. God became flesh and died on the cross, shedding His human blood to redeem us, to take away our sin. After this, He entered into the tomb and Hades, entered into resurrection, and in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit for the purpose of imparting life into us. The flesh was for redemption and the Spirit is for the impartation of life. As the life-giving Spirit, Christ can impart His unsearchable riches into God&rsquo;s chosen people. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to have Himself embodied in Christ to dispense the riches of Christ into God&rsquo;s chosen people for the producing of the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:23) and for the completion of the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4), which is the church as Christ&rsquo;s fullness and expression.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE STEWARDSHIP OF GRACE</h2>
<p>The Greek word for economy, <em>oikonomia,</em> is translated as &ldquo;stewardship&rdquo; in Ephesians 3:2. The stewardship of the grace of God was given to Paul for the saints. A stewardship is an economy because a stewardship is an arrangement to carry out an administration. Paul was appointed to be a steward under God&rsquo;s arrangement to accomplish God&rsquo;s New Testament administration. A stewardship is a service. It is not a common service but a particular service. The stewardship is God&rsquo;s divine arrangement to carry out His New Testament administration. We may also say that the stewardship of grace is the economy of grace to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is His plan, and the stewardship is a service arranged by God to carry out His administration, that is, to carry out His eternal economy. God gave the Apostle Paul an economy, or a stewardship, which is an arrangement to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, His New Testament administration.</p>
<p>The stewardship of grace is to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy by God&rsquo;s grace, which is the processed Triune God to be our life and energy. Paul was one who carried out God&rsquo;s economy, not by his energy or talent but by the grace of God. We have to realize that today our meeting, which is according to God&rsquo;s ordained way, is a service, and this service is the very stewardship God assigned to us. Not only did the Apostle Paul receive such an assignment, but also all of us as members of the church have received the same assignment. We are not different from the Apostle Paul in this matter. He has received a stewardship and we have too.</p>
<p>We need to be brought into a high realization of our Christian meeting. Our meeting today is a stewardship, a service, to carry out God&rsquo;s economy. We carry out our stewardship by meeting. We are continuing to do the work of the Apostle Paul to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Whenever we meet, we serve. Whenever we meet, we are taking care of our stewardship to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This means that our meeting dispenses all the riches of Christ into the attendants, who are God&rsquo;s chosen people. In this book, we are talking about the scriptural way to meet and to serve. I use the words &ldquo;to serve&rdquo; because our meeting is a service which is really the divine stewardship assigned to us to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Whenever we as the attendants in a meeting dispense the processed Triune God into others, actually our meeting dispenses.</p>
<p>Our meeting must come up to this standard. Because I have seen a vision of all these things, I cannot go along with fallen Christianity. I must point out the degradation of today&rsquo;s Christianity so that we can be brought out of it. We must admit that in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there are still things that belong to this degradation. At present nearly all the churches are below the standard. Thus, we must endeavor to build up a meeting that dispenses the riches of Christ to all the attendants. Then our meeting will be uplifted to the standard of the genuine stewardship to carry out God&rsquo;s economy. The Lord has not recovered this meeting life to such a standard in the nearly two thousand years of church history. We do not want to continue to disappoint Him. We must endeavor to build up the meeting life until every meeting is the stewardship of God&rsquo;s economy to dispense all the riches of Christ into His chosen people. One day He will fully recover this matter, and this will be a real glory to the Triune God. Each of us has received the stewardship of grace, and in our localities, we must accomplish our stewardship. The economy of God has become our stewardship, and our stewardship is to carry out God&rsquo;s economy in a corporate way by meeting. We must count on the meetings for the carrying out of our stewardship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>Paul said in Ephesians 3:3 that the mystery of God&rsquo;s hidden purpose was made known to him by revelation. The mystery of God is Christ (Col. 2:2b), the mystery of Christ is the church (Eph. 3:4), and the great mystery is Christ and the church (Eph. 5:32). In the New Testament, the Apostle Paul completed the word of God in the mystery of God, which is Christ, and in the mystery of Christ, which is the church, to give us a full revelation of God&rsquo;s economy (Col. 1:25-29). This completing word is to announce Christ, to warn every man by Christ in all wisdom, and to teach every man with Christ in all wisdom that we may present every man full-grown in Christ (v. 28). We grow into Christ, and Christ is constituted into our very being to make us real Christ-men. We carry out our stewardship by laboring and struggling according to Christ&rsquo;s operation, which operates in us in power (v. 29).</p>
