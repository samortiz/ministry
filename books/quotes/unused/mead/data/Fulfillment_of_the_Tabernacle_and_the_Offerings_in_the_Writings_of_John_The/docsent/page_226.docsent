   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-TWO THE SIGNS IN JOHN TWENTY-ONE 2 Scripture Reading: John 21:1-25</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that all of John 21 is a sign, an aggregate sign.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Everything recorded in this chapter is a part of this aggregate sign.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall go on to consider more aspects of the sign in John 21.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FIRE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John 21:9 says, "When they got out then onto the land, they saw a fire of coals laid there, and fish lying on it and bread."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that this verse indicates the Lord's ability to provide food for His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we want to pay attention to the significance of the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This fire must have been a reminder to Peter of the fire by which he was warming himself on the night he denied the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Mark 14:54 says that Peter "was sitting with the deputies and warming himself in the light of the fire."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here in chapter twenty-one the Lord Jesus seemed to be saying to Peter, "The night I was betrayed and arrested, you were warming yourself by a fire when you denied Me. Now I have made a fire here in order to prepare food for you." Do you not think that this fire served as a reminder to Peter of that other fire?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, in John 21 Peter experienced the miracle concerning the abundance of fishes, and then he saw the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The miracle reminded Peter of the Lord's calling of him three and a half years before, and the fire reminded him of his denying the Lord some days before.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not think that the miracle of the fishes and the fire have no purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I believe that the Lord performed a miracle for the purpose of reminding Peter of His calling of him and also made a fire for the purpose of reminding Peter of his denying of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE LORD'S QUESTIONING OF PETER</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Peter denied the Lord Jesus, he denied Him three times.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now in John 21 the Lord asked Peter three times, "Do you love Me?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 15 says, "Then when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the night Peter denied the Lord, he said to Him, "Even if all shall be stumbled, yet I will not!"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Mark 14:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here in John 21 the Lord Jesus seemed to be saying to Peter, "Do you love Me more than the other disciples do?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You should remember your word spoken on the night I was betrayed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You told Me that even if all the others would fall away, you would not be stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, Peter, you were the one who denied Me. Now I ask you this question: Do you love Me more than all these?" To be sure, this question was a reminder of what Peter had done on the night he denied the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 21:15-17 two different Greek words are used for love: agapao and phileo.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Agapao denotes a love which is higher and nobler than phileo.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verse 15, agapao is used in the Lord's question, and phileo is used in Peter's answer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that Peter did not dare to say that he loved the Lord Jesus with a higher, nobler love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verse 16 agapao is again used in the Lord's question, and phileo is used in Peter's reply.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then in verse 17 phileo is used both for the question asked by the Lord Jesus and the answer given by Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This verse says, "He said to him the third time, Simon, son of John, do you love Me?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Peter was grieved that He said to him the third time, Do you love Me?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And he said to Him, Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here Peter seems to be saying, "Lord, when I boasted that I would not be stumbled because of You, I was full of self-confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You told me that I would deny You three times, and this happened, just as You said it would.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Lord, You know everything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You know that I love You."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not believe that Peter was at peace when the Lord was questioning him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was very troubled by the Lord's questions, and he may have felt like covering his face.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead of giving Peter a long message, the Lord set up a fire as a reminder to him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then He fed him and questioned him concerning his love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even though the Lord did not question Peter until the disciples had eaten breakfast, I find it hard to believe that Peter enjoyed that breakfast very much.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As he was eating, the fire must have reminded him of that other fire.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Immediately after breakfast, the Lord began to question Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord's third question bothered him very much.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In his answer Peter seemed to be saying, "Lord, You don't need me to tell You whether or not I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even if I say that I love You, I am not able in myself to fulfill my word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But whatever You say, Lord, will be fulfilled."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here also Peter was being trained by the Lord Jesus.</S>
