   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>To cherish the church is also an organic matter.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The word cherish is hard to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Note 1 of Ephesians 5:29 in the Recovery Version says, "To cherish is to nurture us with tender love and foster us with tender care, outwardly softening us through tender warmth that we may have soothing, comfortable rest inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the way Christ cares for the church, His Body."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may illustrate what the word cherish means by the relationship between a mother and her little child.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When a mother puts the little child in her bosom, she is cherishing the child.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She is warming the child up, comforting the child, and making the child happy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many times the mother will feed the child while the child is in her bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That little child in his mother's bosom receives everything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is given a room, a bed, food, drink, and comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The mother also rocks him to make him happy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe that all this is included in the word cherish.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To nourish is to feed, but the mother putting the child in her bosom is not merely feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is the mother affording everything to the child.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the way that Christ takes care of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should take care of the Body in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In our care for the church, there should be no condemnation, rebuking, or criticizing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead, there should be nourishing and cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To nourish and to cherish are altogether matters in life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are organic.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To control, to rebuke, to condemn, and to criticize are altogether organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I still remember what I shared in 1976 when we were on the life-study of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we were covering Matthew 20 and 23, I exhorted the elders not to control the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus told us that we are all brothers on the same level 23:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is the unique Lord and Instructor among us v. 10 . Once a brother becomes an elder, he is a slave to the saints in a church, and his wife becomes the wife of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The eldership is not a matter of a position in a hierarchical sense.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That is altogether organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we may ask, "Who should appoint the elders?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The New Testament shows us that the apostles who establish the churches should appoint them Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some have said that after the apostles appoint the elders in a church, they should keep their hands off the church, leaving it to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They have said that the apostles have no more right to touch or to interfere with the things concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Nee's word concerning this matter in The Normal Christian Church Life was misused by some.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 1948, eleven years after he first shared the messages in The Normal Christian Church Life, he released the messages contained in the book entitled Church Affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this book, he mentioned clearly that some brothers misunderstood his word in The Normal Christian Church Life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On page 149 of Church Affairs chapter nine , he said, "After the meeting in Hangkow, some brothers misunderstood that though the elders are appointed by the apostles, they do not have to listen to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is impossible."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The strongest proof of this is in Acts 20.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>While the apostle Paul was on his journey, he still had the burden to take care of the church in Ephesus, and he called for the elders of the church to come to him v. 17 . His word to them was not just a teaching, but a charge vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>18-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This shows that the apostle had an organic relationship with the churches he established.</S>
