   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why did he come up from underneath the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Liu, Feng Village</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Answer: It was his spirit, because his body had been buried and had already decayed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The spirit also has its form.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, the rich man in Hades still had eyes, a tongue, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Both Hades and Paradise are underneath the earth.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Question: Before the gospel of the Lord came to China, there were many God-fearing, righteous people who had not heard the gospel and had no knowledge to believe in the Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Lai, Chingliu</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Answer: One thing is certain, "There is no respect of persons with God" Rom 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Romans 2:7-8, 12-15 refers to this question.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE BAPTIZER</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Question: Baptism by immersion is the most scriptural method.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is the Lord's command.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But my previous baptism was not by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am aware of the fact that this is incomplete, and I really hope to be baptized by immersion in the near future.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I do not know who should be the baptizer or whether there are any qualifications for such a one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Please answer in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Lai, Chingliu</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Answer: It is correct to say that baptism by immersion is most scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no reason that any faithful child of God should be excused.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Baptism by a pastor is part of the system of the denominations today.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, is this the teaching of the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Where is there such an ordinance in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is but a poison of the Roman Catholic Church that has not been completely removed from the denominations!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the Bible baptism is committed to the "disciples" Matt 28:16, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The disciples were the Christians Acts 11:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, every disciple, or Christian, can baptize others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior can baptize others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Aside from this, all are human traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>RELEASING SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Question: In Revelation 20:7-8, since Satan has been locked up by then, and can be thrown into the lake of fire any time, why is he loosed to deceive many?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Lai, Chingliu</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Answer: It is very difficult for men to explain what God has ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, in the millennium many people will still be born.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They cannot be identified as being good or evil unless they are tested by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Furthermore, it seems that without this step, the millennium cannot come to a proper end, and the new heaven and new earth cannot be ushered in.</S>
