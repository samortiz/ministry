   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REVELATIONS RECEIVED FROM THE LORD 1922-1973 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Assurance of Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first thing the Lord showed us through Brother Nee was the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord sent many men of God to China as missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They preached the gospel, but they did not help people to know that they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before Brother Nee was raised up, no one had made the assurance of salvation clear among the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although they knew they were Christians, they did not think that a person could know he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They thought that it was too proud for a person to say that he knew he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Their concept was that they believed in the Lord Jesus, and they would do their best until the day they would see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In that day they would know whether or not they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To them it was only at that time they would be assured of their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They did not believe you could have the assurance of salvation today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many of the Chinese were really saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In a sense, they realized that they were children of God, but if you checked with them, they would not say that they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then the Lord raised up Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was so clear about the assurance of salvation, and this was the first thing which he saw from the Lord and ministered to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even by the time I entered into the work with him in 1933, we were still speaking messages on the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We always helped people to hold on to one verse for their assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is because their assurance was in the written Word of God with the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We would ask people to read a verse like John 3:16 until they realized that they were assured of their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Deviation of Christianity</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After Brother Nee was saved, he made the decision to read the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through his reading of the Bible, the Lord showed him the deviation of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christianity had deviated from the Scriptures and from the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Much of the practice of today's Christianity is a deviation from the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Church</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Mainly through Brother Nee, the Lord showed us the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the third main revelation the Lord gave us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We saw the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Nee told people that the church is not a building, an organization of Christianity, or a mission.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He declared that the church is an organism, the Body of Christ, and that in another sense, the church is the ekklesia, a Greek word referring to the church as the called-out assembly.</S>
