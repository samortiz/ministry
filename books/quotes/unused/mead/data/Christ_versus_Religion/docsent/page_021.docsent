   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE GREATER JONAH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now in chapter 12 again another religious matter is presented to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, Teacher, we would see a sign from thee" v. 38 . A sign is a miracle; it is something accomplished miraculously.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus, of course, performed a good number of miracles while He was on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when the religious people came and asked Him to perform some miracle, He would not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that the Lord Jesus never performs any miracle in a religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Humanly speaking, all people like to see miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To have this kind of disposition or inclination is entirely natural and religious.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If today the Lord would perform a miracle in our midst, we would all be excited that is wholly a natural and religious reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the scribes and Pharisees asked the Lord for a miracle He answered, "An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet: for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>39-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord said that He would not do any miracle for them; He just referred them to the sign of the prophet Jonah.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jonah spent three days and three nights in a whale, and eventually came out that was undoubtedly a kind of miracle, but it was not a miracle accomplished in a religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jonah's miracle was a miracle wrought in the way of resurrection a picture of the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ was put into the heart of the earth, even deeper than the belly of the big fish.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After three days and three nights He emerged in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This resurrection is Christ; this Christ in resurrection is the unique miracle for today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The natural and religious thought of man is that if we could perform miracles we could certainly build a good church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Never.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Through the miracles which the Lord performed while He walked on earth multitudes were attracted to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But eventually, following the Lord's ascension, there were only one hundred and twenty together in the upper room Acts 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I believe that represented less than one out of a thousand of those who flocked around the Lord in the Judean and Galilean villages and countryside.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At just one miracle of His, five thousand besides the women and children were fed Matt 14:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even after the Lord's resurrection, He appeared at one time to five hundred brothers I Cor.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>15:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet, after His ascension, only one hundred and twenty were gathered together.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Where were the others?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only those who really had some experience of the resurrected Christ as their life were the steadfast ones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The only thing that can build us into the church is not a miracle, but resurrected life, the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here we have a case of people coming to the Lord and asking for a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the Lord Jesus answers that there will be no sign, no miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The unique sign is that of resurrection, the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all must know, experience, possess, and be possessed by the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even Paul, near the end of his journey, expressed his longing desire to know Christ and the power of His resurrection Phil 3:10 , not the miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He himself had performed quite a number of miracles during his lifetime, but he did not count on that.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He only wanted to know Christ and His resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not an outward miraculous matter, but an inward resurrection matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not a matter of signs, wonders, and miracles, but a matter of the powerful, resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to see the resurrected Christ.</S>
