These messages were not reviewed by the speaker.</p></td></tr></table></div><h1 class=msg>CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SURPASSINGNESS OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:16; Acts 10:36; Eph. 1:21-23; Col. 1:18; Phil. 2:9; Rev. 19:16; 22:13; John 8:12; 11:25; 10:9; 14:6; 4:42</h1><h2 class=head1>CHRIST IN HIS EXCELLENCY</h2><p>The topic we will consider in this book is Christ in His excellency, or Christ in His supreme preciousness. No person, matter, or thing in the universe is more precious than the Lord Jesus. The expression Christ in His excellency or Christ in His supreme preciousness is not my invention. This thought has long existed in the New Testament and is used in reference to the Lord Jesus. In 2 Corinthians 4:7 Paul says that every saved one has a treasure within him. Who is this treasure? By reading the context of this verse, we can see that this treasure is the glorious Christ. He has come into us to be the treasure within us.<h2 class=head1>THE EXCELLENCY OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST</h2><p>Furthermore, Paul said that he did not consider that only the Lord Jesus Himself is excellent, but even the knowledge of the Lord Jesus is the most excellent thing. The Chinese people appreciate the teachings of Confucius, but no one regards the knowledge of Confucius&#8217; teachings as the most precious thing. When I was young, I really liked the principles of The Great Learning by Confucius, but I never considered them something very precious. However, when I was saved at the age of nineteen, I began to read the Bible, and my eyes were opened wide to know the Lord Jesus. At that time, I felt that in the Bible the words describing the Lord Jesus were not only sweet but also precious, and they were even excellent. Therefore, I truly liked to read the Bible, especially the New Testament. I delighted in it to such an extent that I was completely captured, especially by the words that I read concerning the Lord Jesus. The entire summer of that year I did not leave my house except to go to the Lord&#8217;s Day meetings; I just stayed home reading the Bible. Even my mother was astonished, wondering what it was that had captivated her son to the extent that he would not leave the house for an entire summer and that apart from the time spent eating and sleeping, all he did was read the Bible. Even while eating I was reading the Bible. Furthermore, I shut myself up alone every night to read the Bible. The more I read the Bible, the more I sensed its preciousness. I read it again and again, and even when I went to bed, I still laid there reading it.<p>In those days kerosene lamps were used instead of electric lights. I was always reluctant to blow out my lamp. I would read even one verse of the Scriptures over and over, and there would be a real sense of sweetness and preciousness within me. I read the Bible until I was so tired that I had to go to sleep, but I would leave the Bible open at the verse that I had enjoyed and place it beside my pillow. When I woke up, before I even lifted my head from the pillow, the first thing I would look at was that particular verse, and I felt that it was so precious.<p>I am really captivated by the words in the Bible concerning the Lord Jesus, so I can truly understand why Paul would say, &#8220;The excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.&#8221; Paul was born into a Jewish family, and he was a genuine Judaizer. He had been under the training of Gamaliel, a famous teacher of Judaism at that time; therefore, he was influenced by the Jewish religion basically through Gamaliel. Furthermore, history tells us he was born in a big city-what Americans today would call a university town, because there was a Greek university there. Paul was educated there, so his Greek was very good. All the scholars acknowledge that the Greek Paul used in writing the New Testament was superb. Thus, Paul was one who had tasted the full flavor of the Jewish religion and also had been deeply soaked in the Greek culture with its profound philosophy and literature.<p>The so-called Western culture today evolved from a tripodal culture which includes first the Hebrew religion, second Greek philosophy and culture, and third Roman government and law. Among these three, Hebrew religion and Greek philosophy and culture are most important. Paul received a profound training in both of these aspects. Thus, he could boast that he was a Hebrew and also a Pharisee. (At that time, the Pharisees were the moralists and the cultured gentlemen.) As to the righteousness which was in the law, he was zealous to keep the law, and he might be considered a high level, genuine disciple of the Jewish religion. On the other hand, his Greek was very good, and he had a high appreciation for the Greeks.<p>It was at that time that he was zealously persecuting and killing the believers of Jesus. He thought that the believers of Jesus were a low class people, of the sect of the Nazarene of Galilee. He thought that all those people had been enchanted and deceived, so he had to eradicate them. He could not allow his countrymen to be deceived by these people, so he wanted to cut them off. We all know this story.<p>As Paul was on his way to bind and arrest the believers of Jesus, the Lord Jesus appeared to him from heaven. In Paul&#8217;s understanding, Jesus had been crucified and buried in the earth. Yet, on the day that Paul was on the road to Damascus with the intention to arrest and persecute the believers of Jesus, suddenly there was a voice from heaven and the flashing of a great light. When the great light flashed around him, he fell to the ground and heard a voice from the heavens saying, &#8220;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&#8221; Saul was very surprised. Knowing that this voice was coming from the heavens, he had the fear of God and cried out, &#8220;Who are You, Lord?&#8221; The Lord Jesus answered, &#8220;I am Jesus, whom you persecute.&#8221; This made him even more surprised. He may have thought, &#8220;I persecuted Stephen; I persecuted the believers of Jesus. Was Jesus not crucified? Was He not buried? How can He say that I am persecuting Him?&#8221; Here the Lord wanted Paul to know that He had resurrected from the dead and had ascended, so He could appear to Him from heaven. Paul not only heard a voice, but he also saw a great light with his own eyes; this was the Lord&#8217;s special grace to him. Hence, from that time onward Paul had a great change of concept. It was at that time that he received the revelation from the heavens.<p>I truly believe that after Paul met the Lord on the road to Damascus, he received a heavenly revelation and suddenly became clear. Previously, when he was under the teaching of Gamaliel, he was full of knowledge concerning the tabernacle, the altar, the ark, the golden lampstand, the showbread table, and other things, yet he could not understand their significances. It was not until the time the Holy Spirit came to him that he understood all these things. He now knew that the ark was Christ and that the altar was the cross. He understood what the golden lampstand and the showbread table were. He realized that the entire Old Testament was concerning Christ. Thus, he began to appreciate Christ. This was why he said in Philippians 3 that he regarded the knowledge of Christ as most excellent. The knowledge of the Jewish Bible and the Greek culture is good, but it is not most excellent. The knowledge of Christ as the Son of the living God and as the Lord of all is the most excellent thing. Therefore, in the Epistles which Paul wrote in the New Testament, he repeatedly used the word excellency.<p>The Greek word which is translated into excellency in English as a noun is rendered as most precious in Chinese. In Greek the word means to reach the zenith, that is, to be excelling to the utmost. This word is very close to super-excelling-unsurpassably excellent. In Paul&#8217;s knowledge, Christ surpasses everything. What Paul meant is that Christ excels not only in His position but even more in His virtues, His being, His substance, His nature, and all His attainments. As God, He is exceedingly divine. As man, He is the Man of men. He is the Holiest of the holy, and the Man of all men. Although these words are profound, they still cannot truly express Paul&#8217;s original meaning. What he meant to say was that he had studied the Hebrew religion and had received a deep training in the Greek culture, but to him the knowledge of these matters could not compare with the knowledge of Christ. Thus, the knowledge of Christ is supreme and ultimate.<h2 class=head1>THE BIBLICAL REVELATION OF THE EXCELLENT CHRIST</h2><p>I would like to testify to you that I was saved before reaching the age of twenty, and now I am nearly eighty; in these nearly sixty years, I have been reading the Bible almost every day and have worn out several Chinese Bibles. I have been in America for twenty-two years, and I have also worn out several English Bibles. In my study I have more than forty different English versions of the Bible. Now I have been working together with some brothers on the Recovery Version of the New Testament in English, and for each book I have spent at least several months writing the footnotes. In order to write the footnotes, I needed to read the works of many people and check with the authoritative references. After studying the Bible in this fine and detailed way for many years, I confess that the Bible is truly the Book of books. This is why in English it is called &#8220;The Book,&#8221; meaning that the Bible is the unique book, the book over all other books. This Bible is truly very precious! We may illustrate the preciousness of the Bible in the following way. I have been with the American brothers for twenty-two years, and they have often said, &#8220;Brother Lee, no matter which book of the Bible you take up, after you have written some footnotes and explained the verses in a training, that book becomes a new book.&#8221; Once they said, &#8220;We used to think that there was nothing in 1 and 2 Peter and that these Epistles were very dry and boring to read, but since your recent speaking, 1 and 2 Peter have become rich and fresh, full of revelation and light.&#8221; They also said to me, &#8220;In the past almost no one liked to read Exodus, but ever since you released the messages in the Life-study of Exodus, everyone feels that this book is truly precious. We see that the entire book of Exodus is full of the riches and revelations of Christ that bring us into the reality of Christ. It is truly very precious.&#8221;<p>Let me give you another example. In 1975 when I covered the Gospel of John in Washington, DC, I gave thirty messages, and later I gave tens of other supplementary messages. Thus, now the printed Life-study of John has fifty-one messages. Recently, however, I have had a burden to come back to speak on the essence of the Gospel of John. The Gospel of John is simply inexhaustible.<p>The biblical revelation of the Lord Jesus is very mysterious and precious. No wonder Paul said, &#8220;What things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss...on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord&#8221; (Phil. 3:7-8).<h2 class=head1>THE SURPASSINGNESS OF CHRIST</h2><p>In this message we will look at ten major points concerning the surpassingness of Christ based on the verses in the Scripture reading above.<h2 class=head2>A. Christ Being the Son of the Living God</h2><p>Matthew 16:16 says, &#8220;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&#8221; The Lord Jesus Christ is surpassing because He is the Son of the living God. The living God means that God not only has life, but He also moves. God moves in the universe, so He is the living God. Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God.<h2 class=head2>B. Christ Being the Lord of All</h2><p>Acts 10:36 says, &#8220;The word which He sent...in announcing the gospel of peace through Jesus Christ (this One is Lord of all).&#8221; Christ is the Lord of all. The word all actually includes all people, matters, and things. The Lord Jesus is the Lord of all people, matters, and things. He is the Lord of all. Many times I preached the gospel based on this verse of the Bible. In mainland China I said that everything has its owner, master, and lord; there is nothing in the universe that is without a lord. Who then is your lord? You may say that your parents are your lord, but when you grow up, your parents can no longer be the lord over you; in the end your parents will become dependent on you. The wives may say, &#8220;Our husbands are our lords.&#8221; However, when your husbands get sick, they have to depend on you and can no longer be your lords. Then who is really our Lord? Only the Lord Jesus is our Lord. It is truly marvelous that those who believe in any religion do not say that they believe in a lord; only those who believe in the Lord Jesus say that they have believed in the Lord. This is because only the Lord Jesus is the Lord in the universe; no one else is the Lord.<p>May I ask you who the Lord in the universe is? Heaven and earth are so great and we humans are so meaningful, yet can you say that we do not have an owner? We do have an owner; Jesus is our Owner. We all belong to the Lord Jesus. He is our Lord. Only what He says counts. As parents, children, husbands, and wives, we all rely on Him. He is the Lord of all. He truly is surpassing. None of the great philosophers, anywhere and at any time, such as Confucius, Socrates, and Plato, ever dared to call himself Lord. On the contrary, Confucius only said, &#8220;He who offends heaven cannot pray.&#8221; His word indicated that he was not the Lord. But the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I am the light of the world&#8221;; &#8220;I am the life&#8221;; I am the door&#8221;; and &#8220;I am the way.&#8221; No other person has said these words. Over the past two thousand years everyone believes these great words spoken by the Lord Jesus because these are true words. Jesus is Lord; He is the Lord of all.<h2 class=head2>C. Christ Being the Head of All, the One Who Fills All in All</h2><p>Christ is our Lord, and even more He is the Lord of all. He is not only the Lord but also the Head. Ephesians 1:21-23 says that He is &#8220;far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come&#8221; and that God &#8220;subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&#8221; Jesus Christ is the Head of all and the One who fills all in all. He is not only above all as the Head, He is also in all as the One who fills all. He fills the heavens, the earth, and all things. He is truly marvelous and surpassing. He is far above all rule and authority and power and lordship. According to the original language of the Bible, this passage refers to Satan&#8217;s administrative personnel and helpers in the air. Christ is far above all these and everything that is not only in this age but also in the coming age. Furthermore, God subjected all things under Christ&#8217;s feet and gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church. Christ was given to be Head over all things for the sake of the church. The church is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.<p>Without Christ, man is vanity. The wise King Solomon said, &#8220;Vanity of vanities; all is vanity&#8221; (Eccl. 1:2). Without Christ, your house is vanity, your car is vanity, and your Ph.D. is vanity; being a parent is vanity, being a son or daughter is vanity, and being a husband or wife is vanity. Everything is vanity. Without Christ, all persons, matters, and things are vanity; only Christ is the reality. Christ should fill all people, matters, and things. Only Christ is superior; everything before our eyes is inferior. Only Christ is true and real; He is the surpassing One.<h2 class=head2>D. Christ Being the Head of the Church</h2><p>Today Christ is the Head of the church. Colossians 1:18a says, &#8220;He is the Head of the Body, the church.&#8221;<h2 class=head2>E. Christ Having the Preeminence in All Things</h2><p>Fifth, Christ has the preeminence in all things. Colossians 1:18b says, &#8220;He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things.&#8221; If we would allow Him to have the preeminence in all things and in everything, then we will be blessed. We should let Him have the preeminence in everything: in our married life, in our family life, in our parent-child relationships, in our buying and selling of property, in our bank accounts, in our education, and in all our business affairs. Christ should have the first place in all things.<h2 class=head2>F. Christ Having Obtained the Name Which Is Above Every Name</h2><p>Philippians 2:9 says, &#8220;Therefore also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name.&#8221; God not only exalted Christ to the highest position, but He also bestowed on Him the name which is above every name. In the universe today the name Jesus Christ surpasses all other names; it is above every name.<h2 class=head2>G. Christ Being the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords</h2><p>Revelation 19:16 says, &#8220;And He has on His garment and on His thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.&#8221; Christ is the King of kings and the Lord of lords. I truly believe this word. I often give the following illustration. Today even the atheistic Communist countries use the Western calendar. Do you know whose calendar this is? It is the calendar of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Chinese people all know that when a country uses a certain person&#8217;s calendar, the country belongs to that person. This year is the one thousand nine hundred eighty-third year of the Lord Jesus, and the entire world today uses this calendar. This clearly shows that the earth is our Lord Christ&#8217;s. There have been many great men throughout the ages, but all of them died, and no one remembers most of them. However, the Lord Jesus Christ is different; the more people oppose Him, the more transcendent He is; the more people oppose Him, the more people believe in Him; the more people oppress Him, the more He multiplies.<p>In 1949 before I left Shanghai, I calculated that there were no more than three million Christians, including the Catholics, in China at that time. A couple of years ago, a report in a Hong Kong newspaper said that there are thirty to forty million Christians in mainland China. In one county of a certain province alone, there are one hundred fifty thousand Christians who are there calling on the Lord&#8217;s name, pray-reading His word, and enjoying Christ. If you read history carefully, you will see that the clever kings would not persecute the Christians because they knew that whoever persecutes the Christians will never have a good end. Hitler, who was the worst persecutor of God&#8217;s people in modern times, had a very pitiful end, dying without a proper place for burial. History also tells us that any government that persecuted Jesus Christ has fallen very quickly. The Manchu dynasty in China was ended because it instigated the Boxers to kill the Christians. This is known as the Boxer Rebellion in modern Chinese history. Christ is the King of kings and the Lord of lords. No one else is lord, neither the Roman Caesars nor Napoleon nor Hitler; only Jesus Christ is the Lord. He is the King of kings and the Lord of lords.<h2 class=head2>H. Christ Being the First, the Last, the Beginning, and the End</h2><p>Christ is the First, the Last, the Beginning, and the End. The First, the Last, the Beginning, and the End are all He. Revelation 22:13 says, &#8220;I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.&#8221; When I first read the Bible, I did not understand this word; I felt that the Bible was somewhat repetitive. I thought that the First and the Last were the same as the Beginning and the End. However, the Bible says that Christ is the First and the Last; He is the first One, and He is also the last One; He is the Beginning and the End. Is this repetitive? I gradually received the light to understand that the First means the first One, and the Last means the last One. Hence, one of the hymns we sing says, <p class=hbody>Thine origin, the same as God,<br>Before creation was decreed!<br>Before the foremost, Thou art first,<br>None other doth Thyself precede!</p><p class=hbody>Thou never changest thru all time,<br>Thy years are to eternity!<br>None is as lasting as Thyself,<br>Nor is there any after Thee!</p><p class=hbody>Just as the Father, diff&#8217;ring not,<br>The same perfection Thou too hast!<br>Thou art the Alpha and the First,<br>Thou art Omega and the Last!</p><p class=hbody>(Hymns, #81)</p><p>As to the first, Christ is the foremost; as to the last, Christ is the hindmost. The beginning is He, and the end is also He. He is always the First; no one precedes Him. He is also the Last; no one is behind Him. Furthermore, He is the Beginning and the End. You can be the first, but you may not be the originator. You can also be the last, but you may not be the finisher. Christ is not only the First but also the Originator; He is not only the Last but also the Finisher. In other words, in this universe from beginning to end, all is Christ.<h2 class=head2>I. Christ Being the Light, the Life, the Door, and the Way</h2><p>We have already seen that Christ is surpassing, eternal, unlimited, and complete, but how does this relate to us? The relationship depends on His being the light, the life, the door, and the way. In John 8:12 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.&#8221; In 11:25 He said, &#8220;I am the resurrection and the life.&#8221; In 10:9 He said, &#8220;I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved.&#8221; And in 14:6 He said, &#8220;I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.&#8221; Dear friends, who among you does not want these four things? Who does not want light, life, a door, and a way? Everyone wants these four things. I would also like to tell you that for our whole life and even until eternity we will always need light, life, a door, and a way. And this light, this life, this door, and this way are the Lord Jesus. Christ Himself is the light, the life, the door, and the way.<h2 class=head2>J. Christ Being the Savior of the World</h2><p>Finally, Christ is the Savior of the world. The Lord Jesus was in a city of Samaria called Sychar when He told a Samaritan woman about the living water of life. After that woman believed in the Lord, she left her water pot and went away into the city to testify to all the people. Many Samaritans came to the Lord Jesus because of that woman&#8217;s testimony. Then many more believed because of the Lord&#8217;s word, and they said to that woman, &#8220;It is no longer because of your speaking that we believe, for we ourselves have heard and know that this One is truly the Savior of the world&#8221; (John 4:39-42). Hallelujah, our Lord Jesus is the Savior of the world!<p>This is the Christ of supreme preciousness; He is truly surpassing. He is the Son of the living God, the Lord of all, the Head of all things, the One who fills all in all, the Head of the church, the One who takes the first place in all things, and the One who has obtained the name which is above all names. Moreover, He is the King of kings, the Lord of lords, the First, the Last, the Beginning, the End, the light, the life, the door, the way, and the Savior of the world. The One whom we have obtained today is such an excellent Christ.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE TRANSCENDENCE OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Phil. 3:6-10; 2 Cor. 4:7</h1><p>Philippians 3:8 says, &#8220;On account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.&#8221; Second Corinthians 4:7 says, &#8220;But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us.&#8221; The words excellency and transcendence are very close in meaning to Paul&#8217;s words in the original language, both meaning super-eminence. Based on these two verses, we know that the Christ in whom we believe and whom we experience is the One who surpasses and transcends all. If we carefully consider these two verses, we will know what kind of heart and understanding we should have in order to comprehend Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE REPLACEMENTS OF CHRIST</h2><h2 class=head2>Human Culture</h2><p>Today we are in an era in which human culture is already six thousand years old. In these six thousand years, human society has had many inventions, and the first invention was human culture. Genesis 1 shows us that God&#8217;s purpose in creating man in His image and after His likeness was that man might express Him. Regretfully, before this purpose could be fulfilled, Satan came and tempted man to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The result was that man was joined to Satan. Thus, man fell away from God&#8217;s will and lost God. Once man lost God, he did not have any protection, satisfaction, or joy. Therefore, man invented culture as a substitute for God. Genesis 4 shows us that the first few generations of human beings invented different kinds of weapons for self-defense; they invented different kinds of tools for cattle-raising and farming to feed and satisfy themselves; and they invented musical instruments for their amusement (vv. 20-22).<p>Protection, satisfaction, and enjoyment are man&#8217;s three great needs. Originally, God met these three needs, but after man lost God, human culture was invented as a replacement of God to meet these three needs. Today the things sold in the stores are all for man to be protected, satisfied, and entertained. Man needs these things because he does not have God. If we have God, then He is our safeguard, satisfaction, and joy. Today the most cultured countries are all trying to meet these three kinds of need. They spend large amounts of money on national defense for man&#8217;s protection; they develop industry and improve agriculture for man&#8217;s satisfaction; and they promote different kinds of recreation and music for man&#8217;s amusement. This shows that man does not have God within him. Without God, man needs these things.<h2 class=head2>Religion</h2><p>Man realized that he still was not inwardly satisfied with human culture alone, even though he had protection, food, and amusement. Why is this? It is because these three things can satisfy the needs only in man&#8217;s body and soul but cannot meet the need in his spirit. There is a need in the spirit of man that cannot be satisfied with anything apart from God. Hence, man invented worship.<p>Over the past six thousand years, all nations, whether big or small, barbaric or civilized, all have engaged in the worship of birds, beasts, creeping things, or other kinds of idols. This is what Paul said in Romans 1, that man changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds, four-footed animals, and reptiles. For example, the Japanese people worship snakes and superstitiously believe that snakes can get rid of evil. The Chinese worship dragons and believe that dragons can bring good fortune. In addition, the Persians worship fire. There is really no end to these strange things. People have all kinds of worship, but they worship wrongly. Worship is a human necessity. A more civilized term for the word worship is religion. Religion is a human invention; it is the product of human culture. Religion teaches people according to the object of their worship; the teaching is based on what they worship. Furthermore, religion is also used to regulate man&#8217;s heart. This is why the rulers throughout the ages would never reject religion. In their consideration, it is more effective to have religion along with culture. Religion is a great help to culture.<p>We all know that based on Marxism, Lenin advocated atheism and practiced communism, but the result proved that this was ineffective. Within humans there is the need for religion. At present, in the Soviet Union the percentage of people who go to church for Sunday worship is greater than that in England. The spirit in man needs God. Hence, man cannot be a godless man; even atheists need God. Around 1954 I read a newspaper article in the Philippines which said that when Beria, the chief secret agent under Stalin, was on the execution field, the execution officer gave him a few minutes and told him that whatever he asked for would be given to him. At the hour of his death, Beria said, &#8220;I want a Bible.&#8221; Such an atheist, a real Communist chief secret agent, asked for a Bible before his death. This tells us that within him there was a need for God. Later, Kruschev, the man who pronounced the death sentence on Beria, was banished to Siberia. I once read a booklet which said that when Kruschev was in Siberia, he repented and believed in the Lord. The Chinese have a saying: &#8220;A man speaks the good when he is about to die.&#8221; When a person is about to die, he cannot be hardened; he will repent and believe in God. Everyone needs God.<p>I believe that some people have read the book Fragrant Myrrh, which is the autobiography of a French woman named Madame Guyon who lived over three hundred years ago. Madame Guyon was born into an aristocratic French family. One evening she attended an elegant ball and danced until late that night. Upon returning home she sat there asking herself, &#8220;What meaning does this have? My own family and my husband&#8217;s family are both aristocrats and are wealthy. Everything is available for my enjoyment. I do not know how many balls like this I have attended, but what meaning did tonight&#8217;s ball have?&#8221; The more she thought about it, over and over again, the more she felt it was meaningless. She took off her dancing shoes and gown and threw them down on the floor. In that instant, she felt that she should get up and pray to the Lord. From the depths of her being she prayed to the Lord, and her entire person changed. Later, Madame Guyon became a spiritual person with a deeper experience of the Lord than many in those hundred years following the bringing in of the Reformation by Martin Luther. Her experiences became a help for the next three hundred years to those seeking the growth of the inner life. This also proves that in man&#8217;s deepest part there is a need which only God can satisfy.<p>The Bible often uses the word thirst to describe this human need. Man has a need like that of a thirsty person who needs to drink water. If someone is thirsty and you give him billions of dollars worth of gold, silver, and precious stones, it still will not quench even the slightest bit of his thirst. Only a glass of water can quench his thirst.<p>The thirst of the human spirit can be quenched only by the living water. Who is this living water? The Bible says that this living water is God Himself, the Lord Jesus, and the Spirit (John 7:37-39). God is the source of the living water, the Lord Jesus is the course of the living water, and the Holy Spirit is the flowing into us of the living water. God flowed out in Christ, and Christ became the Spirit of life to flow into us as the living water. Only this living water can quench the thirst of man&#8217;s spirit. Hence, this living water is what everyone needs.<h2 class=head2>Ethics</h2><p>Moreover, in human culture people discovered that man is corrupted. Although man&#8217;s corruption is not always manifested, there is, nevertheless, the seed of corruption within him. However, people discovered that within man there is also good. Therefore, the Chinese philosophers argued as to whether man&#8217;s nature is good or evil. Both theories are correct. When God created man, his human nature was good, but after man fell, his nature became evil. Thus, ethics were produced and added to human culture. The ancient Chinese sages all spoke about ethics.<h2 class=head2>Tradition</h2><p>Every nation has its own traditions. The Chinese have their traditions that were handed down from their ancestors through the generations. These traditions are in the blood of the Chinese people. In the same way, the Japanese, the Arabs, the Indians, and the Jews all have their own traditions.<p>We all know that when someone is born, he is right away under the four great, permeating influences of culture, religion, ethics, and tradition. Today the entire human society is influenced by these four items, even to the extent that man has become a composition of these four items. Simply put, man is an entity of culture, religion, ethics, and tradition combined. I have spoken about these four matters, but these are not my burden; my burden is Christ. These four items are not Christ; they are all replacements of Christ.<p>Stanza 3 of Hymns, #541 says, <p class=hbody>Not philosophy nor Any element Can to Christ conform us As His complement; But &#8217;tis Christ Himself who All our nature takes And in resurrection Us His members makes.<p>No philosophy or ethical element can produce the members of Christ, nor can they produce the Body of Christ-an organic church. Stanza 4 says, <p class=hbody>Not religion, even Christianity, Can fulfill God&#8217;s purpose Or economy; But &#8217;tis Christ within us As our all in all Satisfies God&#8217;s wishes, And His plan withal. <p>All our problems are due to our lack of Christ. If we lack Christ, we are like a human body lacking nutrition, and this allows all kinds of sickness to come in. Once the nutrients are balanced and complete, then the sickness goes away. This is similar to what stanza 5 says, <p class=hbody>All the gifts we&#8217;re given By the Lord in grace, All the different functions Cannot Christ replace. Only Christ Himself must Be our all in all! Only Christ Himself in All things, great or small!<h2 class=head1>CHRIST BEING DIFFERENT FROM RELIGION</h2><p>This surpassing Christ, this transcendent Christ, is different from religion. Most people confuse Christ and religion, thinking that Christ is the founder of the Christian religion. Strictly speaking, this is not accurate. In Philippians 3:6 Paul said, &#8220;As to zeal, persecuting the church; as to the righteousness which is in the law, become blameless.&#8221; These two clauses tell us that Paul had been one hundred percent a Jewish religionist. The Jewish religion is a religion which is formed according to God&#8217;s holy Word in the Old Testament. It keeps God&#8217;s holy Word and teaches people to worship the unique, true God and to act and behave according to His commandments that they may please Him. However, those who have read the four Gospels in the New Testament all know that the true God whom the Jews had worshipped from antiquity was one day incarnated to be a man. God Himself became flesh, was born in a manger, grew up in a poor family, and came out of a despised, remote region. He was Jesus, who is God, the Creator. He is the God of the universe, the Lord of all. The name Jesus means Jehovah the Savior or the salvation of Jehovah. Therefore, Jesus in the New Testament refers to Jehovah in the Old Testament.<p>Recently I read a tenet of faith, which was put out by a very large, respected denomination. It said that the One who visited Abraham in Genesis 18, the Jehovah whose feet Abraham washed, for whom he killed a calf and spread a feast, and with whom Abraham ate, was the Jesus in the New Testament. This is definitely right. However, the Jews wanted their traditional religion and rejected the Savior Jesus Christ. When the Lord Jesus came to the temple, the Jews considered Him a Samaritan and one who had a demon (John 8:48); they did not want the Lord Jesus. Please tell me, who crucified the Lord Jesus? It was not merely Pilate the Roman governor, because he was in favor of releasing Jesus; three times he declared that he found no fault in Jesus. The Jews, however, demanded that Pilate release Barabbas the robber and crucify Jesus. Therefore, it was the Jewish religion, the high priest, the Pharisees, and the elders who crucified the Lord through the hands of the Romans soldiers. The religionists care for religion; they do not care for Christ.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST BEING FAR SUPERIOR TO ALL THINGS AND MATTERS</h2><p>Before Paul was saved, his name was Saul, and he was zealous for the Jewish religion. Acts 9:1-2 says, &#8220;But Saul, still breathing threatening and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest and asked for letters from him to Damascus for the synagogues, so that if he found any who were of the Way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.&#8221; He was not only zealous for religion, but even more, he was carrying out the orders of the religious leaders to arrest anyone who called on the name of the Lord. However, as he was on the road to Damascus, the Lord Jesus came, and a light from heaven flashed around him. Then he fell to the ground and received revelation. After this incident, he understood that the entire Old Testament spoke of this Jesus whom he had persecuted. He began to know Christ and went on further to appreciate Christ. Thus, he was able to write the book of Philippians, telling people that he had once been zealous in the Jewish religion. As to zeal, he persecuted the church with the intention to completely eliminate the church; as to the righteousness which is in the law, he became blameless. But the things which had been gains to him, these he now counted as loss on account of Christ (Phil. 3:6-7). In the past, he did not have Christ, so he practiced the righteousness which is in the law and considered it a gain, but now he counted it as loss on account of Christ. This is because Christ is far superior to religion and the law.<p>In January and February of 1937, I went from Shanghai, passing through Hangchow, to Nanking to hold a gospel conference. During that conference, a group of highly educated people came to hear the gospel. One of them was a very modern lady who listened with complete attention to the gospel that I was preaching. After one evening meeting, she came up to the front to see me and said, &#8220;Mr. Lee, what you have preached in these past few evenings has touched me very much; I am willing to believe. But I would like to ask you if I can do a certain thing after I have believed in the Lord. If I can do it, then I will certainly believe the gospel which you preach. My believing is totally dependent on your answer to this question.&#8221; Then she continued, &#8220;After believing in the Lord, I will be able to give up anything, but there is one thing that will be very difficult for me to give up. I like to go to the opera. From my youth I went to the opera with my father, and I have become addicted to it. I can give up breathing, but if I cannot go to the opera, then I&#8217;ll not be able to live. My husband has also been influenced by me. Now that I have heard you speak about Jesus, you have really persuaded me and made me very willing to believe. But if I believe in the Lord Jesus and cannot go to the opera, what will I do? If you say that I cannot go, then I will not believe. If you say that I can go, then I will believe.&#8221; This question was certainly a hard one to answer. It so happened that by her side she had a three- or four-year-old child, and the Lord gave me wisdom to answer. I said, &#8220;Madam, all children like to play with knives. If your child was playing with a sharp knife and was about to have an accident, what would you do? Would you grab the knife away from him?&#8221; She was very clever and immediately thought of the chocolate candy which was so famous in Shanghai and Nanking at that time, so she said, &#8220;That is easy; I would scatter pieces of chocolate candy all over the floor, then the child would go to pick up the candy, and in the end he would not want the knife.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Chinese opera is a sharp knife. Without Christ, you have nothing that can satisfy you, so you need to go to the opera. But now I am scattering the pieces of chocolate candy. Do you see? I have lots of &#8216;chocolate&#8217;; this is Christ. Do not ask me if you can go to the opera, but only believe in Christ and see if He satisfies you to the extent that you will not want other things.&#8221; She said, &#8220;That is very reasonable; I will believe in Him.&#8221; Christ is truly far superior to all other things and matters.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST BEING ALSO SUPERIOR TO ETHICS AND PHILOSOPHY</h2><p>In China I once met some scholars who studied the works of Confucius and Mencius, and when I preached the gospel of the Lord Jesus to them, they all said very proudly, &#8220;You Christians who believe the Western religion preached by the Westerners are very shallow. The Western culture is materialistic and superficial, so why should we follow it? Our upbringing is not like a tree without roots or water without a source, but it is with roots and with a source, as what Wang Yang-ming the philosopher said.&#8221; If I had not had some foundation in the truth, I would have been confounded by their speaking. In spite of the fact that the philosophers have good things, the best of their good things is merely brass, and when real gold is brought out, the brass is shown to be worthless. The Lord gave me wisdom, and I would say to such scholars, &#8220;Sir, please do not be hasty. Show me the teachings of Confucius and Mencius, and I will also read a few verses of the Bible to you so that we can make a comparison.&#8221; Eight or nine times out of ten, this kind of person would bring out The Great Learning because this book is their specialty. It says that the principle of the great learning is in developing the bright virtue, in introducing new life to people, and in attaining the highest good. Even though this is good, it is still merely brass. They brought out the doctrine of the great learning, so I brought out the Word of mystery, saying, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality&#8221; (John 1:1, 14). This is not the bright virtue; this is grace and reality. The bright virtue is the conscience, and to develop the bright virtue is to cultivate the conscience. If the conscience were not cultivated, it would be dimmed; this is to neglect the bright virtue, to disregard the conscience. I said to one person, &#8220;Sir, please speak according to your conscience. If your son and someone else&#8217;s son both went to take a competitive examination and the other person&#8217;s son passed while your son failed, would you be happy or not?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Of course, I would not be very happy.&#8221; He said this even though to be unhappy is to disregard the bright virtue instead of developing it.<p>The Bible speaks of God, of the Word who was in the beginning, and of the Word becoming flesh. This Word, however, is not the doctrine of great learning; this Word is God. When the Word became flesh, that was God coming to the earth as a man. When God came, both grace and reality came. The Chinese philosophers do not know what reality is. I told the scholars that the so-called ethics and morality were created by God for man. Philippians 4:8 says that we must take account of the things which are true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of; this means that we must live these virtues out. These virtues, which were created by God for man and are all in the human nature, are only empty shells and are not the reality; they are empty terms, having only a name and are without reality.<p>When God became a man, that is, when the Lord Jesus came to be our Savior, He brought the reality of these virtues with Him. Then He died for us, was resurrected, and became the life-giving Spirit to enter into us, His believers, to be our life and our content. In this way He lives out of us a kind of living that is true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of. When this happens, man has not only empty terms and expressions, but he also has the reality. The reality is not lived out by us; it is lived out by God from within us-after He became the life-giving Spirit to come into our spirit as our life.<p>I can testify that some of the Chinese Confucian scholars became truly convinced, and they confessed that the teaching of the Bible is superior to the principles of The Great Learning. Actually, there is no comparison. Paul was originally a &#8220;Confucian scholar&#8221; and a &#8220;Wang Yang-ming&#8221; in Judaism. He thoroughly studied the Jewish religion as well as the Greek culture and philosophy, but after he was conquered by the Lord Jesus on the road to Damascus, he saw that everything in Judaism was an empty shell, just as the tabernacle was an empty shell and was not the reality.<p>John 1:14 says, &#8220;The Word became flesh and dwelt among us&#8221; (Chinese Union Version). According to the Greek, dwelt among us should be translated tabernacled among us. When Jesus came, God came. When God came in the flesh, He dwelt among men as a tabernacle. The tabernacle in the Old Testament was a shell, a shadow; the Lord Jesus is the body or the reality of that tabernacle. John 1:29 says, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; The Jews at that time all understood this sentence because every day they slaughtered the lambs and offered them as sacrifices for the daily redemption of sins, but they did not understand that the blood of the lambs which they killed could not wash away their sins because it was only a type, a shadow. It is just like the airplane in a kindergarten textbook. It is a picture, not a real plane. You may teach the children to say that it is an airplane, but it is still only a picture. A plane flying in the air is the reality.<p>Now the reality has come, and the reality is Jesus. Jesus is God who became a man; His becoming a man is the reality. Thus, He is the virtues, He is the morality, and He is the ethics. What things are true, what things are dignified, what things are righteous, what things are pure, what things are lovely, and what things are well spoken of-Jesus is all these. He is all the virtues: He is our humility, He is our honoring toward our parents, He is our love toward our wives, He is our submission toward our husbands, and He is our love toward all. Without Him, everything is empty and is without reality. Who is He? He is the real and living Creator who was born of a virgin to be a man, and His name is Jesus. He is God, and He is also man. He died for our sins, and then He resurrected and became the life-giving Spirit. Today He is not only in the heavens as the Lord and Christ, but He has also entered into our spirit to be our life (Rom. 8:34, 10).<p>The meaning of Christ as our life is very deep and mysterious, and it is also very important. Once Christ becomes our life, He becomes our everything. We all know that everything we have depends upon our human life. If I were to die today, everything that is of me would be finished, but while I am living here, I can talk, eat, drink, and put on clothes. I can do this and that. When a person has life, he can do everything. When a person does not have life, everything is finished. The Lord Jesus Christ has come into us to be our life, that is, to be our everything. He has become our love. Our love for others is not our own love; our own love is empty, but His love is reality. Without Christ, all human virtues are empty shells; they are like a glove without a hand in it; the glove therefore is empty. All our virtues, such as love, kindness, goodness, humility, and refinement, should be Christ. Christ is everything because He is our life. Paul said that he was once zealous for religion, killing Christians, and keeping the law in such a way that he was blameless. He had once considered those things precious, but then he considered them as loss, as dung. The religion and law which he had before were like junk, but now he obtained Christ, who is like gold and gems. Christ in him was not an empty doctrine but a reality. The Christ whom he had obtained was the real and living God, the real and living Lord. Because Paul had the One of peerless worth in the universe, he suffered the loss of all things and considered them dung.<h2 class=head1>LIVING IN CHRIST</h2><p>I grew up in China and saw a number of Chinese who were moral. Their morality was quite high, but they did not have Christ within them. On the other hand, I also saw a few of the Western missionaries who went to China whose love and morality were truly outstanding and remarkable because their love and morality had Christ in them. The morality of the Chinese moralists is purely Chinese morality without Christ. However, if Christ is in me, when I love, it is not I who love, but Christ who loves. I have been crucified with Christ and I am completely finished. Now it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. It is not I who love nor I who obey nor I who honor my parents; even more, it is not I who am gracious, kind, and virtuous, but it is He. My loving is His loving; it is He who loves from within me. My honoring my parents is His honoring; it is He who honors them from within me. This is because He already lives in us as our everything, and as long as we live according to this Christ who is within us, He will be all the virtues being lived out from within us. Thus, we will become those who live in Christ (2 Cor. 12:2).<p>In Philippians 3:9 Paul said, &#8220;And be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is out of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is out of God and based on faith.&#8221; Paul had been altogether in the Jewish religion under the law and had always been found by others in the law. However, when he saw the great light on the road to Damascus, he repented and received revelation (Gal. 1:15-16). Then he turned from the law and the religion of his ancestors to Christ and aspired to have his entire being saturated with Christ and filled with Christ that Christ might overflow from him so that all who observed him might find him to be one who was fully in Christ. This was why he said, &#8220;Not having my own righteousness...but that which is through faith in Christ.&#8221; This was to be in Christ where Paul aspired to be found by others. God could be expressed through him only in such a surpassing condition. Such a condition was not the result of his keeping the law but of his living Christ. This was not Paul&#8217;s behavior nor Paul&#8217;s righteousness but God&#8217;s righteousness obtained through faith in Christ.<p>The salvation which we have obtained today is a salvation not by &#8220;relying on Christ&#8221; but by &#8220;living in Christ.&#8221; Today we are not just in Christ, but we are even living in Him. This can be compared to taking a 747 jet plane. We can walk up and down within the plane. We not only sit in the plane, but we also live in the plane. Paul said that he wanted to be found living in Christ. Christ is not only our life but also the realm of our living; we can live in Him. First Corinthians 1:30 says that it is of God that we are in Christ. God has made Christ to be our righteousness. When we are joined to Him and live Him out, we have the righteousness which is in Him.<h2 class=head1>PURSUING THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</h2><p>Christ is living. Once He gets into our spirit, He has an organic union with us. Because of this organic union, we can have a kind of living that is not lived out by us but lived out by Christ from within us. In this way the righteousness of God is manifested in us. This is the living that Paul desired to live out. Paul knew Christ, appreciated Christ, and realized that Christ was exceedingly precious; so he diligently pursued the experience of Christ. We need to experience Christ and the power of His resurrection. Resurrection is a matter of life. A stone cannot resurrect, but a seed can because the seed has the power of life within it. Christ is in us as a seed that sprouts and grows within us to bear fruit thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.<h2 class=head1>MANIFESTING THE FRAGRANCE OF CHRIST</h2><p>As we have seen, we are not in religion but in Christ. Christ is life, and within Him as the seed of life there is the power of resurrection. He grows within us that we may participate in His sufferings, being conformed to His death. In this way we experience His resurrection power and know that He is a treasure within us. In this treasure there is an exceedingly great power, even the most excellent power. This transcendent and remarkable power which is in us enables us to endure the sufferings that others cannot bear and to live a life that others cannot live, thereby manifesting the fragrance of Christ. Through the power of His resurrection Christ leads us in joyful triumph in His victory procession and manifests the savor of the knowledge of Him through us.<p>This is the transcendence of Christ. This is the Christ whom we live out. This is not human culture, religion, philosophy, ethics, morality, traditions, or customs. This is the living Christ as life within us who is leading us in triumph and manifesting His fragrance.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE GLORY OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 1:3; John 17:5; 1:4, 21-24; Phil. 2:15-16; 1:20-21; Col. 1:27</h1><h2 class=head1>GLORY BEING THE EXPRESSION OF GOD</h2><p>We have seen the surpassingness and transcendence of Christ, and now we come to see the glory of Christ. The term glory has a special meaning in the Bible, a meaning that is hard to explain clearly with human language. Some Chinese people think that when someone has obtained a high position, has become rich, and lives in a luxurious house, he is &#8220;glorified.&#8221; This kind of usage, however, is not according to the biblical meaning, and it is not even according to the meaning of the Chinese words jung yao. If you look at these two Chinese characters, you will see that the first character jung contains two radicals for fire, while the second character yao contains the radical for light. When two fires burn brightly and give forth light, that is jung yao or glory.<p>The &#8220;glory&#8221; mentioned in the Bible, however, refers to God Himself, the expression of God&#8217;s radiance, the expression of God Himself. God is hidden and invisible, but when He shines forth in His radiance, He is visible. We can use electricity as an illustration. Electricity is very hidden. Strictly speaking, up to this day no one has ever seen electricity. Although electricity is invisible, electric lights can shine forth the brightness of electricity. The light that shines forth from electric lamps is the brilliance of electricity, and the brilliance of electricity is the glory of the electricity. In other words, when the electric lamps shine forth with light, the electricity is glorified. Today we are accustomed to using electric lights and do not feel that electricity is very marvelous. However, if we have never used an electric light before and see one suddenly turned on in a dark room, we would say that the room is certainly full of glory. Within the electricity there is a hidden light, and when this hidden light is expressed, it is glory. The glory of God is the expression of God. When God is not expressed, He is hidden; when He is expressed, there is glory. Genesis 12 in the Old Testament is a record of God&#8217;s appearing to Abraham and speaking to him. This matter is referred to in the New Testament in the Book of Acts as the appearing of the God of glory to Abraham (7:2).<p>According to the biblical definition, glory is not our attaining to a high position and making a great amount of money, but it is God being manifested in us. For example, I may go to a couple&#8217;s home for fellowship, and while I am standing at the door ready to knock, I may hear the husband and the wife arguing inside; then when the husband opens the door, I may see the wife crying. This kind of situation is not glory. It is a shattered lightbulb that no longer shines. Suppose, however, that when the husband opens the door, the wife is praying with her head covered, and I sense that the husband also has a spirit of prayer with him. Although this situation does not have an outward, visible kind of brilliance, it is full of the Lord&#8217;s radiance. Inwardly I would say, &#8220;This is really glorious!&#8221; because I can see God expressed in that couple.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST BEING THE EFFULGENCE OF GOD&#8217;S GLORY</h2><p>Hebrews 1:3 is very difficult to expound. It says that Christ is the effulgence of God&#8217;s glory. We can use an example to explain this: In the daylight we see the sun in the sky, but strictly speaking what we see is not the sun itself but the brilliance of the sun. Christ being the effulgence of God&#8217;s glory means that we cannot see God Himself, just as we cannot see the sun itself, but we can see the effulgence of God&#8217;s glory, which is Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the effulgence of God&#8217;s glory. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, people marveled at the words He spoke. They asked, &#8220;Where did this Man come from? How can He speak such things?&#8221; Also while He was on the earth, He did many marvelous things that were difficult for people to understand. People saw a little Galilean, Jesus, and wondered how He could do such great and marvelous things; they wondered who He really was. The Bible, however, says explicitly that He is the effulgence of God&#8217;s glory.<p>I have studied the Bible and am convinced that according to Isaiah&#8217;s prophecy this Jesus grew up like a tender plant before God and like a root out of dry ground. He had no attracting form or majesty, and He had no beautiful appearance that people would desire Him. He was despised and forsaken of men; His visage and form were marred. Yet, within this man the glory of God was concealed. He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. One time He took Peter, James, and John to a high mountain. Suddenly, He was transfigured before them, His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as the light. In other words, His entire being was shining radiantly; this means that the glory which was concealed within Him was now expressed outwardly.<p>The three disciples saw Jesus the Nazarene appearing in God&#8217;s glory. God&#8217;s glory was completely expressed through Him. Therefore, Peter told us in his Epistle that on the mountain they were eyewitnesses of His glory (2 Pet. 1:16-18). In his Gospel, John also said, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word,...and the Word was God....And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father), full of grace and reality&#8221; (John 1:1, 14).<p>When the worldly people encounter difficulties, they have a sad look and become depressed. However, when we believers suffer persecutions and encounter difficulties, we can still joyfully say Hallelujah! This is because we not only love the Lord, but we are also filled with the Lord. When we are filled with the Lord, He overflows from within us. This overflow is glory.<p>Colossians 1:27 says, &#8220;Christ in you, the hope of glory.&#8221; The Christ within us is glory, but this glory is concealed. The first line of the first stanza of Hymns, #403 says, &#8220;Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me.&#8221; The second stanza says, <p class=hbody>Consecrated is Thy temple,<br>Purged from every stain and sin;<br>May Thy flame of glory now be<br>Manifested from within.</p><p>This hymn tells us that Christ is concealed within us, waiting to be manifested.<p>Even though Christ is concealed within us, this hidden glory cannot always remain covered and sometimes becomes manifest openly. I know that some parents are against their children&#8217;s becoming Christians, especially in the Chinese families that accept the ideologies of Confucius and Mencius. Such parents always think that when their children believe in Jesus, they are believing in a foreign religion, which is not a glory but a shame to their ancestors for three generations. This is why parents oppose their children&#8217;s believing in the Lord Jesus. Among the brothers and sisters here today, there is one who believed in the Lord and was saved under such a circumstance. This brother was saved in junior high school. Before he was saved, he was a naughty teenager, but after getting saved, his living changed completely. When people scolded him, he remained pleasant. His parents would beat him for believing in the Lord, but he would go meekly into his bedroom to kneel by his bed and pray to the Lord. Time after time, day after day the Lord Jesus would manifest His glory in this previously naughty teenager. His parents were so touched that eventually they also believed in the Lord. Many parents oppose when their children first believe in the Lord, but eventually they end up believing in the Lord also. Hallelujah! It is hard to find a family in which the parents do not follow their children to believe in the Lord. Everyone who is genuinely saved has the glory of the Lord Jesus manifested in him; this means that the invisible God is expressed through him.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST HAVING THE GLORY ALONG WITH THE FATHER IN ETERNITY</h2><p>John 17:5 says, &#8220;And now, glorify Me along with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.&#8221; This tells us that in eternity past the Lord Jesus had the same glory as God. This is difficult to explain because we were not there and do not know what it was like. We all know that John 17 is the Lord Jesus&#8217; final prayer before being crucified. After He prayed this, He went to the Garden of Gethsemane and was betrayed, arrested, and judged in that same night; the following day He was condemned and put to death on the cross. Therefore, this prayer is critical and profound. Even if you read it many times, I am afraid that you will not be able to understand its implications. That is because this prayer was prayed by the Lord Jesus directly to God, and it did not matter to Him whether or not we would understand it. He said, &#8220;Glorify Me along with Yourself, Father.&#8221; He did not say, &#8220;Grant Me to have glory along with Yourself, Father.&#8221; It is not a matter of having or not having the glory but a matter of gaining and enjoying it. The Lord Jesus was not without this glory. When He prayed, He already had this glory, but He was not enjoying this glory. Before the world was, before the beginning of time, the Lord Jesus had this glory along with the Father. Also when He was living on the earth, He had this glory, but He did not yet enjoy the glory. This is why He prayed in John 17, &#8220;Glorify Me along with Yourself, Father. Now the hour has come that You want Me to enjoy this glory.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>CHRIST HAVING GOD&#8217;S LIFE AND NATURE AND EXPRESSING GOD&#8217;S GLORY</h2><p>What does it mean for the Lord Jesus to have the glory of God? How was He glorified along with the Father? These are questions that are not easy to answer. We must consider this based upon the context of John 17:5. The first part of the Lord&#8217;s prayer in verse 1 says, &#8220;Father,...glorify Your Son,&#8221; and the second part says, &#8220;That the Son may glorify You.&#8221; It does not say here that the Lord Jesus asked the Father to uplift Him to the throne that He might have an exalted position and thus be glorified. Instead, it says, &#8220;Glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&#8221; The Father glorified the Son, and in this glory the Son glorified the Father. Verse 2 says, &#8220;Even as You have given Him authority over all flesh to give eternal life to all whom You have given Him.&#8221; This verse in the Bible is very precious. The Father gave the Lord Jesus authority over all flesh. The Lord Jesus is the Lord over all things and over mankind. He governs every person for only one purpose, that is, to give eternal life to all those who have been given to Him by God the Father-those who were predestinated and chosen in eternity. Hallelujah! All of us who believe in the Lord are those whom God has given to the Lord Jesus. God has given each one of us to the Lord. Then the Lord gives eternal life to us.<p>Verse 3 says, &#8220;And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ.&#8221; This is a footnote which the Lord Jesus added to His prayer, telling us what eternal life is. This is eternal life, that we know the only true God and Him whom He has sent, Jesus Christ. Today whether or not you have eternal life hinges on whether or not you know the only true God and Him whom He has sent, Jesus Christ. If you say, &#8220;Praise and thank the Lord, I know the only true God, and I know Jesus Christ, whom He has sent,&#8221; then you have eternal life within you. We can all testify to this. When we believed in this only true God and in Jesus Christ, whom He has sent, we received into us something that was living, and we were made alive from within. This living thing is eternal life.<p>Verse 4 says, &#8220;I have glorified You on earth, finishing the work which You have given Me to do.&#8221; This is the key to open these verses. What is the work that God gave His Son, the Lord Jesus, to do? There is only one thing: God wanted the Lord Jesus to live out God Himself on this earth. No one had ever seen God; the only begotten Son of God came among men and declared God to them. To declare God is to glorify God. Declaring God is the definition of glorifying God. To glorify God is to express God.<p>When the Lord Jesus prayed this prayer, He knew that it was the last evening of His thirty-three and a half years of living on earth. He would soon be crucified. His crucifixion would be a great suffering and a terrible shame in the eyes of men, but He knew that this death would be like a grain of wheat being sown into the earth. If the grain of wheat does not die by being sown into the earth, it can never bear much fruit. The Lord Jesus had to be buried in the earth and to die as a grain of wheat. Superficially, this death appeared to be a shame and a suffering, but actually it was a glorious release. The life and all the riches of life in the grain of wheat are covered by the outer shell and cannot come forth. Likewise, the physical body of the Lord Jesus was an outer shell that concealed the life and the riches of life. Therefore, this outer shell had to be buried in the earth and die that the life within the shell might be released. After a grain of wheat is buried in the earth and dies, it sprouts up a tender shoot and grows a stem and leaves; then it flowers, brings forth the ears, and bears fruit. When it multiplies thirtyfold, sixtyfold, or a hundredfold, that is its glorification.<p>The Lord Jesus was just like a grain of wheat. His flesh was the outer shell of the seed. Within Him was God, but this God was concealed within the outer shell and could not be expressed. Therefore, the Lord Jesus had to be put into death in order that through death and resurrection He could be released and the God within Him could be expressed and glorified. This is why He prayed in such a way, &#8220;Father, glorify Your Son.&#8221; To put it plainly, His prayer here was asking the Father to put Him to death! It is as if a seed was begging its master, &#8220;Master! Do not think so highly of me; do not elevate me or put me on a pedestal for exhibition. Please plant me in the earth! Once you plant me in the earth, I will be glorified.&#8221; The meaning of this sentence, &#8220;Father, glorify Your Son,&#8221; is that the Lord was asking the Father to put Him into the place of death that He might pass through death and be resurrected. After the Son&#8217;s death and resurrection, the Father would be manifested and thus the Son also would be glorified. Moreover, in the glorification of the Son, the Father also would be glorified.<h2 class=head1>GLORIFICATION BEING A MATTER OF LIFE</h2><p>The Father being glorified in the glorification of His Son Jesus is a matter of life. Two thousand years ago, among millions of people, only the Lord Jesus had the divine life and the divine nature within Him. His life and nature were for the expression of God. Concerning life and nature, the emphasis is not on enabling us to do things but on enabling us to live a kind of life that expresses the life within us. If you are a Chinese with the Chinese life and the Chinese nature, you spontaneously will express the Chinese condition. If you are a Japanese with the Japanese life and nature, the Japanese condition will be expressed in you. You express whatever life and nature you have. The Lord Jesus had the life of God and the nature of God, so He did not need to do anything; He simply lived out God and expressed God in His living. However, at that time God was still concealed within the flesh of the Lord Jesus. Therefore, the Lord Jesus had to break this flesh through His death, just like a seed must be planted into the earth to allow the life to break through the outer shell and be released. That is glory. Hence, the Lord Jesus prayed that the Father God would put Him into the ground of death and then raise Him up from the dead. In this way the Father God would be released from within Him, and the life and nature of the Father God would be manifested; this would be the Father glorifying the Son.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST GIVING THE GLORY TO HIS BELIEVERS</h2><p>Because the divine life and the divine nature are within the Lord Jesus, He can also give this life and nature to those whom God has chosen, predestined, and given to Him. In other words, just as Christ has the life and nature of God for the expression of God, so also we, whom God has chosen and given to the Lord Jesus, have the life and nature of God for the expression of God. Because the Lord Jesus has given us the eternal life that is within Him, we all are those who have God&#8217;s life and nature. According to the Bible, the goal of believing in the Lord is not merely the receiving of forgiveness of sins, but even more it is the obtaining of eternal life. The forgiveness of sins is only a procedure; it is not the goal. But it is only by the forgiveness of sins that God can give His eternal life to us. When this eternal life is put into us, we have an organic union with Christ. Nothing can have an organic union with us unless it is something of life; only the living things, the things with life, can have an organic union with us. If a stone were to enter our stomach, it would always remain a stone because a stone does not have life. However, if we eat some organic things, such as fish, meat, and fruit, they will have an organic union with us and will eventually become us.<p>The Lord Jesus said that He was not only the bread of life but even more the living bread. The living bread means that when this bread is eaten by us, it continues to live in us. The Lord Himself is full of the organic supply, so when we receive Him into us, He lives and moves within us, full of the organic function and operation. This is how the Lord Jesus gives us the eternal life that is within Him.<p>Christ is living; He is Spirit, and He is in His word. Through our preaching, He is transfused into other people. When He enters into us who have been chosen by God, He infuses eternal life into us. Thus, we become the multiplication and enlargement of Christ. This multiplication and enlargement are glory.<p>The prayer in John 17:21-24 is very mysterious with many &#8220;in&#8217;s.&#8221; &#8220;You, Father, are in Me,&#8221; &#8220;I in You,&#8221; &#8220;that they also may be in Us,&#8221; and &#8220;I in them.&#8221; In the end it is hard for us to discern who is in whom. We who believe in the Lord are all in God and in the Lord Jesus. God is in the Lord Jesus; the Lord Jesus is also in God; and we are in Them. Verse 22 says, &#8220;And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them.&#8221; This glory is simply God&#8217;s life and nature for the expression of God. The unbelievers do not have it; only we who believe in Christ have this glory. Because the Lord Jesus has the divine life and the divine nature within Him, when we believe into the Lord Jesus, He dispenses His life and nature into us; hence, we all have this glory. Verse 23 says, &#8220;I in them, and You in Me.&#8221; Notice that the order is different here. Previously it was the Father in the Son and the Son in the Father that the believers might all be in the Father and the Son. Then the Lord said that He has given to the believers the glory which the Father has given Him, that is, He has dispensed the Father&#8217;s life and nature into them, and the result is that He is in them. After this, the Lord finally said that He is in us, and the Father is in Him.<p>Verse 24 says, &#8220;Father, concerning that which You have given Me, I desire that they also may be with Me where I am.&#8221; What does where refer to? The traditional explanation given by most Christians is that it refers to heaven. They say that the Lord Jesus died, rose, and ascended to heaven, so He prayed to the Father that all the millions of people given to Him would all be brought into heaven. He is in heaven, so let them all go to heaven. This is the traditional teaching in Christianity. But the where revealed here in the Bible does not refer to heaven; instead, it refers to being in God. Thus, in John 14:6 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I am the way;...no one comes to the Father except through Me.&#8221; He does not say that no one goes to heaven except through Him, but to the Father. In John 14-17, He does not have the thought of going to heaven. His heart&#8217;s desire is to bring His believers into the Father, just as He is in the Father.<p>According to the revelation of the Bible, the Lord Jesus&#8217; prayer here says that He is in the Father with the Father&#8217;s life and nature to express the Father, and now He is praying that the Father would sow Him into the ground of death and then resurrect Him that He might release the Father&#8217;s life and enter into those who believe into Him. Once the eternal life and nature get into the believers, they will be in the Father just as He is in the Father. They will be with Him where He is. Where is the Lord? He is in the Father. Where are the believers? They too are in the Father. Originally, we were not in the Father, but now we are. Because the Lord Jesus has put the eternal life and nature into us, we have the life and nature of the Father God within us. This is the Father&#8217;s being in us and our being in the Father. In this way just as the Lord Jesus is, so we are also; wherever He is, we are there too. He is in the Father, and we also are in the Father. The Father is in Him, and the Father is also in us. The Lord Jesus has the divine life and nature, and we also have the divine life and nature. Thus, eventually the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;That they may behold My glory, which You have given Me&#8221; (17:24). The glory that God gave the Lord Jesus is the divine life and nature for the expression of God. Before we were saved, we did not have this. But after we were saved, we obtained the divine life and the divine nature that we may express God. It is in this that we see the glory which the Father has given to the Lord, and we enjoy this glory day by day.<h2 class=head1>SHINING AS LUMINARIES, HOLDING FORTH THE WORD OF LIFE</h2><p>All of us who were saved in this way have the divine life and nature to express God. Furthermore, we are luminous lamps in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, shining as luminaries, holding forth the word of life (Phil. 2:15-16). All of us who have the divine life and nature are children of God without blemish in the midst of this crooked and perverted generation, among whom we shine as luminaries in this dark world, holding forth the word of life. This is the Lord Jesus&#8217; being glorified from within us.<p>As I have said, many young people after being saved become the Lord Jesus&#8217; luminaries shining before their parents and relatives and unconsciously and unintentionally hold forth the word of life-the Lord Jesus Himself. This is Christ being glorified in them.<h2 class=head1>ALWAYS MAGNIFYING CHRIST IN OUR BODIES</h2><p>Paul wrote the book of Philippians while he was in prison, so he said, &#8220;According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death. For to me, to live is Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:20-21). What does it mean for Christ to be magnified in our bodies? Paul did not have Christ merely as his inward life and nature, but even more he had Christ as the outward expression of his living. Therefore, when he was on the verge of being martyred, he could still express the unlimited greatness of Christ, and the glory of God could be shown great in his body. This was Christ&#8217;s being magnified in his body.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE HOPE OF GLORY IN US</h2><p>In Colossians 1:27 Paul said that there is a mystery in us which is Christ. Christ in us is truly a mystery. This is why at the times when people revile us, we are not in the least bit angry; on the contrary, we are joyful and happy. This is truly a story of mystery, and this story is the Lord Jesus as the eternal life. This mystery within us is Jesus Christ as our hope of glory. When Christ returns, He will be in glory, and He will transfigure us and bring us into glory. That will be our being glorified along with Him. &#8220;This mystery...which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.&#8221;<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:8; John 16:13-15; 1:14, 16; Phil. 1:19</h1><h2 class=head1>A CENTRAL SUBJECT IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><p>We have spoken about the surpassingness of Christ, the transcendence of Christ, and the glory of Christ. Now we come to the riches of Christ. In the New Testament this is a central subject and an important revelation. Many of today&#8217;s Christians, however, have never seen this revelation. Many people have been Christians for years, but they have never heard the term the riches of Christ. However, Ephesians 3 clearly speaks about this matter.<p>I have treasured the book of Ephesians since I was young, and I have read commentaries on this book which were written by others, but I never saw that anyone pointed out the central subject of &#8220;the riches of Christ.&#8221; In the past, because no one saw this or led us to see this, I was like a blind man who saw nothing and gained nothing. It was not until many years later that one day the phrase in Ephesians 3:8, the unsearchable riches of Christ, shone on me and jumped up at me. This phrase is not only the riches of Christ; it is even more the unsearchable riches, the immeasurable riches, of Christ. The emphasis on the word unsearchable here is not on the mysteriousness but on the quantity or measure. The riches of Christ are unsearchable and immeasurable.<h2 class=head1>THE REALITY AND CONTENTS OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p>What are the riches of Christ? First, the riches of Christ are the reality and contents of the gospel. Ephesians 3:8 says, &#8220;To me...was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.&#8221; According to this verse, we see that the riches of Christ are the reality and contents of the gospel. Without the riches of Christ, the gospel is empty. The reality of the gospel hinges on the riches of Christ. The riches of Christ are the contents of the gospel. Paul did not say that God gave him this grace to announce to the Gentiles Christ&#8217;s forgiveness of sins as the gospel. The forgiveness of sins is only one item of the unsearchable riches of Christ. The gospel which many people preach today is just one item out of the thousands of items, and that item is the forgiveness of sins. That by itself is not the unsearchable riches; the reality and contents of the gospel make up the riches of Christ.<p>Today our gospel preaching is the preaching of Christ. To preach Christ is to tell people who and what Christ is. From stanzas 2 and 3 of the Chinese Hymns, #403, we can find at least fourteen items of the riches of Christ. [The English version of this hymn, Hymns, #542, contains twelve items.] First it says, &#8220;O the riches of my Savior, / All-embracing....&#8221; Then it goes on to list these riches: life, light, wisdom, power, healing, peace, joy, complete redemption, full salvation, justification, sanctification, release, resurrection power, and transcendence, for a total of fourteen items. The Chinese Hymns, #388 [an abridged version of the English Hymns, #510] speaks even more of Christ&#8217;s riches. Christ is the Lamb of God, the Sun of Righteousness, the tree of life, the fountain of life, the Priest, the Prophet, the King, the Savior, the Mediator, the Physician, the Shepherd, the Counselor, the Head, our Brother, our Father, our God, our Lord, our Teacher, our Beloved, our Friend, life, power, wisdom, righteousness, holiness, redemption, peace, joy, hope, comfort, glory, light, and way, for a total of thirty-three items. Never think that this Jesus Christ whom you have heard, believed in, and received is that simple. He is too marvelous and very rich. His riches are the reality and contents of the gospel.<h2 class=head1>ALL THAT CHRIST IS</h2><p>Second, the riches of Christ are all that He is. The phrase all that Christ is sounds a little peculiar. Can we not simply say that the riches of Christ are all that is Christ&#8217;s? If you say it this way, the meaning is different. For example, I could say, &#8220;All that is Brother Lee&#8217;s.&#8221; You would think of Brother Lee&#8217;s hymn book, Bible, shoes, socks, tie, suit, hair, and so on. Thus, &#8220;all that is Brother Lee&#8217;s&#8221; emphasizes what he has, what he possesses, not what he is. In the same way, if we say &#8220;all that is Christ&#8217;s&#8221; instead of &#8220;all that Christ is,&#8221; then we would think that all that is Christ&#8217;s refers to His greatness, His superiority, and so on. We would not think of all these items as the riches of Christ. What Christ is does not refer to what He has; the emphasis of what Christ is, is on His being.<p>When you watch one or two year-old children, you can see that they really enjoy their mothers. If you give a little girl a huge diamond, she may not want it, but she definitely will want her dear mother. As long as her mother is there, she does not care about diamonds. You can see that she wants what her mother is, not what her mother has. We Christians often do not know what being is; we only understand what possessions are. If the Lord were to give us a big house and the best European car and then allow us to go to heaven after we die, we would think that we have enjoyed all that is Christ&#8217;s. Actually, even if we have enjoyed all these things, we still will not have touched the edges of Christ. See how pitiful we Christians are! We are worse than little children. Little children know how to enjoy their mothers; this is not acquired from teaching but received from birth. When we are regenerated, we also have an innate capacity to enjoy Christ, and we simply like to enjoy the Lord Himself. However, after being saved, because we received improper teachings and influences, we began to long for things other than Christ and to forget Christ Himself completely.<p>Therefore, when we were raised up by the Lord sixty years ago in China, the work was very difficult in the beginning. We saw this vision and truly received the revelation, but our vocabulary and expressions could not be found in the dictionary; they were all coined by us after intense laboring. The emphasis of the riches of Christ is not on what Christ has but on what He is. Little children do not care one bit for what their mothers have; they only care for their mothers. We love the Lord, and we should love Him thoroughly and absolutely like little children. If the Lord allows us to be sick, we still want Him; if the Lord makes us strong, we still want Him. In woe or blessing, death or life, in nothing shall we be ashamed. Our goal is to gain Christ and to magnify Him.<p>John 16:13-15 says, &#8220;But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality....He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you. All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you.&#8221; It says here that when the Spirit of reality comes, He will guide us into all the reality. The Lord Jesus is the tabernacle, the Lamb of God, and the Redeemer. How can these objective matters become subjective, practical experiences to us? We must wait for the Spirit of reality to come. When the Spirit comes, the reality comes. Thus, the reality of the tabernacle is the Spirit, and the reality of the Lamb of God is also the Spirit. All that Christ is, is the Spirit. When this Spirit of reality comes, He glorifies Christ. How does He glorify Him? By making all that Christ is real to the believers.<p>The second part of verse 14 continues, saying, &#8220;He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you.&#8221; This means that the Spirit of reality will declare to us all the riches which He has received of Christ, that is, all that the Lord Jesus is. The Greek word for declare, or disclose, means to put on display. The Spirit of reality does not merely tell us everything that Christ is, but He also puts everything on display in front of us. All that is put on display is all that Christ is. He is the Lamb, the door, the way, the reality, the life, the resurrection, the embodiment of God, and so on. All that He is, is too many items to count. When the Spirit of reality comes, He displays in us all the items of what Christ is.<p>Verse 15 says, &#8220;All that the Father has is Mine.&#8221; This shows us that all that the Father has is received by the Son and becomes the Son&#8217;s. Furthermore, whatever the Son receives, He gives it to the Spirit. Therefore, the Spirit displays to us what He has received from the Son, which is what the Son has received from the Father, in order that we may understand. Stanza 3 of Hymns, #501 says, <p class=hbody>All things of the Father are Thine; All Thou art in Spirit is mine; The Spirit makes Thee real to me, That Thou experienced might be.<p>This stanza was written with the words of John 16. All things of God the Father belong to Christ the Son and are received by Christ the Son. After they have been received by Christ the Son, they become all that Christ the Son is. Then all that Christ the Son is, is given to the Spirit. Moreover, this Spirit enters into our spirit as the reality of all that Christ is to make Christ our experience.<h2 class=head1>RECEIVING OF HIS FULLNESS, AND GRACE UPON GRACE</h2><p>John 1:14 and 16 say, &#8220;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality....For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.&#8221; When Christ came, He was God becoming flesh. When Christ came in time into the human race, He was God tabernacling and dwelling among men. When Christ dwelt among men, He was full of grace and reality. Now Christ has become the Spirit to dwell in us; therefore, we have received the grace of Christ. It is not that we have received only something, but we have received of His fullness, even grace upon grace. To receive &#8220;of His fullness&#8221; and &#8220;grace upon grace&#8221; is not only to receive of His fullness but also to receive it with grace upon grace. We praise and thank the Lord that we do not receive only a little, but we receive of His fullness. Moreover, we receive not only of His fullness, but we also receive it with grace upon grace.<p>What does it mean to receive of His fullness, and grace upon grace? Let me give you an illustration. For example, as you are now receiving this message, you may say, &#8220;This message is really good; I praise and thank the Lord!&#8221; Yes, you have received some supply, and you can count that as your receiving grace and reality. However, I cannot say that you have received of His fullness, and grace upon grace, because you still may have some reservation within you. You may think that I am too much to say this, but in effect you may be receiving &#8220;grace under grace.&#8221; This is why I am so repetitious and why I use many words so that the &#8220;film&#8221; in the &#8220;camera&#8221; within you can be sensitized to such an extent that you will keep receiving without reservation. This is to receive of His fullness, grace upon grace. We need to receive all that Christ is in fullness and grace upon grace.<h2 class=head1>ENJOYING THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY OF THE SPIRIT OF REALITY</h2><p>When we receive of His fullness and grace upon grace, that is, when we receive unreservedly and unconditionally, then we experience the Spirit and enjoy the riches of Christ as our bountiful supply. How is it that the riches of Christ can become our supply? It is by Christ becoming the Spirit of reality. Christ had to become the Spirit of reality for you to receive of His fullness and grace upon grace; the riches of Christ can now become your supply. The riches of Christ are indescribable and immeasurable; therefore, the supply of the Spirit must be bountiful, all-inclusive, and inexhaustible. The Spirit supplies you with whatever you need. Christ is all that you need and desire. We need to enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit of reality in our spirit. The bountiful supply of the Spirit of reality is the unsearchable riches of Christ. The unsearchable riches of Christ are already there; when we receive of them in full and grace upon grace, His riches become the bountiful supply in our spirit. The riches of Christ are to be enjoyed by us and are to supply our needs that we may become His fullness!<h2 class=head1>THE RICHES OF CHRIST BEING THE TRIUNE GOD WITH ALL HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h2><p>With the foregoing knowledge, we are clear that the riches of Christ are the Triune God Himself. The Bible says clearly that God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. He is not three Gods but one. How can this one God be the Father, the Son, and the Spirit? Countless people throughout the generations, including theologians, Bible expositors, and preachers, have all studied and discussed this question to a great extent, but after two thousand years of research and discussion there is still no complete answer.<p>In Christianity today many people have been influenced by tradition to believe that the Father is one God, the Son is another God, and the Spirit is still another God, and that these three Gods added together make up a corporate God. Anyone who has gone to the Vatican, the capital city of the Roman Catholic Church, knows that there is a certain gallery. This gallery does not exhibit many paintings, but it does have two large oil paintings that go from the ceiling to the floor. One painting shows a white-haired old father with a handsome son beside him and a dove above their heads. This is what some in Christianity refer to as the Holy Father, the Holy Son, and the Holy Spirit. This painting shows that they worship three entities: a Father, a Son, and a dove. The other painting shows the same three plus a lady; they have brought the &#8220;Holy Mother&#8221; into the Godhead.<p>Because Christianity has been influenced by tradition, it has lost the reality of Christ. Our God is not three, but one. However, He is triune-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-yet one God. What does this mean? Why is our God one and three? Some people once asked Martin Luther this question, and he answered, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. If I say that I know, then I would be God.&#8221; Martin Luther was not God, so he did not know. His answer was very reasonable. The persons of the Triune God are very mysterious. We have no way to use our limited intelligence to analyze and understand Him. We can only receive this mysterious revelation according to the plain words of the Bible.<p>The Bible clearly states, &#8220;There is no God but one&#8221; (1 Cor. 8:4, 6). Furthermore, God repeatedly says in the Bible, &#8220;Apart from Me [singular] there is no God&#8221; (Isa. 44:6, 8; 45:5-6, 21-22). Also, Psalm 86:10 says, &#8220;You alone are God.&#8221; The Bible never says that we have three Gods. We have only one God. However, in the Bible God does refer to Himself as &#8220;Us&#8221; and &#8220;Our&#8221; many times (Gen. 1:26; 3:22; 11:6-7). In Isaiah 6:8 God refers to Himself, on the one hand, as &#8220;I&#8221; and, on the other hand, as &#8220;Us.&#8221; This is very mysterious, and it is very hard for us to comprehend; therefore, the best we can do is to receive the biblical revelation according to the plain word. There is only one God, so He refers to Himself as &#8220;I.&#8221; But this one unique God also refers to Himself as &#8220;Us.&#8221; Even though there is the aspect of God being the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, They cannot be divided and are still one God. Any theology that explains God by separating Him into three separate persons is a great heresy.<p>In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus clearly said that He is in the Father and the Father is in Him (14:10-11; 10:38; 17:21) and that He and the Father are one (10:30), and He also told us that the Spirit is from the Father (John 15:26). In Greek the word from in John 15:26 is a preposition which literally means from with. This means that the Spirit of reality comes not only from the Father but also with the Father. Thus, when the Spirit comes, the Father and the Son come together with the Spirit. This is because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are coexistent and coinherent.<p>We must be clear that the Bible does not say that when the Son came, the Father no longer existed, and that when the Spirit came, the Son no longer existed. That is the teaching of the erroneous theology called modalism. The modalists say that the Father was in the Old Testament, but in the New Testament, in the Gospels when the Son came, the Father ceased to exist, and then after the Gospels, when the Spirit came, the Son was no more. This is heresy. The pure revelation of the Word says that in the Old Testament the Father was there, and the Son and the Spirit were also there; the Three were all there. In the four Gospels of the New Testament, the Son came, and the Father and the Spirit also came; the Three were there simultaneously. In the Epistles, the Spirit came, and the Father and the Son also came with the Spirit. They did not come in the way of replacing one another; rather, They came in the way of coexistence. Furthermore, They did not merely coexist; They coexisted in coinherence. This one complete Triune God and all that He has accomplished become the riches of Christ for our enjoyment as the bountiful supply in our spirit. However, most people who oppose modalism and who claim to be fundamentalists believe that in the Gospels the Son came by Himself, leaving the Father in heaven, and that in the Epistles the Spirit came, leaving the Father and the Son in heaven. This is to lean toward the other extreme, tritheism, which actually is also a great heresy.<h2 class=head1>THE ACCOMPLISHING OF THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2><h2 class=head2>Incarnation-Christ in the Flesh</h2><p>Christ was originally the infinite God in eternity; in Him all the fullness of the Godhead was hidden (Col. 2:9). However, He became a finite man in time. This is the incarnate Lord Jesus. Before Christ was incarnated, He was only God without the element of humanity. After He was incarnated, He became not only united but also mingled with man. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was not only the union of God and man but also the mingling of God and man. He was not merely God; He was a God-man. This incarnate Christ was a God-man and a man-God. He was both the complete God and the perfect man, with the divine nature and the human nature mingled together yet not producing a third nature.<h2 class=head2>Death and Resurrection-the Pneumatic Christ</h2><p>This God-man, Christ, lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years and died on the cross. Through His death He accomplished eternal redemption for us. Moreover, through His all-inclusive, overcoming death, He completely solved our problems, including Satan, the world, and all the old creation. Then He rose from the dead and was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit. Although He is still Christ, the Christ after resurrection is different from the incarnated Christ who had not yet passed through death and resurrection. The incarnate Christ was in the flesh; He was the Lord Jesus who lived on earth. The Christ after resurrection has become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), the all-inclusive, omnipresent Spirit.<p>When we speak of Christ in the flesh, everyone understands correctly that this was the Lord Jesus who lived on the earth. The Lord Jesus was the Christ in the flesh; the two were one. No one would understand that the flesh was one person and Christ was another. But when we speak of the pneumatic Christ, many easily misunderstand and think that the Spirit is one person, while Christ is another. This is because of the influence of traditional theology.<p>Kittel, the famous German expert on expounding the biblical Greek, put out a lexicon defining more than five thousand six hundred Greek words in the New Testament. He wrote in this lexicon that Christ became the pneumatic Christ after His resurrection. The word pneumatic is an adjective from the Greek word pneuma. Pneuma can be translated as &#8220;spirit,&#8221; &#8220;breath,&#8221; or &#8220;wind.&#8221; In John 3, when the Lord and Nicodemus were discussing regeneration, the Lord said that that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. He also said that the wind blows where it wills. The word for Spirit and for wind are both pneuma. &#8220;The pneumatic Christ&#8221; refers to Christ as the Spirit.<p>After His resurrection, Christ did not transfer from one form to another. Rather, He was transfigured, changed in form. This may be likened to a seed that is planted into the ground. When it grows up as a little sprout, it is changed in appearance. Originally it was round, brown, and small, but after it grows up out of the ground, it becomes long, green, and tall. The substance remains the same, but the form is different.<p>The Lord Jesus Himself as a grain of wheat was sown into the ground, died, and then resurrected. In 1 Corinthians 15 when Paul spoke concerning the body of resurrection, he said that what is sown is one kind of body, but what grows up will be another kind of body. This does not mean that there are two bodies, but that the shape has changed. In this same chapter, Paul also said that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. The last Adam was the grain of wheat; the life-giving Spirit was the green ear of wheat. After this grain of wheat was resurrected, it became a green ear of wheat. Thus, it flowed out the supply of life, bearing fruit thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.<h2 class=head2>Enjoying the Riches of Christ and Expressing the Virtues of God</h2><p>The resurrected Christ, the &#8220;pneumatic Christ,&#8221; is both God and man, possessing both divinity and humanity. He is a God-man. All that He is, is truly beyond our enumeration. He is light, and He is love. The reality that comes out of light is truth, and the reality that comes out of love is grace. Light manifested is truth; love expressed is grace. From within these are produced holiness, righteousness, and every kind of virtue.<p>Philippians 4:8 says, &#8220;What things are true, what things are dignified, what things are righteous, what things are pure, what things are lovely, what things are well spoken of....&#8221; These six virtues are higher than the benevolence, justice, politeness, wisdom, and trustworthiness taught by the Chinese sages. To be true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of are items of what God is. Out of these are produced holiness, righteousness, goodness, meekness, modesty, forbearance, kindness, and so on. All these riches of God, which are also the riches of Christ, become our enjoyment in our experience, and we thereby express the virtues of God.<p>God is true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of. When God created man, He created him according to these virtues. The Bible tells us that God created man in His image and after His likeness (Gen. 1:26). In other words, God created man according to truthfulness, dignity, righteousness, purity, loveliness, and well speaking. If man had not fallen and not been corrupted by the devil, man&#8217;s condition would be true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of. The created man was merely like a photograph. Even though he had the outward form of these virtues, he did not have their reality. It is only when Christ enters into us as our content that we have that reality. Christ is the reality of all the virtues. He truly is rich because all the divine attributes and all the human virtues converge in Him. He is the God who became flesh, the Christ who died and resurrected, and even more the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. Truthfulness, dignity, righteousness, purity, loveliness, and well speaking are His riches. After the Lord Jesus resurrected and became the life-giving Spirit, the riches of Christ became in us the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The riches of Christ are unsearchable, and the supply of the Spirit is bountiful, having no lack.<p>Today the riches of Christ in the Spirit become the bountiful supply in us. You should never ask God to make you humble in a mere outward way. The more you beg for and have this kind of humility, the more you will be proud. When you read the portion in Ephesians 5 which says that wives should submit to their husbands, you may make a decision to be a model wife who absolutely submits to her husband. You might be able to submit temporarily, but eventually you will not be submissive because within you there is no submission. Instead, you should pray by saying, &#8220;Lord! I praise You that You are all things; You are a wife&#8217;s submission to her husband. You are submission, and I am not; I do not have submission, and therefore I cannot submit. You are the Lord Jesus; Your name is &#8216;I Am,&#8217; &#8216;I Am who I Am.&#8217; You are the Lord, and You are submission. O Lord Jesus! I thank You and praise You that Ephesians 5 is wonderful in that Christ is submission. You are my submission. I enjoy You as my submission.&#8221; If you pray like this, you will submit to your husband for the entire day with rejoicing and praise.<p>It is the same thing for husbands toward their wives; the love with which you love your wife must be Christ. It is the same thing for children toward their parents; the obedience with which you obey your parents is Christ. Ephesians 6 says that children must obey their parents in the Lord. Therefore, there is no real obedience outside of the Lord. Only in the Lord can there be the husband&#8217;s love; only in the Lord can there be the wife&#8217;s submission; and only in the Lord can there be the children&#8217;s obedience. Only in the Lord can there be truthfulness, loveliness, and goodness. These virtues can be found only in the Lord.<p>The life of the Lord Jesus, the salvation of Christ, and the bountiful supply of the Spirit are definitely not culture, religion, or philosophy; nor are they ethics, morals, traditions, or customs. The Lord Jesus is the living God who became the God-man and who died for us and resurrected to accomplish redemption and become the pneumatic Christ. Within this pneumatic Christ are hidden all the virtues of divinity and all the perfection of humanity. Today He is the life-giving Spirit who dwells in our spirit as our blessed portion. Therefore, we should not outwardly pursue submission, love, obedience, and other items. Instead, we should live in our mingled spirit to experience the riches of Christ and enjoy the supply of the Spirit. In this way, we will live Christ. When we live out Christ in this way, His effulgence will shine out of us, His virtues will be manifested in us, and we will become the expression of the riches of Christ.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 1:14, 16; Col. 2:9; Eph. 1:22-23; 3:17-19; 4:11-13</h1><h2 class=head1>THE RICHES OF CHRIST BECOMING THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h2><p>In the last chapter we covered the riches of Christ. Now we come to see the fullness of Christ. When we enjoy the riches of Christ, the result is that we become the fullness of Christ. We can say that the fullness of Christ is the most profound subject in the New Testament, and its profoundness lies in the fact that the riches of Christ become the fullness of Christ. Many people cannot understand how the riches of Christ can become the fullness of Christ. Many people cannot even clearly distinguish between the riches of Christ and the fullness of Christ. <p>Let me give an illustration. I may hold an empty glass in one hand and a pitcher full of water in the other hand. Since there is no water in the glass, it is empty. The pitcher, however, is full of water, so it is rich. I can pour the water from the pitcher into the glass until the glass is full of water and overflowing. We can say that this overflow is the fullness, the expression. The rich source of water has become the overflowing stream of water. From the riches to the overflow and expression-this is the fullness.<p>The &#8220;fullness&#8221; in the New Testament comes out of the riches of Christ and is for the expression of God. The source of the fullness is the riches. The continuous supply of the riches as the source produces the fullness as the expression. Thus, the riches are the source, and the fullness is the issue.<p>When we studied the history and the publications of Christianity, we found that nearly no one had spoken anything concerning the riches of Christ and the fullness of Christ. However, these two terms are in the Bible. In Ephesians 3:8 Paul says, &#8220;To me...was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.&#8221; This is the only verse in the Bible that mentions the riches of Christ, whereas the term fullness is mentioned many times. The first time is in John 1:14 where it says, &#8220;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.&#8221; Here full is the adjectival form of fullness. Verse 16 says, &#8220;For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.&#8221; Fullness here implies the riches. Why did John use fullness instead of riches? It is because John was speaking about God being incarnated and thereby having an expression, which is the expression of His riches. These were the riches He brought in with His incarnation to express Himself and for us to receive. When we receive Him as the expressed God, we receive His expressed riches. This is what is meant by &#8220;for of His fullness we have all received.&#8221; Therefore, the incarnated Christ was the expression of God&#8217;s riches and the fullness of God. When we receive Christ, we receive the fullness of God. All the fullness of God dwells in Christ bodily (Col. 2:9).<p>The Gospel of John is a book that speaks of the depths of scriptural truth. It not only tells us that Jesus the Nazarene is our Lord, but it also tells us that He is God, the incarnated One. The Word was God, and the Word became flesh; this means that God became a man, and this man was our Lord Jesus. God is the mystery of the universe and the center of all mysteries. One day, through His Spirit, this mysterious God entered into the womb of a virgin to be born of her, and He was called Jesus. In this way, God became a man. He was the unique, true God, yet He became flesh and took on humanity to become a real Man. As a man He was tempted in all things like us, yet without sin (Heb. 4:15). When this God-man came, it was the Lord Jesus coming. His coming brought grace and reality. <p>Before the Lord Jesus came, everything in the universe- the heavens, the earth, and man-were all in existence, and there were many promises in the Old Testament. The first promise was that the seed of woman would come to bruise the serpent&#8217;s head (Gen. 3:15). There were also many prophecies in the Old Testament, such as Isaiah 7:14, which says that a virgin would conceive and bear a son. This seed of the woman was the Savior of the human race, and He was typified by the lamb in Exodus which was offered for the redemption of sins. Moreover, in the Old Testament there was the type of the tabernacle. The tabernacle was the means and the center for the meeting of God and man. However, all the things in the universe and all these types are still not the reality; they are only shadows. Without God, the heavens and earth are empty; without God, man is also empty; the lamb, the tabernacle, and the offerings are all shadows and are all empty. No wonder the Old Testament rarely uses the word grace, and even when it does, the meaning is unclear. Strictly speaking, before the birth of the Lord Jesus, there were not grace and reality in the universe because the One who is grace and reality had not yet come. This is why John 1:17 says that the law was given through Moses, but grace and reality came through Jesus Christ. Before the Lord Jesus came, grace and reality had not yet come. When the Lord Jesus came, grace and reality also came. This is because He is grace and He is reality.<p>Before the birth of the Lord Jesus, there was no reality on earth, neither was there any grace; everything on earth was merely a type or a shadow. It was not until the Lord Jesus came that grace and reality came. Actually, He was grace and He was reality. Grace is God in Christ as our enjoyment. John 3:16 says, &#8220;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.&#8221; God gave His Son freely to us as a gift, and this is grace. Grace is not what most people understand it to be; they think it is having a high position, making a lot of money, living in a beautiful house, being surrounded by many sons and daughters, and having many grandchildren and great grandchildren. Paul said that these things are not grace. He said that because of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, he considered all people, all matters, and all things to be dung, but he counted only Christ as the excellent One (Phil. 3:8). Grace is the excellent Christ Himself. When grace is gained by man, that is reality. Now we have gained God and Christ, so we have gained life and the reality of life. He is not only life but also the reality of life. If we do not have Him, life is merely a term; if we have Him, we have life and the reality of life. Thus, grace is Christ freely enjoyed by us, and reality is Christ actually gained by us.<h2 class=head1>THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST BEING THE OVERFLOW OF GRACE AND REALITY</h2><p>Based on John 1:16 we can say that the fullness of Christ is the overflow of grace and reality. God became man and dwelt among us, full of grace and reality. Of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace. Our receiving is not a once-for-all matter; rather, it is a continual receiving, a receiving of grace upon grace. The phrase grace upon grace in Greek implies that grace is like the rolling waves of the sea that come in wave after wave without ceasing. Beginning from the time we are saved, we receive grace and reality from His fullness, and it is a receiving without end until we grow up to be a full-grown man with the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.<p>God has given Himself to us to be our grace and reality with a goal in view, that is, to produce the church. John 12:24 says, &#8220;Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&#8221; This &#8220;much fruit&#8221; is blended together to become one loaf-the church. God became flesh and brought grace and reality for the purpose of producing the church. The church does not only have the riches of Christ, but it is also the fullness of Christ. The church is the overflow of His riches, and this overflow is His expression.<p>Genesis 1:27 tells us that God created male and female according to His image. But in practicality when God used dust to create man, He created only a male, Adam; He did not create the female, Eve (Gen. 2:7). God did not create two people. Later God saw that it was not good for Adam to be alone, so He created a female to be his counterpart. How did God create the woman? God caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep and took out one of his ribs, and He built that rib into a woman. Then God placed this woman before Adam. As soon as Adam saw her, he said, &#8220;This is bone of my bones / And flesh of my flesh&#8221; (v. 23). The two were a perfect match, so they were joined together to become one flesh. This proves that Eve flowed out of Adam, that she was an overflow of Adam. In the New Testament, in Ephesians 5, Paul says that the story of Adam and Eve refers to Christ and the church. This also tells us how the church was produced: It was by Christ&#8217;s &#8220;sleeping&#8221; on the cross and His side being pierced to flow out blood and water. The blood was for washing away our sins, and the water was for giving us life. Then in resurrection He entered into us as the Spirit and thereby regenerated us. Thus, all of us are built up together to become the church as the counterpart of Christ. Therefore, the church is the overflow of the riches of Christ, and it is the fullness of Christ. The church is the result produced from the riches of Christ, and it is the overflow and expression of Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST BEING THE FULLNESS OF GOD</h2><p>The fullness of Christ is the fullness of God. Colossians 2:9 says, &#8220;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&#8221; This verse speaks not of riches but of fullness. If we say riches instead of fullness, it is not correct, because all the riches of God have become the fullness of God as His expression. All of this fullness dwells in Christ bodily. Therefore, this fullness becomes the fullness of Christ, and the fullness of Christ is the fullness of grace and reality. These three fullnesses-the fullness of God, the fullness of Christ, and the fullness of grace and reality-all refer to the same fullness.<h2 class=head1>THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST BECOMING HIS EXPRESSION, WHICH IS THE CHURCH</h2><p>When we enjoy the riches of Christ, we become His fullness, and this fullness is His expression. Ephesians 1:22-23 says, &#8220;...and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&#8221; Christ is the Head over all things to the church. The church is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all. Who is the One who fills all in all? It is Christ. The church is His Body, and this Body is the fullness of Christ. Three things are spoken of in these two verses: first, the church; second, the Body; and third, the fullness. These three things all refer to the church. The church as the Body of Christ becomes the fullness of Christ for the expression of Christ. A person with a head and a body appears full and perfect. What is this? This is his expression. Even if he wants to hide, he cannot because the expression of his fullness cannot be covered. Today the church has Christ as the Head and Christ as the Body, so it is the expression of the fullness of Christ. If day by day we have grace upon grace, receive in full the riches of Christ, and enjoy all the fullness of the Godhead which is in Christ, then we will become the expression of the fullness of Christ, which is the church.<p>The fullness is produced by our enjoyment of the riches. For example, when we go to the American supermarket to buy food, we walk in the door and see fish, meat, vegetables, and fruit, which are abundant and rich. These foods, however, have not yet become the fullness; they are only the riches of America. How do the riches of America become the fullness of America? By eating. We must ask everyone to eat these riches of America. If we eat steak every day, eventually each one of us will be a tall, strong, full person, and then we all will be the fullness of America. By eating the riches of America, we become the fullness of America. If we want to become the fullness of Christ, we must enjoy the riches of Christ as food and be filled with these riches that the element of the divine life may become our riches. In this way, we will constantly enjoy and absorb the riches of Christ, and the result is that we become the full expression of Christ, which is the church.<p>The riches of Christ are very abundant, but unfortunately many Christians are not willing to enjoy Christ as food every day. Therefore, despite the fact that the riches of Christ are in them, they do not express Christ&#8217;s fullness outwardly. The riches of Christ are not doctrines but are grace and reality. Twenty-two years ago in Palo Alto in northern California was the first time I spoke in English about the riches of Christ becoming the fullness of Christ. At that time many young Americans received my speaking and rose up to enjoy the riches of Christ. The more we enjoy, the more we digest; and the more we digest, the more we absorb. The result is the fullness, which is the church. Today the churches in different localities in America have truly become the fullness of the One who fills all in all, the expression of the fullness of Christ, and the manifestation of God in the flesh. We should give glory to God, because today God wants to obtain a church that expresses Him to deal with His enemy. Therefore, God wants us to enjoy the riches of Christ, to be constituted and saturated with the riches of Christ, and to become the Body of Christ for His expression in each locality that is on the ground of oneness.<p>Perhaps some would say that we should not speak about the church and that it does not matter how we meet. However, I know deep within that it is necessary to speak about the church. In the past sixty years in mainland China, in Taiwan, and now in America, some were with us but later were influenced by others to refrain from speaking about the church and to reject the ground of oneness of the church. I saw with my own eyes that these ones had a hard time growing strong in Christ. Some were not building up but dividing the Body of Christ. Once they abandoned the ground of oneness, they did not and could not keep the oneness of the Spirit, and the result was division after division. This is a historical fact.<p>I hope that especially you young people who hear this word would from now on always see the church, know the church, and remain in the church. The church is the place where you are fed and where you can dwell securely. In the church you are supplied. This is because what the Lord wants is the church. This is a way not of man&#8217;s choosing; it is the Lord&#8217;s way. We cannot give up this testimony, nor can any person destroy this testimony. This is the testimony of the oneness of the Body of Christ. The Head is one, the Body is one, and the expression is one; they are all Christ. We must preserve this oneness in order to escape all errors. Then our relationship with the church will be like the proper relationship between a husband and wife. A husband and wife must be one flesh; they cannot divorce. Neither the husband nor the wife can change his or her standing because of dissatisfaction; otherwise, all kinds of corrupt things will be brought in. May your vision of the church be with such a proper and clear view.<h2 class=head1>THE EXPRESSION OF CHRIST BEING THE EXPRESSION OF GOD</h2><p>The expression of Christ is the expression of God. Because the fullness of Christ is the fullness of God, the expression of Christ is also the expression of God. Ephesians 3:17-19 says, &#8220;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you...may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are...that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&#8221; The universe has its dimensions, but no one is able to measure its breadth and length and height and depth. The dimensions of the universe are Christ. Christ is the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the universe.<p>In our experience, we first experience the breadth of what Christ is, and then the length. Then we advance and experience, in the church, the height and depth of His riches. From the horizontal aspect of breadth and length to the vertical aspect of height and depth, we are going from a plane to a cube. When we experience Christ together with the brothers and sisters in the church and together apprehend the dimensions of Christ, we discover that the riches of Christ are limitless and immeasurable. Through the bountiful supply of the indwelling, life-giving Spirit, the riches of Christ are constantly being dispensed into us that we may be filled and saturated unto all the fullness of God. The fullness of God refers to the expression of the riches of what God is, and this makes us the expression of God, which is the church of Christ.<h2 class=head1>BECOMING FULL-GROWN AND ARRIVING AT THE MEASURE OF THE STATURE OF THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h2><p>Ephesians 4:11-12 says, &#8220;And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&#8221; We are here perfecting the saints unto the work of the ministry. The work of the ministry is not just the preaching of the gospel, nor is it just the teaching of the Bible or the setting up of a meeting. The work of the ministry is to build up the Body of Christ. According to the Greek grammar, using the word unto twice here is in apposition and implies that the work of the ministry and the building up of the Body of Christ are not two different matters but two ways of saying the same thing. Therefore, unto the work of the ministry equals unto the building up of the Body of Christ. Our work is not merely to preach the gospel, to set up a meeting, or to teach people about the Bible. These are all things we should do, but they are all for the building up of the Body of Christ-the church. If any activity is not for the building up of the Body of Christ, it is a work of division, and it is not for the work of the ministry. The work of the ministry has only one goal, that is to build up the Body of Christ-the church.<p>Verse 13 says, &#8220;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&#8221; This does not refer to three different kinds of arriving, but to one arriving with three aspects. The first aspect is arriving at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God. The second aspect is arriving at a full-grown man. Although we have the church here today, we must confess that we are still immature, that we have not arrived at a full-grown man. We are still in the process of being built up until we arrive at a full-grown man. The third aspect is arriving at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. This fullness of the stature is the church. To arrive at the full-grown stature of the church is to arrive at the stature of the fullness of Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE UNIQUE GOAL</h2><p>We have seen this Christ in His excellency. His surpassingness, His transcendence, His glory, and His riches are all for one unique goal-His fullness. His fullness is His expression, and His expression is His church.<p>The work we are doing here is a spiritual warfare. We are not beating the air in vain with empty fists, nor are we running without a clear aim or goal. Our goal is the same goal as that of the apostle Paul and all those who have ministered throughout the ages: to build up the Body of Christ. We cannot have any work that divides the Body of Christ. If we preach the gospel, teach the Bible, or set up meetings, but this leads to the division of the Body of Christ, we should not do it. All of our work should be a part of the work of the ministry and should all have the goal of building up the Body of Christ.<p>I deeply believe that this is the proper way. The more we go on, the more we will have faith; the more we speak, the more we will have to speak about; the more we preach, the more capacity and boldness we will have to preach. The trumpet we are sounding here is the same trumpet sounded by the apostle Paul and by the saints throughout the ages. Our trumpet sound is in one accord. From Taiwan to America, we have been sounding this trumpet for more than twenty years, and we will continue to sound this trumpet without changing our tune. We do this because the excellent Christ has become our all, and we do it for the expression of His fullness-His church. This is God&#8217;s unique goal.</body></html>
