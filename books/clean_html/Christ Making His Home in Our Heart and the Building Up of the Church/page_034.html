<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S WILL BEING CONTRARY TO MAN&rsquo;S CONCEPT</h2>
<p>Few Bible readers understand the book of Job. Job was written from the standpoint of human adversities. The book of Job was written on the human level, but it also reveals God&rsquo;s intention for man in his adversities. At the end of the book of Job God comes in and says that all the words spoken by Job and his three friends were words without knowledge. Nevertheless, their words are frequently quoted by Christians.</p>
<p>For example, Job 22:21-28 often is quoted: &ldquo;Be well disposed to Him and at peace with Him; / By such, good will come upon you. / Receive instruction from His mouth, / And lay up His words in your heart. / If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up. / If you put injustice far away from your tents, / And place your gold nuggets in the dust / And your gold of Ophir in the stones of the brooks, / Then the Almighty will be your gold nuggets / And precious silver to you. / For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty, / And you will lift up your countenance to God. / You will pray to Him, and He will hear you; / And you will repay your vows. / You will also decree something, and it will be established for you; / And light will shine on your ways.&rdquo; This was spoken by Eliphaz the Temanite. Job responded to these words and said, &ldquo;Today also my complaint is bitter; / My stroke is heavy because of my groaning. / Oh that I knew where I might find Him, / That I might come to His seat! / I would present my cause in order before Him, / And I would fill my mouth with arguments&rdquo; (23:2-4).</p>
<p>Many people consider the portion spoken by Eliphaz to be very good, and they like to quote it. However, they do not realize that at the end of the book of Job God judged the words spoken by Job and his three friends. God said that their words darkened His counsel, His will, and that their words were without knowledge (38:1-2).</p>
<p>Some may ask what is God&rsquo;s will and why does God regard the words that we consider to be wonderful as words without knowledge that darken His will? This illustrates the problem that Christians have in reading the Bible. God desires to give man grace, mercy, and blessing. However, man has the thought that he must be pious and accomplish something for God. With regard to this, we can obtain help from the Psalms. Most of the psalms were written by David, who is a good example. From David&rsquo;s life we see that if a person is strong, God will break his strength; if a person is perfect, God will break his perfection; and if a person is capable, God will break his capability.</p>
<p>All human concepts, thoughts, and doctrines counsel people to be strong, perfect, and capable before God. However, the Bible shows that God always breaks those who are strong, perfect, and capable. This does not mean that we should now be weak, imperfect, or incapable before God. This is not what I mean. Rather, we should consider only whether God can supply us with grace, mercy, and blessing, not whether we are strong, perfect, or capable. It is a question of whether in our strength and perfection God can supply us with grace, mercy, and blessing. If this is the case, our concepts will not be a hindrance to God&rsquo;s intention.</p>
<p>The Bible is the utterance of God. However, the words of the Bible passed through men and were often written in the midst of human sufferings. Therefore, there are several veils that can cover us. The snacks we purchase are a good example. They are covered by a layer of wrapping paper, but the wrapping paper is not the snack. Some words in the Bible are like wrapping paper. In the book of Job there are some &ldquo;snacks,&rdquo; but they have many layers of wrapping paper.</p>
<p>When we read the Bible, it is not easy for us to differentiate which words are wrapping paper and which words are snacks. It is easy for us to remove the wrapping paper, considering it to be the main content. The debates in the book of Job are wrapping paper, but it is not easy for us to discern this. Hence, it is not easy to read the Bible. We are often influenced by our natural concepts when we read the Bible. According to our concept, we think that God wants us to be strong, perfect, and capable. We do not realize that these things are a hindrance to God. God desires that we come to the throne of grace so that we can receive mercy and grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GRACE BEING GOD REACHING MAN</h2>
<p>Regrettably, few people know what grace and mercy are. Grace is God working Himself into us. For example, our ability to believe is grace, and this is God worked into us. Grace does not mean that God does something for us. Rather, grace is what God is and what God has done reaching us.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness. The disciples were regarded as uneducated men and laymen from Galilee (Acts 2:7; 4:13). Their standing up to speak for the Lord was grace. None of the disciples could boast that they were educated or eloquent, nor could they be proud, because they knew that it was God&rsquo;s grace that enabled them to speak. Their ability to speak, their eloquence, and their boldness were the result of God working Himself into them. This was altogether a matter of grace. The disciples did not have any education, nor were they bold. They were uneducated laymen, and they were timid. It was God&rsquo;s grace that they spoke for Him with boldness. Hence, grace is not something that we have, that we are able to do, or that we have done. Grace is God reaching us. God&rsquo;s reaching us can be compared to being struck by electricity. It is not that we reach the electricity but that electricity reaches us. Grace is God reaching man.</p>
<p>We may need to learn many lessons in order to know grace. Sometimes we may feel that a brother does not know grace and that he never feels the need for grace, because he is strong, bold, eloquent, and able to give messages. We may not know what grace is, because we live and work according to our ability. Most of what we do is according to our ability. This is not grace. Grace is God as everything to us. In 2 Corinthians 12 Paul said that he had a thorn in his body so that he would not be lifted up. He prayed three times, asking the Lord to remove the thorn, but the Lord said, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you&rdquo; (v. 9). The Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;I will not remove the thorn, because if I do, you will depend on your strength and not on grace. This thorn is to help you sense your weakness and your need for grace. You need Me as grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grace involves nothing of ourselves. Grace is God becoming everything to us. Grace is God and all that He is becoming our replacement. If we lack eloquence, grace is God coming to be our eloquence. If we lack ability or wisdom, grace is God coming to be our ability and wisdom.</p>
