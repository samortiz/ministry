<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING BUILT UPON THE KNOWLEDGE<br />OF THE REVELATION OF CHRIST</h2><p>The Bible tells us that the church is built upon the rock (Matt. 16:18). The Catholic Church considers the rock to be Peter. Actually, they are wrong, because Peter means a little stone in the original language; he was not the rock. The Lord Jesus told Peter that he was a little stone and that He would build His church upon the rock. Have you seen this? The church is not built upon Peter, but upon the rock. What is the rock? When men know the Lord as Christ, as the Son of the living God, and when the person and work of Christ are revealed, we have the rock. In other words, the rock is the revealed Christ. The knowledge of the Lord as Christ and as the Son of the living God is something that is not revealed by men, but by the Father who is in the heavens (v. 17). The ones who have seen this revelation are taught by God.</p><p>All those who hear of the Lord through men and who know the things of the Lord only through men are not genuine Christians. Anything that is not built upon the rock is not the church. Today it is possible for everyone to receive revelation. Knowing Christ does not mean that we say what everyone else says about Him; we have to know Him personally. Many people study the Bible, but they do not know the Lord. They listen to messages, but the messages do not produce any effect on them. This proves that their efforts are the work of men, not the work of God. God's work is to reveal His Son. Every Christian has to receive revelation directly from the Lord. He has to know the kind of person that Christ is before he can believe in Him and receive Him with a living faith. When he believes and receives, he develops a direct relationship with God. Only those who know God and who know the Lord in this way can be considered as real Christians.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we should not consider merely the outward appearance of the Lord and put Him in the same category as Elijah and Jeremiah. We should know the Lord from the deepest part of our being. Only then can we be considered as Christians. Everyone who has not been to the mountain of transfiguration does not know the Lord. The problem with believers today is that they are like the disciples in those days; they do not know the inward Christ. They only see His outward appearance. You may memorize the catechism, but you will still know nothing about Christ and the Bible; you merely know His outward appearance. None of these things will do you any good. Christ is inward, and only that which is living within counts. You have to pierce through His outward shell to recognize Him inwardly. Others may look at the outward appearance, but we know Him inwardly and are directly related to Him alone. This is what distinguishes a Christian from the rest of the world. Every Christian has to ascend to the mountain of transfiguration. Otherwise, he is nothing but a Christian according to tradition and appearance, one who knows nothing about the inward Christ.</p><p>What does it mean to be a traditional and outward Christian? Suppose the son of a pastor reads the Bible every day and prays every evening. He is very familiar with the stories in the Bible. He attends church services every week, fifty-two weeks a year. He is well acquainted with the doctrines of Christianity and knows everything that you are talking about. Yet he is not saved. He knows nothing about Christ being his personal Savior. He is a Christian by tradition. He receives everything from men and not directly from God. He knows only the outward Christ. The knowledge of the inward Christ, however, is something entirely different. Suppose a man is a Christian. Through his influence, his son professes a Christian faith. This may go on for many years. But one day, thank God, the light of the Holy Spirit reaches the son. He touches Christ and has a direct relationship with the Lord. He knows Christ in a genuine way. This is the difference between an outward knowledge and an inward knowledge of Christ. Many Christians only see a disguised Christ; they do not see His true image. But once they receive revelation and see His true image, they will know Him in a real way.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, what is your knowledge of Christ? If you know Him in the depth of your being, you will have the experience of being crucified, resurrected, and victorious together with Christ; these things will be possible in you. Christ will no longer be abstract; He will be real in you. Let me say honestly that if a person has not received the revelation of Christ the Son of God, he is not a Christian. He has nothing to do with the rock, and he is a person apart from the rock.</p><p>The Lord Jesus said to the disciples, "But you, who do you say that I am?" (Matt. 16:15). We should have a Christ that we know through revelation, and we should believe and receive Him with a living faith. When this happens, the kingdom of God will come upon us. If a man is not born again, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. Those who have seen the revelation on the mountain enter the kingdom of God, and those who have not received such a revelation are not yet regenerated; they have no part in the kingdom of God.</p><p>Romans 14:17 says, "For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit." Everything is in the Spirit. If a man has not received the revelation from the Spirit to know Christ, he will know nothing about spiritual things. If you try to explain something spiritual to him, he will have a headache and not get anything out of it. He has not seen God. He has not seen the Lord, and he does not know anything about the kingdom of God. He may think that he knows a great deal, but what he knows are merely outward things. The Lord is only an abstract Christ to him. The problem today is that the Christ known by God's children is not very real. One does not know Christ through pastors or teachers; he has to receive direct light and revelation from the Lord. This is the first item in Christianity.</p>
