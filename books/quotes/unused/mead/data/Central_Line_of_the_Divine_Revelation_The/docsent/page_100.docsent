   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we love our soul-life we will lose it, but if we hate our soul-life we will keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The word for unto in Greek carries the notions of for, with a view to, and resulting in. Hence, to keep our soul-life unto eternal life is to keep it for, with a view to, and resulting in eternal life.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have this eternal life, but we often do not have the enjoyment of it because we do not hate our soulish life.</S>
