<p>Prayer: Lord, You have brought us out of many preoccupations and have called us into Your name. Tonight we are all gathered together. Here we have You, we have Your Spirit, we have Your name, and even more we have Your Word. Lord, when we read Your Word, we sense Your presence. While we are speaking here, may You vindicate that we are one spirit with You. Speak through our speaking. While we speak, may You speak also. O Lord, grant us the feeling, and grant us Your thoughts, Your expression, and Your utterance, even a spontaneous and fresh utterance, an utterance that will meet Your need as well as ours. Lord, what we need is just You. You are the Word, and You are the Spirit. You are even our expression and utterance. Strengthen us within and without, and make our inner man stronger than our outer man. Lord, may You pour Yourself upon us, and fill us up, nourish us, saturate us, and water us. Wherever we are, whether we sit on the balcony or on the main floor, may You fill us. Open up Your Word to every one of us. Lord, may You teach us mouth to mouth and reveal to us Spirit to spirit. May we touch You and Your presence, Your loveliness, and Your grace. May everyone present in this meeting feel Your presence with us. Grant us the warmth, the binding of our wounds, the healing, the recovery, and even the strengthening. Lord Jesus, we really need You. We wait on You from the depth of our being. Thank You that You have taken the church in Taipei onto the proper track and that it is now going on steadfastly in this new way. May You glorify Your name again tonight. Shame Your enemy, and grant Your blessings to us. We bind the evil one, which is Your enemy, by Your victorious name. Not only do we bind him here in Taipei; we bind him over the whole earth that there would be churches in Your recovery everywhere on earth. Do destroy all of his evil works and all the dark moves. We believe that the cross has overcome the enemy. Today we declare Your victory by the cross. Manifest Your glory, and shame Your enemy. We lift up our hands and call on You. Amen.</p>
<p>In this special conference, we want to see something higher than before. The inward reality is deeper, more far-reaching, and profound. The six verses in Ephesians 4:11-16 are the peak of the truth in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Without the leading of the Lord and the revelation of the Bible, there is no way for us to understand them. What is an apostle? What is a prophet? What is an evangelist? What is a shepherd and teacher? How do these four kinds of gifts combine together to perfect the saints for the work of the ministry unto the building up of the Body of Christ? How do we arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ? When you put these words together, seemingly you can understand all the words and phrases. But when you put the six verses together, it is difficult to understand the meaning of them. For this reason, tonight we have to ask the Lord to bring us to this peak of the Bible.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST DESCENDING<br />
INTO THE LOWER PARTS OF THE EARTH<br />
AND ASCENDING FAR ABOVE THE HEAVENS</h2>
<p>This portion first shows us the ascended Head. &ldquo;Wherefore He says, Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men. (Now this, He ascended, what is it except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth? He who descended is the same who also ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things)&rdquo; (Eph. 4:8-10). Christ is the One who ascended to the height. The fact that He has ascended to the height proves that He had descended to a low place. He was originally on the throne in heaven. In His becoming flesh, He came down from heaven to earth and was born in a manger in Bethlehem, a small, earthly town.</p>
<p>He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. Then He went to the cross and died there. After this He went down to Hades, which is the &ldquo;lower parts of the earth&rdquo; mentioned in verse 9. From there, He resurrected from the dead and came out of Hades and the grave, ascending to the earth. After forty days, He ascended from the earth before the eyes of the disciples far above all the heavens (Acts 1:9). The descending of the Lord was from heaven to the earth, then from the earth to Hades. His ascending was from Hades to the earth, then from the earth to the height above all the heavens. This journey of His was His work. In this work He first became flesh to be a man. The unlimited, boundless God who transcends time and space became a man limited in time and space, restricted in all respects. When He was in Judea He could not be in Galilee, and when He was in Galilee He could not be in Jerusalem. He was restricted by time and space for thirty-three and a half years. This was not a short period of time. Hence, His becoming flesh to be a man was a great matter.</p>
<p>Neither was it a small thing for Him to live on earth for such a long time. While He was on earth, the earth was in confusion. There was almost nothing that could afford Him joy. Even His closest disciple denied Him when He was about to go to the cross. He bore all this. It was not a simple thing for Him to bear this for thirty-three and a half years. Then He went through a process to go to the cross. He passed through man&rsquo;s arrest, interrogations, and examinations. He was condemned unrighteously and unfairly by the blind religion in conjunction with the dark politics. He bore His own cross for part of the way from the city of Jerusalem to Golgotha and was crucified there. He remained on the cross for six hours, accomplishing the work of the cross, and entered into the grave and descended into Hades. After three days, He came out of Hades and the grave and was resurrected. In His resurrection He remained on earth for forty more days before ascending to the heavens.</p>
<p>Throughout this process He accomplished many works. First, He brought God into man in a real way. Second, He lived in man to pass through all the sufferings of human life. Third, He went to the cross to accomplish the all-inclusive death. On the negative side, He solved the problem of our sin (John 1:29; 1 Pet. 2:24; Heb. 9:26, 28; 1 Cor. 15:3), dealt with the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3), crucified the old man on the cross (Rom. 6:6), destroyed Satan (Heb. 2:14) together with his world (John 12:31), terminated the old creation, and abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances which divided man (Eph. 2:14-16). On the positive side, He released the glorious, divine, unlimited, and eternal life. Fourth, in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is everywhere. He is so available that He is even in our mouth and in our spirit. When you call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; you will have a certain feeling within. If you call on any famous men in history, you will not have such a feeling. This is because they are all dead. Plato, Socrates, Confucius, Mencius, Laotze, etc., all died. Even if you call their names, there will be no response. But once you call on the Lord Jesus, something will start happening within you. You will have a certain feeling. This is because this Jesus has resurrected from the dead and has become the life-giving Spirit. Now He is in us as life. This was all accomplished through His becoming flesh, through His passing through human living, and through His resurrecting from the dead.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GIFTS GIVEN BY THE HEAD<br />
WHO FILLS ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>After Christ&rsquo;s ascension, He gave many gifts to the church. These gifts are a group of people. They are the gifted persons. Among them there are some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers. These are people such as Peter and Paul. They were formerly fallen sinners and sons of Adam, captives who were captured, dominated, and bound by Satan. In spite of their struggling, they had no way of escape. Then one day the Triune God became flesh and entered into these hopeless ones. He even became one of these hopeless ones and was made one with them. He lived in such a hopeless man for thirty-three and a half years and brought this hopeless man to the cross, terminating the hopeless one. Then He destroyed Satan on the cross and crushed the Devil, even Satan, who has the power of death. After this, He captured these ones from the hands of Satan, and in His resurrection, He resurrected them all and uplifted and transformed these fallen ones. In His ascension, He led these captives to the heavens and offered them to the Father. The Father gave these captives as gifts to the ascended Head who, in His position of ascension, gave in turn these gifts to the church.</p>
<p>When the Holy Spirit descended on the day of Pentecost, the Lord gave these people as gifts to the Body, the church. The leading one among them was Peter. From that day on, gifts have been given to the church continually. One of these gifts was Saul of Tarsus. Formerly, he was one who was against God, against the Lord Jesus, persecuting the churches, and murdering the saints. While he was on the way to Damascus to persecute the saints, the Lord, who captured him out of the hand of Satan, appeared to him. Immediately he fell to the ground, and he heard a voice that spoke to him, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Who are You, Lord?&rdquo; The Lord said, &ldquo;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting&rdquo; (Acts 9:4b-5). Saul thought that Jesus was in the grave; he never imagined that Jesus was in heaven. He thought that he was persecuting men on earth; he never realized that he was persecuting the Lord in heaven. That day Paul was saved. Later the Lord led him away to a quiet place and showed him the revelation concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. It became the content of his fourteen Epistles, which are the deepest books of the New Testament. Tonight we read a portion from Ephesians chapter four. Had it not been for Paul&rsquo;s seeing, and his writing it down in the Bible, no one would have ever known this matter concerning the ascended Head giving the gifts. Without the revelation and exposition from the Lord, we would not be able to understand this portion even if we were to read it more than a thousand times. The reason for this is that these words are deep words in God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>The Triune God became flesh, passed through human living, died on the cross, entered into Hades, and resurrected from the dead. Through this process of descending and ascending, He captured us, the captives of Satan. He put His life into us to regenerate us, and He put His nature into us that our humanity would be uplifted and transformed.</p>
<p>I believe that whether you have been saved for a long time or a short time, you will discover that you are transformed and have been uplifted higher than before. This does not mean an outward uplifting; rather, it means an uplifting in the inward nature. This uplifting in nature grows higher and higher day by day until we become the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL BELIEVERS CAN BECOME THE APOSTLES,<br />
THE PROPHETS, THE EVANGELISTS,<br />
THE SHEPHERDS AND TEACHERS</h2>
<p>After we have believed in the Lord Jesus and have been saved, many of us have preached the gospel to others. After we preached the gospel, we began shepherding and teaching in the home meetings and group meetings. If we have ever begotten, nourished, and taught, we are the evangelists and the shepherds and teachers. A prophet in the sense of the original Greek language is a spokesman of the Lord. He is one who speaks for God, speaks forth God, and speaks and supplies God into men. Everyone who speaks for the Lord in this way is a prophet.</p>
<p>I came into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in 1932. We have been studying this matter of the apostles for over fifty years to find out who are the apostles and what are their qualifications and status. I received tremendous help from Brother Watchman Nee. Based on our further study the last thirty or so years, we can now say that the light is very clear. Last week at the elders and co-workers&rsquo; training, my first message covered the basic qualifications of an apostle: first, he must have the revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy concerning Christ and the church (Matt. 16:16-18; Gal. 1:11-12, 15-16; Eph. 3:3-4, 8-11; 5:32); second, he must be able to preach the gospel of Christ and lead the chosen and called sinners to Him (Gal. 1:16a; Eph. 3:8; 2 Cor. 11:2); third, he must be able to raise up local churches and to appoint elders to lead, shepherd, teach, and oversee these churches (Acts 14:23; 1 Tim. 5:17; 1 Pet. 5:2); fourth, he must be able to define doctrines, open up the truth, perfect the saints, and build up the Body of Christ (1 Tim. 2:7; Eph. 4:11-12). These four items are the works that an apostle should do. They are also his qualifications to be an apostle.</p>
<p>All the brothers and sisters in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have the possibility of becoming an apostle, a prophet, an evangelist, or a shepherd and teacher. This is the reason why we felt that we must change the system during the past four years. In the old system, we listened to messages week after week. Yet in the end, we were still unable to be the apostles, prophets, shepherds and teachers. We were not even able to preach the gospel. When we tried to help a friend or a relative to be saved, we had to bring him to the gospel meeting to listen to a gospel message. Others had to preach the gospel for us. This was the damage of the old system. I am so happy that since we began practicing the new system last November, many have learned to preach the gospel, to shepherd, and to prophesy. I hope that in two or three years, many of you will become apostles. There is much hope for this.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GIFTS PERFECTING THE SAINTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">That the Saints May Participate<br />
in the Work of the New Testament Ministry,<br />
Which Is the Building Up of the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>The book of Ephesians shows us that the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are for the perfecting of the saints. In a university, there are many professors of various subjects. They perfect the students with the purpose that the latter would do the same work they are doing. In the same way, the church is like a university. Some advanced brothers and sisters have already become the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers. Daily they lead, feed, and teach the saints with the goal that the saints would be perfected to do the work of the ministry, which is the work of the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers, unto the building up of the Body of Christ. This work of the building up of the Body of Christ, when considered separately, involves first, the preaching of the gospel to bring people to the Lord. Second, it involves the home meetings for the feeding of the believers; this is a mouth-to-mouth feeding. Third, it involves the group meetings where they are taught the truth. Fourth, it involves the prophesying where they speak forth the Lord and dispense Him into others. As a result, they become the apostles and can conduct meetings and help people to go on. All this is to build up the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, you must improve yourselves through studying. Every morning you need to read and digest two to three verses of the Bible. At other times you also have to try your best to read as much of the Bible as possible. If you take two to three verses a day, in a month you will have sixty to seventy verses. In a year you will have about a thousand verses digested. After three years you will have three thousand verses of the Lord&rsquo;s Word in you. This is not all. We have the Recovery Version of the Bible with the footnotes and all the Life-study Messages. We are like a scholarly family; there is constantly the scholarly influence around us. Spontaneously we will have a full knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p>Next, you must pay attention to the growth in life. You must grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things. Even the way we comb our hair, dress ourselves, and put on our ties have to match the Spirit within us. If they do not match, we have to change. This is to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things. In this way, you will have the light of the truth, and you will have the growth in life. When you go to contact people, you will be able to feed the younger ones and teach the more mature ones. For the ones who are even more mature, you can perfect them to do the same thing that you are doing.</p>
<p>At the same time, we all have our own family and children. We should live a normal life in an uplifted way. We should provide our children with a good and proper education. For this we need to work to earn our living. This involves our time and energy. We should make a good schedule and should devote at least one or two evenings a week to go out for two hours, either to preach the gospel by knocking on doors, or to feed the saved ones in their homes. We can also go to the small groups to contact three to five families and teach them some further truth. Then we can bring these to the bigger meetings. If there are ten or twenty thousand saints in Taipei who would do this week by week, the first aspect of the gifts perfecting the saints would be achieved, which is that the saints would participate in the work of the New Testament ministry, the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Leading the Saints to Arrive at the Oneness<br />
of the Faith of the New Testament</h2>
<p>When we go out to preach the gospel, we are leading people into the faith. Man basically has no faith. Whatever faith he does have is blind faith. We have to give people the proper faith by telling them that there is only one God in the universe. This God has become the Lord Jesus Christ. For us He became a man, died on the cross, accomplished redemption, and resurrected from the dead to dispense life into us. When we receive Him, we are saved. These kinds of words will put others onto the proper track of faith. After this we have to continue to teach and to lead them until they arrive at the oneness of the faith. The more we help them, the more they will be focused in the faith, and the more they will be brought to the oneness of the faith. Today there are many denominations and sects within Christianity because they all hold different views concerning the faith. They cannot agree, and the oneness of the Body of Christ is lost. I hope that among us we can arrive at the oneness of the faith so that we can preserve the oneness of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">Leading the Saints to Arrive at the Oneness<br />
of the Full Knowledge of the Son of God</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the Son of God. First, He was the Only Begotten of God, without a beginning or an ending. He is the Lord of all, the God in creation. Then He became flesh and put on humanity, passing through death to enter into resurrection. In resurrection, He brought humanity into divinity. The Only Begotten became the Firstborn of God, bearing the dual status, having both divinity and humanity. With respect to His divinity, He is God, and He is the Creator. With respect to His humanity, He is man, and He is a creature. As such, He is a God-man, the all-inclusive Lord. We still need to be led on to advance in the full knowledge of this Lord so that we would not only arrive at the oneness of the faith, but would arrive at the oneness of the knowledge of this mysterious and all-inclusive One.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Leading the Saints to Arrive<br />
at a Full-grown Man in the Divine Life</h2>
<p>We should also grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things. When we grow, we will arrive at a full-grown man, which means a man that is matured in life. We will then no longer be babes.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Leading the Saints to Grow into the Measure<br />
of the Stature of the Fullness of Christ</h2>
<p>Our body is our fullness, and our fullness is our expression. In the same way, the fullness of Christ is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:23). This Body has a stature with a measure. In order to lead the saints to grow into the measure of this stature of the fullness of Christ, we need to help them to grow in life so that they would hold fast the faith and would lay hold of their knowledge of Christ, giving up all the minor and shallower doctrines and concepts that cause division. In this way, we will grow gradually and will arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</p>
<p>The above few things are what the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers preach and do every day. I hope that you all would learn to speak and to do these same things. You must learn the truth, and know what is the faith, and who is the Son of God, and how to grow in life. When you have learned these lessons and have been taught this way, you will be able to teach others in the same way. As a result, not only are you being perfected, even others are being perfected by you. This is the reason for our change of system. It is to afford everyone equal opportunity to develop his spiritual, organic function. In this way, everyone is learning to speak, to teach, and to grow. I hope these words will get into you and that you will truly receive them. As Christians in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we should be those who are genuine and proper. We should be faithful to the Lord. What we are doing here is absolutely according to the truth of the Bible. By leading and perfecting others, we make everyone an evangelist, a shepherd and teacher, and a prophet who speaks the Lord forth and who speaks the Lord into others. We also make everyone an apostle who knows the revelation, is able to preach the gospel of Christ, can lead the sinners to Him, can raise up a small meeting to express the Lord, and can even define doctrines, release the truth, perfect the saints, and build up the Body of Christ. As a result, the church will be full of apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. This is the church that the Lord is after.</p>

<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You that You speak to us in Your recovery all the time. You are the life-giving Spirit living in us and moving among us. We again look to You for this meeting. We confess that we can do nothing and that we have nothing. We are poor and are nothing. Lord, apart from You we have nothing and can do nothing. All that we have depends on You. Speak to us in our speaking, and listen for us in our listening. Vindicate to us that we are one spirit with You. Make us understand and grant us the light in our listening. Lord, grant grace to everyone that is here in the meeting, and may everyone receive something from You. May none have come in vain. May everyone receive something and be fed. Lord, You are the all-inclusive Christ. You can meet all of our various needs. You can meet many needs by one kind of word. Since You could feed five thousand with five loaves and two fishes, You can supply all of us tonight with the few words we speak. Lord, give us the timely word, the pure word, the word that would crush Your enemy and destroy his power. Remove the darkness, the shadows, the veils, and open our eyes and shine on us. Lord, make those who have loved You for many years love You more. May our love to You never grow old, but may it be renewed day by day.</p>
<p>Lord, show us the real things. The world is vanity; everything will pass away. But those who practice the will of God, who have a part in the building up of the Body of Christ, will abide forever. We worship You that in these last days You have enlightened this revelation among us. We pray that there would be an intensified enlightening tonight so that all of us would receive light and enter into Your reality to have a part in the building up of the Body. Lord, answer our prayer, and pour down Your blessing. For Your own recovery&rsquo;s sake and for the sake of the bride that You are after, be merciful to us. Again, in Your name and upon the position that You have given us, we command You to defeat Your enemy and to build up Your Body that Your recovery may be like the dawning of the day in the coming years and may shine brighter and brighter until the day be fully come. Lord, tonight is the time for You to shine Your light. Open up the sky, and reveal Your heart&rsquo;s desire to every one of us. May we feel Your presence in the depth of our being. Thank You and praise You. You are Emmanuel, the Lord that grants grace to us. May You gain the glory, may we receive the blessing, and may the enemy be defeated and be shamed. Amen!</p>
<p>Tonight we will emphasize Ephesians 4:11-16. These six verses can be divided into two sections. The first three verses are of one section, and the last three are of the other section. The first section speaks of the perfecting of the saints by the gifts given by the ascended Head. The second section speaks of the direct building up of the Body of Christ by the perfected saints.</p><h2 class="head1">BY THE GIFTS&rsquo; PERFECTING</h2>
<p>By His death and resurrection, Christ has conquered Satan and death and has rescued man from the enslaving of Satan. In His ascension, He made these redeemed sinners the gifts through His resurrection life and gave them to the Body that they would do the perfecting work on the saints unto the building up of the Body of Christ. When I was first saved, I did not know anything. I did not know how to read the Bible or how to pray. At most, I had a heart to seek after the Lord and to love the Bible. Praise the Lord that through His riches in His ascension, the ascended Head gained a group of people from His redeemed ones and constituted them the gifts, putting them in the church to perfect us. There are the apostles who raise up churches and define doctrines. There are the prophets who speak for God and speak forth God. There are the evangelists who preach Christ to save sinners. There are the shepherds and teachers who supply life and teach the truth. When we are in the church life attending all the meetings time after time according to the way revealed by the Bible, spontaneously we are perfected in many ways. Gradually, we learn to understand the Bible, we pick up a taste for it, and we find ourselves getting into its riches. We also find ourselves preaching the gospel, feeding and teaching others, prophesying for the Lord, and speaking the Lord into others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING NO LONGER BABES</h2>
<p>When we are continuously perfected little by little in this way, we will produce the result in Ephesians 4:14-16. Verse 14 says, &ldquo;That we may be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.&rdquo; This shows us that to be tossed by the waves and carried about by every wind of teaching is the condition of a babe. These teachings come from the sleight of men which is like the cheating of dice players. They also come in craftiness, leading men to a system of error. Actually, behind these winds and waves is the instigation of Satan, the enemy of God. God wants to build up the Body of Christ. But Satan uses the sleight of men and craftiness to lead men away from the building up of the Body of Christ to his system of error.</p>
<p>Before we were saved, we were in the system of the world. After we were saved, God put us in the church for the building up of the Body of Christ. But Satan deceitfully uses different winds of teaching to stir up the waves and blow the believers away from the building up of the Body of Christ into a system of error, which is Satan&rsquo;s system of darkness. However, if we remain in the proper church life and receive the perfecting mentioned in Ephesians 4:11-13, growing up in the divine life to be a full-grown man, having the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and being no longer babes, we will not be deceived and will not be tossed by the craftiness of Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE WINDS OF TEACHING</h2>
<p>According to the history of the church, we see that most of its difficulties arose from winds of teaching, which are the different teachings. The different teachings came from different speakings, and the different speakings came from different opinions. When the different opinions are added to the sleight of men and craftiness, we have the winds and the waves. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been among us for over sixty years. I came in 1932, fifty-six years ago. During the first ten to twenty years, I was in mainland China. There I saw a lot of storms. In 1949 the Lord brought us overseas&mdash;first to Taiwan. Taiwan can be considered as the base of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery overseas. From here the recovery spread to Southeast Asia, to Japan and Korea, to America, then to Europe, Australasia, Africa, and then to the whole earth. During the last thirty-nine years, there were three or four times when we experienced waves. Every time, the waves came due to the winds, which were the different teachings and opinions. For example, in 1954, for the sake of receiving more help in the spiritual life, we invited Brother T. Austin-Sparks, one whom we considered most spiritual, to come to us. His coming did render us some help. But in private, he had a dissenting view concerning the ground of the church, a practice which we emphasized. He did not agree that the church should be one in each locality and attempted to persuade us to give up the church ground of oneness in the locality. When this dissension arose, some young co-workers who were considered the most advanced were affected. A big storm was stirred up, and it brought much damage to the churches.</p>
<p>During the last one or two years, winds of teaching have risen up again. This time they were not raised up in Taiwan. Rather, they originated from overseas. The first wind of teaching says that after the apostles appoint the elders, they can no longer be involved with the matters of a local church. This kind of speaking is contrary to the teaching of the New Testament. The New Testament shows us that after the apostles appointed the elders, although they entrusted to the elders the responsibility of caring for and leading the church, they themselves never removed their hands. On the contrary, they continued to perfect the saints and even to teach the elders. According to the record of Acts and the Epistles, after the apostles appointed the elders, they did their best to visit and strengthen the churches (Acts 15:36, 40-41; 1 Cor. 4:17; 11:34b). Paul even stayed in Corinth for a year and a half and in Ephesus for three years. During his last preaching journey, on his way back to Jerusalem, he sent for the elders in Ephesus to come to him that he might remind them, charge them, admonish them, and teach them. In his first letter to the Corinthians, he rebuked and instructed the Corinthians again and again. He even said that the remaining matters he would set in order when he came (11:34b). This clearly shows us that, in order to perfect the saints, the apostle cannot give up the church and leave his hands off after he appoints the elders. To say that the apostles cannot henceforth be involved with the church is a wrong teaching. Some are blowing this wind and are even practicing this openly. As a result, this has become a problem among us.</p>
<p>The second wind some are emphasizing is that every local church should be absolutely autonomous. The local church is established on the principle of one city one church. In a certain sense, the administration is by locality. For example, whether a church should break the bread on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning or the Lord&rsquo;s Day evening, or whether it should meet in one central hall or in a few dozen halls are matters related to the local administration of a local church. But on the other hand, the church is the Body of Christ. It is universal. All the millions of saved ones throughout the centuries are in this Body. The life within this Body is the life pulse of every member. It is like the blood circulation; you can never separate it into different parts. As far as the different parts of our body are concerned, you may say that this is the hand and that is the leg. But as far as the blood circulation is concerned, you cannot say that this is the blood of the hand and that is the blood of the leg. Hence, the management of a local church is, on the one hand, local in its administration yet, on the other hand, not isolated in its communication. Not only is there the mutual sharing of finance; even in other practical affairs we see the same thing. The churches in the various localities are managed separately, yet they are not separated absolutely. They are still the universal, corporate Body of Christ. For anyone to stress the autonomy or independence of a local church is too much. It destroys the oneness of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The third wind of teaching some are speaking is that the church is built up by the Lord Jesus Himself and that there is no need for man to build it. They base their words on Matthew 16:18. But according to the revelation of the New Testament, the Lord Jesus did not directly build up the church. Rather, first He perfected the gifts, and then He gave the gifts to the church. These gifted ones do not directly build up the church either. Rather, they perfect the saints, who are the many members of Christ. These saints directly build up the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:11-16). In conclusion, this is how Christ builds the church. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 3:10 that he had received a ministry from God, and as a wise master builder he had laid the unique foundation, which is Christ, upon which others might build. This clearly shows that the Lord builds the church through His many ministers, even through each of the many members in His Body. It is wrong for some to say that the building up of the church requires only the Lord Jesus and does not require any man.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT BEING DECEIVED<br />
BY GROWING INTO A FULL-GROWN MAN</h2>
<p>When these three winds blow among us, they produce three waves which cause difficulties among us. Anyone who is swept into these proves that he is childish in Christ and immature in life. If he is a full-grown man and is no longer a babe, he will not be deceived. Ephesians 4:14 tells us that these teachings are &ldquo;in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.&rdquo; The &ldquo;sleight of men&rdquo; in Greek signifies the cheating of dice players. Those who say these things are all outwardly very good in their speaking. But within their speaking, there are different speakings. This is why it is a sleight of men. If I speak to a couple, agreeing with them outwardly but causing them to divorce each other eventually, I am doing things in the sleight of men. &ldquo;Craftiness&rdquo; also refers to the tricks of the gamblers. Those who say these things lead people into the wiles of Satan and are used by Satan to bring people into his system of error. Try to imagine how the saints can be perfected if the apostles are to have nothing to do with a local church after they have appointed the elders. When the local churches are deprived of the perfecting by the apostles, what will happen to them? This is like a university having no principal or professor. How can education be conducted? This reasoning is very clear. Hence, these kinds of sayings are a kind of craftiness, a system set up by Satan for the purpose of ensnaring in sin those who seek after the Lord and causing them to deviate from the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOLDING TO TRUTH IN LOVE</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:15 says, &ldquo;But holding to truth in love.&rdquo; To hold to truth is in contrast to the sleight of men and the craftiness in verse 14. To be carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men and to be led into a system of error is to fail to hold to truth in love. The &ldquo;truth&rdquo; here refers to things that are true. The first item of these is God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, which is God&rsquo;s eternal plan. God has an eternal plan in the universe, which is His economy. It is to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people that He may have a corporate expression. The second item is the all-inclusive Christ. The third item is the church as the Body of Christ for expressing Him. These three things are the true things. We should hold to these true things in love that we may grow up into Christ. All teachings and speakings that separate and isolate us from these three things should be rejected.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GROWING UP INTO THE HEAD, CHRIST, IN ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>When we hold to truth in the love of God, we will grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ (Eph. 4:15). This shows that our growth in life with Christ should be the growth of the members in the Body under the Head. In everything big or small, such as the way we dress, the way we comb our hair, the way we shop, and the way we speak, we should take Christ as the Head, submitting under His headship. In this way, we will grow into Him and will allow Him to occupy all of our inward parts, that is, our mind, emotion, and will. In this way, He will gradually increase and grow within us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUT FROM HIM, ALL THE BODY<br />
CAUSES THE GROWTH OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>When we allow Him to be the Head in everything and when we grow up into Him in all things, we, being supplied with the riches of His life, will receive something from Him to transfuse into other members of the Body. Our growth in life is a growth into Him, but our function in the Body of Christ is out from the Head. First, we grow into the Head; then we have something out from the Head for the building up of His Body.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:16 says, &ldquo;Out from whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body.&rdquo; &ldquo;Every joint of the supply&rdquo; refers to the specially gifted persons, such as those mentioned previously. &ldquo;Each one part&rdquo; refers to every member of the Body. Every joint of the supply is important to the Body of Christ; it has its special, rich supply. Each one part also has its measure, through the growth in life and the development of the gifts, and operates for the growth of the Body of Christ. Through the joints of the supply and the operation of each one part, all the members of the Body of Christ are fitted and knit together. The fitting is the joining together of the frames into a structure; the knitting is the joining together of all the other parts to the frames to be knit together to become one Body. The result is a gradual growth of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BODY OF CHRIST BUILDING ITSELF UP IN LOVE</h2>
<p>The growth of the Body of Christ is the increase of Christ in the church. The result is that the members of the Body of Christ directly build up the Body of Christ in the element and sphere of the divine love.</p>

<p>Prayer: Lord, thank You for gathering us together into Your name and before Your Word again. We believe that we are one spirit with You. While we are speaking, Lord, do vindicate this matter. As we speak, may You speak in our speaking. Wash us in Your blood. We are all open to You and are hungry for You. May You speak to the depth of every one of us and open our eyes that we may enter into Your mystery and see the mystery of the new way and the mystery in Your economy. Grant us to see that the new way today is an advance in Your economy. Lord, remember that we are weak and poor. Unless You are with us, all of our work and words are in vain. Lord, remember every brother and sister attending the meeting, that no one would return empty-handed, and that everyone would be satisfied by You. Amen!</p>
<p>During the past two Lord&rsquo;s Day evenings, we have seen Ephesians 4:7-16. First, it speaks of the ascended Head giving the gifts, with some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers. These gifts perfect the saints to do the work of the New Testament ministry, which is the building up of the Body of Christ. This building goes on continuously until we all arrive at three things: first, the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God. This oneness is carried out in faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God. The knowledge here refers to the experience and the enjoyment. Hence, this oneness is a oneness in practice. Second, we arrive at a full-grown man. Third, we arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. If we arrive at these three things, we arrive at the peak. We will no longer be babes tossed by the waves and carried about by the winds of teaching. Rather, we will hold to the truth in love and will grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things. When we grow up into Christ, everything will be in Christ, and something will issue out from Him to supply the whole Body. By this, all the Body will be joined and knitted together through every joint of the rich supply and according to the operation in measure of each one part, causing the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love. In this message we will cover specifically the last two verses of this portion of the Word.</p><h2 class="head1">GROWING INTO THE HEAD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Holding to Truth</h2>
<p>Verse 15 says, &ldquo;But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.&rdquo; Today, if we want to build up the Body of Christ, we must love God, Christ, and the church in the love with which God loves us and in the love which He put within us. By this we can hold to the truth in this love. According to the words of Solomon, everything under the sun is vanity; there is no reality (Eccl. 1:2). But there is One who is real in the universe, God Himself. If God occupies the proper position in everything, then everything is true. Otherwise, all things are but vanity of vanities. As Romans 3:4 says, every man is a liar; only God is true. In this true God there are three things: the economy of God, the Christ of God, and the Body of Christ, the church. In the whole universe only this group of things is true. If you take them away from the universe, the universe will become vain. For this reason, when you hear some rumors in the church, you should compare them with these words. Do they conform to God&rsquo;s economy, to the all-inclusive Christ, and to the Body of Christ? If they do not conform to these three things, you should let these rumors go. In this way, you will be holding to truth in love.</p>
<h2 class="head3">In Love&mdash;in the Element and Sphere<br />
of the Divine Love</h2>
<p>Love is not just an element; it is also a sphere. Element refers to the inward constituent. The constituent in the love of God is just God Himself. This constituent of love is in us, and we hold to truth in this constituent. This love is also a sphere. In this love and by this love, we are able to hold to truth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Holding to God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy</h2>
<p>When we hold to truth, the first item to hold to is God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. God&rsquo;s economy is His dispensation of the mystery hidden in Him. God is full within with an economy. He is full of a plan and purpose, and He made arrangements accordingly. In short, He arranged to create the heavens and the earth and to create man according to His image and likeness that man would be like Him, be His vessel, and be prepared for the day when the Creator God would enter into man to be mingled with man, to become the many members of Christ, and to constitute the Body of Christ to express Christ, which is to express the Triune God in Christ. This is the economy of God. It is the dispensation of the mystery hidden in God. This is the first item that we have to hold to.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Holding to the All-inclusive Christ</h2>
<p>Second, we have to hold to the all-inclusive Christ. This Christ is the One who fills all in all. He is not only in all but also fills all. The universe is immeasurable, and Paul compared the breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe to the measure of Christ (Eph. 3:18). This shows us that the measure and riches of Christ are unsearchable. No doubt when Paul wrote the book of Ephesians he saw a vision. That is why he used the highest expressions such as &ldquo;the breadth and length and height and depth&rdquo; (3:18) and &ldquo;the unsearchable riches of Christ&rdquo; (3:8) to describe Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Holding to the Church</h2>
<p>Third, we have to hold to the church. The church is the Body of Christ as the fullness of Christ to express Him. Hence, the church is not an organization, but an organism. The reason why our body is so wonderful is that it is an organism. All the organs of our body, such as the teeth, the nose, and the ears are all grown from our body and are part of our body; they are not installed there by addition. The church is the Body of Christ. It is constituted by those who are regenerated, saved, and have received Christ as their life. If a man does not have Christ in him, even if he is baptized ten thousand times, he is still not a member of the church. This is because the church is completely organic. All the genuine members are grown into the church; they are not added in by organization. We have to hold to this organism and not to any organized congregation.</p><h2 class="head2">Growing into the Head, Christ</h2>
<p>To hold to truth is for the purpose of growing into the Head, Christ. According to our experience, the growth here is not our growth, but it is the growth of Christ within us. This is like the words of John the Baptist: &ldquo;He must increase, but I must decrease&rdquo; (John 3:30). Before we believed in Jesus, it was we who were growing. After we believed in the Lord and began to love Him, we began to decrease, and Christ began to increase within us. In the end we will be like Paul who said that &ldquo;it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). Moreover, when Christ grows within us, we grow in Him. Actually, our growth is just His growth. As a result, we decrease, and He comes in to gradually replace us, and we grow into Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">In All Things&mdash;Everything Big or Small<br />
in Our Daily Life and in Our Work</h2>
<p>In all things means in everything big or small in our daily life and in our work. Whether they are big things, small things, spiritual things, or things in our daily life, we have to allow the Lord to grow in us. We must decrease, and He must grow. Once He grows and we decrease, we will grow into Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Growing into the Head&mdash;through Acknowledging<br />
the Authority of the Headship of Christ</h2>
<p>The meaning of growing into the Head, Christ, is acknowledging the authority of the headship of Christ. We have to acknowledge Him as Lord and Head. He has the authority over us. In all things big or small we have to allow Him to be the Lord. This lesson is not easy. In our eating out in restaurants and in our shopping, seldom do we allow Him to be the Lord. Since we lack the practice in our daily life, it is not a surprise that when we come to the meeting we find it difficult to prophesy for the Lord. The key to prophesying is to allow Jesus to be the Lord. In your daily life you have to allow Jesus to be your Lord. Only then will you have the experience, and only then will you have something to say in the meetings. Christ is not only the Head of us individually; He is also the Head of the church and the Head of all things. We should acknowledge the authority of His headship in our Christian life, in the church life, and in everything. By this we will grow into Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Allowing Christ to Increase and Grow<br />
in All the Inward Parts of the Members</h2>
<p>When we grow into the Head, Christ, we are allowing Christ to increase and grow in all the inward parts of the members. Today our common problem is that we reserve a big part within us for ourselves and give the Lord only a little place. Therefore, it is impossible for Him to increase and grow within us. When He cannot grow, we cannot grow. There are many Christians on earth today; but there are few who would allow the Lord to grow within them. We must allow the Lord to have the proper place in us. We must allow Him to increase, grow, and occupy our whole being, part by part. In this way, when you grow in the Lord and I grow in the Lord, the sum total will be the growth of the Body of Christ. In other words, when Christ grows in you and me, the Body of Christ will grow. Hence, the growth of the Body of Christ is the growth of Christ in His members.</p>
<p>The purpose of our practicing the new way is for the perfecting of the saints. The meaning of the perfecting of the saints is to allow Christ to have the proper place in us and to increase in us day by day. If you allow Christ to grow in you, your gift will be manifested. As a result, Christ will not only be your life and living, but will be your gift as well. In other words, Christ will be everything to you. It is the same with our physical life&mdash;as the body grows, so does the function. We are the members of Christ. As such we must allow Christ to grow in us so that we can be perfected. This cannot be achieved by the meetings where one speaks and the rest listen. The way to be perfected is through the practice of the new way which is according to the Bible. Every point of this new way makes man decrease and supplies man with Christ, that Christ would grow in man. The more you decrease, the more Christ will increase and the more you will be perfected. Hence, the &ldquo;perfecting&rdquo; and the &ldquo;growth&rdquo; in Ephesians chapter four refer to the same thing. To be perfected is to grow in Christ.</p>
<p>In order to perfect others, we must first have the experience ourselves. We must first learn the lessons and know God&rsquo;s economy. Then we can help others to see God&rsquo;s economy. It is not a matter of improving and cultivating ourselves. It is a matter of denying our self and knowing the crucified and resurrected Lord as the Spirit who abides in us to be our life. We should live with Him, move with Him, and allow Him to be the Lord in everything. This shows us that, on the one hand, the cross has terminated our old man. On the other hand, it shows us that Christ is the Spirit of life who is now our life. The cross decreases us, and the resurrecting Spirit supplies Christ into us that we would be equipped. This is the perfecting. In the church meetings, all the prophesying should be based on this and should have this as the focus. This kind of word should be spoken frequently in the meetings. The more we speak this kind of word, the more perfecting there will be. We have to speak until all the brothers and sisters are affected in their daily lives by this kind of word. In this way they will receive the genuine perfecting.</p><h2 class="head1">OUT FROM THE HEAD</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:16 begins with &ldquo;out from whom.&rdquo; The expression &ldquo;out from&rdquo; in the original language carries the sense of &ldquo;originating from.&rdquo; When we grow into Christ in all things big or small, and when we become men in Christ enjoying Him, we will spontaneously have something originating from Him that is for the building up of His Body.</p>
<h2 class="head2">All the Body Causes the Growth<br />
of the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>Verse 16 goes on to say, &ldquo;All the Body...through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body.&rdquo; The growth of the Body of Christ is firstly through the joints of the rich supply. These are the gifts described in verse 11: the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers. They are the joints, which are joined together by the sinews, for the rich supply to every member of the Body of Christ. Second, this growth is according to the operation in measure of each one part. The each one part refers to every member in the Body. Every member in the Body of Christ, whether great or small, has a measure. Because of its measure, it has an operation. Through the rich supply of every joint and according to the operation in measure of each one part, the Body of Christ grows gradually.</p>
<h2 class="head2">All the Body Building Up Together</h2>
<p>Verse 16 says, &ldquo;All the Body, fitted and knit together.&rdquo; To be fitted together is like the joining together of the frames and beams of a house. Hence, to be fitted together is for all the parts of the frames to be joined as one structure. To be knit together is like the filling up of the holes in between the frames by the rocks and the bricks, which are stacked up on top of one another and interwoven together. Hence, to be knit together is for all the other parts to be joined to the frames and to be knit together with one another to form one Body. In this way the whole Body is built together.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Body of Christ Building Itself Up</h2>
<p>The end of verse 16 says, &ldquo;The building up of itself [the Body] in love.&rdquo; The building up of the Body of Christ is in love and by love. This love is not our natural love. Rather, it is the divine love. We are building up the Body of Christ in the element and sphere of the divine love. At the same time, this is the direct building up of the whole Body of Christ by the many members of this Body. The Head does not build directly, nor do the gifted ones do the direct building work. Rather, it is we, the perfected members, who build up the Body of Christ directly.</p>

<p>Prayer: Lord, we thank You for gathering us together into Your name once more. How we treasure this gathering together. May You be with every one of us here. We long after Your word. May You in Your word dispense Yourself into us once more. Every one of us here needs You. Grant every one of us grace that we may receive Your word and may enjoy the riches hidden in Your word. Lord, remove the hindrances, the veils, and the shadows between You and us. Open up to us Your heart&rsquo;s desire, and show us Your way that we may see what You are after today. Lord, we hate the evil one; we hate the enemy. While we are fighting the battle for You here, do fight for us. You are the Captain that leads us on. Dispel all the power of darkness, and shame Your enemy. May You gain the glory among us. We stand on Your victory and declare Your victory, and we bind the evil one, Satan, by Your victorious name. Lord, deal with Your enemy, release those who love You, and release Your riches. Amen!</p>
<p>After four years of studying and experimenting, and through a lot of work and at a great price, we have come to a fairly clear and definite conclusion today. The conclusion is very simple. It entails the life and service of the new way. We are going to cover this matter in this message.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE IN THE NEW WAY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being Revived Every Morning</h2>
<p>The life in the new way is the normal Christian life, which is a life of being revived every morning and overcoming every day. Proverbs 4:18 says, &ldquo;The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day.&rdquo; Dawn is the time when the daylight just begins to break and before the sun actually rises from the east. The Christian pathway is not one of sunset but one like the dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day. From morning until noon is an upward path. As Christians we only have mornings; we do not have afternoons.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s law in nature is that with every twenty-four hours there is a dawning. The dawn brings a new beginning and a new sunrise to every creature. This is the same with the spiritual life of a Christian. Every morning there should be a rising up and a dawning. In 1960 I gave a message on the law of revival. At that time I did not apply the light of the dawn to the subject. Today we see that the Christian life should have a dawn and a new beginning every twenty-four hours. Perhaps you fail miserably today. Nevertheless you can confess your sins to the Lord and can ask for the cleansing of the blood. Tomorrow, you can have a new beginning before the Lord. For this reason a Christian should go to bed early and get up early. When the sun rises in the morning, we should rise up together with it. We should not wait until eight o&rsquo;clock before we rise. We should rise before six o&rsquo;clock, preferably around five o&rsquo;clock. Even the Chinese sages of old exhort people to rise immediately at daybreak. They also say that the plan of the day begins in the morning. This is very reasonable. We Christians are the most proper people on earth. We should live the most proper kind of life. The most proper life is one that follows the sun. When the day breaks, we rise. The first thing we do when we rise is not to be busy with so many things, but to contact the Lord and to pray-read two or three verses of the Bible and to digest them into us.</p>
<p>Lamentations 3:22-24 says, &ldquo;The steadfast love of the Lord...his mercies...are new every morning...The Lord is my portion...therefore I will hope in him.&rdquo; Jeremiah was a weeping prophet. There was nothing in his circumstances that could make him happy. At that time the Israelites had backslidden and become desolate. Their nation had fallen, and they themselves were taken into captivity. He was even among the ones taken into captivity. He wrote these five chapters of lamentations purposely for this. But in his lamentations there is such a portion, whose content is not a lamentation but a song of joy. It is a song of joy in the midst of songs of sorrow. He experienced the whole Jehovah God as his portion. This passage clearly tells us that Jehovah God is our portion. He has become our enjoyment in His love and mercies. He is full of love. And when our situation is too poor for His love, there are His mercies. These are new every morning. For this reason we must lay hold of every morning to rise to receive His new mercies.</p>
<p>I have been a Christian for many years. More and more I have come to realize that I need God&rsquo;s mercies. Many times we become old and backslidden and are not worthy to enjoy God&rsquo;s love. At these times, we still have God&rsquo;s mercies. When you were just saved, you felt good and excited; but after two months, perhaps you started feeling old. It was not the dawn anymore; but, instead, you were at your sunset. In these times you should know that there is still a dawn waiting for you. In this dawn there are God&rsquo;s mercies. The mercies of God are new every morning. This newness indicates that we who love God and seek after Him should have a new beginning every morning to enjoy the Lord as our rich breakfast.</p>
<p>All the physical things in nature have their spiritual significance. For the health of our bodies, we need to eat a good breakfast. In the same way, for our spirit, we need to have the best spiritual breakfast. When we wake up in the morning, we should call on the Lord. The first thing we should think about is the Lord. After that we should enjoy some of the Lord&rsquo;s words. The writer of Psalm 119 says, &ldquo;I rise before dawn and cry for help; I hope in thy words. My eyes are awake before the watches of the night, that I may meditate upon thy promise&rdquo; (vv. 147-148). One usually meditates and thinks with his eyes closed. Why then does it say here that the eyes are awake? We can understand this from our experience. If we want to meditate on the Lord&rsquo;s word, we must open our eyes, otherwise it is easy for us to fall asleep. This shows us that we have to struggle to rise early. It is not an easy thing to get up early. The bed is most lovable at five or six o&rsquo;clock in the morning. It has a strong adhesive power to keep us there. On the other hand, after ten o&rsquo;clock at night the bed seems the most hateful; no one wants to go to bed early. But anyone who goes to bed late and gets up late is not healthy and will not be strong spiritually. Today if we want to live in the new way, we must rise at the dawn of the day, and we should wake up before the watches of the night to do nothing else but call on the Lord and hope and meditate on the Lord&rsquo;s words. Hence, to practice the new way, we must be ones that rise early. It is not that easy for one who does not have morning watch to take the new way.</p><h2 class="head2">Every Day Overcoming</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4:16 Paul says that &ldquo;our inward man is being renewed day by day.&rdquo; The reviving is in the morning, and the overcoming is during the day. We are revived in the morning; but we do not stop there. We have to carry on its effect, which is to be renewed. We should be renewed the whole day. Such renewing is the overcoming. For a Christian, the first thing to overcome is his temper. Everyone has a peculiar temperament. It is difficult for two peculiar persons to be put together. If you can overcome your temper for three days, not in the way of swallowing down your grudge and not just in an outward way but in an inward way, then you are an overcomer. Even a church as good as Philippi needed Paul&rsquo;s exhortation for them not to reason or murmur. These are our common problems. Hence, the ultimate definition of overcoming is to overcome our natural person and our self. Man&rsquo;s temper lies in his natural person. If you are a natural person, living in the old creation, being full of self, and considering the self the first and foremost thing in you, you will surely be one that is full of reasonings and murmurings in the church life. This is why the Bible says that they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts (Gal. 5:24).</p>
<p>Every morning we need a revival and a new beginning. This new beginning includes the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus. When we contact Him, there is the element of death in the life-giving Spirit. When He enters into us, He operates within us to perform the killing and the sterilizing function. This is like taking in antibiotics. The antibiotics kill the germs within us. The element of the Lord&rsquo;s death kills the temper within us, terminating our old creation and enabling us to overcome.</p>
<p>In Romans 7 Paul speaks of the experience of the struggle between the law of sin in the flesh and the law of good in man. This is similar to the struggle between reason and lust as promulgated by Chinese Confucianism. Both show us that only the strong-willed and clear-minded person can overcome and control himself. For most people, it is the lust that wins and the reason that fails. This is why Paul said that he was hopeless, that the good that he willed he did not do, but the evil that he willed not he did. He was a wretched man, one who was sold to sin (Rom. 7:24-25). But in Romans 8, he overcame. He overcame in the law of the Spirit of life (v. 2). There is a law of the Spirit of life, which is a spontaneous power. In this law, he overcame the law of sin and of death.</p>
<p>For this reason every morning we need a revival, and every morning we need to contact the Lord. This contact has a result, which is to renew us within during the whole day. This renewing is a continuation of the morning revival, allowing the revival to develop its killing effect in us during the whole day. In this way we will live an overcoming life.</p>
<p>The Lord promised in Matthew 28:20, &ldquo;I am with you all the days.&rdquo; Since the Lord is with us every day, He lives with us moment by moment. For Him to be with us is for Him to live with us. When we are renewed every day and have the Lord&rsquo;s presence and His living with us every day to be the source of our supply, we will spontaneously live an overcoming life. He not only died for us on the cross but is living for us within. Today we have such a Lord who lives with us. We can live an overcoming life daily. This is the life that a Christian should live in the new way. Without this kind of living, we are not qualified to talk about the new way, and there is no way for us to have the service in the new way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVICE IN THE NEW WAY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Contacting People</h2>
<p>The first item of service in the new way is to contact people, that is, to pay the price to contact people for the Lord. First, we must shepherd and feed the Lord&rsquo;s sheep. The Lord asked Peter three times in John 21:15-17, &ldquo;Do you love Me?&rdquo; When Peter answered, &ldquo;Lord, I love You,&rdquo; the Lord replied the first time with &ldquo;Feed My lambs.&rdquo; Then the second time He replied, &ldquo;Shepherd My sheep,&rdquo; and the third time He replied, &ldquo;Feed My sheep.&rdquo; To shepherd is to care for in a general way, like the shepherd caring for the flock. To feed is special; it is like the mother taking care of her child. Perhaps there is a person that is very young or is involved in difficulties. There is the need to take care of him in a special way. When we preach the gospel by visiting people and bring people to salvation, they become the Lord&rsquo;s lambs, and there is the need for feeding. For those saints who have been around longer, who are more mature, there is the need of shepherding. Then there are those who are involved in special difficulties; they need the special feeding.</p>
<p>In the church there is a great need for people to rise up to do the work of shepherding and feeding. This does not mean that we have to find some clergy-like pastors or preachers to do the job while all the other saints remain in their own jobs, raise their families, come for worship on Sunday, and contribute a little money. If that is the case, what is recorded in Ephesians 4 where all the saints participate in the work of the ministry unto the building up of the Body of Christ will never be realized. To build up the Body of Christ, all the members have to exercise their functions. This is the new way that we are taking. I hope that, as the Bible shows, every brother and sister would bear some responsibility. At present there are over six thousand people meeting in the district meetings in Taipei. But there are over twenty thousand that need to be cared for. If everyone would care for one person per week, every week we could care for six thousand people. In a month with four weeks, we could care for all twenty thousand people. This is very effective. We would like to present this burden before all of you. Let us take up this burden before the Lord together.</p>
<p>When you go to shepherd and to visit others, there are proper ways to do it. You should not go just to socialize. For this reason, you yourselves must first be experienced in life. Second, you must study the truth well. This is not too difficult among us. Every week we are handling the truth. As long as we would learn, we can all pick up something. With the experience in life and the expression in truth, you are well equipped to visit people. When you go to visit people, you will know where they are immediately after talking to them. Perhaps a certain one has only believed in the Lord in an outward way; within he has not touched the Lord and has no experience of salvation. He is like the electric light bulb that is installed but not connected; there is still no electricity. You have to be like an electrician, helping him to connect the electricity. You must help him to touch the Lord within and to have the experience of salvation. Then you have to help him to know how to call on the Lord, how to pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word, how to have fellowship with the Lord, how to love the Lord, how to remember the Lord by breaking bread, how to consecrate himself, etc. You must help him item by item. All these require that you have the experience and the truth.</p>
<p>Paul said in Acts 20, &ldquo;How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and to teach you publicly and from house to house....For I did not shrink from declaring to you all the counsel of God....Wherefore watch, remembering that for three years, night and day, I did not cease admonishing each one with tears&rdquo; (vv. 20, 27, 31). Here Paul set up a good example for us. I hope that we all would receive the burden to visit people from house to house, supplying people on the one hand, helping them to grow in life, and teaching people the truth on the other hand to show them according to the Bible what kind of life God wants us to live. Although a Gentile person may repent, believe, be baptized, and be saved, yet he still knows nothing concerning the spiritual things. There is the need for some to teach him. It is not enough for him to come only on Sunday to listen to a message. This is not to mention the fact that sometimes he does not even come at all. This is why we need to care for and to teach people so that they can be brought on step by step.</p>
<p>Paul mentioned in Ephesians 4:12 &ldquo;the perfecting of the saints.&rdquo; This is the most important yet most difficult thing to do during our contacting others. The word <em>perfecting</em> in Greek carries the meaning of equipping. This is like a man joining the army. He needs to be perfected by instructions, drills, equippings, as well as supplies. Now there are over twenty thousand saints. To visit them is not the end. You should hope that one day they can do the work that you are doing today. If the six thousand go out to visit the twenty thousand, and in half a year, among those twenty thousand there are three to five thousand raised up who can do the same thing that the others are doing, then they are being perfected. In this way, you can go out to preach the gospel again to gain more new ones, and the cycle can repeat itself over and over. Today we have six thousand. Perhaps by next year we will have ten thousand who can go out to care for and to feed others. This can never be accomplished by a few preachers or pastors. For this we need all the brothers and sisters to rise up and to strive together in one accord, to grow in life, and to be taught in the truth. In addition there is the need to labor and to pay the price. If everyone would do this, we will surely have good results.</p><h2 class="head2">Preparing to Prophesy</h2>
<p>The second item of service in the new way is also a very difficult thing. It is to prepare to prophesy. In the church meeting, the most precious thing is the prophesying. This matter happened briefly like the blossoming of an overnight flower in the history of the church. During the Apostles&rsquo; time, it appeared for a short while. But after the Apostles passed away, the clergy system was brought in. After that, only a few were able to preach. The saints&rsquo; opportunity to prophesy was replaced, and the one-man-speaking meeting came in to take its place. At the same time, the clergy system produced the religious organization and destroyed the body nature of the church, killing the organic function of the Body, degrading it instead into an organization, and causing the church to deviate and to be distorted. For this reason, we left Christianity and came into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We do not want an organization; what we want is the organism. We do not want to have one speaking and all listening. Rather we want to have all speaking and all listening. Our emphasis is not the preaching but the prophesying.</p>
<p>To prophesy is to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord, which is to supply Christ to others. First Corinthians 14:1 says, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.&rdquo; This is because prophesying is the highest spiritual gift. This matter is not something that only a few can do. Rather all can do it one by one. Verse 31 says, &ldquo;For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged.&rdquo; Moreover prophesying builds up the church. Verses 4 and 5 say, &ldquo;He who prophesies builds up the church. Now I desire...rather that you may prophesy...that the church may receive building up.&rdquo; The conclusion from these few verses is that everyone who is saved is expected to desire after speaking for God that the church may be built up.</p>
<p>In verse 26 Paul continued by saying, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.&rdquo; Here it mentions mainly three things: psalms, teachings, and revelations. The psalms are for praising God, the teachings are for teaching men, and the revelations are for revealing and releasing the light of God. All these are prophesying. They should not be done by one man only. All the brothers and sisters should do this. For this reason you need the exercise. Since all of us love the Lord, love the church, and are willing to help others, we should first go to contact people. Second, we should prophesy for the Lord. Prophesying must be based upon your own experience and your knowledge of the Bible. The Bible is the expression for our spiritual experience. In the daily life, you should grow in life and should labor in God&rsquo;s Word. When you go out to visit others, all this will become your capital with which to serve others. When you go to the small group meeting or the district meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, you will be able to practice prophesying for three to five minutes. This requires that all of us be prepared for the prophesying. You should have the few verses that you pray-read every day digested in you. The little you have every day will eventually become a lot. In a week you will have over ten verses. When we all come together on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, we all pray-read these verses and share and prophesy according to them. As long as we all labor to learn and to exercise, it will not be too difficult a thing to do. Surely we will succeed.</p>
<p>Today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must make everyone seek after prophesying. Although this is not an easy thing to do, we will succeed if we have a heart for the Lord and if we desire to advance. I hope that we would take up these two burdens&mdash;to visit others in our daily life and to prophesy in the meetings. Visitation will bring people to the meetings, and prophesying will keep people in the church life. If all the visited ones prophesy in the meetings, the increase and spread of the church, the growth of the church, and the perfection of the saints will no longer be a problem.</p>
<p>This is why the new way is not a difficult way; it is just a laboring way. You must labor. You cannot be a pew member like those in the denominations, nor can you be in our former condition, participating only in miscellaneous affairs such as cleaning and ushering. When the church was going to preach the gospel, you would only invite a few to come to listen to the messages. At that time, the brothers and sisters among us could still be somewhat relaxed. But today we cannot do that anymore. You must be revived every morning, and you must be overcoming every day. In addition, you have to learn the truth, experience life, pick up the burden, and pay the price to care for people. Only then will the new way be successful.</p>
<p>Forgive me for saying an honest word. All those who say that the new way is wrong are speaking nonsense. Only the lazy ones would say that the new way does not work. I hope that all those who have not seen the new way would not criticize or oppose. Neither should those who have seen it condemn others. Whoever can practice it should just go ahead and practice it. Whoever cannot practice it should just leave it alone. But you have to see that this is an age of advance; everything is advancing. We should not be left behind any longer. We cannot change the truth, but we should always improve on the method. According to the truth in the Bible, this new way is the most scriptural way and the most effective way. May the Lord be merciful to us. I hope that we would all receive at least some amount of this word so that the Lord would have a way among us.</p>
