<h2 class="head1">THE LORD'S LOVE<br />BEING LIKE RED-HOT BURNING COALS</h2><p>We received your letter on January 28. The word in that letter has truly become light to our pathway and strength for our living. Thank the Lord! He dispenses food to the needy at the right time.</p><p>When I consecrated myself during the conference in 1948, my desire was to give my very blood to the Lord. There was no such opening in my environment. I desired to shed my blood but did not have anywhere to shed it. I wanted to die but had no place to be buried. Thank the Lord! He is the God who hears prayer. He received my small consecration and brought me to the place He ordained.</p><p>"O Lord! Keep my consecration, that I would not be shamed by these words. Lord, You know our weakness and that it is possible for anyone to deny You three times. Lord, I truly dare not trust in my consecration. I put this consecration into Your hands. May You accomplish it. Make me burning but not foolish; make me willing to die but not live lightly. May You gain something in me whether through life or death. Amen."</p><p>O brother! My heart feels as if it has been stabbed by a knife! The Lord's love is like red-hot burning coals within me! We will fellowship more later! Tears!</p><p>Lee Tien-giao<br />January 29, 1950</p><ol class="bullet"><li><a class="text" target="_blank" href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/cw-55/map6.pdf">Map of the Churches in Manchuria</a></li></ol><h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP MEETINGS (NANCHANG)</h2><p>Our original idea in coming to Nanchang was to serve with Brother Hsu during the Nanchang conference so that the brothers from Nanchang would not be distracted by anything else. After we arrived, we found that Brother Hsu unexpectedly was unable to come. At first we thought we should return immediately, but inwardly we felt that this would cheat the brothers and sisters in Nanchang. After praying on the spur of the moment, we decided to continue in our responsibility of our service.</p><p>We had three fellowship meetings beginning the first day of the Chinese New Year. Thank the Lord! He blessed His children. Many brothers and sisters gained some knowledge concerning the church and consecrated themselves to the Lord. They are also willing to coordinate with the church and to learn to serve the Lord together.</p><p>There are almost thirty brothers and sisters here in college. Their spirits are very clean. I hope some brothers and sisters who are strong in the truth would migrate to Nanchang soon to give them some good help.</p><p>Thank the Lord! He has heard our prayer and given us some farmland near the Tungjia Railway Station. It is twelve li from Yingtan and eighteen li from Kueixi. It can be reached by a fifteen-minute train ride.</p><p>Tien-giao<br />February 24, 1950</p>
