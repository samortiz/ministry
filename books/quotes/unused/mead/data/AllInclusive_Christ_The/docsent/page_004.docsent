   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MEASURE OF OUR EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is this piece of land?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Never forget, this land is the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not just Christ, but the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If I were to ask you if you have Christ, you would answer, Oh, praise the Lord, I have Him; I have Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But I would ask you what kind of Christ you have.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am afraid that in your experience you have just a little Christ, a poor Christ, not an all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let me tell you a story, a real story.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not long after I was saved, I studied the Scriptures, and I was taught that the passover lamb was the type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Oh, when I learned this, how I praised the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I exclaimed, Lord, I praise You, You are the lamb; You are the lamb for me!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But I would ask you to compare the lamb with the land.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What kind of comparison can you make between a little lamb and a great land?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is the lamb?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You must say that it is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But I would tell you that it is a little Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That was not the goal of God for His people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God never told them, All right, as long as you have the lamb, that is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No. God told them in effect that the reason He gave them the lamb was to bring them into the land.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The passover was for the land.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do you have Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yes, you have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But what kind of Christ do you have, a lamb or a land?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the people of Israel had the lamb on that Passover Day in Egypt, but very few, I m sorry to say, got into the land.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Very few took possession of that piece of land.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After I was saved for one or two years, I was taught that the manna which the children of Israel enjoyed in the wilderness was also a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I was so joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I said, Lord, You are my food; You are not only the lamb to me, but also my daily manna.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But, I would ask you, is the manna the purpose, the goal of God?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Did God deliver His people from Egypt to enjoy the manna in the wilderness?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The land is the purpose; the land is the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do you enjoy Christ as the land?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I doubt it, and I venture to say that even you doubt it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You can say that you enjoy the lamb as your passover and the Lord as your daily manna, but very few can really say that they enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the land.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Word tells us in Colossians 2 that we have been rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now I would ask you to consider: If we have been rooted in Christ, then what is Christ to us?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yes, Christ is the earth; Christ is the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A plant or a tree is rooted in the soil, in the land.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even so, we have been rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am afraid you have never realized that Christ is the very soil, the very land to you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You are a little plant rooted in this land which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I must confess that five or six years ago, I never had such a thought.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I read the Scriptures and spent much time in the book of Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I read it over and over, but never obtained this light.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I never knew that Christ is the soil, my very earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It was not until the last few years that my eyes were opened.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I deeply feel that most of the Lord s children are still remaining in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They have only experienced the passover; they have just taken the Lord as the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They have been saved by the lamb, but they have not been delivered out of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yes, some have come out of Egypt, some have been delivered from the world, but they are still wandering in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They enjoy Christ a little more; they enjoy Him as their daily manna.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They can boast that they enjoy Christ as their food and they are so satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But, brothers and sisters, is this good enough?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I think when we meet those who enjoy Christ as their daily manna, we are very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We say, Oh, praise the Lord, here are some brothers and sisters who really enjoy the Lord as their manna day by day!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But we must realize that this falls far short of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God s purpose is not just that we enjoy Christ a little, but that He should be the all-inclusive One to us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Look at this verse: As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him Col 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is a sphere, a realm for us to walk in. He is not just some food or water, but a realm, a land within which we can walk.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He is our land, He is our earth, He is our kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I believe that the picture is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In Egypt was the lamb, in the wilderness was the manna, and ahead of the people of Israel was the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>That is the goal; that land is the goal of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have to enter in. It is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is the all-inclusive gift of God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must take possession of it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is ours, but we must enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In these days we have been speaking much about the church and the expression of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But you and I must realize that if we are not able to take possession of Christ as the all-inclusive One and experience Him, there can never be the reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You and I must realize that we have been rooted in Christ as a plant rooted in the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must possess Christ as everything to us, not just in words or in doctrine but in practical reality.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must realize that just as the soil is everything to that plant, so Christ is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We must realize this to such an extent that we can experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You and I have already been rooted, but we do not realize the fact, we do not take possession of the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Colossians tells us that having been rooted, we are being built up in Him with others.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we have no experience of having been rooted in Christ, how can we be built up with others?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>That is why the building up of the church among the Lord s people is almost nil.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>How could there be a temple and a city when the people of Israel were still wandering in the wilderness?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Since they were not in possession of the land, it was impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>How can there be the real building up of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>How can there be the real expression of the Body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It can only be by realizing and experiencing Christ as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Brothers and sisters, may the Lord open our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>SOME PRACTICAL EXAMPLES</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Day by day we are speaking many words.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But do you realize that all our words must be Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Do you speak Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Do you take Christ as your words?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If you do not, you are speaking nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Perhaps you will ask what I mean.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I mean this: if you have received light to see that in God s mind Christ is everything, the Holy Spirit will lead you to the place where you realize that even the words you speak day by day must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>You will accept the work of the cross upon your mouth and upon your words.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>You will be renewed in your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>You will be renewed in your language.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>You will experience Christ to such an extent that you will say, Lord, if what I am going to say is not of You, I will not say it.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I apply the cross to my mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I apply the cross to my speaking so that I may be renewed by You in my words.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Let me give you a few more examples of how we must realize Christ as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Whenever we are going to eat, we should immediately have the registration within us that Christ is our real food.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We have to say, Lord, this is not my true food; You are the food by which I live.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Man does not really live by this food, but by Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Lord, I would spend more time taking You than eating this food.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>When we are going to rest, we must say, Lord, You are my rest; You are my true rest!</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Whatever we are going to do, whatever we are going to enjoy and experience, we must realize that Christ is that very thing.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Sisters, you are the ones who are always doing the shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Have you ever thought that Christ is that very thing for which you are going to shop?</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>I believe very few of you have had such a thought.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Perhaps you have heard a message about Christ being everything to us; you have sung Hallelujah in the meeting, but immediately afterward you have forgotten everything.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If you have received true light from the Lord, the Holy Spirit will point out Christ to you in a practical way day by day, step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>He will show you that whatever you are going to buy must be a figure of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>You will not want to pay the price for anything outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>You will say, I wish to gain Christ; I want to have more of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>You can apply Christ to everything.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Young people, when you are going to study, you can say, Lord, You are my book.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>I would read You; I would study You much more than these books.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>I would apply You at this very moment while I am reading.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Try to exercise in such a way day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Take Christ as the land; take Him as everything to you not just as food, not just as the light, not just as your dwelling place, but as the all-inclusive land.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>You must realize that Christ is the all-inclusive One to you.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>You must practice to experience Christ and apply Him in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Then, I believe something will issue forth from you, and that something will be the building of the church in God s kingdom, the temple in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>This is the purpose of God.</S>
