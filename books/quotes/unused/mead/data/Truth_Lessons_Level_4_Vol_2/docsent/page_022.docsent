   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>/ See now that I, I am He, / And there is no god with Me. / It is I who kill, and I make alive; / I wound, and it is I who heal; / And there is no one who can deliver from My hand vv.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, due to their unbelief, God caused Israel to wander in the wilderness for thirty-eight years until the entire generation of the unbelieving men of war was consumed from the midst of the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God also used these thirty-eight years to produce a new generation, training them and preparing them to enter into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because Moses was concerned that the new generation would repeat the failure of their forefathers, he made a covenant with them that included prophecies related to the children of Israel.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, God also promised through Moses that if while in captivity the children of Israel would return to Jehovah their God and listen to His voice with all their heart and with all their soul, Jehovah would be compassionate to them and gather them from all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moses called heaven and earth to witness against them because he had set before them life and death, blessing and curse.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Jehovah also charged Moses to write a song and teach it to the children of Israel and put it in their mouth so that the song would be a witness against the children of Israel, for He already knew their intention even before He brought them into the land.</S>
