The post office's handling of printed material is very slow. In this publication: (1) We will not have a definite number of pages. We will do our best to put all the news into it that we receive while we are in the editing process. We hope that our readers will pray much for the work of God, the workers, and for the churches in all the localities. (2) Sometimes we will not print the column on the travels of the co-workers. Please find out where they are by reading the news of the work and the news of the churches.</p><p>Beginning with the next issue, we will begin publishing the translation of The Dynamics of Service. (It concerns the principles of the work. We will print one of the ten chapters in each issue.) This is a special announcement.</p><p>Some localities have sent offerings. Some of these offerings are for the work, and some are for the brothers and sisters who are in need because of the war. Brother Lan Tsi-yi and Sister Ruth Lee have received them and distributed them according to the needs of each locality (as far as we know them). We can only thank God and ask Him to care for the ones who care for others. May God bless those who receive the gifts.</p><p>Some brothers and their families are still in the war zone, like the Tang, Chou, Sun, Yu, and Yeh families who are still at Mo-Gan-Shan. Brother Ruan Chi-yu and a few other families (see the letters in this issue) are still in the city of Hangchow. We have not heard anything from the co-workers and the churches in northern Kiangsu for a long time. Some localities can receive mail but not wires of money. We need to pray for all these matters.</p><p>We received a letter from Brother Watchman Nee after he arrived in Singapore. He is feeling well after having a tooth extracted. We hope you will pray for him.</p><p>Ruth Lee<br />March 30, 1938, in Chungking</p><h2 class="head1">A FEW REQUESTS</h2><p>(1) Please put the date on your letters.
