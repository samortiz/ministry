   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE POSITION OF THE CROSS Scripture Reading: Rom 12:3 THE ONENESS OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God desires to gain churches for the local expression of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No matter how large a locality is or how many saved ones there are in a locality, God desires that the saved ones in that place be the local expression of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God desires that we not only maintain the oneness of the church in our locality, bearing a testimony of oneness, but even more that we express the Body of Christ in our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In fact, the oneness of the church is the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Most people, especially medical doctors, readily admit the fact that the best example of oneness is our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Very few things are more one than a body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although there are many members in a body, the members are one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Medical students have to spend several years in order to study the human body in depth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After they have diligently studied the human body for a number of years, they realize that it is difficult to commit every body part and detail to memory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are many parts in a human body, and each part is complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although there are many parts, they function entirely as one body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since we have a body, we have some realization of the extent to which a body functions as one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If there is something lacking in the oneness of our body, we sense it immediately and are hindered in our movement.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Similarly, if something is wrong with the oneness in the Body of Christ, the whole Body is hindered in its movement.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we serve together on the ground of oneness, not only do we need to be one in our condition, but even more we need to express the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The brothers and sisters may not have much feeling in regard to this point, but if the Lord opens our eyes to see the Body of Christ, such a seeing of the Body will subdue our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE NEED TO RECEIVE THE DEALING OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If God desired that each one of us be an individual Body, it would have been very convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, God desires that we, though many, become one Body; this is rather difficult for us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, only twelve disciples were with Him, and they had quite a number of arguments and disputes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today there are more than twelve people in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the church in Taipei alone we have more than two thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How can we become one Body?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we desire not to fight but to become one in the Body, one basic issue needs to be resolved; that is, every one of us needs the Lord s dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Being dealt with in this regard is not to be dealt with in regard to defects or mistakes but in regard to our person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the brothers and sisters continue to have the I in them, they cannot be members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we would be members of the Body, our I must go.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To be a member, we must not have the I. We may use a simple illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Suppose a few brothers and I are serving the Lord together, either as elders or as responsible ones in the districts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to serve together, we must come together to discuss things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, one day we may need to go to the place where we meet, and one brother may suggest that in order to save time we should hire a taxi.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, I may think that hiring a taxi costs too much and that we can get there by each riding a bicycle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>While one party wants to save time, the other party wants to save money.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Consequently, there may be an argument among us, and some may end up going by taxi, but I may declare that I dare not ride in the taxi.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I may say that I dare not, but actually I am declaring that since my suggestion was not adopted, I do not want to be one with those taking the taxi.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be in coordination means that we need to put aside our own opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is good to go by taxi, by bicycles, or even by foot.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>None of these ways offends the Lord or damages the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It does not matter which way we take.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While the motive of some brothers is to save time, others may want to save money.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In any case, if the brothers decide to go by taxi, I should not have another feeling and should simply go joyfully with the brothers in a taxi.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not only should I not have an opposing attitude, I should not even have any negative feeling concerning the matter.</S>
