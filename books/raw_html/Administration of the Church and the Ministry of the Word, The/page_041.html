 <h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE<br />
BEING THE BUILDING<br />
OF THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</h2>
<p>To build the church, the Body of Christ, is a general expression in the Bible. A more specific and definite expression is to build up the temple and the city. The emphasis of the temple is on God&rsquo;s presence, the mingling of God and man. Hence, to build up the temple is to build up the mingling of God and man. First Corinthians 6:19 says, &ldquo;Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you?&rdquo; We are God&rsquo;s temple, and God&rsquo;s Spirit dwells within us. This is the mingling of God and man. The temple is a matter of God mingling with man. After the temple was built, the glory of Jehovah filled the whole temple (1 Kings 8:10-11). This temple signifies the children of Israel becoming God&rsquo;s dwelling place; God dwelt among them. In the administration of the church and the ministry of the word we are building up the church. We are building the mingling of God and man into people. The purpose of the administration of the church is to produce the mingling of God and man. The purpose of our ministering the word is also to produce the mingling of God and man. If we produce the mingling of God and man, we are building up the temple.</p>
<p>This principle can be applied to many situations. There may be two brothers who live together but cannot get along. They do not quarrel and are polite, but there is no building. I may ask, &ldquo;Is God&rsquo;s presence with them? Is God&rsquo;s temple there?&rdquo; If there is no building between them, they do not have God&rsquo;s presence or the temple. They are independent persons, neither of whom cares for the affairs of the other. They are simply two brothers who serve the Lord together and who live in the same house. They do not have God&rsquo;s presence, His temple.</p>
<p>If we have been built and have learned the lesson of building, we will realize that these brothers are lacking in the mingling. They both have a substantial amount of the self, and therefore there is not much mingling with the Lord. Hence, our work is to build them up so that Christ can be mingled more with them. We need to pay special attention to the parts of their being that do not allow them to be mingled with God. If they would allow those parts to be dealt with, they would be mingled with God, and God&rsquo;s temple would be in them. The extent of our being joined to others depends on how much we have been mingled with God. This is the building, and it is God&rsquo;s temple with His presence.</p>
<p>Whenever we truly render spiritual help to people, we enable them to be mingled more with God. The more they are mingled with God, the more they will be joined to the other members of the Body. Those who are short of the element of God cannot be one with other believers. Therefore, the brothers who speak from the podium must be sure that their words will issue in God being mingled more with the saints. If we work with young people, the messages we speak should cause them to be mingled more with God. If our messages do not have this result, our work is not a building work. We are not building the temple. A work that builds the temple is a work that allows God to obtain a dwelling place. It allows God to dwell in man. Our work must cause God to dwell more in man and to be mingled with man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING OF GOD&rsquo;S CITY</h2>
<p>There is a distinction between the temple and the city. The temple emphasizes a dwelling place, a habitation. The city is a matter of administration. Therefore, the temple is a matter of presence, and the city is a matter of sovereign power, authority. When the New Jerusalem appears, these two matters will be combined. The New Jerusalem is a city, which is a matter of authority, and God&rsquo;s tabernacle with men, which is a matter of dwelling. Hence, in the New Jerusalem we see both God&rsquo;s presence and God&rsquo;s authority. Although both aspects are combined, the emphasis in the city is on authority. Hence, the center of the New Jerusalem is the throne of God and of the Lamb, which is a matter of God&rsquo;s sovereign power, God&rsquo;s authority (Rev. 22:3).</p>
