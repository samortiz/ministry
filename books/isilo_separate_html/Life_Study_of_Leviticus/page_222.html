Bringing a Sword</h2><p>&#8220;I will bring a sword upon you that will execute vengeance for the covenant&#8221; (v. 25a). This signifies that in the church there will be fightings among the brothers. Fightings among the brothers is a sign of God&#8217;s chastisement.<h2 class=head3>2. Sending the Pestilence</h2><p>&#8220;If you are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you&#8221; (v. 25b). This signifies that in the church there will be some kind of contagious disease. The &#8220;germs&#8221; of this disease are spread mainly through gossip and vain talk.<h2 class=head3>3. Delivering the People into the Hand of the Enemy</h2><p>&#8220;You shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy&#8221; (v. 25c). This signifies that the believers in the church will be taken over by the enemy. During my history in the church life, I have seen such a thing happen a few times.<h2 class=head3>4. Cutting Off the Supply of Bread So That It Will Be Delivered by Weight and People Will Not Be Satisfied</h2><p>&#8220;When I cut off your supply of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they will deliver again your bread by weight; and you will eat and not be satisfied&#8221; (v. 26). This signifies that in the church the spiritual supply will be cut off to a greatly reduced amount, so that there will be no satisfaction for the believers. We also have seen this happen in the church life. In a certain church there was a long period of time when there was no distribution of the spiritual food supply. As a result, in that church there was starvation.<h2 class=head2>E.
