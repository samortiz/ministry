   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There is a marvelous verse in the New Testament, with words to which I am afraid you have paid little attention.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is I Corinthians 12:13.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It says firstly that we were all baptized in the Holy Spirit, and secondly that we were all made to drink of the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We were not only baptized into the Spirit, but also made to drink of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Have you noticed these two aspects in this one verse?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose I have here a glass of water.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To baptize my finger in this water is one thing: the finger is clothed with the water; the water is put upon the finger.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But this is just an outward act: something is put on, but not put in. The second aspect is that we are also made to drink the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I drink this water in the glass, the water gets into me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To be baptized into is one thing, while to drink of is another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many Christians today confuse these two aspects, thinking that the baptism in the Spirit is equivalent to drinking of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This concept is really not logical.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When people are put into water, does that mean they are made to drink the water?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If so, they will be drowned.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To baptize a person is to put him into water, not to make him drink the water.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Holy Spirit upon us is one thing, while the Holy Spirit within us is another.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord Jesus, when speaking to His disciples concerning the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost Acts 1:5, 8 , said that the Holy Spirit would come upon them, not into them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was a matter of "upon," not a matter of "in."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To be baptized into the Spirit is to put on the Spirit, to put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is our righteousness, Christ is our covering, Christ is our qualification, Christ is our new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But this should not be a mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You must put on this Christ, not just receive the doctrine of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It must be an experience in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You should be able to exclaim, "O God, Hallelujah, I am now in Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is the all-inclusive pneuma, and I am in the all-inclusive pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am standing before You, not in myself, but in Christ not in Christ as a doctrine, but in Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must put on Christ as the new garment, and this new garment is the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ is no more the untreated cloth; He is now the finished garment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this finished garment we have redemption, resurrection power, and all the divine elements of the divine Person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This new garment is not just a piece of clothing, but the divine pneuma, the all-inclusive Spirit, including Christ's incarnation, His crucifixion, His redemptive work, His resurrection, and His resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can put on such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus told His disciples, "I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that he may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality" John 14: 16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In these verses the Spirit is the treated Christ; this Spirit is the crucified and resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such a Christ is the other Comforter, the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"In that day," He said, "ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you" John 14:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He said in effect, "At that day you will both put Me on and receive Me into you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In that day you will be baptized into Me, and you will also drink of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the treated Christ, the finished Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ today is no more untreated; He has been thoroughly and completely worked upon.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now He is the finished garment for us to put on, and now He is also the new wine for us to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose I have here an orange.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Could you drink it?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You could not it is untreated, it must be dealt with first.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We could not drink of Christ before His crucifixion and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the cross He was cut and pressed by God, and now as the Spirit in resurrection we can drink of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We were all baptized into Christ, and we were also made to drink of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because He is now the treated Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He said, "If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, from within him shall flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet" John 7:37-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Why at that time, when the Lord spoke those words, was the Spirit not yet?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because Christ was not treated yet.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After a short time He would be treated, and then resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now, whoever thirsts may come unto Him and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today the Lord Jesus is no more the untreated Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do you want to be baptized into Him?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do you want to drink of Him?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>"That day" is this day.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today you may know that you are in Him and He is in you.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You may be baptized in Him and you may drink of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Now, by being baptized into Him, Christ becomes our outward qualification, and now, by drinking of Him, He becomes our inward satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are clothed with Him as the Spirit of power and we drink of Him as the Spirit of life that we may enjoy Him as our Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the first three new things the new cloth, the new garment, and the new wine we see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Christ from His incarnation to His crucifixion is the new cloth, and Christ from His resurrection to eternity is our new garment and our new wine.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The new cloth was just the material for making the new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Now we are daily under His covering. and we are daily satisfied by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He is everything to us.</S>
