Here the question of water was brought up. Water is something to satisfy man's thirst. A person can live without food for a day. But if he does not have water for a day, he will become very desperate. Without water, man will be unsatisfied. Here was a woman who was thirsty and unsatisfied within. The Lord came and asked her for water to drink. This shows that the Lord was also thirsty and unsatisfied. If He had not been thirsty, He would not have asked for a drink. Both the woman and the Savior were thirsty.</P><P>Friends, do you realize that the world today is a thirsty place? Who among us can say that he lacks nothing? You may have much education and money, but you still feel that you lack something. Although you may not know what it is that you lack, you somehow feel that there is something missing in your life. The reason man seeks for entertainment and amusement is that he is bored and depressed, and he has no interest or taste for anything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD BEING MAN'S SATISFACTION</H2><P>When a man is thirsty, you will not solve his problem by giving him gold. Husbands, wives, children, parents, money&#151;none of these things can satisfy man's thirst. Only God can solve this problem of man. A wife cannot satisfy a person's heart. Money cannot satisfy a person's heart. But when you come to the Lord with an empty heart, you will be filled. God is man's real need and real joy. A person can have fine clothing, good food, nice houses, an enormous amount of savings in the bank, high position, or great knowledge, but he will still not be happy within. What he needs within is simply a glass of water. This water is God. Without God, man is not satisfied. God is man's satisfaction. Whenever man has God, he is happy, and he is satisfied.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BOTH GOD AND MAN SATISFIED BY EACH OTHER</H2><P>Not only are the sinners thirsty; even God is thirsty. Man thirsts because he does not have God, and God thirsts because He does not have man. God is man's satisfaction, and man is God's satisfaction.</P><P>The Lord Jesus is a sinless Man. Yet He is also thirsty. Today what He wants is you. He is asking water from you. Whenever the Savior meets a sinner, that sinner will thirst no more. Whenever the Savior gains a sinner, the Savior will also be satisfied. You are drawing water, and the Lord is asking you for water. Man is thirsting on earth, and God is thirsting in heaven.</P><P>Satan is working on earth today to frustrate man from having God. What we are doing on earth today is to have man gain God and to have God gain man, so that both God and man can be satisfied. This is why both heaven and earth rejoice when a sinner is saved (Luke 15:8-10, 23-24). Both heaven and earth rejoice because both God and man are satisfied.</P>
