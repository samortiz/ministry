   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ORGANIC LESSONS IN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The full-timers, on the one hand, should learn to follow the sense of the Holy Spirit and the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the other hand, they should learn the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No one can be independent in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Suppose a brother who loves the Lord serves in Kaohsiung, and he has a desire to learn to follow the sense of the Holy Spirit and the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He must be in fear and trembling, because the sense within him might be his preference and not of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It might be his excitement and not the anointing, or it might be his impulse and not the operation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since we can experience counterfeits, we must learn to rely on the Body and not trust ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We learn the Body life by placing ourselves in the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, a brother who has a burden to serve on the campuses in a locality must first fellowship with the elders in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This does not mean that he is asking the elders for a decision or a confirmation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, he fellowships because the elders have more experience, and his sense may not be accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must fellowship with the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When there is fellowship, the elders should not act as if they are sitting on thrones to issue edicts and quick decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When some people hear me say this, they may fully support me because they have such thoughts about the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If this is the case, such a person is equally wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a saint is not in spirit, and the elders act like government officials, then fellowship with the elders will be without effect.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The lesson in the Body is of two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The full-timers must learn the sense of life and obey the anointing, and they must learn to fellowship with the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The elders must also learn these same lessons, because we are all in the Body and are members one of another.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should never consider that being an elder means that the saints need our approval to determine whether or not they can serve.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some elders are proud; they think that no one can serve without their approval and that not listening to them is to not listen to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Such an elder warns the saints that they should be careful to hear the church, as in Matthew 18:17, so that they will not be regarded as a Gentile and a tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although a young saint loves the Lord with a pure heart and wants to serve Him full time, his present sense may not be entirely accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nevertheless, his heart is an indication of his willingness to learn the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When he goes to fellowship with the elders, the elders must be in spirit when dealing with him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the elders are not in spirit, they can damage the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the elders are in spirit, even a brief contact with him will help them determine whether this desire comes more out of excitement than conviction.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If this is the case, they can direct him to pray more about the matter in a calm way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If he receives this word, it is good.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, he may react inwardly and decide that the elders are lukewarm because they told him to be calm in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If he disobeys the elders and insists on going to the campus to serve, the organic nature of the Body will be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The greatest need in the Lord s testimony today is for all the saints to be in fear and trembling and to allow the Body to function organically.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We do not have organization, but we move as one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We do not have the regulations of an organization, but we have the movement of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the only way to bring in the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We believe that the Lord is blessing us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We might be able to accomplish things by taking the way of organization, but we will lose the testimony of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can only take the way of the Body, which is the organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This requires all the members to live in life, to be under the anointing of the Spirit, and to obey the operation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is not one-sided; it has many aspects and includes all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As long as we are members of the Body, we must learn to take this organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>LEARNING TO BE</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Suppose, for example, every saint in the church in Kaohsiung is exercising to live in the spirit, and the church in Taipei lacks serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the elders in Taipei fellowship their need with the church in Kaohsiung, the elders in Kaohsiung should go to the saints who have a burden to serve in the campus work and ask whether they have a burden to serve in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If they say that they do not have a burden, the elders can ask them to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, the serving ones may insist that they do not need to pray because they are clear concerning the sense of the Spirit; this interrupts the organic function of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Ephesians 4:4 says, One Body and one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord s Spirit is the Spirit of the Body, and the Lord s Spirit is in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we kill the organic function of the Body, the Lord s Spirit cannot get through in His operation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is mainly for moving, not for working.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When His operation is hindered, the function of the Body is damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This can be compared to the circulation of blood in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When this circulation is blocked, the organic functions of our body are damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, we must always be in fear and trembling to live in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should never think that recognizing the sense of life once means that we are always right.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If in any matter or at any time we do not live in our spirit, we damage the function of life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He operates not only within the church in Kaohsiung but also in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Not only so, He operates in the entire Body.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Due to His operation in Taipei, the elders may have a sense to fellowship with the church in Kaohsiung and ask the church to send them some serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When the elders in Kaohsiung fellowship with the saints, the saints must seek the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even if we had the leading of the Spirit in the past, we dare not assume that the Spirit is still operating in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is possible that the Holy Spirit wants to move some saints to the campuses in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hence, we should open to the fellowship of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should not refuse their fellowship or insist on following our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have no organization among us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Everything is in the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, this does not mean that when the church in Taipei has a need, they should always go to the church in Kaohsiung.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Neither does it mean that the elders in Kaohsiung should insist that unless they have more than twenty full-time serving ones, they cannot send three or four to Taipei, because they will suffer a lack.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Such methods are organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the past we have fallen into such situations when serving ones were transferred by arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It seemed as though everyone was very obedient, but there was not much organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This matter concerns us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>From now on we must be careful when using such words as transfer in relation to serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All our activities must be the spontaneous result of the operation of the Spirit of life who is in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It may be that He operates in Kaohsiung and gives the elders in Kaohsiung a sense to fellowship with Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They may say, We have a few extra full-time serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Does Taipei have a need for some?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is sweet fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>LEARNING TWO ASPECTS OF COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>There are two considerations related to the full-time serving ones that should be avoided.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The first is related to a locality having more serving ones than is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is often the case when the elders in a church want to improve so that their church is the best.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Since all elders want their local church to improve, there is a tendency to want to keep full-timers in a locality to function and serve as needs arise.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Second, we are all human, including the elders, and we have our preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The elders who are gentle and do things in a refined manner are troubled by saints who are impatient and quick.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The elders might pray, Lord, please do not touch these quick-tempered saints.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Do not move them to consecrate themselves to serve full time, because I do not approve of them.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Such elders prefer gentle and slow saints to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>However, the elders must put all their preferences aside so that their administrating of the church is by the organic function of the Body, not according to their personality.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This matter is a lesson in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Suppose there are five full-time serving ones in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It may be that the elders do not like two of the serving ones and try at every opportunity to send these two serving ones to a different locality.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>However, if the co-workers feel that they should remain, the elders must keep them.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If the elders do not receive this leading, they will continue to look for an opportunity to send them away.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Such a situation will kill the organic function of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Such cases do exist.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The elders, the full-timers, and all the other saints must learn the lessons of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Furthermore, the full-timers must always open to the Lord and seek the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The church in Taipei might not ask for additional serving ones, and the elders in Kaohsiung might not feel to send anyone to Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>However, as you open to the Lord, He may operate within you to give you the sense to go to Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>You must fellowship this sense with the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If the elders do not consider this matter before the Lord, they may quickly respond that you are doing very well in the campus work and want to keep you in their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This can damage the organic function of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Even if your elders are willing to send you to Taipei, the saints serving on the campus there might not want full-timers from other localities.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Such situations have existed.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>It is not easy for a full-time serving one from another locality to join an established group.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Such a group might accept only those who were raised up locally, because they have their local way of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The local saints should be careful not to refuse anyone who comes to serve, because we are all in one Body bearing the same testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>An attitude that does not accept others who have come to serve also damages the organic function of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Just as our physical body can become infected with many illnesses, so the Body of Christ can also have different kinds of sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>If we want to stay healthy, we need to learn many lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We must pay our full attention to this.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>It is especially helpful if we can have open fellowship before the Lord when we come together.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Such fellowship is like the circulation of blood, which brings in great healing.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>It maintains the health of the Body and preserves the Lord s testimony.</S>
