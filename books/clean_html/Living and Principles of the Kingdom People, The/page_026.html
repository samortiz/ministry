<h2 class="head1">TWO KINDS OF TREES AND FRUITS</h2>
<p>The second principle for the living and work of the kingdom people is related to a tree and its fruit. In verses 15 through 17 and verse 20 the Lord said, &ldquo;Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. By their fruits you will recognize them. Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles? Even so every good tree produces good fruit, but the corrupt tree produces bad fruit...So then, by their fruits you will recognize them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These verses say that the kingdom people must discern the type of leading they receive from others. Prophets are ministers of the word, who speak for God and who are servants of God. The kingdom people need the leading of the servants of God. However, the kingdom people should not accept the leading of a person simply because he calls himself a servant of God or a prophet, just as they cannot enter any gate or take any way. Just as there are different gates and different ways that need to be discerned, there are different leadings that also need to be discerned. We will suffer destruction if we choose the wrong gate and the wrong way. Likewise, we will suffer loss if we choose the wrong leading or follow false prophets. If this were not a serious and crucial matter, the Lord would not have concluded His teaching with it.</p>
<p>The kingdom people must discern those who lead them. This discernment is not based on words but on the fruit of their living and work. By their fruits we can know whether they are good trees or bad trees. No matter how good or spiritual someone&rsquo;s message may sound, we should not be quick to accept his person. Although we may accept his message, we should not accept his person too quickly.</p>
<p>We must be cautious about accepting others&rsquo; leading, lest we be deceived by false prophets. False prophets may seem more genuine than real prophets. Outwardly, they wear sheep&rsquo;s clothing and speak the word of God, but inwardly, they are ravenous wolves from whom we may suffer great loss if we are not careful. For this reason, we need to discern cautiously. We should not only listen to people&rsquo;s words but also look at their living and deeds, that is, the fruits of their walk. Such discernment cannot be done too quickly; it requires a period of time. Time is the best test; any imposter will be manifested in time.</p>
<p>Because it was not easy to exercise discernment, believers who were traveling to a different local church in the times of the apostles took a letter of commendation, which was a letter of introduction. Even a minister of the word took a letter of introduction from his locality. This letter was not to introduce him to join the breaking of bread but to confirm his standing in preaching the word of God. Hence, it is risky for a believer or a local church to accept the leading of a prophet without first seeing his fruit, his letter of commendation. Regrettably, not many Christians discern the leading that they accept. Many Christians do not know how to discern; instead, they believe every word and readily follow others&rsquo; leading. As a result, false prophets are rampant in their damage to God&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>An individual Christian who does not discern the leading he accepts has no spiritual pursuit and is not living under the heavenly rule. The same applies to a Christian group that does not discern the leading it accepts. If a Christian is seeking God and is ruled by heaven, he will be very particular about accepting others&rsquo; leading. He will discern and examine before he accepts. Similarly, a Christian group that seeks God and is ruled by heaven will also discern and examine the leading of others.</p>
<p>Such discernment and examination require that one deals with the self. Many accept a wrong leading because they have the element of the self, not because they do not understand. It is easy for a Christian who has not dealt with the self to accept a wrong leading. The same applies to a Christian group. Conversely, if a Christian is willing to be governed and restricted by the heavens, he will not easily accept a wrong leading. When the element of the self is present, the preferences and tastes of the self are also present. False prophets deceive people by echoing these preferences and tastes so that people feel good about accepting his words and his leading. Hence, it is easy for a person who is according to the self to accept a wrong leading.</p>
<p>Discernment demands that we have no tastes or preferences of our own. We should not consider whether a preacher fits our tastes but whether his leading brings us to God. We should not carelessly ask others to give messages, nor should we carelessly accept their leading. We must first know whether the walk of a prophet bears grapes and figs or thorns and thistles. Just as the people of the kingdom of the heavens must discern the wide gate and broad way from the narrow gate and constricted way, they should also discern the two kinds of leadings. The principle of the gate and the way is narrow and small, and the basis of leading is examination. We should take the narrow gate and the constricted way and accept only that which has been examined. We must pay attention to these two points.</p>
