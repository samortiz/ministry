   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>toward God and toward His Promise</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The failure of the children of Israel at Kadesh-barnea was due to their unbelief toward God and toward His promise 1:32, 35 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is faithful, and His word, which is His promise, cannot fail.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the people believed neither in God nor in His promise.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Their unbelief offended God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. In Spite of God's Carrying Them</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1:31 Moses said, "In the wilderness, where you have seen that Jehovah your God carried you, as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went until you came to this place."</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>E. Unbelief Causing Disobedience to God</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reason we do not obey God is that we do not believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Unbelief is the cause of our disobedience to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The New Testament ministry is a ministry of faith, and the New Testament word is a word of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus we begin our Christian life and church life by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without faith we cannot live either the Christian life or the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Unbelief damages us and leads to tragedy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With respect to believing in God we should forget our past, but with respect to knowing God and ourselves we should remember our past.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A proper review of our past will help us to no longer trust ourselves but to put our trust absolutely in God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through reviewing the past we may learn the lesson of not having any trust in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are nothing more than an unbelieving self, and all we have is flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, we must learn to reject the self and the flesh and put our trust altogether in God, the One who is faithful and whose words can never fail.</S>
