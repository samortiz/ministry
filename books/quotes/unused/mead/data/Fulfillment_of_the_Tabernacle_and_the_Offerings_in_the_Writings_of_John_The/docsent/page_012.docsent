   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Not Only Conciliatory but Also All-inclusive</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John's writings are not only conciliatory but also all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word conciliatory means reconciling.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some theologians say that John's writings are conciliatory in reconciling doctrinal controversies concerning Christ's Person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One school of thought claimed that Christ was divine but not human.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of course, this is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to 1 John 4, some spirits do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is to deny the fact that Christ is human as well as divine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Another school of thought claimed that Christ was human and not divine, that He was merely a good man but not God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to this heretical school, after His resurrection Christ became divine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John reconciled these matters when he said that the Word is God and that the Word became flesh John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Word is divine, even God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The "flesh" in John 1:14 denotes humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, in these verses John shows that Christ is both God and man, both divine and human.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We would prefer to say that John's writings are not merely conciliatory but all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The writings of John are all-inclusive in the truth of Christ being all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who do not see Christ's all-inclusiveness can be compared to blind men touching different parts of an elephant.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some touch the trunk, and others touch the legs, the side, or the tail.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But all think that they have a full understanding of what an elephant is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead of trying to reconcile the differences among these blind men, John would speak concerning the entire elephant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is a kind of blindness to deny any aspect of Christ's all-inclusiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is both God and man, both the Creator and a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Years ago, certain ones declared, "Our Christ is the Creator, but He is not a creature."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When I heard this, I said to myself, "It is foolish to say that Christ is not a creature, but that He is only the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If Christ were not a creature as well as the Creator, how could He be a man with a body of flesh, blood, and bones?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Are these not the elements of a creature?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of the heretical teaching of Arius, who was condemned at the Council of Nicea in A.D. 325, some are not willing to say that Christ is a creature as well as the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Arius falsely taught that Christ was merely a created being, not the very God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the Bible, our Christ is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because He is God, He is the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But because He is also a man, He is a creature with a body made up of created elements.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If Christ were not a creature, how could He have had the blood to shed for our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The divine Being does not have the blood required for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because we are human beings, we need human blood to be shed for us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The redemption accomplished through the blood of Jesus gives us eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This blood has eternal efficacy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First John 1:7 speaks of the blood of Jesus, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The name Jesus denotes the Lord's humanity; the title Son of God denotes His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is the blood of Jesus that redeems us, and it is the divinity of the Son of God that insures the eternal efficacy of this redeeming blood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If Christ were only divine, He would not have had the blood to shed for us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But because He is both human and divine, both a creature and the Creator, He had the blood to shed for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John's writings reveal the truth of Christ being all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ is God, man, the Creator, the creature, and even our spiritual food, water, and air.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because we teach the all-inclusiveness of Christ revealed in the Gospel of John, others have falsely accused us of teaching pantheism, the heretical doctrine that everything in the universe is God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who condemn us falsely for teaching pantheism say, "Witness Lee teaches that grass, water, air, sunshine, and wind are all God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He claims that everything in creation is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, he is pantheistic in his teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We know that he came from the Orient, and that oriental people are pantheistic."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is their accusation, but I strongly declare that I am not pantheistic.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to the Scriptures, I teach that Christ is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>My Christ is God and man, the Creator and a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ is my Redeemer, my Savior, my Master, my Lord, and the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is the real life, light, spiritual food, water, and air.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ is even my spiritual clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Oh, He is everything to me!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Is this pantheism?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the truth of Christ's all-inclusiveness revealed in the writings of the New Testament.</S>
