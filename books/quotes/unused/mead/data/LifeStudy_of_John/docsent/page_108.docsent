   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. The Son Being the Same as God, Omnipresent,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>without the Limitation of Time and Space</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 1 the Lord said to His disciples, Let not your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe also in Me. This verse reveals two very important points.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first is that the Lord is the same as God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If one believes in God, he must also believe in the Lord, for the Lord is the same as God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In fact, the Lord is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even up to that time, the disciples did not adequately realize that the Lord was God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is omnipresent: He is not limited by time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the one hand, the Lord was in the flesh, and with the flesh there are the elements of time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the other hand, the Lord was not the flesh but the very God, and with God there are not the elements of time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this book we are told both that He was limited in time and in space and that He was not so limited.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 7:6 He said, My time has not yet come, indicating that although He was the eternal, infinite, unlimited God, He lived on earth as a man, limited in the matter of time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 3:13 He said, No one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This verse indicates that while the Lord was on earth, He was still in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that He, as the very God, was omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With Him there was not the limitation of time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why did the Lord mention to His disciples that He was the same as God?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because He told the disciples that He was going, and they had the human thought that His going meant that He was leaving them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since the disciples knew that God is omnipresent, the Lord told them that He was the same as God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Just as God is omnipresent, so He likewise was omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Just as God is without the elements of time and space, so He also was without these elements.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whether He went or stayed it was the same, for He, as God, was omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since His going was actually His coming, their hearts did not need to be troubled by His going.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was the same as the God in whom they believed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If they believed in God, they also had to believe in Him because He was the same as the God who is always present.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord seemed to be telling His disciples, Do not be troubled by My going.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not let your hearts be perplexed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you believe in God, you must also believe in Me. God is omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With Him there is no time or space limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is the same with Me. I shall go, but I shall still remain with you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And while I remain with you, I shall go.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you believe in God, you must also believe in Me, for I am the same as God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The second important point in verse 1 is that believing God is different from believing into God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You may say that you believe God, but do you believe into God?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Greek the preposition in means into, that is, to believe into God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, this is not an objective believing; it is a subjective believing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The basic thought of this chapter is that the Lord intends to help or instruct the disciples to be in God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must remember that to believe God is objective but to believe into God is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is this kind of subjective believing that brings us into God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In effect, the Lord was saying, If you believe into God, you must also believe into Me. The preposition into is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is regrettable that many have the wrong concept, thinking that to believe in God means to believe God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must not miss the preposition.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not a matter of believing the fact objectively; it is a matter of the subjective believing that brings us into God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The central thought of this chapter is that we must believe into God.</S>
