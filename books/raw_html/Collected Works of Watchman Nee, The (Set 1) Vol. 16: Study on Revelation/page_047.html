<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Revelation 13:17</H2><P>"And that no one may be able to buy or sell except he who has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of his name." </P><P>It is not hard not to sell, but it is really hard not to buy. There are several kinds of marks: one is the name of the beast; one is the number of his name; and others may be various kinds of symbols.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Revelation 13:18</H2><P>"Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred sixty-six." </P><P>This beast is not the beast that comes up out of the earth but the beast that comes up out of the sea. Many people only search into the number 666, but they forget to pay attention to the context of the whole verse. According to this verse, there are three things which must agree:</P><P>(1) The number of a man (the number of a place cannot be used).</P><P>(2) The number of the beast. In 13:1 the beast has seven heads, and 17:9 and 10 say that these seven heads are the seven mountains and also the seven kings. (History clearly tells us that Rome is a city of seven mountains.) Then does this beast refer to the Roman Empire or to one of the Roman emperors? Since 13:18 says that the number of the beast is the number of a man, this beast must not refer to the Roman Empire but rather to one of the Roman emperors!</P><P>(3) It must be the number of a person's name, a person who is a Roman emperor. The sum of these numbers is 666. From these three facts we can find out who the beast is.</P><P>The letters of the Greek and Hebrew alphabets all represent numbers. Except for Caesar Nero, there is no other man in history who has this number. Nero's number is 306, to which 360 must be added to make it correct. The title of Caesar exactly represents the number 360. When the Bible mentions the names of the Roman emperors, the title Caesar is always added, as in Luke 2:1 and 3:1, which mention Caesar Augustus and Tiberius Caesar. History tells us that Nero always called himself Caesar.</P><P>According to the Hebrew alphabet, the sum of the numbers of the name Caesar Nero is exactly 666. Some people think that the former Nero committed suicide and that the future false Christ will be cast into the lake of fire. So how can we say that this is Nero? According to Revelation 17:11, we know that this false Christ is the resuscitated Nero. Hence, there is no conflict at all.</P><P>The following shows the sums of these numbers:</P><div align="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="300"><tr><td colspan="3"><p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold">Nero</p></td><td rowspan="8"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/images/sngpxl.gif" width="10" height="2" border="0"></td><td colspan="3"><p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold">Caesar</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="sm" style="text-align:center">Greek</p></td><td><p class="sm" style="text-align:center">Hebrew</p></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><p class="sm" style="text-align:center">Greek</p></td><td><p class="sm" style="text-align:center">Hebrew</p></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p class="greek">N&epsilon;</p></td><td><p class="hebrew">&#x05E0;</p></td><td style="text-align:right">50</td><td><p class="greek">K&alpha;&iota;</p></td><td><p class="hebrew">&#x05E7;</p></td><td style="text-align:right">100</td></tr><tr><td><p class="greek">&rho;</p></td><td><p class="hebrew">&#x05E8;</p></td><td style="text-align:right">200</td><td><p class="greek">&sigma;&alpha;</p></td><td><p class="hebrew">&#x05DD;</p></td><td style="text-align:right">60</td></tr><tr><td><p class="greek">&omega;</p></td><td><p class="hebrew">&#x05D5;</p></td><td style="text-align:right">6</td><td><p class="greek">&rho;</p></td><td><p class="hebrew">&#x05E8;</p></td><td style="text-align:right">200</td></tr><tr><td><p class="greek">&nu;</p></td><td><p class="hebrew">&#x05E0;</p></td><td style="text-align:right">50</td><td><p class="greek">&nbsp;</p></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td style="text-align:center">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td style="text-align:right"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/images/line.gif" width="25" height="2" border="0"><br>306</td><td style="text-align:right">+</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td style="text-align:right"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/images/line.gif" width="25" height="2" border="0"><br>360</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td style="text-align:right">=</td><td style="text-align:right">666</td></tr></table></div><P>From this we see that the first beast, which comes up out of the sea, is Antichrist, the resuscitated Caesar Nero; while the beast that comes up out of the earth is the false prophet, the resurrected Judas, the betrayer of Jesus.</P>
