<h2 class="head2">Having the Reality of the Body of Christ<br />and Experiencing It</h2><p>The Body is not a doctrine, but a spiritual fact. If a spiritual matter is recovered, and it is real, it will surely be felt by others. This was the case with the release of the kingdom truth by Evan Roberts. He was sick for a long time. Later, he began to realize the truth concerning the kingdom. When he stood up to speak, the message may have been only fifteen minutes long, but there was something real in what he said. Before him, there were people who spoke about the truth of the kingdom, but the reality was not there. The same is true today with regard to the truth concerning the Body. Many people are able to speak about the Body, but they do not have the Body itself. Before Darby, many people preached this truth, but they did not have the thing itself. When Darby came, it was different; not only did he speak about the truth, but he presented before men the real thing that is conveyed by the truth.</p><h2 class="head2">A Believer Dropping What He Is Holding,<br />and Experiencing What<br />He Has Received Positionally</h2><p>Does this mean that God is restricted by man? Of course not. If God wants to work, He will not be restricted. What a Christian receives on the day of salvation is the most that he will receive. What happens afterward is that these riches are gradually lost. Why are they lost? It is because such a one picks up many other things along the pathway of being a Christian. Both of his hands are full, and he has no capacity to receive anything more. This is the case with an individual, but the same is true with the church as a whole. The book of Ephesians describes the height of the attainment of the church. After that, things began to fall below that standard.</p><p>What a believer has received initially is something positional only. Afterward, he begins to receive something experiential. However, in order to receive something experiential, he must first drop some other things. We must drop what we have in our hands before we can gain something more in our experience. When we leave this world one day, we will be able to say that all our losses were actually gains. Today the believers must catch up with God's work and go on with Him; they should not be ones who are falling back.</p>
