   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A MATTER OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is the same in the physical life with your children.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Little ones can do certain things when they are two years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When they become five years of age they can do something more.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So there is the need of the measure of the stature in life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Don t imitate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you are able to pray that much, just do it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if you are not able to do it, spontaneously there is no need for me to say don t do it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You simply can t do it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To portray the real experience of Christ in our life is somewhat strange.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The only thing that can help us to realize it is to get into that stage.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I get into a certain stage, I will spontaneously understand the life matters in that stage.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I get to another stage I will understand the matters of life in that stage.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we began this Perfecting Training we realized that many of you have been in the experience of Christ for years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We surely realized that many of you are bothered because your old way of experiencing Christ in the past no longer works.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is because you have reached another stage.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I don t mean that all of us have reached another stage.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is like a big family.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are folks of all ages.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You don t need to imitate others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You are in one stage of life, and others are in different stages of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the church life we cannot have separate grades to form classes as in a school.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE REAL BODY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Gradually, I believe the Lord will speak to us more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then perhaps we will go on to another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It may be that the Lord will lead us to the matter of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, not many even among us know what is the real Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because the life is not that much here.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the real Body life is much closer than it was years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>So it may be that we will turn eventually from the experience of Christ to the real Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We look to the Lord that He would surely lead us on.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I believe many of you realize that in these few months what we have covered is higher, not in knowledge or doctrine, but in our practical experience of Christ in life.</S>
