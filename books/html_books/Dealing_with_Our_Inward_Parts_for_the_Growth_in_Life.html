These messages were not reviewed by the speaker. The subject of the Summer Training was the inner life and the church life. The messages in this book were given concurrently with other messages on life and the church, including Christ as the Content of the Church and the Church as the Expression of Christ and Our Human Spirit.</p></td></tr></table></div><h1 class=msg>CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SPIRIT, THE WORD, AND THE GIFTS TO CONVEY CHRIST TO THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Gal. 1:15a, 16a; 1 Cor. 1:24, 30; 2:2; 10:3-4; Matt. 25:14-15; Rom. 12:4-8; Eph. 4:11, 16</h1><p>According to the revelation of the Word, the Lord&#8217;s central thought and intention is to have the church as His Body to express Himself. Therefore, the church is for nothing other than Christ, and Christ is the very life, the very content, of the church. This must be very clear to us. The church is the Body of Christ. A body is something which contains the life of the head and expresses what the head is. The body is the expression of the life of the head, so the head is the life and the very content of the body. In the same way, the first and most important matter in the church life is that Christ is the Head, and this Head is the life, content, and everything in the church. The church is not merely a meeting; the church is not for a kind of activity; the church is not for a kind of service or for anything else. The church is absolutely to express Christ.<p>Galatians 1:15a and 16a say, &#8220;But when it pleased God...to reveal His Son in me.&#8221; We need to see how Christ can be realized by, revealed to, and worked into the church. According to the Bible and all the experiences of the saints, Christ is wrought into us by three things. The first is the Holy Spirit. Christ is wrought into us through the Holy Spirit because Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the very reality of Christ (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17). If we have the Holy Spirit, we have Christ. If we do not have the Holy Spirit, we do not have Christ. The second way is by the Word, which contains many teachings, and the third way is by the gifts. It is through the Holy Spirit that Christ is revealed, wrought, and woven into us. But how does the Holy Spirit work this out? It is either by the Word or through the gifts.<h2 class=head1>TEACHINGS AND GIFTS BEING FOR CHRIST</h2><p>The Holy Spirit, the Word, and the gifts are the three means by which Christ is wrought into us. However, the church is for Christ, not even, strictly speaking, for the Holy Spirit, the teachings of the Word, or any gift. What then is the position of the teachings and the gifts? They are simply a means. All the teachings are a means, and all the gifts are also a means. The problem throughout all the centuries and even today is that people pay their attention to certain teachings more than to Christ. This creates trouble. Similarly, some people pay their attention more to the gifts than to Christ. This also creates a problem.<p>Consider how all the denominations and divisions came into existence. The Presbyterian denomination, for example, came into being because some people stressed the government of the church by the presbytery. In the same way, we have the Baptist Church today because some people stressed baptism by immersion rather than Christ, creating a division. These are divisions according either to teachings or to practices. Today we also have the Pentecostal Church, because those people stress the Pentecostal things instead of Christ. Of course, they would say that they believe in Christ and exalt Christ. Yes, they do, but more or less they stress something in addition to Christ. Perhaps that one thing is right, but no one should stress it.<p>All the teachings are for Christ, and all the gifts are for Christ. The gifts should not be for the gifts, nor should the teachings be for the teachings. Regardless of how many teachings we have and how good those teachings are, we have to consider them simply as a means, not as the central item. The central item must be Christ. We need teachings, but our stress and emphasis must not be on the teachings instead of on Christ. If we stress the teachings instead of Christ, the teachings become a substitute for Christ. We have to make this very clear. We need the teachings because we need Christ; the teachings convey Christ to us. But we should not pay attention to the teachings instead of to Christ. We have to pay attention to Christ, whom we receive through the teachings.<h2 class=head1>THE MEANING OF THE GIFTS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><p>The teachings are more or less ordinary, and certain kinds of gifts are very ordinary, but there are also certain extraordinary gifts. Today too many Christians take things lightly. They talk about gifts, but they may not know what the word gift really means or where in the Bible the gifts are dealt with. We have to study these things. There are several books in the Bible that deal with gifts. Matthew 25 speaks of the parable of the talents and the parable of the virgins. These two parables go together. The parable of the virgins deals with life, while the parable of the talents deals with service. As to life we all are virgins, and as to service we all are servants, bond slaves. These bond slaves were given five talents, two talents, or one talent (vv. 14-15).<p>After Matthew, there is Romans. Romans 12 speaks of the gifts. In this chapter, the gifts are very ordinary (vv. 4-8). Here, even teaching, extending hospitality to the saints, showing mercy, and giving material things are gifts. In Romans 12 there is nothing extraordinary; there are no miraculous gifts, only the ordinary gifts.<p>Then in 1 Corinthians we have the miraculous gifts with the governmental gifts. Chapters twelve and fourteen speak of miraculous and extraordinary gifts, such as healing, speaking in tongues, and works of power, and also of the governmental gifts, such as the gift to take care of the government of the church.<p>Ephesians is the fourth book dealing with the gifts. The gifts dealt with in this book are the persons, the members of the Body, such as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers (4:11). These are members of the Body, and we all are members of the Body. In Ephesians there are not only these four kinds of members; there are all the members with their functions (v. 16). In this book, the persons are the gifts.<h2 class=head1>THE ORDINARY GIFTS BEING MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE EXTRAORDINARY ONES</h2><p>In Matthew 25, Romans 12, and Ephesians 4 there is nothing miraculous. Only in 1 Corinthians are some of the gifts miraculous. Which of all these kinds of gifts are important? We may say that all are important, but there is no doubt that the talents, the ordinary gifts, and the persons as gifts are more important. Of course, under certain conditions and in certain places we need the miraculous gifts, but the miraculous gifts are not as important as the talents, the ordinary gifts, and the persons as gifts. At home we have certain kinds of medicine, but are the medicines more important than the ordinary food? Only for sick people are medicines more important than food. However, we do not expect to have a home always with sick people. In a normal family life, we do not serve three meals of medicine. Rather, we always serve meals of food with the proper vitamins.<p>We should not say that we have only teachings and not the gifts. Praise the Lord, we have many gifts. The question is what we mean by gifts. In the matter of gifts, Matthew, Romans, and Ephesians are more important than 1 Corinthians. In the more important books we do not find the miraculous gifts. Romans is a book on the general sketch of the Christian life. In such a book there are no miraculous gifts. Ephesians is the main book that speaks of the church. In this book on the church we again do not have anything miraculous. In the last book of the Bible, Revelation, chapters two and three contain seven epistles. In those seven epistles there is nothing miraculous. Rather, there is the tree of life, the hidden manna, and the feast with the Lord (2:7, 17; 3:20).<p>The reason that the more important books do not have the miraculous gifts is that the miraculous gifts are not the main item, just as medicine and drugs are not the main items of our diet. The main items in our diet are milk, bread, eggs, and fruit. When we have trouble, lose our appetite, or catch a cold or something worse, we need a special cure. Consider the book of 1 Corinthians. Was the church in Corinth a healthy church? We have to say that this church was sick. The church in Ephesus, however, was a strong, healthy church. Even the church in Rome at that time was also sound and healthy. The regrettable thing is that the sick church in Corinth took too much &#8220;medicine.&#8221; They trusted in the medicine more than in the normal food. Therefore, the apostle wrote 1 Corinthians to adjust them, telling them not to take so much &#8220;medicine.&#8221; Rather, they should take more of Christ as wisdom, power, and their spiritual food and drink (1:24, 30; 10:3-4). Paul told them, &#8220;For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified&#8221; (2:2).<h2 class=head1>THE MIRACULOUS GIFTS BEING ONLY FOR SPECIAL PURPOSES</h2><p>If we read the book of Acts, we will realize that the miraculous things are for three purposes. First, they are for the beginning of a work in a new place, a new territory, where the name of Christ has never been preached. In such a case, God may do something miraculous to start the work. Second, the miraculous acts are for special occasions. The apostle Paul, for example, had such special occasions. Once in the night the Lord stood by the apostle, not inwardly but outwardly (23:11). That was something special. It was not ordinary but miraculous. Paul told us that the Lord is within us all the time, but in Acts on that one occasion the Lord stood beside the apostle. That was something special for the purpose of strengthening him.<p>More than thirty years ago I heard many people talk about miraculous dreams. Whenever they had a meeting, it seemed to be a &#8220;dream meeting.&#8221; Someone would stand up and say something like, &#8220;Last night I had a dream. I was in the third heaven, and I saw Paul eating the tree of life.&#8221; Then on the next day someone else would stand up and say, &#8220;I had a dream last night. We were all eating manna. I saw how big the manna is, and I could even smell it.&#8221; I heard many such dreams. This caused me not to believe much in miraculous dreams. Those people based their dreams on Acts 2:17, which says, &#8220;Your old men shall dream things in dreams,&#8221; but it was not mainly the old ones among them but the young ones who had such dreams.<p>However, during the time I was persecuted by the Japanese army for the sake of the gospel, I had some miraculous dreams. Before the enemy came, I had a dream in which I saw clearly how they would come. In this way I knew that the Japanese military police would come to arrest me, so I was able to clear up my affairs beforehand. As a result, they could not find anything as evidence against me. Then they brought me to their office and eventually put me into prison. At that time, another dream came in the night, showing me how they would put me on trial and torture me. In that dream, however, the Lord showed me that He would preserve my life safely. Because of this, I had very much confidence. I knew that regardless of how much they would torture me, I would still live. After more than three weeks, they had done much damage to my body. In the last week before I was released, a third dream came in the night. In it I saw clearly how I would be released and how the enemy would leave.<p>After I was released, the Japanese did not give me full liberty. They still exercised a certain control over me, and I was still under their threatening. At this point I had not only a dream but a vision. In the afternoon of the first Lord&#8217;s Day after I was released from prison, we were at the Lord&#8217;s table. As I was sitting there, while the bread and cup were being passed, I was suddenly in something like a dream, but I was not sleeping. I saw a vision and heard a voice saying, &#8220;Be at peace. The enemy will be defeated.&#8221;<p>Such things as miraculous dreams and visions are for special occasions. Other than these special occasions, however, we have the Lord indwelling us and anointing us all the time. We mainly know the Lord&#8217;s will by His inner anointing (1 John 2:20, 27). As we have said, according to the book of Acts, the miraculous things are either for the beginning of a work or for a special occasion. The third purpose for the miraculous things is to care for an unhealthy condition. When people are spiritually unhealthy, they need a certain kind of gift to heal them. If we are unhealthy, we may need some miraculous gifts to come in to heal us.<h2 class=head1>THE MORE NECESSARY GIFTS CONVEYING CHRIST TO US</h2><p>We have to see that the more necessary gifts are not the miraculous ones, but the talents in Matthew 25, the ordinary gifts in Romans 12, and the persons in Ephesians 4. The talents, the ordinary gifts, and the persons as gifts are the means to convey Christ to us. Therefore, the church is not for any of the gifts. The church is for Christ. We need the teachings, but we are not for the teachings. If we are for any of the teachings, eventually we will be a sect of that teaching. Likewise, we need the gifts, but we are not for the gifts. If we are for any gift, we will become a division of that gift. This is why in the past we have always proclaimed that we have to be general. We take all the proper teachings as the conveyances of Christ. In like manner, we take the proper gifts as a means to convey Christ, but our attention is never on the teachings or on the gifts. Our attention is on Christ.<p>We have a very good example of this in Acts 8. When Peter exercised his gift to do something, a man named Simon came to try to receive that gift (vv. 18-24). That man had no intention for Christ; his intention was only for the gift. We are not here for anything but Christ. We have to be very clear to help people to know Christ through the teachings and to help people to realize and experience Christ by the gifts, but we have to be careful not to bring people to pay their main attention to the teachings or gifts.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE ECONOMY OF GOD AND THE MARK OF GOD&#8217;S ECONOMY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 4:3-7; Gen. 1:26-27; Isa. 9:6; Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 3:17; John 1:1, 14: 20:22</h1><p>Second Corinthians 4:3 and 4 say, &#8220;And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those who are perishing, in whom the god of this age has blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers that the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine on them.&#8221; According to verse 4, the gospel of the glory of Christ shines. The enemy is afraid of this shining, so he has blinded the minds of the unbelievers in order that the shining of the gospel of the glory of Christ will not get through. Verses 5 and 6 continue, &#8220;For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus&#8217; sake. Because the God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts to illuminate the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.&#8221; The gospel of the glory of Christ in verse 4 corresponds with the knowledge of the glory of God in verse 6. Verse 7 says, &#8220;But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us.&#8221; The treasure in the weak earthen vessels is the very God in Christ shined into us.<h2 class=head1>THE ECONOMY OF GOD BEING TO WORK HIMSELF INTO US</h2><p>If we read the entire Scriptures carefully, we will realize that they reveal only one main item: the economy of God and the mark of God&#8217;s economy. The main item of the economy of God is that God&#8217;s intention is to work Himself in His Triune person into all the parts of our being. I have the burden to tell the Lord&#8217;s children a thousand times, if need be, that in the whole universe God&#8217;s intention is nothing else but to work Himself into human beings. For what purpose did God create man? It was for the unique purpose of making man His container. A container is a vessel, like a bottle or a cup. Romans 9:21-23 and 2 Corinthians 4:7 tell us clearly that God created us with the intention that we may be vessels, containers, to contain God Himself. We are nothing but empty containers, and God is the unique content.<p>A drink such as Coca-Cola needs a bottle as a container. Soda bottles are very definite and specific containers, because they are made with a definite and specific purpose. We human beings are also made in a very definite and specific way. If a bottle made purposely for Coca-Cola does not contain Coca-Cola, it is meaningless, good for nothing. We human beings were made purposely to contain God. If we do not contain God, if we do not have God as our content, we are meaningless persons. Regardless of how much education we have, what kind of position we have obtained, or how much wealth we have in our hands, without God we are still meaningless, because we were made purposely as containers to contain God. God is the very content, so we have to receive God into us.<p>This word may seem very simple, but it is the precise way to speak the central point, the main item, of the entire Scriptures. The whole Scriptures simply tell us one thing: God is the very content, and we are the container to contain this content; therefore, we must receive God to be filled with God. This is the basic teaching of the Scriptures. There are many things mentioned in the Scriptures, but all those items are not the basic item of the Scriptures. The basic item of the Scriptures is that God&#8217;s intention is to put Himself into us as our content.<h2 class=head1>GOD BEING TRIUNE FOR HIS ECONOMY TO WORK HIMSELF INTO US</h2><p>In order to do this, God is triune. This is mysterious to us. We can never understand the mystery of God&#8217;s person. We can never give an adequate explanation of the verses that speak concerning the Triune God. It is very clear that there is only one God. Portions in Exodus and Isaiah tell us clearly and definitely that God is one, and in the New Testament 1 Timothy 2:5 says, &#8220;For there is one God.&#8221; However, in the first chapter of Genesis God spoke of Himself using not the singular pronoun I but the plural pronouns Us and Our.<p>In the grammatical composition of Genesis 1:1, the Hebrew word for God, Elohim, is plural in number, while the predicate created is singular. Therefore, is God one or three? Genesis 1:26 and 27 say, &#8220;And God said, Let Us make man in Our image,according to Our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth. And God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.&#8221; Verse 26 speaks of &#8220;Our image,&#8221; and verse 27 speaks of &#8220;His own image.&#8221; Is God singular or plural? Who can explain this? God Himself used a plural pronoun to refer to Himself: &#8220;Let Us make man in Our image.&#8221; Is God one or more than one? To say that God is more than one is heresy, because the Bible tells us that God is only one. In the whole universe, we have only one God; we do not have more than one God, yet the one God needs a plural pronoun to refer to Himself.<p>Isaiah 9:6 says, &#8220;For a child is born to us, / A son is given to us; / And the government / Is upon His shoulder; / And His name will be called / Wonderful Counselor, / Mighty God, / Eternal Father, / Prince of Peace.&#8221; The little child born to us is called the mighty God. The child mentioned in this prophecy is the very child born in the manger at Bethlehem, but this little child is called the mighty God. Not only so, but the son given to us is called the eternal Father. This is very strange. How can a son be called the Father? A child is called the mighty God. Is He a child or God? A son is called the eternal Father. Is He a son or the Father? We cannot figure this out, but if we believe the authority of the Scriptures, we have to take the fact that a son is called the Father. This means that the son is the Father. If the son were not the Father, how then could He be called the Father? We have only one God. Who then is this little child whose name is called the mighty God? The little child is Jesus. This means that Jesus is God. If He were not God, how could He be called the mighty God, and how could the son be called the eternal Father?<p>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &#8220;And the Lord is the Spirit.&#8221; The Lord here is Jesus Christ, and the Spirit is the Holy Spirit, yet this verse says that the Lord is the Spirit. The Son is called the Father, the Son is the very Lord, and the Lord is the Spirit. This means that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one. We do not have the time to go into detail concerning the Triune God. Rather, we will simply stress that in carrying out His economy to work Himself into us, God is in three persons. Without being three-the person of the Father, the person of the Son, and the person of the Spirit-God could never work Himself into us. In order to work Himself into us, God must be in three persons.<p>Matthew 28:19 says, &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; This verse does not speak of being baptized &#8220;into Christ,&#8221; as in Romans 6:3, or of being baptized into the name of Christ. Rather, it says, &#8220;baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Moreover, the Lord did not say &#8220;into the names&#8221; but &#8220;into the name&#8221; in the singular number.<p>We cannot fully illustrate the Father, Son, and Spirit in our human language because this is something divine and mysterious, but we may use the illustration of a large watermelon. We may have the intention of eating a watermelon, or we may say, of working a watermelon into ourselves and into our family. Yet how can we work this melon into our stomach? We must first cut the melon into slices. Then after the slices of melon get into our stomach, they become juice. First we have the whole watermelon, then the slices, and then the juice. Otherwise, how can we get the melon into us? It is bigger than our mouth, throat, and stomach. The melon has to become slices. Then it can contact our mouth, and it is so easy to take in. However, as soon as we take in the slices, they are no more slices but juice. Are the melon, slices, and juice three things or one? Is the juice not the melon? It is foolish to say that the juice is not the melon. After being cut, the watermelon is not only a melon; now it is the slices, and within us it is juice. Originally the melon was on the table, but after we eat it, the melon seems to be gone. Where is the melon? It is now in us and in the members of our family. In this sense, to speak of the melon, slices, and juice is the best &#8220;teaching&#8221; of the theology of the Trinity. God is now not only the Father; He is also the Son and even the more, He is the Spirit.<p>I would ask you to read and study the Gospel of John again and again. In the Gospel of John there is the Father, and there is the Son. Eventually, when we come to chapter twenty, there is the Spirit as the breath (v. 22). In this one Gospel we have the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as the breath breathed into us. John 1:1 says, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#8221; Then verse 14 says, &#8220;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&#8221; The Word who was with God and who was God Himself became flesh, that is, became a man to dwell not within us but only among us. He lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years and eventually went into death and was resurrected. After His resurrection He came in a mysterious, miraculous, and wonderful way. On the evening of His resurrection, the door to the upper room was shut, yet He came to the disciples with a physical body, showing them His hands and His side (20:19-20). We cannot understand this with our natural understanding. Then He breathed into the disciples and said, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; (v. 22).<p>At the beginning of this Gospel there is the Word, who is God Himself incarnated as a man. Then in the middle of this book there is this man living on the earth for those three and a half years. Finally at the end of this book, this wonderful One went to die and be resurrected, and He came to the disciples and breathed into them. That breath breathed into the disciples was the very Holy Spirit. That was the &#8220;juice of the watermelon.&#8221; From that time on, where was the Jesus spoken of in the Gospel of John? John does not tell us that Jesus ascended to heaven. There is such a record in the other Gospels, but the Gospel of John has no such record. Rather, just as the watermelon gets into our stomach, this Jesus was now within the disciples.<p>God has wrought Himself into us in His three persons. I am here not teaching mere theology. Rather, I am pointing out that this is God&#8217;s economy. God&#8217;s economy is to work Himself into us in His three persons. Without being in three persons, God could never be wrought into us, just as the watermelon could never be wrought into us without being cut into slices and taken as juice.<h2 class=head1>THE MARK OF GOD&#8217;S ECONOMY CONCERNING THE PARTS OF MAN</h2><p>On His part, God has wrought Himself into us in His three persons. On our part, we are containers for God. However, we are not simple. Medical doctors tell us that a human body is very complicated and delicate. Do not think that we are simple vessels, like a Coca-Cola bottle. Rather, we were made with many different parts. Just as we must know the three persons of God by whom He works Himself into us, we also have to know the different parts of our being. Then we will be able to know how to hit the mark of God&#8217;s economy. God&#8217;s economy is in His three persons, and the mark of God&#8217;s economy is in the different parts of our being. In order to be a good driver, we must learn the parts of a car and how to deal with them. We may say that to know the parts of a car is the mark of handling a car. In the same way, we all have to know the different parts of the human being, because our human being is the vessel, the container, to contain God.<p>In order for us to realize how to contain God, we have to know the different parts of our being. Second Corinthians 4:4 speaks of the thoughts of the unbelievers, referring to the mind. Then verse 6 says that God has shined in our heart. This short passage speaks of at least two parts, the mind and the heart. I am concerned, however, that even someone who has been a Christian for many years may not know the difference between the mind and the heart. We may never have considered that two parts of the human being are mentioned here.<p>We may illustrate 2 Corinthians 4 with a camera. The purpose of a camera is to take in the scenery. Originally, a person or object is outside the camera, but after a picture is taken, that person or object is inside the camera. In order to do this, a camera needs three main things: a lens on the outside, film on the inside, and the shining of the light. Once while I was traveling, I took a good camera with me. However, when I returned home and sent the pictures to be developed, I found that the film was blank. I realized that while I was on the train hurrying to take the pictures, I forgot to take off the lens cover. The camera was &#8220;blinded&#8221; by the cover. In the same way, someone may hear a wonderful message of the gospel, and everyone may expect him to be saved. However, Satan, the enemy of God, may blind his mind, his understanding organ. Regardless of how good the message is and how much he has heard, his understanding is blinded and covered. If his understanding is blinded, he can take in nothing.<p>One day over thirty years ago, Brother Watchman Nee was preaching the gospel. He told the people that God&#8217;s intention is not for us to do good; we cannot do good, and even if we did do something good, it would not mean anything to God. He stressed this very much and made it so clear. At that time, a brother had brought a friend to the meeting. During the message, the brother looked at his friend and watched him nod his head over and over. The brother was very happy, thinking that his friend was listening and taking in everything. After the meeting, the brother asked him concerning the message. The friend replied, &#8220;Yes, all religions tell people to do good.&#8221; His understanding was blinded by the enemy. Many times, even in the gospel message meetings, we need to pray that God would bind the god of this age and his blinding work. This is to take off the &#8220;lens cover.&#8221;<p>After the lens cover is removed, the film must still be adjusted rightly. The film is something within the camera. If the film is not right, then even if the lens is right, the camera will not work correctly. Our understanding, our mind, is the lens, and our heart is the film within. Our heart has to be rightly adjusted; it must be put aright. We need a proper &#8220;lens,&#8221; and we also need the right &#8220;film.&#8221; We need the understanding of the mind, and we need a receiving heart. Our heart must be pure, clean, right, adjusted, and corrected.<p>Suppose that we have an uncovered lens and the proper film, that is, the understanding of the mind and a pure heart. Then we still need the divine light to shine. This is what is mentioned in 2 Corinthians 4. The mind is right, the heart is right, and the divine light shines God&#8217;s glory into us. Then within us is the image, the picture, of Christ. This very image of Christ is the treasure in the earthen vessel.<p>By all of the above, we can realize that we must know how to deal with our mind and our heart. If we do not know how to handle the &#8220;lens&#8221; and the &#8220;film,&#8221; we can never receive a proper picture. The genuine spiritual experiences are simply the taking of pictures. We are like a camera, so we must learn how to handle this camera correctly to take in God and Christ as the picture. Regrettably, many Christians do not know that they are &#8220;cameras&#8221;; they do not know how to handle their mind and their heart. The Christian life is not a religion to teach people to do this and that. The Christian life is Christ, the living One Himself, wrought into us. He is the very object, the figure, and we are the camera. This figure has to be wrought into us through the lens and onto the film by the shining, the flashing, of the light. Day by day and moment by moment we need the flashing of the light to take in more of the image of the Savior through the understanding of the mind and the receiving of the heart. Therefore, we all have to know how to handle the mind and how to adjust our heart.<p>All of our spiritual experiences are the different pictures taken into our heart as the spiritual film. With some Christians, however, the lens is almost always covered and the film is almost never properly fixed. If we could look onto their film, we would see no pictures. Their film is blank; that is, they have very few experiences of Christ. However, if we could look into the apostle Paul, we would see a picture of Christ on every piece of film. He had much film, full of beautiful pictures of Christ. How many pictures of Christ we have depends on how much we know how to adjust the &#8220;film&#8221; and take care of the &#8220;lens,&#8221; that is, how much we deal with our mind and adjust our heart. Then whenever the divine light shines on us, the image of Christ comes into us, and we have a picture of Christ within us. This is God&#8217;s economy and the mark of God&#8217;s economy. By this we can see the importance of knowing our different parts. We were made as vessels to contain God in our many parts, so we have to know all these parts, not just the mind and the heart. We must see in more detail these different parts, their functions, and how to deal with them.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE PARTS OF MAN AS THE VESSEL OF THE LORD</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Jer. 31:33; Heb. 8:10; Psa. 51:6; 1 Thes. 5:23; Heb. 4:12; Luke 1:46-47; Phil. 1:27; Mark 12:30</h1><p>In this message we will continue to see the details of the parts of man as the vessel of the Lord. We have seen clearly that God&#8217;s intention is to work Himself into us to be our life and our everything. In other words, He has to be our content. For this purpose, God created us as His vessels with many parts. The word parts is not a term used only by us; rather, it is in the Word of God. Jeremiah 31:33 says, &#8220;But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares Jehovah: I will put My law within them and write it upon their hearts.&#8221; For the phrase within them, both the King James Version and the American Standard Version render it as &#8220;in their inward parts.&#8221; The outward parts are the members of our body, but within our body there are the inward parts. We need to know what these inward parts are. Hebrews 8:10, a quotation of Jeremiah 31:33, says, &#8220;I will impart My laws into their mind.&#8221; The inward parts in Jeremiah 31 becomes &#8220;their mind&#8221; in Hebrews 8. This indicates that the mind is one of the many inward parts.<p>Psalm 51:6 says, &#8220;Behold, You delight in truth in the inward parts; / And in the hidden part You would make known wisdom to me.&#8221; Here again we see the inward parts. Besides these, there is also the hidden part. Truth is in the inward parts, but wisdom is in the hidden part. We must find out what the inward parts and the hidden part are.<h2 class=head1>MAN BEING OF DIFFERENT PARTS</h2><p>First Thessalonians 5:23 tells us that we are tripartite, of three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body. This verse gives us the right order of these three parts. It says &#8220;spirit and soul and body,&#8221; not &#8220;body and soul and spirit.&#8221; The following diagram illustrates the parts of man.<br><br><center><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/images/diagrams/parts-man.gif" width="290" height="290" border="0" alt="Parts of Man diagram"></center><p>Hebrews 4:12 says, &#8220;For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&#8221; This shows us that the spirit and the soul can and must be divided. In order to know Christ and enter into Him as our rest and good land, we have to discern our spirit from the soul. The spirit is the very place where Christ dwells in us (2 Tim. 4:22). If we are going to know Christ in an experiential way, we must learn to divide our human spirit from our soul.<p>Luke 1:46 and 47 say, &#8220;My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit has exulted in God my Savior.&#8221; Here again there is a difference between the soul and the spirit. Philippians 1:27 speaks of standing firm in one spirit and striving with one soul. This one spirit is not the Holy Spirit but our human spirit. In this verse also we see a difference between the spirit and the soul.<p>Hebrews 4:12 not only speaks of the dividing of spirit and soul; it also mentions the joints and the marrow. Joints and marrow are something of the body. This verse also speaks of the thoughts and intentions of the heart. Even in the heart there is also the difference between the thoughts and the intentions. Mark 12:30 says, &#8220;And you shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength.&#8221; This verse speaks of four parts: the heart, the soul, the mind, and the strength. All these parts have to be discerned by the living Word of God. This proves that in order to know the Lord in a practical and real way, we have to discern all these items. We must know the thoughts of the heart, the intentions of the heart, and all the many parts of our heart.<p>The soul is of three parts, and the spirit also has three parts, or functions. We need to know the three parts of the soul and the three parts of the spirit. Moreover, we also should know what the heart is. First Thessalonians 5:23 speaks of our whole being, telling us that we are tripartite-spirit, soul, and body-but it says nothing about the heart. Therefore, we must see what the heart is, what it is composed of, and how we can locate it with respect to the inward parts and the hidden part.<p>If we put all these verses together, we can realize that there are many different inward parts within the many outward parts of the body. What are these parts? According to 1 Thessalonians 5:23, within the body we have a soul and a spirit. Psalm 51 tells us that we have the inward parts with the hidden part. According to Jeremiah 31 and Hebrews 8, the mind is one of the inward parts, and as we shall see, the mind is a part of the soul. Therefore, the inward parts must be all the parts of the soul. The hidden part must be the spirit, because our spirit is hidden within all our other parts; it is the inmost part hidden, not within the body, but within even the soul. In summary, we have the outward part of the body, the inward parts of the soul, and the spirit as the hidden part.<h2 class=head1>THE SOUL HAVING THREE PARTS</h2><h2 class=head2>The Mind Being a Part of the Soul</h2><p>The soul is of three parts-the mind, the will, and the emotion. This is clearly and definitely proved by the Word of God. Proverbs 2:10 gives us the spiritual ground to prove that the mind is a part of the soul. This verse says, &#8220;For wisdom will enter your heart, / And knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.&#8221; Because knowledge is a matter of the mind, this proves that the mind is a part of the soul. Proverbs 19:21 and 24:14 also indicate that knowledge and wisdom are related to the soul. In addition, Psalm 139:14 says, &#8220;My soul knows it well.&#8221; Since to know is a matter of the mind, this also proves that the mind must be a part of the soul. Psalm 13:2 speaks of bearing concern in the soul. This concern must be something considered in the mind. Lamentations 3:20 says, &#8220;My soul remembers them well,&#8221; indicating that the soul can remember things. By these verses we can be clear that the mind as the organ to know, to consider, and to remember is a part of the soul.<h2 class=head2>The Will Being a Part of the Soul</h2><p>The second part of the soul is the will. Job 7:15 says, &#8220;My soul would choose,&#8221; and 6:7 says, &#8220;My soul refuses.&#8221; To choose and to refuse are both decisions and functions of the will. These passages prove that the will must be a part of the soul. First Chronicles 22:19 says, &#8220;Now set your heart and your soul to seek after Jehovah your God.&#8221; Just as we set our mind to think, this verse says that we set our soul to seek. This is, of course, to make a decision. That the soul makes a decision also proves that the will is a part of the soul. Numbers 30:2 says, &#8220;When a man vows a vow to Jehovah or swears an oath to bind himself by pledge....&#8221; The term to bind oneself, which occurs ten times in this chapter, literally means &#8220;to bind his soul.&#8221; To bind the soul is to make a decision. This chapter in Numbers deals with vows made to the Lord. Since we must make a decision to bind our soul to vow to the Lord, this also proves that the will must be a part of the soul. It would be good for the brothers and sisters, especially the young ones, to remember all these verses. They should pick up the burden to learn this.<h2 class=head2>The Emotion Being a Part of the Soul</h2><p>The emotion comprises many things, including love, hatred, joy, and grief. Song of Songs 1:7 and Psalm 42:1 show us that to love is a function of the soul. This proves that within the soul there is the organ, the function, of the emotion. Second Samuel 5:8, Psalm 107:18, and Ezekiel 36:5 show us that hating, loathing, and despising are also in the soul. Despising in the soul is the hatred of the soul. Since these are emotions, this also proves that the emotion must be a part of the soul.<p>Joy is a great part of the emotion. Isaiah 61:10 and Psalm 86:4 tell us that joy is in the soul. This again proves that the emotion is a part of the soul. Deuteronomy 14:26 and Jeremiah 22:27 tell us that the soul desires. According to the better translations and Strong&#8217;s or Young&#8217;s concordances, to desire in Jeremiah 44:14 and to set the heart in Ezekiel 24:25 are literally to lift up the soul. These verses tell us that the desire of the emotion is something in our soul. In addition, 1 Samuel 30:6, Judges 10:16, and Job 30:25 speak of bitterness, misery, and grief in the soul.<p>The verses of the Scriptures above are the ground to say that within the soul there are three parts-the mind as the leading part with the will and the emotion. These are the best verses to prove this, but they are not the only ones. If we study the entire Scriptures, it is hard to find anything other than these three parts in the soul. These three parts comprise all the functions of the soul.<h2 class=head1>THE HUMAN SPIRIT HAVING THREE PARTS, OR FUNCTIONS</h2><p>Now we come to our human spirit. With God there are three persons, with man there are three parts, and with the soul there are also three inward parts. In addition, the spirit is of three parts, or functions. According to the Scriptures, the tabernacle and the temple were of three parts. In the building of God, three is a basic figure. The ark of Noah had three stories, and in the tabernacle there are many threes. The width of a standing board, for example, was one and a half cubits; two boards in a pair were a whole measurement of three cubits. This proves that we can never be independent. We always need another half, just as the Lord Jesus sent His disciples two by two. By ourselves we are one and a half, but two together make three cubits, a whole unit. By this we can see that the number three is a whole unit in God&#8217;s building.<p>The three functions of the spirit are the conscience, the fellowship, and the intuition. It is easy to understand what the function of the conscience is, which is to know right and wrong and to condemn or justify before God. It is also easy to know what the fellowship is, which is for us to commune with God, to contact God. Within our spirit there is a function, or a part as an organ, which we have so that we can fellowship with God, commune with God, and contact God, or simply put, to touch God. It is not as easy, however, to know what the intuition is. It is a direct sense or a direct knowing. In our spirit there is such a part that many times has a direct sense, regardless of the reason, circumstance, background, or environment. We call this organ, or this function, the intuition of the spirit, with a direct sense and direct knowledge from God.<h2 class=head2>The Conscience Being a Function of the Spirit</h2><p>Romans 9:1 says, &#8220;My conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; We should compare this verse with Romans 8:16, which says, &#8220;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.&#8221; On the one hand, the Holy Spirit bears witness with our spirit, and on the other hand, our conscience bears witness with the Holy Spirit. By this we can locate the conscience in the human spirit. In 1 Corinthians 5:3 the apostle Paul says, &#8220;I, on my part, though being absent in the body but present in the spirit, have already judged, as if being present, him who has thus done this.&#8221; This means that in his spirit Paul judged the sinful one. To judge is either to condemn or to justify. This is a matter of the conscience, but the apostle said that he judged in his spirit. This also proves that the condemning or justifying function, that is, the conscience, is in the spirit.<p>Psalm 51:10 speaks of a steadfast spirit, and 34:18 speaks of being contrite in spirit. To be contrite is to realize that we are wrong, to accuse and condemn ourselves. Right or wrong is something related to the conscience. This verse says, &#8220;Contrite in spirit,&#8221; which again proves that the conscience is related to the spirit.<p>Deuteronomy 2:30 says of Sihon the king of Heshbon that God &#8220;hardened his spirit.&#8221; To be hardened in the spirit is to be hardened in the conscience, to be careless about the conscience, not caring about what the conscience says. All the above verses are strong ground to show that the function of the conscience is in the human spirit.<h2 class=head2>Fellowship Being a Function of the Spirit</h2><p>It is easy to find the ground to say that the function of fellowship is in the spirit. John 4:24 says that because God is Spirit-the divine, Holy Spirit-we have to worship Him in our human spirit. To worship God in our spirit is to fellowship with God, contact God, and commune with God. Therefore, this verse proves that the worshipping and fellowshipping function is in our spirit. In Romans 1:9 the apostle Paul says, &#8220;For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit.&#8221; To serve God is also a kind of fellowship with God. Concerning service in the spirit we need to add Romans 7:6, which says that we &#8220;serve in newness of spirit.&#8221; The service to the Lord, which is fellowship with the Lord, is in our spirit.<p>Ephesians 6:18 says, &#8220;Praying at every time in spirit.&#8221; According to the Greek text, this verse does not refer to the Holy Spirit but to our human spirit. To pray is to fellowship with God, so to pray in the spirit means that fellowship with the Lord is a matter in our spirit. Luke 1:47 says, &#8220;My spirit has exulted in God my Savior.&#8221; This implies that the spirit has contacted God, again proving that fellowship with God is a function of our spirit. As we have seen, Romans 8:16 says, &#8220;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit.&#8221; This makes it very clear that fellowship with God is both in our spirit and in the Spirit of God, again showing that fellowship is a function of our spirit. Finally, 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, &#8220;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&#8221; That we can be one spirit with the Lord is the real fellowship, and this fellowship is in the spirit. All these give us strong proofs that the fellowshipping function is in our human spirit.<h2 class=head2>The Intuition Being a Function of the Spirit</h2><p>To speak of the intuition is a little more difficult, but we still have the scriptural ground. First Corinthians 2:11 says, &#8220;For who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him?&#8221; Our spirit can know and discern something that the soul cannot. This proves that there is an additional and special ability to know in our spirit. To know something in the soul is to know by reason and circumstances, but our human spirit can discern and know things apart from any reason. It knows directly, with a direct sense. This verse proves that the direct sense, that is, the intuition, is in our spirit.<p>Mark 2:8 says that Jesus knew fully in His spirit what the scribes were reasoning, and 8:12 says that He groaned deeply in His spirit. This is to realize something in the spirit which makes one sorrowful. John 11:33 says that Jesus was &#8220;moved with indignation in His spirit.&#8221; To be sorrowful, to groan for certain things, in the spirit is to realize, perceive, and discern those things. These verses are adequate to prove that within our spirit there is a function to realize, discern, and perceive things, to have a direct sense. We call this the intuition, the third function, or part, of our spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE HEART BEING A COMPOSITION OF THE SOUL AND THE CONSCIENCE</h2><p>What then is the heart? The heart is not a separate part besides the soul and the spirit. As human beings, we have only spirit, soul, and body; we do not have the heart as a fourth, separate part. Rather, the heart is a composition of all the parts of the soul and the first part of the spirit, the conscience. As we have seen, the parts of the soul are the mind, the will, and the emotion. The heart includes all these parts plus one part of the spirit, the conscience.<h2 class=head2>The Mind Being a Part of the Heart</h2><p>The mind, the first part of the soul, is a part of the heart. Matthew 9:4 says, &#8220;And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Why are you thinking evil things in your hearts?&#8221; We think in our heart. Since to think is something of the mind, this proves that the mind is a part of the heart. Genesis 6:5 says, &#8220;Every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.&#8221; The thoughts are something of the mind, but this verse speaks of the thoughts of the heart. Hebrews 4:12 also mentions the thoughts of the heart. These three passages are adequate and very strong to prove that the mind, which is the organ of thought, is a part of the heart.<h2 class=head2>The Will Being a Part of the Heart</h2><p>Concerning the will, Acts 11:23 speaks of &#8220;purpose of heart.&#8221; To purpose is a matter of the will. It is the function of the will, but this verse says it is something in the heart. Hebrews 4:12 also speaks of the intentions of the heart. The intentions, like the purposes, are something of the will, but here it says that they are something of the heart. This proves that the will is a part of the heart. These two verses are adequate to prove this. To prove something from the Scriptures requires two verses, because two is the number of testimony.<h2 class=head2>The Emotion Being a Part of the Heart</h2><p>Concerning the emotion, the Lord said in John 16:22, &#8220;Your heart will rejoice.&#8221; To rejoice is a matter of the emotion, but here the Lord said that the heart rejoices. This proves that the emotion is also a part of the heart. In the same chapter the Lord said, &#8220;Sorrow has filled your heart&#8221; (v. 6). Sorrow also is something of emotion, so these two verses prove that the emotion is in the heart.<h2 class=head2>The Conscience Being a Part of the Heart</h2><p>Hebrews 10:22 says, &#8220;Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience.&#8221; The conscience has much to do with the heart. In order to have a pure heart, we must have a conscience without offense. If our conscience is sprinkled, we can have a pure heart. This proves, no doubt, that the conscience is a part of the heart. First John 3:20 says that &#8220;our heart blames us.&#8221; To blame is the function of the conscience, but here it says that it is a matter of the heart, proving that the conscience is a part of the heart.<p>By all of the above, we have the ground to prove that these four parts-the mind, the will, the emotion, and the conscience-all the parts of the soul and the first part of the spirit, are composed together to equal the heart.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE HEART, THE SPIRIT, AND THE SOUL</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:16; Rom. 10:9-10; Heb. 10:22; Ezek. 36:26; Mark 12:30; Col. 2:13; Eph. 2:1, 5; John 3:6; 14:17; Ezek. 36:27; Rom. 8:11, 16; 1 Cor. 6:17; John 4:24; Matt. 16:24-26; Luke 9:23-25; 1 Pet. 1:22; 2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2</h1><p>We have seen that the inward parts of our being are the parts of our soul, and the hidden part is our spirit (Psa. 51:6). We have also seen that both our soul and our spirit are of three parts. We have a body with many parts, a soul with three parts, and a spirit also with three parts. Moreover, we also have a heart, composed of the three parts of the soul and the first part of the spirit. In this message we will see further details concerning the inward parts and the hidden part. I look to the Lord that we may have the grace to see all these things clearly, knowing all the parts of our being so that we may be able to exercise our spirit, heart, mind, and will to contact the Lord, to fellowship with the Lord, and to know the Lord.<h2 class=head1>DEALING FIRST WITH OUR HEART</h2><p>According to the Scriptures, we must deal first with our heart, not our spirit or soul. The heart comes first, because it is composed of all the parts of the soul and the first part of the spirit, the conscience. All relationships with the Lord must start with the conscience. Even relationships with other people must begin with the conscience. To be sure, if our conscience is dark and wrong, we will be wrong not only with God but also with others. Since the conscience is the main part of the heart, the heart has to come first in our relationship with God.<h2 class=head2>Turning Our Heart to the Lord</h2><p>Second Corinthians 3:16 says, &#8220;But whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.&#8221; The heart must first be turned to the Lord. To turn our heart to the Lord is the real repentance. While we were fallen, our heart was turned away from the Lord, but at the time we repented, our heart turned back to the Lord. We must have a turning back of the heart to the Lord. This turning is not once for all; we have to turn our heart back to the Lord all the time, day by day. Every morning we must turn our heart again to the Lord. I would suggest, especially to the young brothers and sisters, that every morning after you rise, when you go the Lord, tell Him, &#8220;Lord, here I am by Your mercy and grace. I wish to exercise myself to turn my heart to You again, to turn to You anew for this day.&#8221;<p>When our heart is turned to the Lord, the veil is taken away. This is an important secret for us. Many people ask why they do not have light and guidance and why they do not know the Lord&#8217;s will. I would ask them &#8220;Where is your heart? Toward what is your heart turned?&#8221; This is their problem. We have to turn our heart to the Lord. Over thirty years ago when I was a young brother, almost every day I prayed with 2 Corinthians 3:16: &#8220;Lord, cause me to turn my heart to You.&#8221; This works; just try it. Before we go to read the Word in the morning, we first have to turn our heart to the Lord. Then the life will be there, and the veil will be taken away. I like this verse: &#8220;But whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.&#8221; The veil between us and the Lord is taken away by our turning our heart to the Lord.<h2 class=head2>Exercising to Believe in Our Heart</h2><p>Romans 10:9 and 10 say, &#8220;If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; for with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation.&#8221; After turning to the Lord, the second thing the heart must do is believe. To believe is not a matter in the spirit, the mind, or the will. To believe is a matter of the heart; the heart has to believe. First we have to turn our heart to the Lord, and second we must exercise our heart to believe in the Lord. To believe in the Lord is something in the heart.<p>Verse 10 says that with the heart there is believing. We must learn to exercise our heart to cooperate with the indwelling Spirit in faith. After we turn our heart to the Lord, we must always exercise our heart to believe. We have to exercise to believe in our heart whatever the Lord says in His Word, and we have to exercise to believe in our heart whatever we sense deep within us. We must also exercise our heart to believe in the Lord for all our environment and circumstances, for all the things happening to us. We must pray that the Lord would protect our heart from any kind of doubt.<h2 class=head2>Having Our Heart Sprinkled from an Evil Conscience</h2><p>Hebrews 10:22 says, &#8220;Let us come forward to the Holy of Holies with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.&#8221; The third dealing with our heart is that it must be sprinkled from an evil conscience. With our heart, there is always the need of the sprinkling of the redeeming blood of the Lord Jesus. The more we turn our heart to the Lord and believe in the Lord by exercising our heart, the more we will have many feelings in our conscience that we are wrong in certain matters. When our heart is not turned to the Lord, we do not have the sense that we are wrong. We have only one sense, that is, that we are right in everything; everyone but us is wrong. However, when we turn our heart to the Lord, immediately we do not see others as wrong; we only see ourselves as wrong.<p>It is even more so with believing in the Lord. The more we believe in Him, the more we have the sense of how wrong we are in many things. We are wrong with our spouse, wrong with our children, wrong with our schoolmates, and wrong with our parents. We are wrong with everything, and have many accusations in our heart. These are the accusations in the conscience. At this time spontaneously we should confess our sins according to the inner accusations, one by one. The more we confess, the more the blood of the Lord Jesus is applied to our conscience. Then our conscience will be purged, cleansed, and we will have a conscience with no offense, a pure conscience. This means that our heart is sprinkled from an evil conscience. Because our conscience has been purged, there is no more condemnation in our heart. Our heart is at peace and full of joy. We will sense joy in our heart with the Lord.<h2 class=head2>Being Renewed in the Heart</h2><p>Ezekiel 36:26 speaks of the renewing of the heart. Verse 25 says, &#8220;And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your filthiness and from all your idols I will cleanse you.&#8221; However, this is not all. This is still something on the negative side. We need something on the positive side. Verse 26 says, &#8220;I will also give you a new heart.&#8221; A new heart is the old heart renewed.<p>Here we have four steps to deal with our heart. Not only at the time we first believe in the Lord Jesus to receive Him as our Savior, but as Christians seeking the Lord, from the time we are saved and all the days afterward, we must deal with our heart in these four steps. We must turn our heart to the Lord, exercise to believe the Lord in our heart, have our heart sprinkled from an evil conscience, and be renewed in our heart again and again. Even the renewing of the heart is not just once for all. If the apostle Paul were on the earth today, he would still need the renewing of the heart. We all must put these matters into practice right away. At the latest, tomorrow morning when we rise up, we have to go to the Lord and say, &#8220;Lord, cause me to turn my heart to You.&#8221; Then we must exercise our heart to believe the Lord, telling Him, &#8220;Lord, I believe You! In Your Word I believe You. In Your dealings within me I believe You. In all my environment and in all the things happening to me I believe You.&#8221; By this point we will realize how wrong we are, how many mistakes we have made, and how much filthiness we have to deal with. We will need to confess to have the cleansing, the sprinkling of the blood, that we may be sprinkled from an evil conscience. Then once again our heart will be renewed.<h2 class=head2>The Issue of Dealing with Our Heart Being That We Love the Lord More</h2><p>The issue of our dealing with our heart is that we love the Lord more. Our heart is keen and adequate to function. What is the function of the heart? The function of the heart is to love the Lord. The heart is the loving organ, the organ for us to love the Lord. Mark 12:30 says, &#8220;And you shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart.&#8221; The heart that was created in us by the Lord is for us to love Him. Thank the Lord that we have a heart. Just as we could not see without eyes, hear without ears, or think without a mind, we could not love without our heart. I am sorry to say that even many Christians do not know what the function of the heart is. They know the function of the eyes, the ears, the nose, and the mouth, but they simply do not know the function of the heart. Now we all have to be clear that the function of the heart is to love.<p>In Chinese, the written character for heart is embedded in the middle of the character for love. Love is a matter of the heart. We cannot love people with our nose or our hands. Whatever we love, it is with our heart, the loving organ. Before we turn our heart to the Lord, our heart loves something other than Him. No one can say that he does not love anything. Everyone loves something or someone, either the Lord Himself or something else. No one can say how many things we love, but what is certain is that the more we turn our heart to the Lord, exercise our heart to believe the Lord, and have our heart sprinkled from an evil conscience, the more our heart will love the Lord. This is the function of the renewed heart. Every morning our heart must be renewed so that we may love the Lord more and more.<p>All spiritual experiences begin with the loving of the heart. If we do not love the Lord, it is impossible to have any kind of spiritual experiences. Even the first experience of our Christian life, our salvation, is a matter of the heart loving the Lord Jesus. Not one person who truly repents has no love in his heart toward the Lord. Perhaps he does not have the words for it, but he has the sense within him, &#8220;Oh, Jesus is so lovable!&#8221; I can recall the time I first received the Lord Jesus. I cannot tell you how sweet He was to me. I did not have the words, and no one taught me to say that the Lord Jesus is lovable or that we have to love Him, but I had the true sense that the Lord Jesus was so sweet and good. At that time I could not even say the word sweet; I could only say, &#8220;Too good! Oh, Jesus is too good!&#8221; This kind of love is the reflection of the Lord&#8217;s love in our heart. We all must learn to exercise our heart to turn it again, to believe anew, to be cleansed again from an evil conscience, and to be renewed again that we may love the Lord more and more.<p>The degradation of the church is firstly due to the loss of our first love for the Lord (Rev. 2:4). To lose our fresh heart of love for the Lord is to be fallen, to be in degradation. We all must learn how to turn our heart again and again and be renewed again and again, that we may have a new love, a fresh love, toward the Lord.<h2 class=head1>RECEIVING AND CONTACTING THE LORD WITH OUR SPIRIT</h2><h2 class=head2>Our Spirit Being Made Alive</h2><p>The Bible tells us that originally we were dead, and at the time we received the Lord Jesus, we were made alive. Colossians 2:13 says, &#8220;And you, though dead in your offenses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our offenses.&#8221; Ephesians 2:1 and 5 are similar to this. These two passages prove that we were originally dead in our spirit, but at the time we received Jesus as our Savior, this dead, dormant spirit of ours was made alive.<p>When I was young, I could not understand how we were dead. It seemed that I was still living and not yet buried. Later I came to know that this means that we were dead in our spirit. As we have seen, the function of our spirit is to contact God, commune with God, receive God, and worship God. Due to the fall, however, our spirit was dead and out of function. At the time we received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, the all-inclusive, wonderful Holy Spirit came into our spirit. By the Spirit&#8217;s striking our spirit, our spirit was made alive. It is hard to adequately translate the Greek word for made alive. It means that by touching life, life is ministered to us. We can illustrate this by electricity. If we are touched by electricity, something of the electricity is transmitted by that touching. The Holy Spirit came into our spirit to touch our spirit. By that touch, that striking, the very life which is the Holy Spirit Himself was imparted into us. Then our dead, dormant spirit immediately became alive.<p>To be made alive in this way is more than a miracle. We may think that for a person who is dead physically to be resurrected is miraculous, but for the Holy Spirit to make our dead spirit alive is more miraculous than that. Thousands and even millions of people throughout history who were dead were immediately made alive in their spirit. A person who is dead in his spirit can be made alive because the Holy Spirit is more powerful and is transmitted and imparted more quickly even than electricity.<h2 class=head2>Having a New Element Added to Our Spirit</h2><p>When we received the Lord, our spirit was not only made alive but also was made new. Another life, another element, was added into our spirit. This other life and element is the divine, uncreated, eternal life of God, which is Christ Himself. When the Holy Spirit comes into us, based upon the redeeming work of Christ, He not only makes our dead spirit alive but also brings Christ into our spirit as the new element, as another life added into our spirit. This is something more than what God accomplished in His creation. Now not only has our dead spirit been recovered and made alive, but also we have something new added to our spirit, another element, essence, and substance.<h2 class=head2>Having Received Christ Himself in Regeneration</h2><p>To be made alive is to be reborn, to be regenerated, as spoken of in John 3:6. This verse says, &#8220;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&#8221; By our regeneration something other than what we had was added into us. This new element, essence, and substance is Christ Himself as the divine life added into us. Not only was the old part renewed, and not only was the old part made alive, but something new, divine, and eternal-Christ Himself-was added into us as the very essence of life.<p>What could be better than Christ Himself? Since we have received Christ, why do we still seem so poor? Today many Christians need to know this reality. Atomic power is something inward, not outward. Even a small piece of paper has this atomic power within it. At the time we received Christ, something more powerful than atomic power was added into our spirit. That was Christ Himself. If we truly believed this, we would declare, &#8220;Hallelujah, this is wonderful!&#8221; Whether or not we realize this adequately, we still have to thank Him that such a wonderful, all-inclusive, exhaustless, immeasurable Christ has been added into us. We do not have the adequate words to qualify what kind of Christ we have received and has been added into us. Only eternity can tell the story. However, even if we do not see this truth adequately, we still have received Him.<h2 class=head2>Being Renewed and Indwelt by the All-inclusive Spirit</h2><p>From the time of our regeneration, our spirit has been indwelt by the all-inclusive Holy Spirit. According to Ezekiel 36:26, at the time we were saved, God not only renewed our heart but also renewed our spirit. Then verse 27 tells us that He put His own Spirit into us. John 14:17 also tells us that this wonderful Spirit is in us. Romans 8:11 says that His Spirit dwells in us, and verse 16 proves that this Spirit dwells in our human spirit. Our spirit is the very residence of the Holy Spirit. From the time of our salvation, our spirit has become such a wonderful spirit-made alive, renewed with Christ as the divine life added to it, and having the all-inclusive Holy Spirit dwelling in it.<h2 class=head2>Being Joined to the Lord as One Spirit</h2><p>Moreover, 1 Corinthians 6:17 clearly tells us that from this time onward this wonderful spirit is joined to the Lord as one spirit. Our spirit and the Lord Himself as the Spirit-these two spirits-are joined together as one spirit. No human words can exhaust the meaning of this.<h2 class=head2>The Function of the Spirit Being to Receive the Lord and Contact Him</h2><p>What is the purpose for such a spirit? This brings us again to the function of the spirit. The purpose of our spirit is to contact the Lord, to receive the Lord, to worship God, and to fellowship with the divine Person. This is clearly implied by John 4:24. Just as the heart is the loving organ, the spirit is the contacting and receiving organ. We cannot love with our spirit; we have to love with our heart. However, we have to receive and contact with our spirit the very Lord whom our heart loves.<p>Once a certain sister thought that as long as our heart loves the Lord, that is good enough. There was no need to talk about the spirit, since, she thought, spirit and heart are synonymous terms. She asked, &#8220;Is it not good enough that our heart loves the Lord? Why is there the need for us to talk about the spirit?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Sister, here I have a nice Bible. Do you love it?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Of course I love it.&#8221; Then I said, &#8220;Take it.&#8221; When she stretched out her hand to take it, I said &#8220;No, do not exercise your hand. As long as your heart loves the Bible, that is all right. There is no need to use your hand to take it.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Brother Lee, if I do not exercise my hand, how can I take the Bible?&#8221; I told her that in the same way, we cannot say that for our heart to love the Lord is good enough.<p>Suppose that I love breakfast. As long as my heart loves bacon, toast, milk, and juice, is that adequate? That is absolutely not adequate. If I only love food but do not take it, after a few days I may die. To love is a matter of the heart, but to receive we must exercise another organ. Which organ we exercise depends on what we are to receive. If we want to receive food, we have to exercise our mouth. If we want to receive voices, we have to exercise our ears, and if we are going to receive scenery and colors, we have to exercise our eyes. We love the Lord, but by which organ can we receive Him? Shall we look at Him with our eyes? The more we look at the Lord in this way, the more He will not be there. No doubt, only one organ was created by God for the purpose of receiving and contacting Him; that is our spirit.<p>The spirit within us is like the stomach within our body. It is special, specific, and definite for the purpose of receiving something. We have to exercise our spirit to receive the Lord. Our spirit was created for this definite purpose. However, before we receive, we have to love. No one would receive something if he did not love it. If we do not love breakfast, it is hard to receive it. This is why we must have an appetite. We have to love the Lord; then we will take Him, touch Him, contact Him, commune with Him, fellowship with Him, and receive Him in our spirit.<p>The heart is for us to love, and the spirit is for us to receive and contact. By the renewing of the heart we have a new interest, new desire, and new capability for us to love the Lord. By the renewing of the spirit, we have a new ability and capacity to receive the Lord. After our spirit has been renewed, has had Christ as life added to it, has been indwelt by the Holy Spirit, and has been joined to the Lord as one spirit, it is a very keen organ to receive and contact the Lord.<h2 class=head1>DEALING WITH THE SOUL</h2><h2 class=head2>Denying the Soul-life</h2><p>Concerning the soul, the first thing we must learn is to deny the soul-life, the self. Two passages, Matthew 16:24 through 26 and Luke 9:23 through 25, tell us this clearly. The soul is the very self composed of the mind, the will, and the emotion. This means that we must learn to deny our natural mind, natural will, and natural emotion.<h2 class=head2>Purifying Our Soul</h2><p>Second, we must purify our souls. First Peter 1:22 says, &#8220;Since you have purified your souls by your obedience to the truth.&#8221; Our souls are purified mostly by receiving the word. The word of God is able to purify the soul. To purify the soul is to purify it from fleshly, carnal, worldly, and natural things. Our soul, our very self, our very being, has been damaged, saturated, and occupied by those negative things. Now this soul has to be purified from all these things. However, we must first deny the soul-life. The more we deny our soul-life, the more our soul will be purified by receiving the word of God.<h2 class=head2>Being Transformed in Our Soul</h2><p>Third, our soul must be transformed. Second Corinthians 3:18 tells us that we are being transformed, but by that verse alone we are not clear what part is being transformed. In Romans 12:2 we are told that we are transformed by the renewing of the mind. By this we know that transformation is accomplished in our soul. After our spirit has been regenerated, we need to be transformed in our soul. First we must deny the soul-life; then our soul must be purified and transformed to the image of Christ.<h2 class=head2>The Function of the Soul Being to Reflect and Express the Lord</h2><p>As we have seen, the purpose of the heart is to love the Lord, and the purpose of the spirit is to receive and to contact the Lord. What then is the purpose of the soul? The soul is to reflect the Lord. Second Corinthians 3:18 says that with an unveiled face we behold and reflect like a mirror the glory of the Lord. The soul, after being purified and transformed, is the very organ to express Christ, to reflect the Lord. We love Him with our heart, we receive and contact Him with our spirit, and we reflect and express Him with our transformed soul. The soul-life must first be denied, then the soul must be purified and transformed. Then it will be adequate to express and reflect the Lord Jesus.<p>I hope that you will put all these matters into practice in your daily life. If you do, you will see that what we have spoken of here is altogether practical. It truly works.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND BEHAVIOR</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 15:5</h1><p>In this message we will consider the difference between the growth of life and the improvement of behavior. Then in the following message we will consider the difference between the growth of life and the form of godliness, zeal in service, the increase of knowledge, the manifestations of gifts, and the increase of power. According to human understanding, these six things-behavior, the form of godliness, service, knowledge, gifts, and power-are very close to life. Today in Christianity too many people consider all these matters as life. Strictly speaking, however, these things are not life.<p>We should be able to present and define the truths we are fellowshipping about here. To do this requires a certain amount of knowledge and understanding. However, too much knowledge is not helpful. If we have no knowledge or understanding, we have nothing to speak, but if we use too much knowledge in our speaking, it is hard to make things clear to others. Eventually, this kind of speaking merely complicates people&#8217;s understanding.<h2 class=head1>LIFE BEING CHRIST HIMSELF</h2><p>First we need to see the difference between life and behavior and between the growth of life and the improvement of behavior. Life is simply Christ, whereas behavior is what we do, how we act, how we behave ourselves, and what kind of conduct we have. As we know, Adam was created by God as a person of three parts. After being created, he acted and behaved in a certain way. At that time, however, Adam did not have the divine life, because life is Christ, and Adam did not have Christ. What he had was the created, human, temporal life, not the uncreated, divine, eternal life. Therefore, Adam did not have life, but he did have behavior.<p>In the garden of Eden, there were two trees in front of Adam, the tree of life, signifying Christ as our life, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. With the second tree, there is not only evil but also good. Behavior may be evil, and it may be good. Not only is evil not life, but good is also not life. Both good and evil behavior are in the same category. When Adam partook of the tree of knowledge, he received evil, and he also received good. After the fall, therefore, just as the human race could do evil, it could also do good, because both good and evil are of the same category. We Christians must realize that life is absolutely different from behavior.<h2 class=head1>THE GROWTH OF LIFE BEING THE INCREASE OF CHRIST WITHIN US</h2><p>What then is the difference between the growth of life and the improvement of behavior? Because life is Christ, the growth of life is the increase of Christ within us. We may illustrate the improvement of behavior in many ways. Although a person originally can be full of hatred, he may be taught to love people. From then on he will try to love others instead of hating them. Originally he had a behavior of hatred, but now he will try to have a behavior of love. To some extent he may be successful. Formerly, this person always was full of hate, but now he has changed a little. This is the improvement of behavior. We have to ask, however, is this improvement of behavior the growth of life? No it is not, but today many Christians consider this kind of improvement of behavior as the growth of life.<p>As fallen beings, we have a certain amount of bad behavior as well as a certain amount of good behavior. Sometimes good behavior comes out of ourselves, and sometimes bad behavior comes out. Sometimes hatred comes out, and sometimes love comes out. Both hatred and love, however, are out of ourselves; they are merely behavior. Formerly we may have had hatred as a bad behavior, but now we may consider that as Christians we should not act in that way, that we have to change and improve our behavior and behave in a better way. Although eventually we may be successful, this is not the growth of life. It is merely an improvement of behavior.<p>What then is the growth of life? Since Christ is life, the growth of life is the increase of Christ. Christ came into our spirit as our life. Now we have to open ourselves and let Christ come in to fill us from within, spread out from within, and saturate us, permeate us, and swallow us up. Then Christ will live Himself out through us. This life, which is Christ Himself, will swallow us up, and He will live Himself out. In certain circumstances, there is the need of love. This Christ who lives Himself out of us will be the very love we need. This love is the spreading, permeating, and saturating of Christ. It is the expression of Christ from within. Therefore, this love is not a mere improvement of behavior. This love is an increase of Christ, a growth of Christ as life.<h2 class=head1>BEING ABLE TO DO NOTHING APART FROM CHRIST</h2><p>If two brothers hate one another, someone may pray for them and advise them to love each other. It seems that it is right to do this. However, the brothers cannot love out of themselves. John 15:12 says, &#8220;This is My commandment, that you love one another even as I have loved you,&#8221; and verse 17 says, &#8220;These things I command you that you may love one another.&#8221; However, verse 5 says, &#8220;I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing.&#8221; On the one hand, the Lord Jesus tells us that we have to love one another. On the other hand, in the same chapter He says that apart from Him we can do nothing.<p>The love mentioned here by the Lord is the spreading and increase of Himself. Within a tree there are the riches of the life-juice of the tree. The bearing of fruit is simply the spreading of the riches of the life-juice of the tree. By this we can see that in John 15 the love which we should have toward one another is not a kind of behavior. It is the growth of life, the increase, expansion, and spreading of Christ. Even if we could love one another, that is not the real love mentioned here. The real love spoken of here may look like a behavior, but it is not. It is the increase and spreading of the indwelling Christ, the expression of the inner life. Therefore, this is the growth of life, not the mere improvement of behavior.<p>A brother may have a disposition full of pride, but he realizes that to be a Christian brother in the church among the other brothers, it is not right to be proud; pride is ugly. He may then pray and try his best to improve his behavior in order to be humble. We all may be surprised at this brother&#8217;s humility. We may say, &#8220;Look, just last week this brother was very proud. Now see what kind of change he has had. He is so humble.&#8221; However, we need to ask what kind of change this is. Is this a mere improvement of behavior, or is this an expansion of Christ within? The way to have the expansion of Christ from within is not to adjust ourselves or to improve our behavior, but to open ourselves to the Lord, to let Him come in to fill us, swallow us up, permeate us, saturate us, and spread Himself throughout us. Then in the circumstances in which we need humility, this spreading Christ will be humility to meet the need. This humility is not a kind of behavior but a kind of spreading of Christ and an expression of Christ.<p>This may be hard to understand, because our understanding, concept, and mentality are focused too much on behavior, morality, and the improvement of conduct. However, now we have seen that the growth of life is the increase of Christ, the spreading of Christ, the permeating of Christ, and the expansion of Christ.<h2 class=head1>REAL LOVE AND HUMILITY BEING CHRIST SPREADING AND LIVING OUT THROUGH US</h2><p>There are two kinds of humility and two kinds of love. One kind is merely something out of ourselves whereas the other kind is the expanding of Christ. I may love the brothers fervently, but it may be a love out of myself. There is another love, that is, the spreading and expression of Christ. I may have no intention to love someone, but day by day I open myself to the Lord, and He comes in to fill me, swallow me up, and saturate me with Himself. Then when I come to you and there is the need for love, spontaneously something of Christ will come out to meet the need. That is the real love. This kind of love is not something out of me but something of Christ spreading and living out through me.<p>Again, formerly I may have been a proud person, but now that I am saved, I have learned to love the Lord, and I realize that if I am going to be a proper brother, I should not be so proud. Rather, among the brothers I need to be humble. Therefore, I may all the time try my best to be humble. To some extent I can be successful and have a certain kind of humility. This is one kind of humility, but there is another kind. I may not regard that I have to be humble among the brothers, but I contact the Lord, open myself to Him, and let Him come in again and again so that He fills me and saturates me. Then when the situation among the brothers demands humility, the Lord meets the need by spreading Himself through me. In this way, the humility I manifest is not merely my behavior. This humility is Christ spreading Himself through me and living Himself out of me.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED FOR A HEALTHY SPIRITUAL SENSE AND THE DEALING OF THE CROSS</h2><p>How can we differentiate the love, humility, and patience that are out of ourselves from that which is the spreading of Christ? How can we differentiate the &#8220;brass&#8221; from the &#8220;gold&#8221;? The best way to differentiate these two categories of things is by our inner sense. However, in order to sense these things, we must have a proper spiritual &#8220;nose.&#8221; If we are spiritually healthy, we will have a healthy spiritual nose. Many times we will sense that someone has love, but this love is not so sweet. This love has no sense of Christ. There is not the sweet odor of Christ in that love. Rather, this love is full of the self. Again someone may have humility toward a brother, but this humility has no sense, no sweetness, no sweet odor of Christ. We can sense the odor of Christ or the odor of pride in humility. We cannot define it, but we can sense it. We all have to learn to do this. Then Christ will grow within us.<p>Here we can see how much we need to deny the self, how much we need the work of the cross. The work of the cross is not only to deal with the evil things but also to deal with the good things. It is to deal with our behavior. Strictly speaking, we should not have mere behavior. What we should have is simply life, Christ spreading Himself from within us.<h2 class=head1>OUR NEED TO CONTACT THE LORD TO LET HIM SATURATE US, PERMEATE US, AND SWALLOW US UP</h2><p>Sometimes people advise us to behave in a certain way in order to show people that we are humble; otherwise, they say, people may think that we are proud. This is merely an improvement of behavior. This is wrong. As real, normal Christians, we should not do this. If someone advises us to have a change and be more humble, it seems that this is good advice given by love and in love. We may take this advice and go to pray, &#8220;Lord, help me,&#8221; and soon afterward our attitude may change. However, this is only the improvement of behavior. This is not the teaching of Christ; it is the teaching of ethical philosophy, like the teaching of Confucius.<p>Someone may ask, &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t the Bible tell us that we have to be humble?&#8221; Yes it does, not in the way of behavior but in the way of Christ. What we need is for someone to help us to contact the Lord. If a brother knows the proper way to contact the Lord, he should help us to contact the Lord by opening ourselves to Him to let Him come in more and more to fill us, saturate us, permeate us, and swallow us up in Himself. Then spontaneously we will have a change by the spreading of Christ as life to meet the need of humility among the brothers. This humility is Christ spreading Himself and expressing Himself from within us. Then we will have the growth of life instead of the mere improvement of behavior.<p>We talk about the inner life and the church life, but the more I travel and contact the Lord&#8217;s children, the more I am concerned and burdened that people simply do not know what the real inner life and church life are. The real inner life is nothing of behavior. The real inner life is altogether something of Christ.<p>After I was saved, I sat at the feet of certain teachers. From John 13 and 15, sometimes they stressed that we must love one another. They taught that we should wash one another&#8217;s feet to show that we love each other, and sometimes they practiced this. At that time I was convinced by their teaching, because apparently this was the word of the Lord Jesus. One day, however, I found out that in the same chapter, John 15, the Lord Jesus says that apart from Him we can do nothing (v. 5). Therefore, the love for the brothers must not be something out of me; it must be something out of Christ. This caused me to be puzzled. It seemed that I could do something without Christ. Apart from Christ I could still come to a brother and wash his feet. Yes, we can do many things without Christ, but those things are not of life. Anything of life must be of Christ.<p>Consider the branches of a tree. The branches can bear many things apart from the tree. We may, for example, hang a handkerchief or a hat on a branch. However, these things are not real fruit. Apart from the tree, the branches cannot bear fruit. In order for branches to bear fruit, they must abide in the tree. Without the tree, the branch can do nothing as far as fruit-bearing is concerned. Apart from Christ as life, we can have only the improvement of behavior, but we cannot have the growth of life. The growth of life is the spreading of Christ within us.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND THE FORM OF GODLINESS, ZEAL IN SERVICE, KNOWLEDGE, GIFTS, AND POWER</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 3:5; 1 Tim. 3:16a; Acts 22:3; Rom. 12:11; 1 Cor. 8:1; 6:17; Num. 22:28; 1 Cor. 1:22-24; 3:1</h1><h2 class=head1>THE OUTWARD FORM OF GODLINESS</h2><h2 class=head2>True Godliness Being the Likeness of God</h2><p>Second Timothy 3:5 says, &#8220;Having an outward form of godliness, though denying its power; from these also turn away.&#8221; We need to see the difference between the growth of life and the form of godliness spoken of in this verse. Again I say, we need to learn two lessons. One lesson is to know the reality of these truths, and the other is to learn how to present what we know in a clear way that is easy for people to apprehend and understand. Briefly speaking, godliness means God-likeness. To be godly means to be like God. First Timothy 3:16a says, &#8220;And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh.&#8221; The mystery of godliness is God manifested in the flesh, in a human being. Therefore, godliness is the likeness of God, to be like God. This is a great subject. Man was created in the image of God, according to God&#8217;s likeness, with the intention that he may be like God. It is God&#8217;s intention that we be like Him, that we have His image and His likeness. Second Timothy 3:5, however, speaks of the outward form of godliness without its power. To deny the power of godliness is to not have its living reality, to have the form without the life.<h2 class=head2>The Form of Godliness Being Only the Outward Appearance of Godliness</h2><p>The form of godliness is only the outward appearance, the outward likeness, of godliness. God is holy, so we may try to be holy as God is. God is separated from the common things, so we too may try to separate ourselves from the common things. God is love, so we may try to be like God and show love to others. In addition, God is light, so we too may try to be in light, avoiding everything of darkness. This is only the form, the outward appearance, of godliness, of God-likeness. In today&#8217;s Christianity we can easily see many forms of godliness, especially when we come into a church &#8220;service.&#8221; Many think that in order to show that they are godly, they must pick up their Bible on the Lord&#8217;s Day morning and walk in a certain way. Then when they come into the church building, they take a seat quietly. When I was young, I was influenced to learn these things. This is the form of godliness, as is practiced by many in Christianity today. That is not the growth of life.<p>In the four Gospels the Lord Jesus was a living person. He was truly holy. He was the real love and light. This was the living reality, not the form. What the Pharisees had was only a form, but what the Lord Jesus was, was the living reality of godliness.<p>Several centuries ago there was a certain man of God, a truly holy man. Once he was invited to another city in order to minister. Since he was famous, on the day of his arrival the people in that city were excited to welcome him. He anticipated that, so before he arrived, he disappeared from the public view and went to a little park to play on a seesaw with the children. At the scheduled time for his arrival, the people could not find him. They looked throughout the town and eventually saw him playing with the children. In that age especially, people thought that a man of God must appear holy, like a priest with a long robe. That brother knew that if he would come into the city in this way, they would all admire him. Instead, the people asked, &#8220;What kind of person is this? Is this a servant of God? Is this a man of God that first goes to the park to play with the children?&#8221; In doing this he was trying to break their natural concept of godliness and to help them to realize what real godliness is.<h2 class=head2>The Reality of Godliness Coming from the Increase of Christ within Us</h2><p>The reality of godliness is the growth of life, and the growth of life is the increase of Christ within us. It is not to have an outward show. Rather, it is to open ourselves again to the Lord, to contact Him daily and all the time, to be one spirit with the Lord, and to be filled, saturated, and permeated with Him and swallowed up by Him. Then He will live Himself out of us, and spontaneously and unconsciously we will be godly persons. We may have no intention of being like God, of having godliness, but we are one with the Lord and always filled with Him. Our inner man is strengthened by Him, He makes His home in all the parts of our being, and we are even filled unto all the fullness of God (Eph. 3:16-19). Then spontaneously whatever we are will be the likeness of God. This is the living reality of godliness. There is no need to make a show that we are holy as God is or to show that we have love as God has.<h2 class=head2>Godliness Being Manifested in Different Persons in Different Ways</h2><p>Suppose that we all live by Christ in such a way that we are filled with the riches of Christ unto the fullness of God. We have the growth of life with the living reality of godliness. In this case, will we all be the same? Since we all have God-likeness, the living reality of godliness, it seems that we would be the same. However, godliness is God manifested in man. God Himself is the same, but with the manifestation of God in man there is a difference. The manifestation of God in man differs with different people. We can see God manifested in Peter in one way and in Paul in another way. In all the apostles we can see the manifestation of God, but the manifestation differs with different persons.<p>We all appreciate the way the apostle Paul was. A small brother may think that he should imitate Paul in order to have the likeness of God, but this is to have merely the form of godliness. When I was seriously ill in 1943, there was an elderly co-worker, Sister Wong. She was very much with the Lord and came from Shanghai purposely to see me. She gave a great deal of help to the brothers and especially to the sisters. As such a sister in the Lord, she no doubt had a certain kind of appearance. After she stayed among us for about two weeks, all the young sisters began to imitate her. She spoke in a certain way, so all the young sisters learned to speak in the same way. After I recovered, I gave a message to these sisters to tell them that this is not godliness. It is merely a kind of imitation, a form. I told them that they should simply be genuine. They should learn to open themselves to the Lord so that He can fill them. Then with each of them He would come out in His own way. All the manifestations would be of the Lord, but the manifestations would be different. Again I say, the growth of life is simply the increase, expanding, and spreading of Christ. It is not anything with only a form.<h2 class=head1>ZEAL IN SERVICE</h2><p>There is also a difference between the growth of life and zeal in service. Acts 22:3 proves that zeal is something different from Christ as life. Paul said of himself that before he received Christ, he was &#8220;trained at the feet of Gamaliel, according to the strictness of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, even as you all are today.&#8221; Paul was without Christ, yet he was zealous. Nearly all the Jews at that time were zealous without Christ. What then is the real zeal? It is the burning of Christ. When we open to Christ and let Him come in to fill us, He is the burning One. Not only will He flow out of us, but He will burn us and cause us to be burning to burn others. The more we contact Him and are filled with Him, the more we are burned, and the more we will be burning.<p>The real zeal comes not from the soul but from the spirit, as Romans 12:11 says, &#8220;Do not be slothful in zeal, but be burning in spirit, serving the Lord.&#8221; How can we be burning in spirit? This requires that we open to the Lord from the depths of our being, from our spirit, and let the Lord fill us from within. Then we will be burned in the spirit, and we will be zealous, fervent, in the spirit.<p>We must learn how to differentiate between a person that is merely fervent and zealous in the service to God from a person who is filled with Christ, burned by Christ, and burning in spirit. This zeal, this burning, must be Christ Himself. Again, this is the real growth of life. We may have Christ as life within but not have the growth of life. If we do have the growth of life, we will be burned by Him, and we will become burning. This is the real zeal for service.<h2 class=head1>THE INCREASE OF KNOWLEDGE</h2><p>We must also see the difference between the growth of life and the increase of knowledge. Knowledge is not life. Today in Christianity there is too much knowledge. Comparatively speaking, many people have too much knowledge, although they know too little of what they need to know. There is too little genuine life. Mere knowledge is teaching and doctrines, whereas life is Christ Himself. As we have clearly seen, the growth of life is the increase and expanding of Christ, not the increase of knowledge. Knowledge is something in the soul, but life is something in the spirit. If we subtract the knowledge that is merely in the soul, then whatever is left must be in the spirit.<p>The first Epistle to the Corinthians deals with this matter. What the Corinthians had was merely knowledge in the soul. Therefore, this book tells us that knowledge puffs up (8:1). All those Corinthian believers were soulish, having much knowledge in their soul. Therefore, the apostle Paul exhorted them to exercise not their soul but their spirit, not to learn more knowledge but to contact the Lord more and more. It is in this book that he says, &#8220;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit&#8221; (6:17). The soul is something full of knowledge, but the spirit is full of Christ. In this book we have the contrast between Christ and knowledge. Christ is the very life in the spirit, and all else is merely knowledge in the soul. Whatever we know, regardless of what it is, even the knowledge about God, may be mere knowledge in the soul. The Corinthians considered that they knew many things, so the apostle Paul dealt with them to tell them that whatever they knew was only in the way of knowledge in the soul. Rather, what they needed was the real experience of Christ as life in the spirit.<p>Knowledge is something in the soul whereas life is something in the spirit. Whatever we have in the soul is only knowledge. We may even have much knowledge in the soul about Christ, but what we need is not to open our mentality to knowledge but to open our spirit to the Lord. Today we need one thing: to open ourselves to the Lord, to contact Him, and to let Him come in to fill us, saturate us, and make His home in us that we may be filled not with the knowledge of God but unto all the fullness of God. This is the one thing we stress in these days.<h2 class=head1>THE MANIFESTATION OF GIFTS</h2><p>The growth of life is different from the manifestation of the miraculous, supernatural gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14. It is a real tragedy in today&#8217;s Christianity that many Christians consider the miraculous gifts the same as life. The donkey of the prophet Balaam that spoke in human language is a very good illustration to show that miraculous gifts are not something of life (Num. 22:28). What the donkey spoke was a genuine, real tongue. Many people today proclaim that they have spoken in tongues, but I doubt whether they have spoken in a genuine tongue. However, even if someone speaks in a genuine tongue, that still is not life.<p>First Corinthians deals not only with knowledge but also with gifts. Not only knowledge but gifts also are in contrast to Christ. Verses 22 and 23 of chapter one say, &#8220;For indeed Jews require signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness.&#8221; Signs and wonders are something miraculous and supernatural. We have to be careful in speaking about gifts, because this matter is very complicated. I must speak the truth to say that in all my Christian life I never saw a person who stressed speaking in tongues who was a genuinely spiritual person. It is hard for almost any brother or sister who insists on speaking in tongues to know life.<p>Here we have a difference. Life is one thing, and the manifestation of gifts is another. We do realize that the proper manifestation of the gifts is for life. However, the manifestation of gifts is not life itself. Life is Christ, and the growth of life is the increase and expanding of Christ. The Corinthian believers at that time cared the most for speaking in tongues, but in chapter three Paul told them that they were not only childish but were even infants (v. 1). They spoke in tongues the most, yet they were infants because they were distracted by speaking in tongues. The proper use of speaking in tongues is to be a help for life, but the Corinthians were distracted by this matter, so they were frustrated from knowing Christ as their life.<p>Knowledge is not life and neither are gifts. Any kind of gift is not life, because life is simply Christ Himself. Therefore, the growth of life is the increase of Christ. It is not the manifestation of any kind of gift. To speak in tongues and to heal people miraculously are the manifestations of gifts. These are for life, but they are not life itself.<h2 class=head1>THE INCREASE OF POWER</h2><p>There is also a difference between the growth of life and the increase of power. Samson was very powerful, but what did he have-life or mere power? Sometimes people say that Peter was also powerful. Often, though, I consider that Peter was not as powerful as Samson. Peter was powerful in a different realm, in a different way. Samson had genuine power from God, but that power was not life. We cannot see much life in the record of Samson.<p>Today most Christians do not differentiate power from life. In a sense, someone may even have a kind of spiritual power but still be very short of life. Power must be for life, but people today mistake power for life. A powerful person may not be full of life. We have to differentiate these two. Power is for life, but power is not life. Regardless of how much increase of power we have, we may still be poor in the growth of life. For the growth of life there is the need of the work of the cross, but for power in itself there is not such a need.<p>What then is life? Again I say, life is Christ Himself, and the real growth of life is the increase and expanding of Christ. How can we have the expanding of Christ? There is no other way but to always open ourselves to the Lord and contact Him, not only once a day but all the time, daily, every day. We have to open ourselves to Him and let Him come in. Therefore, we should forget about behavior, the form of godliness, zeal in service, knowledge, gifts, and power. Simply pay attention to one thing, that is, to Christ, to open ourselves to Him, contact Him, breathe Him in, feed on Him, and drink of Him. Then we will have not merely the improvement of behavior but transformation. We will have not merely the form of godliness but the reality of godliness. God has the appearance of a precious stone, like jasper, so we too will have the appearance of jasper (Rev. 4:3; 21:11). We will be transformed into the very image of God, not in form only but in reality.<p>Then to be sure, the more we feed on Christ and breathe Him in, the more we will be burned and will be burning; we will have the real zeal within. We will also have the real knowledge, not the knowledge in the soul but the real knowledge of Christ in the spirit. We will have the experience rather than mere knowledge. We will know Christ not merely by reading and listening but by experiencing Him. We also will have not the mere manifestation of the gifts but the function of life. The function of life comes out of the growth of life. The more we feed on the Lord, the more we take Him in, and the more we grow in Him, the more our function in life will come into being. Then we will have the power in life, the indwelling Christ as the real power, just as 1 Corinthians 1:24 says that Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.<p>In order to know and experience the inner life more and more, we need to learn to differentiate all these things. We should forget about everything but life and learn to do only one thing: open ourselves to Christ, take Him as the tree of life, feed on Him, drink of Him, and breathe Him in more and more. This produces the genuine growth of life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE INTRINSIC SIGNIFICANCE OF REGENERATION</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 1:12-13; 3:6; Eph. 2:5; John 3:14-16, 36; 5:24; 6:47; 1 John 5:11-12; 1 Pet. 1:3; 2 Pet. 1:3-4; Ezek. 36:25-27a; 1 Cor. 2:12; Rom. 8:9, 2; John 14:16-17, 26; 15:26; Phil. 1:19; Eph. 1:13; 1 John 2:27; 2 Cor. 13:5; Rom. 8:10; Eph. 4:6; 1 John 3:24; 4:12-13, 15; 2 Cor. 5:17</h1><p>There are many matters related to the inner life. Of these, the first main point is regeneration. We must go back to the beginning to consider regeneration because many of us are still too short in the understanding of life, and we are not able to present these truths to others. First we need to experience the things of life, and then we need to learn how to present them to others in a brief, clear, and impressive way.<h2 class=head1>REGENERATION BEING A NEW BIRTH TO RECEIVE A NEW LIFE</h2><p>What is regeneration, and what do we obtain by regeneration? Regeneration means to be generated again, that is, to be born again. Regeneration is a rebirth. We all have had a birth by our parents. By that birth we received the human life, which is the life for us to exist on this earth. However, that is not the uncreated, divine, eternal life. God&#8217;s intention is to put Himself into us as the eternal life, the uncreated life, to fulfill His eternal purpose. Therefore, we need another birth; this means that we need another life. By the birth we have had already, we received a life. Now we need another birth in order to receive another life, which is nothing less than God Himself.<p>John 1 tells us that Christ as the expression of God was incarnated in order that we may receive God as our life. Verses 12 and 13 say, &#8220;But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&#8221; When we receive Christ, we are born of God. This is the second birth, that is, regeneration. To be regenerated is to be reborn, to be born of God. In our birth from our parents we received the human life, but now we are born of God to receive the divine life, which is God Himself.<p>In regeneration we are born not of the flesh but of the Spirit, of God Himself. John 3:6 says, &#8220;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&#8221; To be born of the flesh is the first birth, but to be born of the Spirit is the second birth. Moreover, this regeneration is something that happens in our spirit. Therefore, regeneration is to be born again of God, to receive God in Christ through the Spirit as a life other than the life we received from our parents. This is the way we should present the truth of regeneration to others. This word is brief, clear, and impressive.<h2 class=head1>THROUGH REGENERATION, LIFE BEING IMPARTED TO OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>Strictly speaking, whether or not we were fallen, we would still need regeneration. This presents a problem in the theology of today&#8217;s Christianity. Today&#8217;s theology tells people that because we are fallen, our life has became rotten; therefore, we need a better life. In a sense this is right, but we should realize that even if man had never become fallen, he would still need to be born again. The spirit of man was deadened by the fall through sin. Now through the redemption of the Lord&#8217;s blood, the Holy Spirit has gained the ground to come to give life to this deadened spirit, to impart Christ as life into this spirit.<p>If our spirit had only been made alive, that would simply have been a kind of recovery. What happens, though, is not only a recovering but a regenerating, a life-imparting, because the Holy Spirit brings Christ Himself into us. The Greek word in Ephesians 2:5 translated as quicken in the King James Version means &#8220;to give life.&#8221; In every language there is a shortage, and in English this word is a problem for translators. In English we can use the noun eye as a verb, as in Hymns, #206, which says, &#8220;The Bride eyes not her garment.&#8221; In Chinese the word life is both a noun and a verb. If it were possible, in English also we should use the word life as a verb. The Holy Spirit comes to &#8220;life&#8221; us. Thus, &#8220;to put life into us&#8221; is the correct meaning of the Greek word in verse 5, which has zoe-the divine, eternal life-as its root, as does the phrase life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45. When the Holy Spirit comes, He comes in as the Spirit of life to life us. When we are &#8220;lifed,&#8221; we are not only &#8220;quickened,&#8221; but we also have the Triune God within us as our life. In this way we are regenerated. We are born once more not of flesh but of the divine Spirit, that is, of God Himself. Hence, we are born of God. What is regeneration? Regeneration is to be born again of God, to have God Himself in Christ through the Spirit as the divine life, which has come into us in addition to the life which we received through our parents.<h2 class=head1>REGENERATION BEING DISTINCT FROM THE BREATH OF LIFE IN GENESIS 2:7</h2><p>The breath of life that God breathed into man in Genesis 2:7 was only a part of God&#8217;s creation, for the purpose that man could live. At that time, however, God did not commit Himself to be within man. The dust with which God created man became his body whereas the breath of life became his human spirit. That breath was not God Himself. Some Christian teachers have made a serious mistake, teaching that at the time of creation God put Himself into man. At that time God only gave the breath of life to man to cause man to live. That produced merely a created human life.<p>The proper definition of regeneration is to have a second birth, to be born again. We all have been born once of our parents; by that birth we have received the human life from our parents. Now we have a birth, and we have a human life within us. However, this life is good only for us to exist on this earth. It is not good enough for us to fulfill God&#8217;s purpose. God&#8217;s intention is put Himself into us as the eternal life, the divine life, to fulfill His purpose. Therefore, we need to be born again, to have a second birth to receive the divine life into us. That is why John 1:12-13 tells us that as many as received Him were born of God, and John 3:6 says that these were born in their spirit of the divine Spirit. Regeneration is to be born of God, to receive God into us in Christ through the Spirit as the divine life, which is a life other than our natural life. It is by this life that we can fulfill the eternal purpose of God.<h2 class=head1>WHAT WE OBTAIN THROUGH REGENERATION</h2><h2 class=head2>The Divine Life</h2><p>The first thing we obtain by regeneration is life, and because we obtain life, our human spirit is made alive. What is this life that we have obtained? Before we were regenerated, we already had the human life, the created life that we received from our parents. This life is not the real life. It is only temporary, a shadow of the real life, just as the food we take in day by day is not the real food but a shadow of Christ as our real food. Now through regeneration we have received the uncreated life, which is the divine, spiritual, heavenly, real, eternal life, without beginning and without end. This life is nothing less than God Himself in Christ through the Spirit. All other lives are merely shadows of this one.<p>John 3 proves to us that when we were regenerated, we received the divine life. Verses 14 through 16 say, &#8220;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that every one who believes into Him may have eternal life. For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.&#8221; John 3:36, 5:24, 6:47, and 1 John 5:11 and 12 also show us that by regeneration we receive the eternal life, which is God Himself. The law of life, the fellowship of life, the sense of life, and the light of life all come from life. We may say that these are &#8220;by-products&#8221; of the life we received in regeneration.<h2 class=head2>The Divine Nature</h2><p>With life there is also a nature. By regeneration we have received the essence of the divine life, and we have also received the divine nature. Second Peter 1:3 says, &#8220;Seeing that His divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness, through the full knowledge of Him who has called us by His own glory and virtue.&#8221; Life is the inward content, while godliness is the outward expression. The divine power of God has given us all things relating, pertaining, to life within and godliness without. Then verse 4 says, &#8220;Through which He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust.&#8221; By the exceedingly great and precious promises we are partakers of the divine nature, the nature of God. Have you ever realized that we have the nature of God within us? In the first Epistle of Peter, verse 3 of chapter one says, &#8220;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.&#8221; The first chapter of the first book of Peter speaks of regeneration through the resurrection of Christ, and the first chapter of the second book speaks of partaking of the divine nature. This shows us that we receive the divine nature by regeneration.<h2 class=head2>The Spirit</h2><p>By regeneration we have also received the Spirit into us. Ezekiel 36:25 through 27 is a passage dealing with regeneration. Verse 25 speaks of cleansing on the negative side, and verse 26 tells us that our old heart and deadened spirit have been renewed. After this, verse 27a says, &#8220;And I will put My Spirit within you.&#8221; After cleansing us and renewing us, God put His own Spirit into us. This is the best verse to show that in regeneration we received the Spirit into us.<h2 class=head3>The Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Life</h2><p>First Corinthians 2:12 also tells us that we have received the Spirit which is of God. Romans 8:9 says, &#8220;But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.&#8221; We should know all these different terms. The Spirit of God today is the Spirit of Christ, and this Spirit of Christ today is the Spirit of life within us (v. 2). The main purpose of the Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of Christ, is to be life to us. The phrase Spirit of power cannot be found in the New Testament (the spirit of power in 2 Timothy 1:7 is the regenerated human spirit, not the Holy Spirit). However, in Romans 8:2 there is clearly the term Spirit of life. This is because the main purpose of the Spirit who dwells in us is not power but life. If the Spirit within us is for some kind of power, He is for resurrection power, which is the power of life. The Spirit of God in us today is the Spirit of Christ for the purpose of life.<h2 class=head3>The Spirit of Reality</h2><p>This Spirit of life dwells in us as the Spirit of truth, that is, the Spirit of reality (John 14:17).<h2 class=head3>The Comforter</h2><p>The Spirit of reality, as the reality of Christ, is the Comforter (vv. 16, 26; 15:26). There is no adequate equivalent in English for the Greek word for Comforter, so we have borrowed the Greek word as Paraclete. This word has two meanings, a legal one and a civil one. In legal terms, a paraclete is an attorney who takes care of your whole case in the law court. In civil terms, a paraclete is a patron who serves you and takes care of you. If you need food, he gives you food. If you need water, he gives you water, and if you need medicine, he gives you medicine, somewhat like a nurse does. Today the Spirit of life is in us as the Paraclete. Therefore, with this Paraclete there is the bountiful supply. Philippians 1:19 says, &#8220;For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&#8221; Again, here we do not have an adequate translation. The word supply indicates a bountiful, all-sufficient, all-inclusive supply. This is the supply of the Paraclete, the Spirit of Jesus Christ.<p>The Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of life, who is the Spirit of the reality of Christ, and He is within us as the Paraclete to take care of us in every way. If we need to learn teachings from the Bible, it is this kind of teaching that we need to learn. Do not pay too much attention to the teachings of dispensations, sovereign grace, and sovereign will. Rather, learn to know the practical things of life. In Christianity today too many people pay attention to learning all kinds of doctrines but not the teachings concerning life. Anything related to life is generally neglected.<h2 class=head3>The Seal and the Pledge</h2><p>The Holy Spirit within us is the seal (Eph. 1:13). A seal is a stamp of ownership. When the Chinese buy a book, for example, they put their seal on it. When I buy a Bible, I always put my seal on it; then everyone knows this Bible belongs to me. The Holy Spirit dwells in us as a seal, testifying that we belong to God. The Holy Spirit as the seal declares that we are the inheritance, the property, of God.<p>Verse 14 and 2 Corinthians 1:22 tell us that the sealing Spirit is also the pledge. The pledge is the earnest, the down payment, or guarantee of the full payment of God Himself. As the seal the Spirit marks us as God&#8217;s inheritance, God&#8217;s property, and as the pledge He is the guarantee that God is our inheritance.<h2 class=head3>The Anointing</h2><p>The Spirit whom we have received is also the anointing Spirit (1 John 2:27).<p>There are many other aspects of the Spirit, such as the Spirit of sonship, the Spirit of holiness, and the Spirit of wisdom (Isa. 11:2). The above aspects, however, are the main ones. The Spirit of God today, who is the Spirit of Christ, is within us as the Spirit of life, who is also the Spirit of reality, the Paraclete, the seal, the earnest, and the anointing. We need to know all these items of the Spirit not only in knowledge but also by experience.<h2 class=head2>The Son</h2><p>Fourth, in regeneration we also receive the Son. Second Corinthians 13:5 and Romans 8:10 prove to us that the Son, Christ, is within us.<h2 class=head2>The Father</h2><p>Ephesians 4:6 indicates that through regeneration we have also received the Father. This verse says, &#8220;One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.&#8221; We have the divine life, the divine nature, the Spirit, the Son, and God the Father in us. First John 3:24 says, &#8220;And he who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And in this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us.&#8221; Verses 12 and 13 of chapter four say, &#8220;No one has beheld God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us. In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit.&#8221; Verse 15 says, &#8220;Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him and he in God.&#8221; These verses prove adequately that God is in us.<p>What have we obtained by regeneration? We have the divine life, the divine nature, the Holy Spirit, the Son, and the Father God within us. Have you ever fully realized that by your regeneration you have received all these items? These are simply the spiritual ABCs. Many Christians today think that they know many things, and they do, but the one thing they do not know is life. The matter of life is not something in our natural human concept, as many other teachings are. If you put a Christian to the test and ask him or her to speak something about life, you will see where Christians today are. The matter of life is veiled by the enemy.<p>The above five items that we receive in regeneration are actually just one item with five aspects. The Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, the Spirit is the Spirit of life, and within the divine life is the divine nature. The Son is the embodiment of the Father, so the Father is in the Son. The Spirit is the reality of the Son, so the Son is the Spirit. This Spirit comes into us as the Spirit of life, and within this life is the divine nature. The divine life we have received is nothing less than God Himself, but not merely God in a simple way. Rather, God the Father is the fullness in God the Son, God the Son is the very embodiment of God the Father, God the Son is realized as God the Spirit, and God the Spirit is the very transmission of the Triune God who comes into us as the divine life with the divine nature.<p>All the divine attributes such as wisdom, holiness, power, and love are in this Spirit. If we have this Spirit as the all-inclusive dose, we have all these divine attributes. In this all-inclusive Spirit we even have the human nature of Christ and the effectiveness and killing power of Christ&#8217;s death. All this we have obtained by regeneration.<h2 class=head1>WHAT HAPPENS TO US IN REGENERATION</h2><p>We have seen what regeneration is and what we obtain by regeneration. Now we may see what happens to us in regeneration.<h2 class=head2>Being Renewed in Our Heart</h2><p>According to Ezekiel 36:26, in regeneration our heart and our spirit are renewed. Before regeneration, our heart was a stony heart. It was not dead; the Bible never tells us that our heart is dead. Rather, it tells us that our heart is hardened, so it becomes rotten and stony.<p>Within the tripartite man are two kind of hearts, the physical heart and the psychological heart. Medical doctors deal with the physical heart, whereas a little &#8220;doctor&#8221; like me deals with the psychological heart. The physical heart is in the body, but according to the Scriptures where is the psychological heart? The first word of the New Testament gospel is repent. This is because the mind of man was turned away from God. To repent is to turn our mind back, to have a change of mind. Then after we repent, we have to confess. This is to exercise the conscience. Before this time the conscience was seared, without feeling; it was evil and careless. Now through our repenting the conscience starts to work, giving us the sense that we are sinful, so spontaneously we confess all our sinfulness. In addition, in our emotion we loved the world and hated God, but by repentance and confession spontaneously our emotion starts to delight in God and love Him. Before this time also, our will was hardened and stiff-necked, like the will of Pharaoh at the time of Moses.<p>If we add all these four items together-a mind turned away from God, a conscience seared, insensitive, without any feeling, and careless, an emotion hating God, and a hardened will-what we have is a stony heart. Our heart was hardened, like a piece of stone, but at the time of our regeneration, God the Spirit did something miraculous and divine to soften and renew our heart. He did this by causing us to turn our mind to God, causing us to have an exercised conscience sprinkled with the cleansing blood, causing our emotion to delight in God and love God, and causing our will to be not only softened but also pliable and very submissive. By all this, our stony heart became a renewed heart. This is the first thing that happened to us at the time of regeneration.<h2 class=head2>Being Renewed in Our Spirit</h2><p>Ezekiel 36:26b says, &#8220;A new spirit I will put within you.&#8221; Before regeneration our heart was hardened, like a piece of stone, and our human spirit was deadened. This means that all the functions of the spirit were lost; the spirit was without function. At the time of regeneration, however, our heart was softened, and our spirit was made alive. Our spirit was &#8220;lifed,&#8221; made alive, by the Holy Spirit coming into our spirit to be life to us. Since life came into our spirit, it was lifed. All of the above are the meaning of regeneration. In order to define what regeneration is, we have to tell people the definition and meaning of regeneration, what we obtain by regeneration, and what happened to us at the time of regeneration.<h2 class=head1>WHAT WE BECOME BY REGENERATION</h2><h2 class=head2>Children of God</h2><p>We must also consider what we become by regeneration. First, we become children of God, because by regeneration we are born of God (John 1:12-13.)<h2 class=head2>A New Creation</h2><p>By regeneration we also become a new creation (2 Cor. 5:17). As children of God, we have God within us as life, but as the new creation, we have God within us as our essence, element, and substance. What is the difference between the old creation and the new creation? The old creation did not have God as the essence, element, and substance, but in the new creation the essence, element, and substance of God are mingled with the creatures. Praise the Lord, today we are regenerated! We have God within us as our life, so we are God&#8217;s children, and we have God within us as our very substance and element, so we are the new creation.<p>If we can adequately tell people what the meaning of regeneration is, what we obtain by regeneration, what happened to us at the time of regeneration, and what we become through regeneration, then we are clear about regeneration, and this will help us very much to go on in life. These are the ABCs of the inner life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>THE CONDITION OF OUR SPIRIT WITH RESPECT TO REGENERATION</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 2:1, 5; Col. 2:13; John 3:6; Ezek. 36:26; Rom. 8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22; John 4:24; Rom. 1:9a; Eph. 6:18; Rom. 8:4-5; 1 Cor. 2:11; Gal. 6:1; 1 Pet. 3:3-4</h1><p>In this message we will see the condition of our spirit in three stages: before regeneration, at the time of regeneration, and after regeneration.<h2 class=head1>THE CONDITION OF OUR SPIRIT BEFORE REGENERATION</h2><p>According to Ephesians 2:1 and 5 and Colossians 2:13, our spirit was deadened before we were regenerated. Apparently, these verses do not mention the word spirit. However, consider our past before we were regenerated. Before regeneration our body was not dead. If our body was dead, we should have been buried. Before we were regenerated, our soul was not dead either. In fact, it was very active and alive. The body was not dead, the soul was not dead, and neither was our heart dead, but these two portions of the Word say clearly that we were dead. In what part then were we dead? Since we have a spirit, a soul, and a body, it must be that before the time of our regeneration we were dead in our spirit.<p>For the spirit to be dead mainly means that it lost its function. If my eyes lose their function, then they are dead eyes. The function of the spirit is to contact God, receive God, and sense God. Before we were regenerated, our body was very alive, and our soul was very active with many functions, but our spirit was dormant, without function and without the sense of God. Since the function to contact God was lost, our spirit was deadened and dormant.<h2 class=head1>THE CONDITION OF OUR SPIRIT AT THE TIME OF REGENERATION</h2><p>According to the same verses mentioned above in Ephesians and Colossians, at the time of regeneration our spirit was made alive. In addition, John 3:6 tells us that our deadened spirit was not only made alive but also was regenerated. This verse says, &#8220;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&#8221; According to Ezekiel 36:26, our regenerated spirit was also renewed. Our dead spirit had become old. Everything dead becomes old; dead things are old things, like an old, dead tree. Now at the time of regeneration the deadened spirit was made alive, regenerated, and renewed. It became a living spirit and a new spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE CONDITION AND FUNCTION OF OUR SPIRIT AFTER REGENERATION</h2><h2 class=head2>The Condition of Our Spirit-Being Indwelt by the Holy Spirit and by Christ Himself</h2><p>After we were regenerated, our conscience was purged and cleansed by the blood of Jesus, the fellowship of the spirit was revived, and the intuition of the spirit was made sensitive. However, there is something more important than this related to the condition of our spirit. After regeneration the Spirit of God is now in our spirit. Not only is the spirit itself with its three parts revived, but it now has the Spirit of God, even Christ Himself, in it. Romans 8:16 tells us that the Spirit today is in our spirit. This verse says, &#8220;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.&#8221; Then 2 Timothy 4:22 confirms that Christ is in our spirit: &#8220;The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.&#8221; This verse is as important as John 3:16, but almost no one pays attention to it. John 3:16 says that God so loved the world, that is, the people of this world, that He gave His Son to them. Now we have His Son. Where is He? He is in our spirit.<p>Some dear Christians, even certain Christian teachers, say that the spirit is the same as the soul. However, we cannot find a verse that tells us that the Holy Spirit is in our soul, nor can we find a verse saying that the Lord Jesus Christ is with our soul. Romans 8:16 says that the Holy Spirit bears witness with our spirit, and 2 Timothy 4:22 says that the Lord is with our spirit. Now we are clear about the condition of our spirit. Our spirit is made alive, regenerated, and renewed, the Holy Spirit is in it, and the Lord is with it. Our spirit is in a very healthy and strong condition.<h2 class=head2>The Function of Our Spirit</h2><h2 class=head3>To Worship and Contact God</h2><p>Now we may see what the function of our regenerated spirit is. To worship and contact God is a matter of the spirit. John 4:24 says, &#8220;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.&#8221; In the entire Bible is there a verse telling us to worship God in the soul? By this we can see that there is a difference between the spirit and the soul. This is not a small matter. We cannot see with our ears, and we cannot speak by using our eyes. This is to use the wrong organs. To contact God and to worship God is something in the spirit.<h2 class=head3>To Serve God</h2><p>Romans 1:9a says, &#8220;For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit.&#8221; To love God is a matter of the heart, but to serve God is a matter in the spirit. Verse 6 of chapter seven says, &#8220;But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held, so that we serve in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter.&#8221; This verse does not tell us that we serve in newness of the heart, mind, soul, or body. We can serve God only in the spirit, with newness of spirit. To worship God is something in the spirit, and to serve God is also in the spirit.<h2 class=head3>To Pray</h2><p>We also pray in the spirit. Ephesians 6:18 says, &#8220;Praying at every time in spirit.&#8221; There is no article here in the Greek text, so spirit should be rendered in the lower case.<h2 class=head3>To Live and to Walk</h2><p>We also live and walk according to the spirit (Rom. 8:4-5).<h2 class=head3>To Know the Spiritual Things</h2><p>In addition, 1 Corinthians 2:11 says that the spirit of man knows. To know the things of God is a matter in the spirit. The function of our spirit is to worship, to serve, to pray, to live, and to know the things of God.<h2 class=head3>To Work for the Lord</h2><p>Galatians 6:1 says, &#8220;Brothers, even if a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, looking to yourself lest you also be tempted.&#8221; To restore a brother is to help a brother. In principle, this is an example of our work for the Lord. We need to work for the Lord in the spirit.<h2 class=head3>To Be Adorned</h2><p>First Peter 3:3 and 4 say, &#8220;Let your adorning not be the outward plaiting of hair and putting on of gold or clothing with garments, but the hidden man of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of a meek and quiet spirit, which is very costly in the sight of God.&#8221; Our adornment must be in the spirit.<p>The above seven items concerning the condition of the spirit are adequate to represent all the matters of the spirit: to worship God in the spirit, to serve God in the spirit, to pray in the spirit, to live and walk in the spirit, to know the things of God in the spirit, to work for God in the spirit, and to adorn ourselves in the spirit. Are there any passages in the Word telling us to worship in the soul, to serve in the soul, to pray in the soul, or to live and walk according to the soul? Rather, there are verses in the four Gospels in which the Lord Himself tells us to deny the soul, to put the soul on the cross. Likewise, are there any verses telling us that we can know God in the soul? On the contrary, 1 Corinthians 2:14 tells us that the soulish man, the man of the soul and living in the soul, cannot understand the things of God and that the things of God are foolishness to him. Moreover, there are no verses telling us to help the brothers in the soul.<h2 class=head1>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SPIRIT AND THE SOUL</h2><p>By all this we can see the great difference between the spirit and the soul. The teaching of dichotomy says that the soul and spirit are the same. However, they are not the same, just as we cannot say that the ears are the eyes. The ears and the eyes are very close to each other, but they are not the same.<p>Luke 1:46 and 47 say, &#8220;And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit has exulted in God my Savior.&#8221; This portion of the Word proves that the spirit is not the soul. Here the soul does one thing whereas the spirit does another thing. In addition, to magnify is one thing, but to rejoice is another. To magnify the Lord is something in the soul, and to exult in the Lord is something in the spirit. We cannot say that we magnify the Lord in our spirit. According to the proper meaning of magnify, this is something that is done in our soul. The best way to take the Word is to take the clear words in it. These verses are very clear. We worship God in spirit, serve the Lord in spirit, pray in spirit, live and walk in spirit, know the things of God by the spirit, work for the Lord in the spirit, and even adorn ourselves in the spirit. To be sure, there is a soul and there is a function for the soul, but we have to realize that the spirit comes first.<p>Therefore, we cannot say that spirit and soul are synonymous terms, that we can use either one in either way. No, the spirit is the spirit, and the soul is the soul. In the Bible these two words are never used interchangeably, just as the eyes and the ears are very close to each other but are different.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>DIFFERENTIATING THE SPIRIT FROM THE SOUL</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 4:12; 1 Thes. 5:23; Matt. 16:24-26; Luke 9:23-25; Rom. 8:6; 2 Cor. 3:17</h1><p>We have seen clearly what the condition and the function of the spirit are. Now we must learn how to differentiate the spirit from the soul. Hebrews 4:12 says, &#8220;For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&#8221; Joints are the bones, and marrow is within the bone. Just as we differentiate these two things, we have to differentiate the spirit and the soul.<p>It is difficult to differentiate the spirit from the soul. This is because we are fallen people. As we have seen, the spirit of fallen man was deadened, and it lost its function. This means that the human spirit within fallen man did not function. From our youth, even from the day of our birth, we did not exercise our spirit. If we do not exercise any organ of our being for a certain time, it becomes useless. An expert once told me that if we do not use our eyes for three months, they will lose the function of sight, and it will take a long time to recover our vision. As fallen people, our spirit was deadened, and for a long time we did not use it. However, we were very accustomed to using our body and our soul. Therefore, after the fall of man, the human mind became overdeveloped. Now the mind is always too active. Even after we are saved and our spirit is made alive and renewed, we still are not used to exercising the spirit.<p>Today&#8217;s psychology does not even recognize that there is a spirit in man. The science of psychology only recognizes the body and the psyche, that is, the soul. The Bible, however, reveals to us that we have a third part, not only a body and a soul but also a spirit. First Thessalonians 5:23 says, &#8220;And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221; Our soul comprises the mind as the leading part and the emotion and the will. Our spirit, which was deadened, is made alive, regenerated, and renewed. However, we are still not used to the exercise of the spirit.<p>More than twenty years ago we lived in a small town in northern China. Like other homes in that town, ours had no electricity, so we used an oil lamp for a long time. One day electricity was installed in our home. At that time I visited people almost every day beginning early in the morning, and I came back in the evening. Whenever I came back home, the first thing I did was to put away my bicycle and pick up a match to light the lamp, even after electric lights had been installed. When I did this, our children would laugh at me. When I saw them laughing, I said to myself, &#8220;Foolish man, throw the match away.&#8221; Then I went to the switch to turn on the lights. For many years I was used to picking up a match to light the lamp. Now electricity had been installed, but I was not used to it. Today the heavenly &#8220;electricity&#8221; has been installed in our spirit, but we are not used to exercising this part. We are still used to &#8220;picking up the match&#8221; in our soul.<h2 class=head1>DENYING THE SELF BY DENYING THE NATURAL MIND, EMOTION, AND WILL</h2><p>How can we differentiate the spirit from the soul? As Christians, the regenerated ones, whenever we are going to do something, we have to learn the lesson to deny the soul and the self. If we read Matthew 16:24 through 26 and Luke 9:23 through 25, we can see that the soul is the very self. These two passages clearly tell us that to deny the self is to deny the soul. When I was young, I asked people what it meant to deny the self. I simply did not know what to deny. Eventually by reading the Word and through experience, we came to know that the self is the soul. Matthew 16:26 says, &#8220;For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life?&#8221; whereas Luke 9:25 says, &#8220;For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself?&#8221; These passages prove that the soul is the self.<p>As we have pointed out, the soul is composed of the mind, emotion, and will. Therefore, we now have the answer to the question, &#8220;What do I deny?&#8221; To deny the self is to deny our own mind, emotion, and will. The mind, emotion, and will added together equal the soul. If we subtract the mind, subtract the emotion, and subtract the will, there is nothing left. We should not speak merely doctrinally but practically. To deny the self is to deny the mind, the emotion, and the will. When we go to do something for God, for a brother, or even for ourselves, as children of God, reborn persons, those who are learning to walk in the presence of the Lord and please the Lord, we have to learn the lesson to deny our self in whatever we do.<p>Someone may say that after we deny our natural mind, natural emotion, and natural will, nothing will be left. It seems that this is true, but it is not altogether true. There is truly something left, that is, the spirit. We may not be able to place it, but we still have to exercise it. We must deny the mind, emotion, and will and try to exercise something else (not, of course, the body). Put this into practice and try it for two or three days. Eventually, something will come up from the spirit. Even in the ministry of the Word, many times I have denied what I know, what I like, and what I have decided to speak. Sometimes after I did this, I became blank, having nothing within, but I still stood on the ground of denying all these things. Then after a few hours something sprang up from deep within and became clear to me, sometimes right away but sometimes gradually, bit by bit. Then I knew what I had to minister.<p>When I come to visit a brother, for example, I have to learn the lesson to deny my mind, my emotions, and my will. When I get into his home and begin to speak, there is nothing of the mind, emotions, or will. I have denied them and given them up. At that time I will exercise not my body but the hidden part, the inmost part, silently praying, &#8220;Lord, what should I say?&#8221; In my mind I may have many things to say, from Genesis through the Psalms to Malachi and then from Matthew through Acts and Romans and on to the book of Revelation. In addition, I may be desirous to talk, especially about international affairs. This is my emotion, so I must take the cross. My mind full of the Bible knowledge must be crossed out, and my emotion which is so willing to talk about Europe, Asia, and Africa must be put on the cross. Then after five minutes I may still have nothing, so I still look to the Lord. Gradually, something comes up from within, that is, from my spirit.<p>I can tell you a number of real experiences like this. Many times, as I was about to give a message, I denied my mind, my emotion, and will. Then as I was going to the platform, there was nothing within. A responsible brother announced a hymn, and everyone sang it, but I simply looked to the Lord: &#8220;Lord, what is Your mind? What must I speak here?&#8221; While someone prayed, I was still looking to the Lord, and during more singing and praying I continued to look to Him. Then after the prayer I had to stand up. I simply went to the platform and said, &#8220;Let us read,&#8221; but I did not know what to read. While I was speaking, &#8220;Let us read,&#8221; I was still looking to the Lord. Then I said, &#8220;the book of John.&#8221; Still I did not know what chapter to read. Even as I said, &#8220;John,&#8221; I was not clear. Then I said, &#8220;chapter fourteen.&#8221; This illustrates the way to differentiate the spirit from the soul. The way is to deny the natural mind, the natural emotion, and the natural will.<p>A brother and his wife may quarrel in the morning. Then in the evening the brother may ask someone what he should do about it. What he must do is cross out his mind, his emotion, and his will. Then he will know what to say to his wife, and whatever he says will be from the spirit. Before this time the brother may have had many reasons ready in his mind and emotion with which to reason with his wife. The more he considers his reasons, the stronger he becomes, and he finally makes the decision to go to his wife in that way. This is the self, and this is the soul. The brother should not do this. He should go to the Lord and contact Him. If he goes to the Lord in this way, he will learn the lesson. Something within will cross out his mind with its many reasons, his emotion, and his natural will. He may say, &#8220;Lord, if I cross out all these things, I will have nothing left. What shall I do?&#8221; The Lord will say, &#8220;You will be gone. You will be crossed out, and I will come out.&#8221; Then gradually something will come up from his spirit, and he will know what to say to his wife. Whatever he says will be from the spirit.<p>We should not try to figure out if something is of the spirit or the soul, saying, &#8220;This is too shallow, so it must not be of the spirit, but this other is deeper, so it may be of the spirit.&#8221; We can never figure out what the spirit is in this way. The way to differentiate the spirit from the soul is to deny the self, to always deny our natural mind, our natural emotion, and our natural will. Then we will see what is left and what will come out.<h2 class=head1>MEETING BY DENYING OUR SELF AND EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>When we come to the Lord&#8217;s table meeting, we should cross out what we know. We should not pray according to what we know or what we like to pray. We must cross out our decision. Since we have encouraged the brothers and sisters to participate in the meetings, many have truly been convinced. Therefore, before the Lord&#8217;s table a brother may prepare to offer a prayer about the Lord&#8217;s love. Then he considers John 3:16 and the constraining love of Christ in 2 Corinthians 5:14 until he is burdened in his emotions and makes the decision to offer a prayer about this. If we pray in this way, our prayer will be deadened. This is the wrong way. We have to learn to cross out what we know, cross out what we like, and cross out what we decide to do. Now when we come to the meeting, we will say, &#8220;Lord, I am open. My mind, emotion, and will have all been crossed out, and there is nothing of me left.&#8221; Then we will exercise to speak something from within, and whatever we say will be of the spirit.<p>The way to differentiate the spirit from the soul is to take the cross. We should learn to apply this to ourselves. When we first practice this, many times after denying our self we will seem blank. However, after a certain time of practice, it will be very easy to have something after we deny our self, because our spirit will be exercised to be very sensitive. After a certain period of practice and exercise, our spirit will be sensitive, and we will be used to the sensitivity of the spirit. We all need to learn this lesson. By way of testimony, I can tell you that even today I was not clear what I should minister. In the morning I thought that I should come to a different point, but by the afternoon I had a real burden to speak something else. I denied my thought and said, &#8220;Lord, what is Your mind about the next point I should speak on?&#8221;<p>Most Christians today do not know the proper way to have a church meeting. They have their meeting merely according to traditions, forms, and regulations, either written or understood. If we all will learn the lesson how to deny the soul and let something spring up from within the spirit, our meetings will be revolutionized. What passage in the New Testament tells us to meet in the way we do today? We learned the way we are taking today from our background in Christianity. We start the meeting with a hymn, but where is the scriptural ground for this? We have to break our traditional, formal, natural, old ways from our background. If you ask me what the right way to meet is, I would say that I do not know. One thing I do know, however, is that when we all come together, we have to come in the way of denying the mind, denying the emotion, and denying the will. Then we will see what comes up from the spirit.<p>In a recent prayer meeting I was very happy that we did not start with a hymn. We simply started to pray. Sometimes to not use any hymns will take us to the highest heavens. Eventually some hymns were called, but they were an interruption to the meeting. At that time I myself chose a hymn only to help bring us back. Sometimes we have to follow in the wrong direction to bring people back to the right way. This is what the Lord did with those two disciples on the way to Emmaus. However, we simply should have prayed, perhaps even until midnight. What a bondage traditional knowledge is. Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, release, and freedom (2 Cor. 3:17).<p>I cannot tell you what the right way for Christians to meet is, but I do believe the proper way is that we have to come together by denying the mind, the emotion, and the will, along with all our forms. We must simply do one thing&mdash;exercise our spirit. Then let us see what comes out. I have a heavy burden about this. To discard all the traditional ways is a revelation, even a revolution. We do not have any scriptural ground to prove that the present way for our meetings is right. I do not know what the proper way is, but I do know that what we must do is deny the soul and meet not according to knowledge but according to the spirit. Then the Holy Spirit will have the free way. The way to differentiate the spirit from the soul is to deny the negative thing; then the positive thing will spring up. Learn to do this, and try to do this. Then you will see the result.<h2 class=head1>KNOWING THE SPIRIT BY LIFE, PEACE, AND FREEDOM</h2><p>There are two main verses in the Bible that give us the way to know the spirit. Romans 8:6 says, &#8220;For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&#8221; Similarly, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, &#8220;And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&#8221; In Romans 8 there are two key words: life and peace. Then 2 Corinthians 3 speaks of freedom. Life, peace, and freedom, or release, are the way to know the spirit. Whenever we have life, peace, and release within, we are in the way of the spirit. For the way to know that we are in the flesh, there is just one word: death. Death is versus life, peace, and freedom. When we have death within, we do not have life, and neither do we have peace or freedom. If someone is full of death, there is no need for him to argue that he is not in the flesh. It is by death that we know the flesh, and in the same principle it is by life, peace, and release that we know the spirit.<p>In our physical body there is a life, yet it is hard for anyone to show us the life. If a medical doctor examines a dead body, he cannot find death itself, but the life is gone. We know that there is life or death in a body by the expressions of the body. If we come to someone and see the expression of death, this shows that his life is gone; then we know that this is a dead person. It is also by certain expressions that we know there is life in a person. In the same way, the way to know the spirit is by its expressions, which are revealed in the above two verses: life, peace, and freedom.</body></html>
