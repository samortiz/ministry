   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>10 Forgiving the Brothers and Forgiving One Another in the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the church life the believers forgive one another.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Peter asked the Lord, "How often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Until seven times?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Matt 18:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord replied, "I do not say to you until seven times, but until seventy times seven" v. 22 , and then He gave a parable as an illustration vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>23-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Matthew 18:35 says, "So also shall My heavenly Father do to you if you do not forgive each one his brother from your hearts."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do not forgive the brother who sins against us, we shall be disciplined by the Lord until we forgive him from our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then the Lord will forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we do not practice the way of repentance and forgiveness, the longer we stay in the church life, the more offenses there will be.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, the accumulation of offenses will cause us to forfeit the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>May the Lord grant us the grace we need.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you offend someone, you need to go to that one and repent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If someone offends you, you need to look to the Lord for grace to forgive that one from your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And once you have forgiven an offense, you should forget it and never mention it again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do this, we shall maintain a proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Another verse that speaks of forgiveness is Ephesians 4:32: "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as also God in Christ forgave you."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only the enjoyment of Christ as our life supply and as our joy can make our hearts tender.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are tenderhearted, we shall forgive others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In our daily walk we need both to forgive others and to ask others to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is necessary because we are easily offended and we easily offend others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we have offended someone, we need to ask for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we have been offended, we need to extend forgiveness to others, even as God in Christ has forgiven us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Colossians 3:13 Paul says, "Bearing one another and forgiving one another, if anyone should have a complaint against any; as the Lord forgave you, so also should you forgive."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The forgiving Lord is our life, and He lives within us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Forgiving is a virtue of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we take Him as our person and live by Him, forgiving others will be a spontaneous virtue of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we have truly forgiven someone, we shall also forget the offense.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once we have forgiven someone in a matter, we should not mention it again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To make mention of an offense indicates that we have not released the one who offended us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to the New Testament, to forgive means to forget and to release.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to forget the offense and release the offender.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once we have done this, we should never speak of the matter again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To forgive means not to be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As soon as we forgive someone, we shall not be offended by him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But if we do not forgive, we shall be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The point here is that forgiving annuls offending.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we do not forgive others, we shall be offended by them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if we forgive them, we shall annul the offense.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Suppose a certain brother offends you and you forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Your forgiving of him will annul his offending of you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then there will be no problem between you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, suppose this brother offends you and you are not willing to forgive him and forget the offense.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This will cause trouble, especially to you, for you will become entangled as the result of being offended.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the church life we should avoid stumbling others, and we should also avoid being offended by others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should always be careful and cautious not to offend others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the same time, we should always be willing to forgive.</S>
