<P>The name of our God here also matches this point. "Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth." Here we see that grace and peace are from the Triune God. How different is this book from the Epistles! Here it is still "Grace to you and peace." However, it is no more "Grace to you and peace from God our Father," nor is it "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ." (Please compare the first chapter of each Epistle.) Now grace and peace are from Jehovah who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ. We may notice that it is different from the other Epistles not only in tone; the names are addressed in a very different way. Let us look at this in detail.</P><P>God's name is "Him who is and who was and who is coming." This is the "Jehovah" in the Old Testament—the "I am that I am." "Him who is" is the name of Jehovah. Hence, it is spoken first. "Who was" declares how He dealt with the earth, with men, with Abraham, and with Moses. "Who is coming" indicates that He will still be administrating in the coming eternal age. He incorporates into His name the eternal past and the eternal future. This is the covenanted name of the God of Israel. In the Gospels and the Epistles, He is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now He does not use that name, but He returns to the name that He used to establish the covenant with the Israelites in the Old Testament. Does this not shame the ones who think that they are more loving than God? They think that the concept of God in the Old Testament is incomplete because the Old Testament says that God is a righteous God and is the God of Israel. Here they are reprimanded by the word of God. God is now in the New Testament using the Old Testament name! This God has never changed. He combines two eternities in Himself. After all, the New Testament does not create another God for us, nor does it remake the old God of Israel! What the New Testament exalts is the One who never changes. Thank God, He exists from the beginning to the end. He does not change amidst all changes. His kingdom is eternal. This is what we rest our faith on! Now God returns to grace Israel. Therefore, even when He speaks to the church, He uses the Old Testament name. Before He returns to Israel, He should judge those who call themselves His church. After He gives up the church that exists in name only, He will give grace—not law—to the tribes of Israel. Because of the substitutional death of the Son of God, God's grace flowed to the Israelites. The use of this name is to prove this fact. Although this is so, now is still the time of His patience, and grace and peace are still coming to us from Him. May we be faithful!</P><P>Grace and peace not only come from that eternal One, but also from "the seven Spirits who are before His throne." We know this indicates various kinds of works of the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, chapter four verse 5 uses the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne to represent Him: "which [lamps] are the seven Spirits of God." Again, chapter five verse 6 uses the seven eyes of the Lamb to represent Him: "which [eyes] are the seven Spirits of God." Here it says "seven Spirits." It does not mean that there are seven Holy Spirits. Paul in Ephesians clearly says that there is "one Spirit." There, the church before the Lord is also "one Body" (Eph. 4:4). However, here we see that the Lord uses the seven churches to represent the whole church. Likewise, the Lord says "the seven Spirits" to indicate one Holy Spirit. Ephesians indicates the oneness of His person in the heavens. Revelation indicates the diversity of His works on the earth. "The seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth" (5:6). Moreover, when we read Isaiah 11 we clearly see how He is related to Christ in the future kingdom. There it also speaks of His seven kinds of power. The seven Spirits are before the throne of God. The throne is the place where God administrates His government. We see how the Holy Spirit here is connected to God's government and is not for building up the church. To be before the throne is to work for the throne. In addition, grace and peace come from Him! All of God's administration on the earth is to give us grace and peace. If we believe this, how restful and bold we will be!</P><P>Usually, grace and peace are from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ to the church. Here not only the style of the writing is different, but the order is also different. Grace and peace come first from Jehovah, then from the seven Spirits, and then from Jesus Christ. I believe the reason for this is that in this book, Christ is not expressing His own glory in the Godhead nor His own relationship with the church. In this book Christ is the God-man exalted by God. That is why He is mentioned after the Holy Spirit. The reason the Epistles only mention God the Father and Christ in reference to grace and peace without mentioning the Holy Spirit is that in the age of grace the Holy Spirit is from the Father and testifies for the Son; He does not speak anything of Himself (John 16:13).</P><P>Now let us come to our Lord Jesus Christ. Here it says He is: (1) the faithful Witness, (2) the Firstborn of the dead, and (3) the Ruler of the kings of the earth. Here it speaks of Him as the Son of Man and not as the Son of God. At least, the latter is not mentioned. Here it does not mention His incarnation, which shows His status as a God-man, nor does it mention His ascension and Headship over the church, which indicate His divine power. Here it mentions only His past works on earth and His future glory on earth.</P>
