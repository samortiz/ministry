<h2 class="head1">II. NAZARITES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Consecrating Themselves Voluntarily</h2>
<p>Numbers 6 is on the vow of the Nazarite. A Nazarite is a voluntarily consecrated one. Whereas a priest is chosen by God, a Nazarite voluntarily consecrates himself. Although not every Israelite was blessed with being chosen by God, everyone could voluntarily consecrate himself to be a Nazarite and receive the blessing of God&rsquo;s choosing. This is like Samuel (1 Sam. 1:11-28), who complemented the priestly ministry of God&rsquo;s ordination by his human cooperation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Separating Themselves from Worldliness</h2>
<p>The Nazarites also separated themselves from worldliness. They separated themselves to God by making a special vow. They were separated to Jehovah in not drinking wine and strong drink and in not eating anything of grapes (Num. 6:3-4). This signifies that they did not care for earthly enjoyment or pleasure and that they rejected the blessings of the world. They were altogether separated from worldliness and were absolutely for God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Submitting Themselves to God</h2>
<p>The Nazarites also submitted themselves to God. During the days of a vow of separation, no razor could pass over the head of the Nazarite; he was to let the locks of the hair of his head grow long (v. 5). Not shaving the head signifies not rejecting the headship of the Lord (cf. 1 Cor. 11:3, 6). A Nazarite must remain under the Lord&rsquo;s headship to absolutely belong to God and be in subjection to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Typifying Christ</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Consecrating Himself to God Voluntarily</h2>
<p>According to typology, among the human race the unique Nazarite is the Lord Jesus. He voluntarily consecrated Himself to God in living for God in His humanity. He was always carrying out God&rsquo;s work, doing God&rsquo;s will, speaking God&rsquo;s word, seeking God&rsquo;s glory, and expressing God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being Sanctified to God</h2>
<p>Throughout His life the Lord Jesus was absolutely separated unto God, was for God, and was one with God. Hence, He is called the Holy One (cf. Acts 3:14). He is not of the world (John 17:14), and in Him the ruler of the world has nothing (14:30). He is absolutely holy in Himself; however, He still sanctified Himself in His living to set an example of sanctification for us (17:19).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Submitting Himself to God</h2>
<p>Christ submitted Himself to God in His walk and living. He took the form of a slave to serve God and man (Phil. 2:7; Acts 3:13; Mark 10:45). He humbled Himself and became obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross (Phil. 2:8), that He might give His life as a ransom for all for the accomplishment of the eternal purpose of God to whom He is in subordination.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Typifying the Believers</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Consecrating Themselves to God</h2>
<p>Through redemption and regeneration, the New Testament believers have been chosen and ordained by God to be the priests who serve Him. However, we still need to be a Nazarite in consecrating ourselves to God for the fulfillment of the service of the holy priesthood.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Separating Themselves from the World</h2>
<p>To take up the standing of the priesthood, we must be willing to be separated, sanctified, from the world unto God and His will by leaving the earthly enjoyments and pleasures to live a sanctified life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Submitting Themselves to God</h2>
<p>As Nazarites serving God, we must deal with the rebellion in our nature and live under the Lord&rsquo;s headship, submitting ourselves to God. We need to have a submissive spirit, standing, atmosphere, and intention. Thus, we can be a genuine Nazarite serving God as a priest to fulfill His purpose.</p>
