   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TREASURE, THE PEARL,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE NET</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to the three remaining parables in Matthew 13: the treasure, the pearl, and the net.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This will make a total of seven parables.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Bible the number seven is composed of four plus three, three plus four, and six plus one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The number seven in Matthew 13 is firstly composed of four plus three.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first four parables comprise one group and the last three comprise another.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first instance of the number seven found in the Bible was composed of six plus one: in Genesis 1 and 2 there are six days for God's work and one day for God's rest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever we have six plus one, it means that God has a completion for His rest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The number seven in these parables is composed both ways.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First it is composed of four plus three; then it is composed of six plus one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The last parable, the parable of the net, stands alone.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the time of this parable will have been fulfilled, that will be the completion, the consummation of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then God will have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Revelation 6 and 8 there are seven seals, the first four seals plus the last three.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Also, there are six seals plus one seal, for the completion follows the seventh seal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At that time the wrath of God will come.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The same principle applies to the seven trumpets in Revelation 8, 9, and 11.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First, there are four trumpets and then three trumpets.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are also six trumpets plus the last trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the last trumpet sounds, God's wrath is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the seventh parable of Matthew 13 is finished, that signifies the completion for God's rest.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this parable the King James Version uses the phrase, "the end of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the Greek, this phrase should be translated, "at the completion of the age."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that the seventh parable is the completion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When this parable is completed, that will be the time for God's rest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Treasure and the Pearl</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Each of the four parables in the first group contains something related to the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The two parables following the treasure hidden in the field and the pearl are both related to minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The treasure certainly must contain either precious stones or gold, both of which are minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The pearl also is a type of mineral since its basic structure, a tiny rock, is a mineral.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Three Peoples</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is a great deal involved here.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord Jesus is very wise, and the parables, although they are simple, contain great wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Taken as a group, the last three parables cover the whole human race.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The human race is composed of three peoples: the Jews, the church, and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First Corinthians 10:32 reveals that among the human race today there are only these three peoples the Jews, the church, and the Gentiles.</S>
