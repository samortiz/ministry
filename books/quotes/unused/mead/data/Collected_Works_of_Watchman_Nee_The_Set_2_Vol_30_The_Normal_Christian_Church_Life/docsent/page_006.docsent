   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God said to the Israelites, "Moses, because of your hardness of heart, allowed you to divorce your wives" Matt 19:8 , but the Lord Jesus said, "What God has yoked together, let man not separate" Matt 19:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Is there not a discrepancy here?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Moses, because of your hardness of heart, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so" Matt 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not that in the beginning it was permissible, and later it became forbidden, and still later became permissible again, as though God were a changeable God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No, the Lord said, "From the beginning it has not been so" showing that God's will had never altered.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From the beginning right on until today it is just the same.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here is a most important principle.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we want to know the mind of God, we must look at His commands in Genesis and not look at His permissions later on, because every later permission has this explanation, "because of your hardness of heart."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is God's directive will we want to discover, not His permissive will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We want to see what God's purpose was from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We want to see things as they were when they proceeded in all their purity from the mind of God, not what they have become because of hardness of heart on the part of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we would understand the will of God concerning His Church, then we must not look to see how He led His people last year, or ten years ago, or a hundred years ago, but we must return to the beginning, to the "genesis" of the Church, to see what He said and did then.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is there we find the highest expression of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Acts is the "genesis" of the Church's history, and the Church in the time of Paul is the "genesis" of the Spirit's work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Conditions in the Church today are vastly different from what they were then, but these present conditions could never be our example, or our authoritative guide.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must return to the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only what God has set forth as our example in the beginning is the eternal will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is the divine standard and our pattern for all time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A word of explanation may be needed regarding the examples God has given us in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christianity is not only built upon precepts, but also upon examples.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God has revealed His will, not only by giving orders, but by having certain things done in His Church, so that in the ages to come others might simply look at the pattern and know His will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God has not only directed His people by means of abstract principles and objective regulations, but by concrete examples and subjective experience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God does use precepts to teach His people, but one of His chief methods of instruction is through history.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God tells us how others knew and did His will, so that we, by looking at their lives, may not only know His will, but see how to do it too.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He worked in their lives, producing in them what He Himself desired, and He bids us look at them, so that we may know what He is after.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Shall we, then, say that because God has not commanded a certain thing we need not do it?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we have seen His dealings with men in days past, if we have seen how He led His people and built up His Church, can we still plead ignorance of His will?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Is it necessary for a child to be told explicitly how to do everything?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Must each item be separately mentioned of things permissible and not permissible?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Are there not many things he can learn simply by watching his parents or his elder brothers and sisters?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We learn more readily by what we see than by what we hear, and the impression upon us is deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That is why God has given us so much history in the Old Testament, and the Acts of the Apostles in the New.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He knows we learn more easily by example than by precept.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Examples have greater value than precepts, because precepts are abstract, while examples are precepts carried into effect.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By looking at them, we not only know what God's precepts are, but we have a tangible demonstration of their outworking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we try to eliminate examples from Christianity and leave only its precepts, then we have not much left.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Precepts have their place, but examples have no less important a place, though obviously conformity to the divine pattern in outward things is mere formality if there is no correspondence in inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In closing, may I stress the fact that this is not a book on missionary methods.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Methods are not to be despised, but in God's service what matters most is the man, not his methods.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Unless the man is right, right methods will be of no use to him or to his work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Carnal methods are suited to carnal men, and spiritual methods to spiritual men.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For carnal men to employ spiritual methods will only result in confusion and failure.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This book is intended for those who, having learned something of the cross, know the corruption of human nature, and seek to walk, not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Its object is to help those who acknowledge the lordship of Christ in all things, and are seeking to serve Him in the way of His own appointing, not of their choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To put it in other words, it is written for those who are already in the good of Ephesian truths, so that they may know how to express their service along Corinthian lines.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May none of my readers use this book as a basis for external adjustments in their work, without letting the cross deal drastically with their natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In God's work everything depends upon the kind of worker sent out and the kind of convert produced.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the part of the convert, a real Holy Spirit new birth is essential, and a vital relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the part of the worker, besides personal holiness and enduement for service, it is essential that he have an experimental knowledge of the meaning of committal to God and faith in His sovereign providence.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Otherwise, no matter how scriptural the methods employed, the result will be emptiness and defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To the Lord and to His people I commend this book, with the prayer that He may use it for His glory, as He sees fit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>January 1938</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>W. Nee</S>
