   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Sins of the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not only are there spiritual sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are also sins of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Adultery is a sin of the flesh, undisciplined eyes are a sin of the flesh, and improper relationships with others are also a sin of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many have failed in these things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many have sinned with their eyes because their eyes have not been disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many are improper in their relationship with friends.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These are sins of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are sins in one s conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some sins have nothing to do with the body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Other sins are related to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brothers and sisters, have your eyes been dealt with?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I admit that today there are plenty of opportunities for the eyes to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You have to deal with this matter before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are many Christians who will never experience God s overcoming life unless their eyes are dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Friendship is another thing that we have to watch carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A brother may build up an extraordinary friendship with an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the world, this is not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But according to God s ordained life for a Christian, this extraordinary friendship is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is true also with the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A Western missionary once said that some unbelievers tried to develop extraordinary friendships with him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When he realized that it was a sin, he rejected the friendships.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sins of the Mind</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not only are there spiritual sins and sins of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are sins of the mind as well.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many do not have spiritual sins.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To an extent, they have been dealt with in their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But they cannot overcome their thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some have wandering thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Others have circumventing thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some have unstable thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some thoughts are not wandering, circumventing, or unstable, but they are unclean or illusionary.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some are filled with doubts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Others are obsessed with a drive for knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They want to know everything, and they will not stop until they do.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those who have these kinds of thoughts have not experienced the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not think that there is nothing wrong with us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Few are actually victorious over their thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many have wandering, unstable, and drifting thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Having drifting thoughts is serious, but having unclean thoughts is even worse.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some have unclean thoughts that tenaciously linger over them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I once met a sister who confessed that her thoughts were always wandering.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I met another Christian who confessed that his thoughts were always unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This shows that we are not living out the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to deal with all these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Imaginations have damaged many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Doubts have also damaged many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For example, when we meet a brother on the street and he is not very friendly, we may think that he is angry with us or that he thinks unfavorably of us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But when we arrive home, we may learn that his unfriendly attitude was related to the fact that he did not sleep well the night before, that he had a headache, or that he was going through some terrible experience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We thought that it was a problem related to ourselves, but actually there was nothing wrong with us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our imaginations often hurt us, yet we often think that we can discern the hearts of others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must realize that only the Lord can search the inward parts and the hearts Rev 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many imagine that others are one way or another.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have sinned in our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have made too many judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have too many illusions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brothers and sisters, we must come to the Lord and deal with these things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If our thoughts are not dealt with, we cannot enter into a life of victory in God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is a brother who has an obsession for knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He has to know the reason for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He analyzes everything and wants to know everything.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His mind is very active.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He does not trust in God, yet he wants to know about every single thing around him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Brothers and sisters, this kind of drive for knowledge is also a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must deal with this as well.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Sins in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There are some sins that are related to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They may not necessarily be unclean things.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Humanly speaking, they may not be big things.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But to a Christian, these are sins.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some pay too much attention to eating.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Others pay too much attention to sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Some pay too much attention to health or to personal grooming.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Some are bound by the habit of indulging in snacks.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Some love their bodies too much.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All of these are sins before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Many Christians are bound by eating.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They have never fasted as a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is possible to know the kind of person they are from the way they eat.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The minute they pick up their chopsticks, others know the kind of person they are.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>A brother said, I have a large appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>My appetite is extraordinarily large.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Brothers and sisters, overindulgence in eating is also a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Those who cannot control themselves in the matter of eating are committing a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Some have a terrible look on their face when they only lose a little sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They become impatient in handling things and talk incoherently.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This also is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Some indulge in eating snacks.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>They spend a great deal of money on snack food.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Others pay too much attention to their personal grooming.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>They always insist on good clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>There are also some who are obsessed with health.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Everything has to be just right for them.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>They consider this or that to be poisonous or bad for the body.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>They are confined and threatened by everything.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Brothers and sisters, these are examples of being obsessed with our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Too many people love their own body too much.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>They cannot suffer at all, and they cannot bear to even approach those who are sick.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>They are bound by their body.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Paul said, I buffet my body and make it my slave 1 Cor 9:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He put his body under his subjection.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Failing to put one s body under one s subjection is a sin.</S>
