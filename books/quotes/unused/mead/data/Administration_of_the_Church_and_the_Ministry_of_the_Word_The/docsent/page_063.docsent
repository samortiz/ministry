   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE GROUND FOR THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the one hand, we need to see the building up of the church, and on the other hand, we need to see the main frustration to the building not having the proper ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the saints in Jerusalem were built together, they became the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Likewise, the saints in Ephesus were built up to be the church in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the ground of the church is a serious problem today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Taipei there are Baptist churches, Presbyterian churches, Lutheran churches, and other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Taipei has become a city of many churches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE GROUND OF THE BUILDING NOT DEPENDING ON THE MEASURE OF THE STATURE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to build up the church and pay attention to the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother T. Austin-Sparks thinks that the measure of the stature of Christ should be our criterion; that is, we should be able to join any group that has more Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Catholic Church accepts the Bible, recognizes the Trinity, and confesses that Christ Jesus is the Son of God who was born of the virgin Mary, was crucified on the cross, shed His blood for our redemption, resurrected from the dead, and ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These items are included in the orthodox belief of Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some of the believers in Catholicism are more pious than many of us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Should we then join the Catholics since they have Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Or should we go to another group that has more Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What standard should one use to determine the amount of Christ that there is in a group?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH IN</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>OUR BELIEF AND PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A Western brother who was affected by Brother Austin-Sparks has asked why we say that only we are the church and that others are not.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is also questioning the local administration of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I shared three points with him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We believe that the church is uniquely one in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We believe that the expression of the church in every city should also be one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The cities of Jerusalem, Antioch, and Corinth had only one expression, one church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We believe that any ground other than the local ground is sectarian and therefore should not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>SPIRITUAL REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>AND THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>BEING TWO SEPARATE MATTERS</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brother Austin-Sparks does not agree with the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He also condemns organized Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In our time of fellowship with Brother Austin-Sparks, a brother asked, If there are five independent groups in a city that have left organized Christianity, are any of these groups right or are they all wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brother Austin-Sparks replied that none of the groups were absolutely right, but that they were relatively right.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When asked what he meant by relatively right, he said, Each group should be measured according to the stature of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The group that has a greater measure of the stature of Christ is more right; the group that has a smaller measure of the stature of Christ is less right.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I was the translator at the time, but at this juncture I joined the discussion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I asked whether there is any Christ in Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I then said that we have received help from Madame Guyon in the matter of life and that Madame Guyon definitely had a stature of Christ, but Madame Guyon was in Catholicism, which we condemn.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should be clear that spirituality and the ground of the church are two different matters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Madame Guyon was spiritual, but she was not right in the matter of the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Dr. F. B. Meyer is highly recommended by Brother Austin-Sparks, but Dr. Meyer never left organized Christianity, which Brother Austin-Sparks condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Based on Dr. Meyer s spirituality and measure of Christ, should we say that organized Christianity is relatively correct? Andrew Murray is another spiritual giant who remained in organized Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, we cannot determine the ground of the church based on a person s spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God desired that His people stay in the land of Israel and take Jerusalem as the center in their worshipping Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Jerusalem was the ground for their worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After being captive in Babylon for seventy years, there was a call for them to return to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What would have happened if at that time a prophet rose up and said that it did not matter whether they returned to Jerusalem or stayed in Babylon, because only their spiritual stature mattered?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Daniel was the most spiritual among them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Using New Testament terms, Daniel was full of Christ, but such a Christ-filled, spiritual person remained in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those who returned to Jerusalem were not as spiritual as Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They had opinions and weaknesses, and some of them even married Gentile women.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Their spiritual condition was far inferior to that of Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, was Daniel s ground correct, or was the ground of those who were weak and unspiritual correct?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This shows that to be spiritual is one thing and that to have the proper ground of the church is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A person may be very spiritual but stand on the wrong ground.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Daniel s standing on the wrong ground was due to God s sovereign arrangement, not according to his own will.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although he was in Babylon, his heart was in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One day Brother Austin-Sparks asked what we mean by local ground.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I illustrated this with an example.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I drew a circle that represented the city of Jerusalem and said that all the believers in Jerusalem met in that circle; hence, it was called the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The city of Jerusalem is the ground of the church in Jerusalem; the church is in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then I drew another circle representing the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The church in Corinth was initially one, but the believers in Corinth became divided.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Those who were for Paul became a Pauline sect.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Suppose some in the Pauline sect moved to Samaria and declared that they belonged to Paul in Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They would be taking Paul as their ground instead of Samaria as their ground.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Initially, there was only one church in Corinth the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The city of Corinth was the ground of the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After they were divided, there were some of Paul, some of Apollos, some of Cephas, and some of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They lost the local ground.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Pauline sect took Paul as their ground, and the Apollonian sect took Apollos as their ground.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Suppose some brothers from the church in Jerusalem went to Samaria to meet with the brothers there only to discover that they belonged to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The brothers in Jerusalem could explain that the church cannot be of Paul, but those in Samaria would insist on being of Paul; thus, the brothers from Jerusalem would have no alternative but to meet apart from them in Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Although there would be two groups meeting in Samaria, one would be meeting on the local ground, and the other would be meeting on the ground of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is possible that those who were on the proper ground were fleshly and that those who were on the ground of Paul were spiritual, each group had a measure of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When other believers would go to Samaria, should they take the measure of Christ as the criterion and meet with the Pauline sect?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The next morning Brother Austin-Sparks spoke concerning Christ and said that we make Christ a small Christ and the church a small church by limiting everything to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I calmly translated for him even though I felt uncomfortable within.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This was a matter of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Two plus two equals four.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>How can two plus two equal five?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Brother Austin-Sparks also saw that we had come to an impasse, and he discontinued the fellowship meeting the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He said that he and another Western brother were satisfied with our replies and that there was no need to continue the discussion.</S>
