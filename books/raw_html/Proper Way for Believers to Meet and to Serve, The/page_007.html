        <h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING THE LORD JESUS<br />
AS THE SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Through Calling on the Name of the Lord</h2>
<p>Every believer has experienced calling on the Lord. We do not have to call loudly; we may also call softly. At night we may call softly so as not to disturb others. If we are in a convenient place, we may call with a loud voice. Our calling loudly is not for the Lord to hear us but for us to be released. A few days ago I had a cold, so the nurse taught me how to breathe deeply. In order to breathe deeply, we must use our diaphragm to inhale and to exhale. This is very beneficial. Calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name is spiritual deep breathing that enables us to receive spiritual help. A brother who has lost his job and is not able to pay his rent may pray silently, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! I am miserable. I cannot find a job or pay the rent. Please help me.&rdquo; This prayer is very good. I have frequently taught others to pray such a prayer. The Lord answers such prayers. However, the brother may not feel comforted afterward, because he did not meet the Lord and therefore has no joy. But if he prays loudly, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! I am really miserable! I have lost my job, and I cannot pay my rent. Don&rsquo;t You care, Lord Jesus? O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Afterward, he will shed tears. When he prays in such a loud way, not only will the Lord hear him; he will be released, his sorrow will be turned into joy, and he will enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s supply and consolation.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the Lord does not answer our silent prayers. As those who belong to Him, He knows that we have a problem even before we pray (Isa. 65:24). Therefore, in a sense, our prayer is unnecessary. The Lord said that we should not be anxious about what we will eat, what we will drink, or with what we will be clothed, for all these things the Gentiles are anxiously seeking. But our heavenly Father knows that we need all these things; hence, we need to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness (Matt. 6:31-33). Normally, we do not think about His kingdom, nor are we concerned about His kingdom or His righteousness, but the Lord wants us to be concerned. Not only should we be concerned; we need to seek our Father&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness. When He answers our prayer by giving us His kingdom and His righteousness, He also gives us something more, something supplemental&mdash;what we will eat and what we will drink&mdash;without our asking. This can be compared to buying a huge item in a store and receiving a free gift from the storeowner. From this perspective, we do not need to pray for our daily necessities.</p>
<p>However, we still need to pray for ourselves. I have experienced being in distress and having nowhere to turn, yet I called, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! I really thank You that You are with me.&rdquo; Immediately, the Lord was with me. If we do not call on the Lord and pray to Him, we will not have inward peace. But once we call and pray, we will have peace and joy, even if the problem is still with us. Therefore, calling loudly is for our sake, not for His.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by calling loudly we shut the devil&rsquo;s mouth. If we are not willing to call and pray, Satan will bother us and rule over our thoughts. At such a time we simply need to call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; and chase the devil away! Hence, when we call on the Lord loudly, we are experiencing deep spiritual breathing, which enables us not only to touch and gain the Lord but also to be cleansed, to shut the devil&rsquo;s mouth, and to have inner peace and joy.</p>
<p>Our Lord is not a doctrine, nor is He a religion; He is not knowledge, facts, or explanations. The purpose of doctrinal expositions and revelations of truth in the Scriptures is to show us a living person&mdash;Jesus Christ, the Lord of heaven and earth, the origin of the universe, and the Creator of all things. He became a man, died, was resurrected, and became the life-giving Spirit. He is waiting to be received by us. We should never think that it is difficult to believe in Jesus. On the contrary, it is easy to believe in Jesus because He is God, the Savior, and the Spirit. His name is Jesus. The Bible says that He is &ldquo;rich to all who call upon Him; for &lsquo;whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&rsquo;&rdquo; (Rom. 10:12-13). It may seem as if we cannot meet or touch the Lord, but we know His name. There is a name in the universe that is unique. History shows that the name of Jesus is extraordinary. Whenever we call on His name, we are richly supplied.</p>
<p>I know for a fact that many people who did not believe in the Lord after hearing the gospel were touched in their conscience on their deathbed; they felt that during their life they had done many wrong things toward their parents, spouse, children, relatives, and friends. Then before they breathed their last breath, they would recall the gospel that they had heard many years prior, call on the name of Jesus, and be saved. As believers, we can also testify that we often call on the name of Jesus and that as often as we call this name, He comes to us as the life-giving Spirit to give us life.</p>
<p>Many of us can testify that whenever we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we are refreshed inwardly and filled with joy. When we feel lonely or homesick and call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we experience Him as our Companion. Regardless of how intimate a person is to us, he can never be so intimate that he enters into us. But whenever I call on the Lord, I immediately sense that He is in me. Whether or not I call, He is still in me. But without calling on Him, I do not sense His presence. As soon as I call, I sense His presence. We can call on Him at any time. We are not bothering Him. We sense His presence the moment we call &ldquo;Lord Jesus!&rdquo; When we do not call, we may feel quite lonely, but once we call, we have a Companion. Even when we feel miserable, our misery will disappear when we call on His name, and we will be joyful.</p>
<p>Paul says that we need to be sober-minded before others (2 Cor. 5:13). For this reason, I do not call on the Lord&rsquo;s name loudly in the presence of others. However, when I am alone in my bedroom, I call and leap with rejoicing. When I hear someone&rsquo;s footsteps, I am sober. Therefore, no one knows that I was praying, skipping, and leaping with joy. Many other believers have had similar experiences. When we are sad or grieved, having no peace or rest, we need to pray, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! You know that I am suffering; I have nowhere to turn. Lord, You are compassionate and sympathetic.&rdquo; Although we may doubt whether the Lord would answer such an informal prayer, we will immediately have peace and support, and we will also sense that He is bearing our pain.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
