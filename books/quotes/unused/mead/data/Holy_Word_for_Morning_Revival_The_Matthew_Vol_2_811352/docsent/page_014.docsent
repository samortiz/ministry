   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 11:2-6, 11</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>2 Now when John heard in the prison of the works of the Christ, he sent word through his disciples</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>3 And said to Him, Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>4 And Jesus answered and said to them, Go, report to John the things that you hear and see:</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>5 The blind receive their sight and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; and the dead are raised and the poor have the gospel announced to them;</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>6 And blessed is he who is not stumbled because of Me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>11 Truly I say to you, Among those born of women there has not arisen one greater than John the Baptist, yet he who is 1 least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John the Baptist's word here v. 3 does not mean that he was in doubt concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He questioned Christ in this way in order to provoke Him to deliver him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He knew that Christ was the Coming One, and he had strongly recommended Him to the people John 1:26-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After that, John was put into prison Matt 4:12 , where he waited, expecting that Christ would do something to deliver him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, Christ did nothing for him, although He did much to help others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When John heard of this it might have been that he was about to be stumbled v. 6 . Hence, he sent his disciples with such a question to provoke Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Lord's answer to John He mentioned the blind's receiving of sight, because there had been no such miracle in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By this He gave clear evidence to John that none other than the Messiah could have done such a miracle Isa 35:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the spiritual sense also, the blind's receiving of sight comes first.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Lord's salvation, first He opens our eyes Acts 26:18 ; then we can receive Him and walk to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The lame signify those who cannot walk in God's way.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The cleansed lepers signify those who have been saved from their rebellion leprosy to become the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The deaf signify those who cannot hear God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After being saved, they can hear the Lord's voice John 10:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The dead signify those who are dead in sins Eph 2:1, 5 , unable to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After being regenerated, they can fellowship with God by means of their regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The poor signify all who are without Christ and without God and who have no hope in the world Eph 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Upon receiving the gospel, they are made rich in Christ 2 Cor 8:9; Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Matthew 11:6 implies that John the Baptist might have been stumbled because the Lord did not act on his behalf according to his way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Lord's recovery we need to learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever the Lord does something positive for us, we are excited.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But many times the Lord will not do anything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The reason He did nothing to rescue John from prison was that if John had been released from prison his ministry would have been in competition with the Lord's ministry.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the prophets prior to John prophesied only that Christ was coming, but John testified that Christ had come.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The prophets were looking forward to Christ, but John saw Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, John was greater than all the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although John saw the incarnated Christ and introduced Him to people, he did not have the resurrected Christ indwelling him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The kingdom people do.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>John could say only, "Here is Christ," but the kingdom people can say, "To me, to live is Christ" Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, the least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.</S>
