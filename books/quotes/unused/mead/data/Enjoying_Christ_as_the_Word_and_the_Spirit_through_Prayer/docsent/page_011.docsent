   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR FURTHER ILLUSTRATIONS OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>READING THE WORD WITH PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prayer: Lord, under Your precious blood we come again to You.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We look to You for Your help.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, You know that in the proper practices we need the help in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>May we have the liberty and the encouragement to speak and to practice in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do help us to this effect.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We ask this in Your precious name.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>NOT MAKING A FORMAL PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>BUT SPEAKING TO THE LORD SPONTANEOUSLY</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The more we practice to exercise our spirit to pray with the word we read, the more we will be adjusted and learn how to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This kind of reading will become spontaneous to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is no need to understand what we read and then make a formal prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We simply need to read something and speak to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At first, some may need to close their eyes when they pray, but after a certain amount of practice, they will become more inward and able to pray in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At a certain point we will be able to read and pray with John 15:10, for example.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This verse says, If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; even as I have kept My Father s commandments and abide in His love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may speak to the Lord in a spontaneous way, Lord, not only are You Yourself life, but even Your commandment is eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I do not take Your commandment merely like the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I take Your commandment as life, because Your commandment is You Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Lord, You told us clearly that without You we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I take simply Your commandment as Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You are joy, and You are love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no need to make a formal prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may simply speak with the Lord in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we talk to the Lord in this way, we should not exercise our mind too much.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, we need to learn to exercise our spirit to open deeply from within and speak something to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need more practice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we start to practice to read and pray in this way, we will need to set aside some definite time each day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After we are more accustomed to this, however, we can do it throughout the entire day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The word will be familiar to us, and we will be able to turn any verse into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then each verse will become the Spirit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need more practice to become accustomed to this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>TURNING EVERY PASSAGE INTO PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>BY EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to read the Bible without exercising our choice.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should begin from Matthew 1:1 and simply continue to read in order.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One day we can read the first eight verses, and the next day we can continue from verse 9 and read another five or ten verses.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One morning we may come to Mark 4:3 to 6, which says, Listen!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Behold, the sower went out to sow.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>And as he sowed, some seed fell beside the way, and the birds came and devoured it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And other seed fell on the rocky place, where it did not have much earth, and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And when the sun rose, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can pray something simple without much doctrine and without ministering a message in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Spontaneously we may say, Lord, I praise You that You are the sower and You are the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>O Lord, You have sown Yourself into me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Oh, the seed!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You are the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sometimes we may repeat several times, O Lord, You are the wonderful seed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then we may come to our spouse and say, Dear wife, the Lord is the seed!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We can also turn to the enemy and say, Satan, do you not know that the Lord is the seed within me?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is a simple and living way to pray without many words.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes our prayers are too wordy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many words are piled together, but there is nothing of substance.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our prayer over Mark 4 can simply be: Lord, You are the living seed, the seed of life that has been sown into me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I praise You that by Your mercy I am not by the wayside.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am afraid, though, that I may have some stones.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>My heart may be the stony earth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Lord, show me the stones and take them away.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Grant that You may grow deeply within me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Such a prayer is living; it is not in the exercise of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have to exercise our spirit to say something to the Lord in a living way from deep within.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This requires our practice.</S>
