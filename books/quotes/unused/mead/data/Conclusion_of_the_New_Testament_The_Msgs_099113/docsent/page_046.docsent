   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With Christ as Their Shepherd, Who Laid Down His Soul Life for Them That They May Have the Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The sheep in the one flock have Christ as their Shepherd, who laid down His soul life for them that they may have the divine life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>11, 14-15, 16b, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 10 the Lord Jesus says, "I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And in verse 11 He says, "I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In these two verses two different Greek words are used for life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 10 the Greek word is zoe, which is the word used in the New Testament for the eternal, divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verse 11 the Greek word is psuche, the same word for soul, which means the soulish life, that is, the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These verses indicate that the Lord Jesus has two kinds of lives.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As a man the Lord has the psuche life, the human life, and as God He has the zoe life, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He laid down His soul, His psuche life, His human life, to accomplish redemption for His sheep vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>15, 17-18 that they may share His zoe life, His divine life v. 10 , the eternal life v. 28 , by which they may be formed into one flock under Himself as the one Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As the good Shepherd He feeds His sheep with the divine life in this way and for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord's divine life could not be slain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What was slain in His crucifixion was His human life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order to be our Savior, He, as a man, laid down His human life to accomplish redemption for us so that we may receive His zoe life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He laid down His human life in order that we, after being redeemed, might have His divine life, the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Shepherd, the divine life, and the human life are all for the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those in the flock are fallen ones in need of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a man the Shepherd had the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He sacrificed His human life in order to accomplish redemption for His flock.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way His flock was redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then His flock received His divine life, and by this divine life the sheep lived together as the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, the flock is formed into one unit, into one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is accomplished not by the human life but by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the human life we are condemned and divided; in the divine life we are accepted and united.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the divine life we all are one entity, meaning that we are one flock under one Shepherd in one life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, if we live by our human life, we are no longer sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A sheep is a regenerated person with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all must live by the divine life and thus become genuine, real, and pure sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we shall be in the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do not live by the divine life, there can be no flock, for the flock is produced, formed, and maintained by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the divine life we are truly one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is not possible in our human, psuche life; it is possible only in the divine, zoe life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now, as redeemed and regenerated ones, we are in the divine life under one Shepherd to be one flock.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>M. MANY GRAINS OF WHEAT</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The believers are also symbolized by many grains of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John 12:24 says, "Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The expression "much fruit" refers to many grains of wheat as the multiplication of the one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Produced out of the One Grain Christ</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 12:24 the Lord Jesus clearly refers to Himself, God incarnate, as the unique grain of wheat that falls into the ground and dies.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The believers as many grains of wheat are produced out of Christ as the one grain.</S>
