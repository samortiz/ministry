   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Bride and the Bridegroom</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With few exceptions, most Christians have read John 3.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, how many pay adequate attention to the word "bride" in verse 29?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this verse John the Baptist said, "He who has the bride is the bridegroom."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was a young Christian, I heard messages on Christ as our Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I was told that the Lord Jesus would come back as our Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But how poor it would be to have the Bridegroom without the bride!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Bible we have a universal couple the Bridegroom and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The bride is the aggregate of regenerated persons, and the Bridegroom is Christ with whom all regenerated persons should be one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ's Increase</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John 3:30 speaks of Christ's increase.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This increase is the multiplication and reproduction of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is important for us to know that the regenerated part of our being is the reproduction, the multiplication, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This increase of Christ is His bride.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Speaking in a general way, we may say that those who believe in Christ and who have been regenerated are the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, we need to study this matter thoroughly and ask what it is that makes us a part of Christ's increase.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our natural life and living are not part of the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, if you speak in a natural, joking manner, you are not living as part of Christ's increase.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the contrary, that way of speaking is part of the serpentine being, and the serpentine being cannot be part of Christ's bride, His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only the regenerated part of our being, our regenerated spirit, is Christ's increase.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John 3:6 says that that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Often we live and speak in a natural way according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But there is another part of our being, the regenerated being, the spiritual being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This regenerated part of our being is a part of Christ's increase.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Unlimited Christ</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 3:31-35 we see the unlimited Christ, the Christ who is all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The expression "the unlimited Christ" may be new to you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We shall define this in the next message.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Immeasurable Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 3:34 we have the immeasurable Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The immeasurable Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This Spirit is immeasurable in sphere and all-inclusive in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have listed eight matters in chapter three of John concerning which Christians have very little realization: the serpentine flesh, the brass serpent, the spirit, the bride, the Bridegroom, Christ's increase, the unlimited Christ, and the immeasurable Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although John 3 is often used by Christians for teaching and preaching, most believers do not give adequate attention to these eight matters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, we need to pay our attention to them and have an adequate realization concerning them.</S>
