   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE FULFILLMENT IN THE NEW TESTAMENT OF THE TYPOLOGY IN THE OLD TESTAMENT CONCERNING GOD'S ECONOMY 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter I want to continue to fellowship concerning the fulfillment in the New Testament of the typology in the Old Testament concerning God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The whole Bible unveils God's economy, which is for the accomplishment of His heart's desire for His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The center and the reality of God's economy is Christ and His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ISRAEL BEING A TYPE OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before the new testament age, that is, before the Lord's incarnation, God had chosen a people on this earth called Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This people of God's selection has a long history.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Their forefather was Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then by Moses' time at their exodus from Egypt, they became a race that had at least two million people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since then they have become a type of the church as God's elect in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the Old Testament has a people, and the New Testament has a people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Old Testament has Israel, and the New Testament has the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These two peoples do not represent two things God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These two peoples are a description of one thing which God has done, and this one thing is the accomplishment of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before God came to accomplish this economy, He first put out a type, a figure, a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In God's economy the people of Israel are just a type, a figure, a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They are not the real thing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Israel typifies the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I would like to present some verses from the New Testament to show that the people of Israel are a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 1 Corinthians 5 Paul said, "Our Passover, Christ, also has been sacrificed" v. 7b . After the descendants of Abraham became a people, they eventually became fallen into the hand of Egypt and its king, Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Pharaoh typifies Satan, and Egypt typifies the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that God's chosen people fell into the hand of Satan and Satan's world, so there was the need of God's salvation to save them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's salvation must first be judicial.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God cannot come to save us nonsensically.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because God has to carry out His salvation judicially, there was a need of redemption for God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Exodus we see two things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, there is redemption, and then immediately following redemption, there is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Redemption is to redeem God's fallen people back to God, and salvation is God's saving His people out of the hand of Satan, out of the world, and eventually, even out of themselves for God to come in to make them the same as God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>So in Exodus we see that first a lamb was slain and the shed blood was sprinkled on the houses of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That was called the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that God, the just God, the righteous God, formed something judicial to redeem His people by fulfilling His righteous requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That was God's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then immediately following that redemption, God exercised His salvation to save Israel out of Pharaoh's hand, out of Egypt, and bring them into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the wilderness God came to be a tabernacle, indicating how He would come to dwell with His people to save them further and further that they might become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul said in 1 Corinthians 5 that our Passover is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ became our Redeemer to accomplish a passover by which God could pass over us, having our sin judged and dealt with by Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First Corinthians 5 also says that following the Passover Israel had the Feast of Unleavened Bread v. 8 . After God's redemption and in God's salvation, God ordained that His people should have no sin, no leaven, a feast without leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the beginning of the history of Israel, and this beginning was fulfilled by the church's experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By this you can see that with Israel it was a type.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>With the church it is a fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At the end of the New Testament, the Lord Jesus called the degraded church, Jezebel Rev 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Jezebel was an evil woman as a wife to that evil king, Ahab 1 Kings 16:31; 19:1-2; 21:23, 25-26; 2 Kings 9:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>She did many demonic things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She was a type of the church becoming degraded and fallen absolutely into Satan's hand and even mingled with Satan as one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The fallen church became Jezebel and is called the Great Babylon, the mystery Rev 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, the outcome of the church is the same as that of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Israel's outcome was to be captured to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Eventually, they became Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Revelation 17 the Lord called the degraded church the great whore, the Great Babylon, the mother of harlots vv.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>1, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This shows that the church is a fulfillment of the type of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>So the entire history of Israel is a type of the church.</S>
