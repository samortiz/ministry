   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. A Spring Cannot Gush Out Two Types of Water</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What follows is clear and obvious.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One cannot bless God with his tongue and use the same tongue to curse the man created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He cannot bless on the one hand and curse on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A spring cannot gush out two types of water.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A fig tree cannot produce olives, nor can a vine produce figs.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Salt water cannot produce sweet water.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The fruit reveals the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The water reveals the spring.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A person whom God uses surely produces sweet water; there should not be any bitter taste to his words.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's way of salvation today is to install a new spring and a new tree in us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If I am a fig tree, I will surely not produce olives.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If I am a vine, I will surely not produce figs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If God gives me something new, if He places a new life in me, surely I will produce sweet water.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>PAYING ATTENTION TO LISTENING</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In addressing the matter of speaking, we must not neglect the matter of listening.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A. Resisting an Itching Ear</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let me speak a frank word to all of you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many improper words in the church would disappear if all the brothers and sisters learned the lesson of listening.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church has so many improper words because there are many brothers and sisters who want to listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is the demand; therefore, there is the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are so many defiling words, criticisms, evil speakings, slanders, double-tongued speakings, because many people want to hear them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man's heart is deceitful, wicked, and defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because the heart wants to hear these words, someone is always ready to speak them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If God's children know the kinds of words they can and cannot speak, they will know the kinds of words they can and cannot hear.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One brother put it aptly when he said, "Many people's ears are like trash cans."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Does anyone ever dump trash into a rice pot?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one would do such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you accept all kinds of lecherous words and do not consider them harmful, clearly you are a trash can; that is the kind of person you are.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only a certain kind of person will listen to certain kinds of words.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must learn to listen to healthy words.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not be led away by those who spread rumors and improper words.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must say, "I do not want to listen to these things."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many sins will cease and many brothers will be edified if you do this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is a lust among us for unhealthy words.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is why these words multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>People find these words tasteful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must be delivered from these things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If a person is saying something improper to you, perhaps you should walk away quietly and leave the speaker to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This will kill his interest in you the next time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Alternatively, we also can testify to him saying, "As Christians we should not speak such words."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This will stop any further speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may even say something stronger, such as, "Brother!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What do you think I am?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I am not a trash can.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Please do not dump all this trash on me."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many problems in the church are like Gehenna fire; they need to be quenched as soon as they catch fire.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must not allow them to spread.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many troubles related to words are actually troubles related to listening.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The speaker, of course, bears a greater part of the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But the listener also bears a small part of the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The listener must learn before God to reject this lust for words.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Man has a lust for words; he has a lust to know everything.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we can reject this lust, we will quench much fire from Gehenna.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should say, "I am sorry.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am a Christian, and I cannot take such words."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We will cut short the words of others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we keep on listening, hoping to learn a little more and to probe a little more, we are fanning the flame, not extinguishing it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many idle, evil, and deceptive words are prompted by the interest of the listeners.</S>
