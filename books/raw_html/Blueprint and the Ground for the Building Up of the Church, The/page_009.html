         <h2 class="head1">THE PRIESTLY SERVICE&mdash;<br />
BEING BUILT UP AND BUILDING</h2>
<p>Through these pictures in the Old Testament, the Lord shows us two sides of one matter. One aspect of our work is to be built up, and another aspect is to build. We are building by being built up. This is to genuinely serve God as priests. Some may think that to serve God is to do the work of God and to live for God. This is the general understanding in Christianity. However, to serve God as a priest is to build the temple of God, which also is to be built up. We are proper priests carrying out the genuine building work only when we are genuinely built up. We cannot separate the priestly service from building. A believer who serves as a priest apart from the temple of God has an improper priesthood. Any priestly service that is separated from the building, that is, from the temple of God as the ground for the priestly service, is improper. This is a tremendous light that we must see: our priesthood must be in the building and for the building. For us to serve as priests is for us to build.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:5 says that the proper service cannot be apart from the building. When we are built up as a spiritual house, we become a priesthood. <em>To offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God</em> refers to our work. When we are built up into a priesthood, we can have work that is acceptable to God. For centuries those who love God have known that they should serve God. But few believers have seen that the basic matter of serving God depends on being built up. If we are not built up as the spiritual house of God, there will be no priesthood. The priesthood is based on the building. When God&rsquo;s children begin to love God, they are very willing to serve God. However, they neglect the matter of being built up. Once a person becomes zealous, he wants to serve, but God speaks of being built up into a spiritual house as the basic condition for service. We cannot serve if we are not built up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVING IN A CORPORATE PRIESTHOOD,<br />
NOT ALONE</h2>
<p>We can see from the picture presented in the Bible that building involves coordination. For a Levite to be a priest, zeal was not enough; he also had to be coordinated in the priestly divisions. This is a type of passing through the process of being built up in the building and habitation of God. The habitation of God is the priesthood; the two are one. We need to be built into and coordinated into the building. Then we will have the proper ground to serve. We are not individuals who serve alone; we serve in a corporate body, the priesthood.</p>
<p>Whether in the service according to the pattern revealed in Exodus 25, which is the Old Testament priestly service, or in the New Testament apostolic service, there is no individual service. Some may say that in Acts Philip served alone. However, a careful reading of Acts 8 shows that Philip was not doing a work by himself. Philip seemed to be led to do a work by himself; however, Philip was actually in a corporate body. Verses 4 through 13 speak of Philip&rsquo;s preaching in Samaria, and verses 14 through 25 speak of the confirmation by the apostles.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament service, only one priest went into the temple to burn incense, but the burning of incense was the responsibility of the priesthood. Similarly, Philip&rsquo;s work was within the service of a corporate entity. He was led to go alone but was joined to the corporate entity. There are no incidents in the Scriptures of individual service, either in the Old Testament or in the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVICE ACCORDING TO THE BLUEPRINT</h2>
<p>The kind of work that God wants on the earth today is consistent in both the Old Testament and the New Testament. He wants to build a habitation for Himself. The Tent of Meeting that the children of Israel built in the wilderness was an initial work. The tabernacle had three sections. The outer court contained the altar, the laver, and the hangings. In the Holy Place there were the table of the bread of the Presence, the golden lampstand, and the golden incense altar. The innermost section, the Holy of Holies, had the Ark. This was the building work of the tabernacle. The building of the temple occurred at the time of fullness after the children of Israel entered into the good land. The same furnishings were still present in the temple, but the temple was stabilized and enlarged with materials such as valuable stones, cedar, cypress, and olive wood (1 Kings 6:7, 15-16, 23).</p>
<p>The principle involved in building the tabernacle and the temple was the same: the building was done according to the blueprint given by God, and it was linked to the service of the priesthood. This shows that our service cannot be lacking in these two things. We must have the full vision of what God wants on the earth, and under this vision, those in the service need to be built together as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood. On the one hand, we need a full vision of what God wants. On the other hand, we need to be built together with those in the service into a spiritual house and a holy priesthood to carry out this vision.</p>

            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
