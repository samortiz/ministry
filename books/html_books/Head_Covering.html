<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 11:2-16</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will cover an important subject&mdash;head covering.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 11:2-16 does not speak of believers as brothers and sisters; rather, it speaks of them as men and women. It does not speak about our status in Christ, but rather of God&rsquo;s order in His creation.</p>
<p>This passage does not echo the thought in John 10:30, which says, &ldquo;I and the Father are one.&rdquo; Rather, it says that God is the Head of Christ. It does not emphasize the relationship between the Father and the Son, but the relationship between God and Christ, between God and His Anointed. It is not a relationship between God the Father and God the Son in the Trinity of the Godhead, but a relationship between God and the One whom He sent to earth and anointed to be the Christ. The matter of head covering is an issue between God and His Anointed.</p>
<p>Neither does the matter of head covering have anything to do with the relationship between Christ and His church. The fact that Christ is the Head and the church is His Body is unrelated to head covering. The matter of head covering involves a totally different issue. First Corinthians 11:3 says that &ldquo;Christ is the head of <em>every man.</em>&rdquo; Christ is the Head of individual men. Although there are many men, Christ is the Head of them all. His being the Head does not refer to His headship in the church. His headship in this passage refers to His headship over every man. Hence, the subject here has nothing to do with the relationship between Christ and the church. It has to do with the relationship between Christ and every man. Thus, it does not refer to a relationship among God&rsquo;s children or to a relationship between brothers and sisters. Verse 3 says that &ldquo;<em>man</em> is the head of the <em>woman.</em>&rdquo; We must be clear about this foundation before we can understand the meaning of head covering.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. TWO SYSTEMS OF GOD<br />
IN THE UNIVERSE</h2>
<p>I would like to consider this subject from a much broader perspective. This will help us to understand 1 Corinthians 11. Only those who know God and who are familiar with the Bible will understand this chapter. This chapter can be difficult reading for many people. The first thing we have to know is that God has two systems in this universe: One we call the system of grace, and the other we call the system of government.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The System of Grace</h2>
<p>The church, our salvation, the brother-sister relationship in the Lord, and our being God&rsquo;s children&mdash;these are all items within the system of God&rsquo;s grace. Everything related to the church, the Holy Spirit, and redemption belongs to the system of grace. The centurion and the Syrophoenician woman both received grace from God. Peter received grace, and so did Mary. Lazarus could be resurrected, and Martha and Mary could serve. In the system of grace, man and woman are placed on equal footing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The System of Government</h2>
<p>There is another system in the Bible which we call God&rsquo;s government. This system of government is altogether different from the system of grace. The system of God&rsquo;s government is separate from the system of grace; it is another system altogether. In this system, God operates according to His own pleasure.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Creation of Male and Female</h2>
<p>In His creation, God created both male and female. This distinction is related to God&rsquo;s government. He first created the man and then the woman. This order was also a matter of God&rsquo;s government. God operates according to His own pleasure. He has an independent will. He ordained that human beings would come out of the woman. Even the Lord Jesus was born of a woman. This was related to God&rsquo;s government. No one can argue with God in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Man&rsquo;s Food</h2>
<p>In the garden of Eden, man was given fruit for food. This was God&rsquo;s government. After the flood man was given meat for food. This was God&rsquo;s government as well.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Confounding the Language</h2>
<p>In the beginning there was only one language for all men. But after man built the tower of Babel to demonstrate the united power of man, God confounded human language at Babel so that men would no longer speak the same language. This was God&rsquo;s government. Later, when God poured out His Spirit at the time of Pentecost, the believers who were present began to speak in tongues. This also was related to God&rsquo;s government.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Scattered as Many Peoples</h2>
<p>At the time of the tower of Babel, the people on earth were divided into many &ldquo;peoples.&rdquo; These &ldquo;peoples&rdquo; signify races, not nations. This also was a matter of God&rsquo;s government. Later, God chose from so many peoples a unique people&mdash;the nation of Israel, who would belong to Him. This was grace. But the separation of mankind into peoples was a matter of government.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. The Beginning of Nations</h2>
<p>After a time these many peoples became many nations. The history of the Bible tells us that the beginning of the nations came after the beginning of peoples. First there were the races and then the nations. Every nation had its own king. This also was something established by God&rsquo;s government and under God&rsquo;s government.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Israel Becoming a Nation</h2>
<p>At the time of the judges, the Israelites were still a race; they had not yet become a nation. By the time of Samuel, they were still a race among other races, because there was no king over them. One day the people of Israel wanted a king like the other races; they asked to be transferred from the sphere of grace to the sphere of government. They wanted a king like other nations. God warned them by showing them how a king would reign over them (1 Sam. 8:9-18).</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. Saul Becoming King</h2>
<p>Later, God chose Saul to be their king. As soon as Saul was chosen, God&rsquo;s system of government was introduced among the people of Israel. This does not mean that God&rsquo;s grace ceased; rather, it means that the Israelites explicitly placed themselves under His government. They could no longer rebel against their anointed at will, because the anointed one had become their king. Even after Saul departed from God in the realm of grace, he remained a king in the realm of God&rsquo;s government. We must identify the two different systems here before we can understand the two different situations Saul was under. In terms of grace Saul had fallen, but in terms of God&rsquo;s government he was still a king. This is why David could not rebel against God&rsquo;s ordained authority.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE SYSTEM OF GRACE PERFECTING THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT</h2>
<p>This situation continued until the time of the Lord Jesus. We see both aspects of God&rsquo;s work being present at the same time. The system of God&rsquo;s grace continued to operate in the world. At the same time, the system of His government also operated. The priests and the prophets belonged to the side of grace; they maintained the system of grace. The kings and the leaders of the Israelites belonged to the side of God&rsquo;s government; they maintained the system of God&rsquo;s government.</p>
<p>On the one hand, when the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was the Savior to deliver men from sin. This was His work under the system of grace. On the other hand, God&rsquo;s desire is for the Lord Jesus to establish His authority and heavenly kingdom through the work of the cross, with the result that heaven&rsquo;s reign will be brought to the earth. God is continually working to destroy the power of the devil, to bring in the kingdom of the heavens, and to usher in the new heaven and the new earth. On that day grace and government will unite to become one system. This means that in the new heaven and the new earth, the system of grace and the system of government will join together and become one system. Then both systems will be united in the Lord Jesus. He stands for both aspects of God&rsquo;s work. On the one hand, He works on the basis of the system of grace. On the other hand, He works on the basis of the system of government.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s government did not begin with His creation of man; it began when He created the angels. This is clearly revealed in the Bible. When Satan was still the morning star reigning over the world, a system of government was already in place. After man was created, many things, such as marriage, the husband-wife relationship, family relationships, and the parent-child relationship, became things within the system of God&rsquo;s government. These basic institutions were established by God according to His system of government.</p>
<p>I would like to point something out to the brothers and sisters. Those who are saved in this age must learn the fundamental lesson of not frustrating God&rsquo;s government with His grace. I need to repeat this word in an emphatic way: Do not frustrate God&rsquo;s order in His government with the grace that He dispenses to you. God&rsquo;s intention is that man would respect His government; He has no intention for man to annul His government. If you are oblivious to God&rsquo;s government, you are lawless in the eyes of God; you are totally ignorant of the fact that, in addition to the church, there is also the kingdom. You must see the system of government. The system of grace perfects the system of government. The system of government is not for the system of grace; rather, the system of grace is here to perfect the system of government.</p>
<p>Many people have a fundamentally wrong concept. They think that they can put aside government with grace. This is foolish. One cannot change God&rsquo;s government with His work in grace. The forgiveness we obtained before God in grace cannot replace His governmental forgiveness. No matter how much forgiveness we have received in grace, it will not replace governmental forgiveness.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s government works on a totally different principle! From the very beginning, God has been trying to usher in His governmental system. He will continue this work until the very end. Grace always goes along with government. Because man fought and rebelled against the system of government, the system of grace was brought in. The system of grace brings us to salvation and restoration so that we will obey God&rsquo;s system of government. Grace is given to supplement God&rsquo;s system of government.</p><h2 class="head1">III. LEARNING TO ACKNOWLEDGE GOD&rsquo;S GOVERNMENT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Adam Being<br />
Cast Out of the Garden of Eden</h2>
<p>Recall how Adam sinned. After God prepared the garden of Eden, He created Adam and Eve and charged them to guard the garden. The garden of Eden was committed entirely to them. Eden means happiness, and they lived in this happy garden. But both of them sinned. After they sinned, God gave them a promise that a Savior, the seed of the woman, would come. Though there was the promise of redemption, Adam and Eve were cast out of the garden of Eden. Here we see the grace of the Lord manifested through the promise of redemption. Yet this does not annul God&rsquo;s governmental action of casting them out.</p>
<p>God not only cast them out of the garden of Eden; He also guarded the garden with cherubim so that Adam and Eve could not go back. This was God&rsquo;s government. God&rsquo;s government and grace are two different things. Grace gave man the promise of a Savior, whereas government drove man out of the garden of Eden. From that day forward, man could no longer return to the garden of Eden. This is quite clear.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Israelites Being Barred<br />
from Entering Canaan</h2>
<p>When the Israelites reached Kadesh-barnea, they refused to enter Canaan. As a result, God barred them from entering the good land. The Israelites regretted this and wanted to go in by themselves. Many of them were killed by the Canaanites in one day. They wept and cried, but God would not let them enter the land (Num. 13&mdash;14). Once they refused to enter, they could no longer enter in. God&rsquo;s government would not allow them to do as they pleased. God has His government.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Moses <br />
Not Being Allowed<br />
to Enter Canaan</h2>
<p>Moses struck the rock with his rod two times and did not sanctify Jehovah. As a result, he could not enter into Canaan (Num. 20:7-12). Although God was merciful to him and brought him to the mount of Pisgah, he could not join the people of God in entering Canaan. Although he could see the land of Canaan with God on the mount of Pisgah, he could not enter it (Deut. 34). God&rsquo;s grace allowed him to see the boundary of the land, but God&rsquo;s government forbade him from entering the land.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Sword Not Departing<br />
from the Household of David</h2>
<p>When David sinned, God was gracious and merciful to him and forgave him of his sins. God was so gracious that He even granted David a special fellowship after that incident. But the sword never departed from his household (2 Sam. 12:7-14). This was God&rsquo;s government.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Paul&rsquo;s Separation from Barnabas</h2>
<p>Barnabas separated from Paul because of Mark (Acts 15:37-39). Mark was a relative of Barnabas (Col. 4:10). He disagreed and disobeyed along the way, but Barnabas still wanted to bring him along. Obviously, this decision was motivated by his kinship relationship. Barnabas then departed from Paul and took Mark to Cyprus (Cyprus being their home). Here we see the influence of a fleshly relationship at work. I admit that Barnabas still might have been used by God in some way after this; he still might have done a good job later. But from that point forward, the Holy Spirit erased his name from the Bible. His name was still in the book of life, but it was no longer in the book of Acts. This is God&rsquo;s government. God&rsquo;s government does not allow anyone to take his own way!</p>
<p>The system of grace is one thing. The system of government is another. The more humble a person is, the more experienced he will be in the system of God&rsquo;s government. Never think that you can annul God&rsquo;s system of government just because you are under the system of His grace.</p>
<p>Grace never annuls government. In fact, grace makes a person yield to government. I say this solemnly: Grace gives us the ability to subject ourselves to government. Grace does not make us rebels; it does not help us overturn government. These two systems of God mutually perfect one another. Grace cannot annul government. Only foolish ones will say, &ldquo;Since I have received grace, I can behave loosely and do things carelessly.&rdquo; This is the work of a foolish man!</p>
<p>The more a person&rsquo;s eyes are opened to grace, the more he will behave as a proper servant (if he is a servant) or a proper master (if he is a master). Similarly, the more a person&rsquo;s eyes are opened to grace, the more he will know how to be a husband, a parent, a son, and a citizen, and the more he will find himself in subjection to authority. The more a person receives grace from God, the more he will know how to maintain God&rsquo;s government. I have never seen a person who truly knows the grace of God destroy His government.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. HEAD COVERING BEING RELATED TO GOD&rsquo;S GOVERNMENT</h2>
<p>The matter of head covering is related to God&rsquo;s government. I cannot persuade you to cover your head if you do not know anything about God&rsquo;s government. If you do not know the meaning of God&rsquo;s government, you will not know the significance of head covering! Once you see God&rsquo;s government and see that such a system of divine government is revealed in the Word, you will realize that head covering has much to do with this government.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 11:2-3 says, &ldquo;But I praise you because in all things you have remembered me and hold fast the things that I have handed down even as I handed them down to you. But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ.&rdquo; This is God&rsquo;s government.</p>
<p>These verses do not say anything about the relationship between the Father and the Son; that is a relationship in the Godhead. They speak of the relationship between God and Christ. To borrow a modern term, we can say that Christ is God&rsquo;s deputy. In ministry and in God&rsquo;s order and government, God and Christ are separate: God is God and Christ is Christ. Christ was the One sent by God. John 17:3 says, &ldquo;That they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ.&rdquo; God is God, and the Lord Jesus is the Christ sent by God. This distinction between God and Christ has to do with God&rsquo;s government. Christ was originally equal with God, but He was willing to be the Christ and to be sent. God remains God high above, while Christ was sent to do God&rsquo;s work. This is the first thing related to God&rsquo;s government.</p>
<p>What is God&rsquo;s goal? His goal is to appoint Christ as the Head so that every man would submit to Him. Christ is the firstfruits among all creation. He was the first One created by God. [Editor&rsquo;s note: This refers to His humanity only.] Therefore, He is the Head of every man, and all men must be subject to Him. This is a basic principle in God&rsquo;s government. Christ is the Head of every man. This is not something in the system of grace but something in the system of God&rsquo;s government. Likewise, for man to be the head of the woman is also something in the system of God&rsquo;s government. In His government God appoints man to be the head, just as He appoints Christ to be the Head and He appoints Himself to be the Head. All these arrangements have to do with God&rsquo;s system as a whole.</p>
<p>God Himself is the Head. He also appoints Christ to be the Head. Moreover, He appoints man to be the head. These are three great principles in God&rsquo;s government.</p>
<p>God is the Head of Christ. This has nothing to do with whether God is greater or Christ is greater. It means that God is the Head of Christ in His government. Similarly, Christ is the Head of every man in God&rsquo;s government, and man is the head of the woman in God&rsquo;s government. This is God&rsquo;s appointment and ordination.</p>
<p>Philippians 2 is very clear concerning this. The Lord Jesus is equal with God in His very essence. But He is the Christ in God&rsquo;s government. Since He is the Christ, God is His Head. In the Gospel of John, the Lord said that He did only what He saw the Father doing (5:19). He did not come to do His own will but the will of the One who sent Him (6:38). It is as if He were saying, &ldquo;I am just the Christ, the One who was sent. I dare not speak by Myself. What I hear, these things I speak. I do nothing from Myself, but what I see, I do&rdquo; (cf. 8:26, 28). He spoke these words on the ground of God&rsquo;s government. God&rsquo;s ordination is for God to be God, and for Him to be the Christ. As such He must obey God. As far as their intrinsic persons are concerned, God the Son is equal with God the Father; they are of equal stature and deserve the same honor. As such, God the Son does not have to obey God the Father. However, in terms of God&rsquo;s government, Christ did not stand in the position of God the Son, but in the position of the Christ, the One sent by God.</p>
<p>One day God&rsquo;s government will be known by all. The whole world will know that Christ is the Head. This is God&rsquo;s ordination in His government. Christ will be the Head of every man. But today only the church knows this; the world does not know this. One day the whole world will know that Christ is the Head, the first One of all creation. He is the firstfruits of all creation. All created beings will come under the authority of Christ. In the same principle, only the church knows that God has ordained man to be the head of the woman. Do you see the point? Today only the church knows that Christ is the Head of every man. In the same way, only the church knows that man is the head of the woman.</p>
<p>We have seen that grace can never overturn God&rsquo;s government. I think the lessons we have learned are becoming clearer and clearer to us. Grace supports God&rsquo;s government; it does not destroy it. No one can be so foolish as to utilize God&rsquo;s grace to go against His government. No one can offend God&rsquo;s government! God&rsquo;s hand continually upholds His government. Today a man cannot overturn his father&rsquo;s authority just because he has believed in the Lord. He cannot overturn his master&rsquo;s authority or the government&rsquo;s authority just because he has believed in the Lord. A man cannot say, &ldquo;I do not have to pay taxes because I am a Christian. I do not have to pay duties.&rdquo; There is no such thing! The fact that you are a Christian makes it more necessary for you to maintain God&rsquo;s government.</p>
<p>Today we live in the world to maintain His testimony. The Lord has shown us three kinds of heads: God is the Head, Christ is the Head, and man is the head. This is altogether not an issue between the brothers and the sisters. It is basically a matter of government, not a matter of grace. Grace calls us brothers and sisters, but God has another arrangement which has to do with His government. This is God&rsquo;s will, His unique heart&rsquo;s desire. God ordains that He would be the Head, and that Christ would be the One under Him. He also ordains that Christ would be the Head and that everyone would submit to Christ. Now He further ordains that man would be the head and that the woman should have the sign of submission.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE MEANING OF HEAD COVERING</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 11:4-5 says, &ldquo;Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraces his head. But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head; for it is one and the same as she who is shaved.&rdquo; Let us now find out the meaning of head covering.</p>
<p>The significance of head covering is that one puts himself under God&rsquo;s government; he acknowledges this position. He would never annul God&rsquo;s government just because he has received His grace. He would not even allow such a thought to come into him. He would, on the contrary, acknowledge God&rsquo;s government. Just as Christ accepted God as His Head, so also every man should accept Christ as his Head. In like manner, the woman should accept the man as her representative head. Head covering means that one covers his head as if he had no head.</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that, in practice, only the woman is required to cover her head. In reality, Christ&rsquo;s head is covered before God, and every man&rsquo;s head is covered before Christ. But in practice God requires only that the woman cover her head before the man. This is a marvelous thing! It expresses a profound principle. The whole matter is not trivial by any means.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel that I do not have the liberty to speak to some saints about the matter of head covering because they have no idea about God&rsquo;s government. You must first understand what God&rsquo;s government is before you can understand head covering. Since Christ has His head covered before God, I also have my head covered before Him. I have covered my head; it is no longer exposed. God is now my Head. Actually, God wants every man to cover his head. Christ is our only Head. Our head should not be exposed; it must be removed from sight.</p>
<p>Here, I will say a word to Christian women: God has ordained the man to be the head of the woman. In this day of ignorance concerning God&rsquo;s authority, God only requires the church to observe this. The matter of head covering now becomes a question of whether or not one is a Christian. In the church God requires every Christian to acknowledge His ordained system of government.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE RESPONSIBILITY<br />
OF THE SISTERS</h2>
<p>For the sisters to cover their heads means that they take the position Christ takes before God and the position every man takes before Christ. God&rsquo;s intention is for women to cover their heads as an expression of His government on earth. He asks only the women to cover their heads. A woman does not cover her head for her own sake but for the sake of representation. There are many things which one does for himself, but there are also many things which one does as a representative of the whole group. A woman covers her head for herself, because she is a woman. She also covers her head as a representative, because she represents every man, and she also represents Christ. A woman represents every man before Christ. She also represents Christ before God. The woman&rsquo;s covering before God is equal to Christ&rsquo;s covering before God. In the same way, the woman&rsquo;s covering before Christ is equal to every man&rsquo;s covering before Christ.</p>
<p>No one should assume any headship before Christ. Everyone should cover his head and let Christ be the Head. If one does not cover his head, there will be two heads before Christ. When there are two heads, one should be covered. Between God and Christ, one head has to be covered. Likewise, between the man and the woman, one head must be covered. Between Christ and every man, one head must be covered. Without the covering, there will be two heads. There must not be two heads in God&rsquo;s government. If God is the head, Christ cannot be the head. If Christ is the head, man cannot be the head. If man is the head, the woman cannot be the head.</p>
<p>God is asking the sisters to be representatives. The sisters are responsible for the sign of submission on their head. This expresses God&rsquo;s system of government. In particular, God ordains that the woman should cover her head while praying or prophesying. The reason for this is that she should know God&rsquo;s government when she goes to God. Whether she prophesies before men for God or prays before God for men, whether it be prayer, prophecy, going out for God, or going to God, she must conduct these God-related activities by covering her head. This is for the purpose of expressing God&rsquo;s government.</p>
<p>Man is not allowed to cover his head. A man disgraces his own head if he covers his head before a woman. Man represents Christ. If a man covers his head, he is, in effect, saying that no man should cover his head before Christ, and that Christ should cover His head before men.</p><h2 class="head1">VII. A SIGN OF SUBMISSION<br />
TO AUTHORITY<br />
FOR THE SAKE OF THE ANGELS</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 11:6 says, &ldquo;For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off; but if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered.&rdquo; In other words, God is telling the sisters that they should be absolute in everything that they do.</p>
<p>No one can leave her head uncovered yet at the same time keep her hair. If a woman is not covered, her hair should be cut off or shaved. If you feel that it is shameful to have your hair cut off or shaved, you should cover your head. This is what Paul means. A woman should cut off or shave her hair if she does not want to be covered. If a woman thinks that it is shameful to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered. She must be absolute one way or the other and not do anything halfway.</p>
<p>Verse 7 says, &ldquo;For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is God&rsquo;s image and glory.&rdquo; A man represents God&rsquo;s image and glory. He should not have his head covered. &ldquo;But the woman is the glory of the man.&rdquo; This is why a woman should have her head covered. A woman cannot express the headship of the man if she does not cover her head.</p>
<p>Verses 8 and 9 are quite clear. Both speak of government. This is why I say that a person might as well forget 1 Corinthians 11 if he does not understand the matter of government. Verse 8 says, &ldquo;For man is not out of woman, but woman out of man.&rdquo; This is God&rsquo;s ordination. Man did not come out of the woman at the time of creation. The woman was made from the rib taken out of the man during creation. The head was Adam, not Eve. Verse 9 says, &ldquo;For also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.&rdquo; A woman must be submissive even for the sake of creation.</p>
<p>Verse 10 says, &ldquo;Therefore the woman ought to have a sign of submission to authority on her head for the sake of the angels.&rdquo; The Bible does not say what a woman should use to cover her head. It says only that her head, the part where her hair is, should be covered. The reason for doing this is for the angels.</p>
<p>I have always considered how wonderful this teaching is. It is for the sake of the angels that the sister&rsquo;s head bears the sign of submission. We all know the history of the angels&rsquo; fall. Satan became rebellious, but how did he rebel? He exalted himself to be equal with God. Isaiah 14 says he uplifted himself and wanted to ascend to God&rsquo;s height. In other words, he exposed his head before God; he was not subject to God&rsquo;s authority. In Isaiah 14 Satan repeatedly said, &ldquo;I will.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will ascend to heaven;...I will exalt my throne....I will sit upon the mount of assembly....I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; / I will be like the Most High&rdquo; (vv. 13-14). This was Satan&rsquo;s ambition. Here we see the fall of the archangel. Revelation 12 shows us that Satan carried with him a third part of the angels when he was cast down (v. 4). Trying to assume headship without first coming under God&rsquo;s headship was the cause of the fall of the angels!</p>
<p>Today the woman bears the sign of submission. This is for the angels! Only in the church do we find the sign of submission on the sisters&rsquo; heads. This sign in effect declares, &ldquo;Our heads are covered, and we have no head of our own. We do not want to be the head; our head is not exposed. We accept man as the head. We are doing this to testify to the angels that have rebelled that we accept Christ as our Head and we accept God as the Head.&rdquo; This is the meaning of the phrase <em>for the sake of the angels.</em></p>
<p>When we have the sign of submission on our head, that is, when we cover our head, we are rendering the best testimony to the fallen angels. This explains why Satan is against head covering. Head covering puts him to shame. We are doing what he did not do before God. What God did not obtain among the angels, He has obtained in the church. Some of the angels did not subject themselves to the authority of God and the authority of Christ. This brought in chaos to the universe. The fallen angels and the fallen Satan pose a greater problem than the fall of man. What God could not obtain from the fallen angels, He has obtained in the church.</p>
<p>When many sisters in the church stand in the position of a woman and cover their heads, an unspoken and implicit testimony is displayed before the angels in the air. It tells them that God has gained what He is after in the church. Therefore, the woman should have the sign of submission on her head for the sake of the angels.</p><h2 class="head1">VIII. NOT GOING TO THE EXTREME</h2>
<p>However, some may go to the extreme. They may think that since the man is the head, the woman should subject herself to him in everything. This puts the woman in a position of blind submission in everything. This kind of submission is unprofitable. The problem with some is that either they do not do anything at all or they go to an extreme when they do something. Paul told us that the matter is not that simple. He continued in 1 Corinthians 11:11 with the word <em>however.</em> Head covering is an outward testimony. We have to do it for the sake of an outward testimony. But what is the reality and the intrinsic significance of this testimony? Verse 11 says, &ldquo;However neither is woman without man, nor man without woman, in the Lord.&rdquo; Some may ask, &ldquo;What did Paul mean when he said neither is woman without man, nor man without woman?&rdquo; Paul explained in verse 12: &ldquo;For just as the woman is out from the man, so also is the man through the woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the garden of Eden, the woman came out of the man. But today, after the garden of Eden, man comes out of woman. Every man is born of a woman. In reality neither is woman without man, nor man without woman. Neither man nor woman can say that he or she is anything special. &ldquo;But all things are out from God&rdquo; (v. 12). Head covering is merely a sign on the head of submission to authority. In the end all things are out from God. In reality man is born of woman, and woman came out from man. No one can be proud of himself, and no one can despise himself.</p>
<p>Verse 13 says, &ldquo;Judge this in your own selves: Is it fitting for a woman to pray uncovered to God?&rdquo; Here Paul seems to ask the sisters in particular, &ldquo;After hearing this word and realizing that in God&rsquo;s government God is the Head of Christ, Christ is the Head of every man, man is the head of the woman, and God has appointed the woman to be a representative of Christ before God, do you still think that it is fitting for a woman to pray with her head uncovered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verse 14 says, &ldquo;Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him.&rdquo; Here Paul appealed to the feeling of the church in judging the matter. Pay special attention to the words: &ldquo;Does not even nature itself teach you.&rdquo; Verse 15 says, &ldquo;But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, because her long hair has been given to her for a covering.&rdquo; Women all over the world treasure and take pride in their hair. Hair expresses the glory of a woman; a woman always likes to keep her hair. I have never seen a woman throw her hair into the garbage bin. Hair is a woman&rsquo;s glory; it is precious to her. In other words, God gave the woman her long hair for a covering.</p>
<p>I would like to point out two things to you: Since God gave women long hair for a covering, Paul indicated that the woman should add a head covering to this covering, because God wants her to be covered. Since a woman&rsquo;s long hair is a God-given covering, she should cover it further with a man-made covering. We should read verses 6 and 15 together. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off; but if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered.&rdquo; Verse 15 says, &ldquo;But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, because her long hair has been given to her for a covering.&rdquo; The thought is quite clear once we put these two verses together. God has covered the woman&rsquo;s head with her hair. This being the case, those women who accept God&rsquo;s authority should use something to cover their hair. If a woman refuses to cover her hair, she should cut off the hair which God has given her. In other words, if you accept God&rsquo;s covering, you must also add your own covering. If you do not accept His covering, you must give up what God has given you in the first place. The Bible does not forbid women from keeping long hair; it only says that long hair is not enough and that one should also add a head covering.</p>
<p>Today neither of the two commandments of the Bible is being observed. If a sister does not cover her head but instead shaves off her hair, we can say that she is still obeying the Scripture. The trouble is that many women refuse to do either. They neither shave their hair nor cover their heads. Verse 6 says that if a woman does not have her hair covered she must be shaved, and that if she is not shaved she must cover her head. Verse 15 says that since God has covered us, we also should cover ourselves.</p>
<p>What should the obedient ones do? This verse says that since God has covered us, we also should cover ourselves. Those who know God will always add their part to what God has done. They will always go along with God&rsquo;s way and not contradict it.</p><h2 class="head1">IX. NOT HAVING CONTENTION</h2>
<p>Verse 16 says, &ldquo;But if anyone seems to be contentious, we do not have such a custom of being so, neither the churches of God.&rdquo; I think Paul&rsquo;s word is quite strong. Paul knew the Corinthians well. Corinthians can be found not only in Corinth, but also in many places! They can be found in the church where you are!</p>
<p>Paul said, &ldquo;But if anyone seems to be contentious.&rdquo; What is the contention about? Verses 1 through 15 speak about head covering. Thus, the contention is about head covering. But Paul said that it is wrong for anyone to be contentious. The matter of head covering is not to be contested.</p>
<p>Many want to argue that the woman does not need to cover her head! This is the same as saying that God&rsquo;s headship over Christ is a Corinthian matter, not a universal matter; this is the same as saying that Christ&rsquo;s headship over man is a Corinthian matter, not a universal matter; and this is the same as saying that man&rsquo;s headship over the woman is a Corinthian matter, not a universal matter. But thank God! Being a Christian is a universal matter, not a Corinthian matter. In the same way, God being the Head of Christ and Christ being the Head of every man are universal matters, not Corinthian matters. Likewise, man being the head of the woman is a universal matter, not a matter that just pertains to the Corinthians.</p>
<p>What did Paul say to those who thought that sisters do not need to cover their head and who opposed his words, his decision, and his commission from the Lord? He said, &ldquo;We do not have such a custom of being so.&rdquo; <em>We</em> refers to Paul and the apostles. There was no such custom among the apostles. There was no sister who did not cover her head among the apostles. &ldquo;If anyone seems to be contentious, we do not have such a custom of being so.&rdquo; There is no way to argue. If anyone wishes to argue, &ldquo;neither the churches of God&rdquo; have such a custom. This means that no one may argue about this.</p>
<p>Here Paul showed us the custom of the churches of God at that time. According to the custom at the time, all Jews covered their heads when they entered the synagogue. Jewish men and women covered their heads with a head covering called a &ldquo;tallith&rdquo; before entering the synagogue. Without such a covering, they could not enter the synagogue at all. The custom of the Greeks (Corinth being a part) was that when men and women entered their temple, both uncovered and exposed their heads. No race or country during Paul&rsquo;s time had the custom of men uncovering their heads and women covering their heads. The Jews at that time covered their heads, while Gentiles uncovered their heads. But for God&rsquo;s children, men should uncover their heads, while women should cover their heads.</p>
<p>Thus, for man not to cover his head and for woman to cover her head was a commandment uniquely given by God&rsquo;s apostles and a custom unique to the churches of God. This custom was different from either Jewish or Gentile customs. This custom was uniquely found in the church. Because this custom was instituted by the apostles, it was brand new, and it was from God.</p>
<p>All the apostles believed that the woman should cover her head. Should there be an apostle who did not believe that the woman should cover her head, he would not have been one among the other apostles and would surely have been an outsider. The apostles did not have such a custom among them. If any church tried to contest this, Paul&rsquo;s answer was that the churches of God did not have such a custom. No church had such a custom. There was no such custom among all the local churches the apostles visited. From verse 16 on, Paul did not try to reason concerning this matter. His reasoning ended with verse 15. In verse 16 he no longer was trying to reason. If anyone seemed to be contentious, Paul said, no apostle should agree with such a one. Such a one had nothing to do with the apostles and nothing to do with the church. All the apostles and all the churches believed this, and no one could argue about this.</p>
<p>This is the reason we ask all the sisters in the church to cover their heads in the meetings when a message is given or when they pray. They must do this because God wants to secure in the church what He could not secure in the world. He wants to gain what He could not gain in the universe. We want Him to gain in the church what He did not gain among the angels. We want Him to gain what He has not gained in the world. The sisters should know this. Verse 3 gives us the clear teaching concerning this. God is the Head of Christ, Christ is the Head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman. For this reason, the woman should have her head covered. This is the underlying teaching of this portion of the Word.</p><h2 class="head1">X. THE PRINCIPLE<br />
OF REPRESENTATION</h2>
<p>The Bible contains a very important principle&mdash;the principle of representation. I have spoken of this before, and I would like to reiterate it here.</p>
<p>As Christians we walk according to two different principles. One is that we walk as individuals before God, and the other is that we walk in the capacity of a representative before God. In the eyes of God we not only live the Christian life individually, but representatively. If I am not deceived, I believe that in the coming judgment we will be judged not only individually but also according to what we do as representatives.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. As a Master</h2>
<p>Suppose we have a master with a few servants in his house. The master is a brother, but he treats his servants unrighteously, unjustly, unmercifully, and unreasonably. He will be judged by God in the future for his unreasonableness, unrighteousness, and meanness. But the matter will not stop here. He will receive another judgment. This brother is responsible not only for his relationship with his servants. In the eyes of God and as a master, he represents the Lord. Whenever we are masters, we represent the Lord as the Master. The way we treat our servants should represent the way the Lord treats His servants. If we treat our servants poorly, we sin as individuals and also as representatives; we have misrepresented the Lord. If I am not deceived, I believe that we will be judged for our own sins and for the sin of misrepresenting the Lord in the coming judgment before God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. As a Servant</h2>
<p>Suppose I am not a master but a servant. Suppose further that as a servant, I steal, lie, and am slothful in my work. I only pay lip service to my master and deceive him in all kinds of ways. I have sinned, and I will be judged for my sinful conduct. But the judgment will not stop here. On the one hand, I am a servant individually, and on the other hand, I stand as a representative of all the servants who are subject to the Lord in heaven. I could afford to cheat, steal, and be slothful if it were just a matter of my personal service before man. But every time the Bible speaks of a servant, it reminds us that we have another Lord in the heavens. Therefore, we are not only servants individually; we represent all those who are servants on earth. This expresses another relationship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Example of Moses</h2>
<p>When Moses was at Meribah in Kadesh, he was angry at the Israelites because they tempted God, and he struck the rock twice. God immediately rebuked Moses. Moses lost his temper, and this was wrong. If this had only been a personal matter or an independent act as a leader of Israel, Moses could have been forgiven. He had lost his temper previously. When he saw the Israelites worshipping the golden calf at the foot of the mountain and then broke the two tablets with God&rsquo;s own writing, he displayed an even greater amount of anger (Exo. 32:19). However, God did not rebuke him. He represented God&rsquo;s wrath when he lost his temper then. He was angry on God&rsquo;s behalf, and his representation was right. But what did God say when Moses lost his temper and struck the rock twice? God said, &ldquo;You did not believe in Me, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the sons of Israel&rdquo; (Num. 20:12). In other words, you have not separated Me from your actions; you have misrepresented Me. The Israelites thought it was God who was angry. Actually, God was not angry.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Individual Standing<br />
and Representative Standing</h2>
<p>Personal sin is one thing, while representative sin is another thing. First Corinthians 11:3 indicates that every sister, that is, every woman (even though such a woman cannot be found outside the church) must realize that she has an individual standing as well as a representative standing. God is the Head of Christ, Christ is the Head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman. Therefore, the woman must have her head covered. The woman must realize that she represents others. At the very least she has to realize that she represents herself as an individual.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Individual Head Covering<br />
and Representative Head Covering</h2>
<p>When a sister covers her head in speaking or in prayer, she is proclaiming before God that no one in the world can assume any headship before Christ. She is saying that no head can be exposed before God. No one can be the head before Christ; no one can offer his suggestion or opinion to Christ. Everyone has to cover his head before Christ. He should hide his own suggestions and opinions and say to the Lord, &ldquo;You are my Head.&rdquo; A sister has to cover her head as an individual, and she has to cover her head in the position of a representative. She stands as a representative in this universe. The sisters are declaring to the world the proper standing that everyone should take before Christ.</p>
<p>Head covering may appear to be a small thing; yet it is a great testimony!</p></body></html>
