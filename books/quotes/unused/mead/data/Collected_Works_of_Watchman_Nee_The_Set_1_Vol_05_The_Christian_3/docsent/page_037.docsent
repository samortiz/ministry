   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not only were the people this way, even the rulers were the same.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hence, the prophet spoke to the key person of the government at that time: "Thus says the Lord Jehovah of hosts: / Get up, go to this steward, / To Shebna, who is over the king's house, saying, / What are you doing here and whom do you have here / That you have hewn a tomb for yourself here, / As he who has hewn a tomb on the heights, / As he who has cut out a resting place for himself in the rock?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>/ Jehovah soon throws you far away, you mighty one, / And He grasps you firmly; / He will wind you up tightly; / Like a ball He will toss you into a wide land.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>/ There you will die; and there the chariots of your glory / Will become the disgrace of the house of your master.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>/ And I will drive you from your position, / And from your standing He will pull you down.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>/ And in that day / I will call to My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, / And I will clothe him with your tunic, / And I will strengthen him with your girding sash, / And I will put your dominion into his hand; / And he will become a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem / And to the house of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>/ And I will set the key of the house of David upon his shoulder / When he opens, no one will shut; / When he shuts, no one will open" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>15-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This treasurer was expecting long-lasting glory and a peaceful and noble death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That was why he spent so much time and money to hew out a sepulchre in the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that he had forgotten about resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>David believed in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That was why he did not build for himself a great sepulchre.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He knew that it would not be his eternal habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Bible scholars know that God's promise to David was not fulfilled until resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since this treasurer had lost the key of hope of the house of David, which is the hope of resurrection, he was no longer qualified to hold the key of office in the house of David.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God promised David: "And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee" 2 Sam 7:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This can only be fulfilled in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It cannot be otherwise fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This promise never had a continuous fulfillment because the house of David later forsook the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As such, God's promise and hope to David, like His promise to Abraham, cannot be fulfilled until resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord dealt with Shebna according to his unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was to die and was to be run over; his sepulchre was to be left to another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He would lose his position, and others would take over his office to be the real keepers of the key of David.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God chose Eliakim.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The name Shebna means "repent now."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But this call did not produce the desired effect.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now God was raising up Eliakim, which means "God will raise up."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was the son of Hilkiah.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The name Hilkiah means "God's portion."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Resurrection is God's reserved portion for His servants.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All those who do not believe in Him will not have a portion in the "faithful things" of David Acts 13:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here in Revelation 3, the Lord Jesus considers the word of Isaiah to be referring to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is the Lord of the house of David, and He holds the key to all promises.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is the one resurrected from the dead, who has "the keys of death and of Hades."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The grave is not the glory of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Resurrection is the glory of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The gates of Hades cannot prevail against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Listen again to the words of the apostle: "And we announce to you the gospel of the promise made to the fathers, that God has fully fulfilled this promise to us their children in raising up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, You are My Son; today I have begotten You.'</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And as to His having raised Him up from the dead, no longer to return to corruption, He spoke in this way, I will give you the holy things of David, the faithful things....Now David, having served his own generation by the counsel of God, did indeed fall asleep and was buried with his fathers and saw corruption; but He whom God has raised did not see corruption" Acts 13:32-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From this we see that the key of David is the key to open the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the Lord Jesus opened the gates of Hades, no one could shut His believers inside.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When He shuts the unbelievers in it, no one can open it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When He opens the abyss, countless locusts will fly out to injure men Rev 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When He shuts up the abyss, Satan will be kept there for a thousand years Rev 20:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Both powers are equally important, and the Lord Jesus has absolute possession of both.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is why He could say "to the prisoners, Come forth, / To say to those who are in darkness, Show yourselves" Isa 49:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And this is why He could gather together the sinners, "like prisoners gathered in a dungeon; / And will be shut up in prison, / And after many days they will be punished" Isa 24:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord Jesus has absolute power over Hades; He can overcome Satan, the one who holds the authority of death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As the One who holds the key of David, the Lord Jesus is the Lord of resurrection and the King of the kingdom to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The gates of Hades open and close according to His will and His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although He is not exercising this authority to rule over the world at present, He has already been made "Lord and Christ" by God Acts 2:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He revealed His authority in this way to comfort those overcoming believers who have slept, so that they would know that when the time arrives, He will make them share in the first resurrection, a thing in which many ordinary ones will not be able to participate Phil 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A little later, He told the living overcoming believers that He would open a door for them also.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In a moment we will see this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although what is covered here has to do with Hades, it has lessons for us also.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It seems as though He is not interfering with anything outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To the unbelievers, He keeps His silence and ignores all present confusions and difficulties in the same way that He did on the boat one day when winds and waves beat fiercely against it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, He has never given up His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He holds the key to all administrations, and He alone can open and close.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How comforting this is!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many times it seems as if we are shut up by men of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, although our eyes may perceive things in this way, and although the ones shutting the doors may be acting according to their self will, they are but instruments in the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do not have to open a shut door because what is shut is of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the other hand, if the Lord opens a door, we can be at rest knowing that no one can shut what He has opened.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord Himself holds the key of David.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hence, believers need not look to the world or to other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What a great temptation this is!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Nevertheless, He has the key, and what He has is what they lack.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Man can work everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Jezebel, the false prophets, and all those who are living in name but dead in reality can do their own works, but the One who is holy and true is the sovereign Lord of all.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The more the believers are weak, the more they need Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They are without power and cannot open the door, but the Lord opens the door for them, and brings them into a broad and unrestricted place.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The emphasis here is on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If it is right with Him, it will be right with everything else.</S>
