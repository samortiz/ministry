<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Divine Life&#151;the Inner Supply<br>and Nourishment</H2><P>For our physical life, we daily need supply and nourishment. This is why we have to eat at least three times a day. The divine life is the inner supply and nourishment to all parts of the New Jerusalem. This is indicated by the water of life flowing out of the divine throne to saturate the entire city (Rev. 22:1, 17). In the water grows the tree of life, which bears twelve kinds of fruit every month, twelve months yearly, to feed the entire city (Rev. 22:2a, 14, 19). The water of life and the tree of life with the fruit of life do the supplying and nourishing. The whole city lives on these two items.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Divine Light&#151;Inward Light and<br>Outward Glory</H2><P>The divine Trinity is the basic structure, the divine life is the inner supply and nourishment, and the divine light is the inward light and the outward glory for the expression. God in the Lamb is the lamp as the inward light (Rev. 21:23). In the New Jerusalem we will not need the sun, the moon, or candles, or kerosene, or electricity. We will not need God-created light or man-made light, for we shall have God Himself, who is the inward light. At the same time this light shines in and through the precious stone, as a jasper stone, signifying the transformed believers (Rev. 21:11). The jasper stone is "clear as crystal." God as the light within the Lamb as the lamp is shining through the city. Within the city is the shining light. Without, the light is expressing God's glory, so that the entire city bears the glory of God. The glory of God is God Himself, shining out of the city through the transparent wall of jasper (21:18). This is what the church should be today&#151;a living composition of God, with Christ as our inner shining light and as our outward expression in glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Mingling of the Triune God<br>with the Tripartite Man</H2><P>We have been redeemed, regenerated, and now we are being transformed. We are also on the way to being glorified. Our spirit has been regenerated, our troublesome soul is being transformed, and our poor body is awaiting transfiguration.</P><P>In the New Jerusalem the Triune God is fully mingled with the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite man. This mingling is the eternal dwelling of God, signified by the number twelve. Twelve is three multiplied by four. We know this because the city is square with four sides. On each side are three gates (21:13). For eternity the New Jerusalem will be an absolute mingling, not just an addition. It is multiplication&#151;the Triune God (three) multiplied by man (four).</P><P>In the New Jerusalem the number twelve is used fourteen times. Twelve foundations of twelve precious stones bear the names of the twelve apostles (21:14, 19-20). Twelve gates of twelve pearls with twelve angels bear the names of the twelve tribes (21:12, 21a). The city's measurement is twelve thousand stadia in three dimensions (21:16). The height of the wall is one hundred forty-four cubits (21:17a), which is twelve multiplied by twelve cubits. The tree of life produces twelve fruits in each of the twelve months yearly (22:2). The number twelve, occurring so many times, means that the holy city is a mingling of the Triune God with the tripartite man.</P>
