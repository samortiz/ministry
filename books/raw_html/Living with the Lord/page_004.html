 <h2 class="head1">OUR NEEDING TO DO TWO THINGS<br />
TO LIVE WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>What do we need to do in order to live this kind of life? What do we need to do in order to live by and with the Lord and to abide together with Him? We need to do only two things. In telling you these two things, I do not wish to give you methods; my intention is simply to tell you the way to live this kind of life. First, we must always be open to the Lord. The easiest way to open to the Lord is to learn to open up our whole being&mdash;our spirit, our heart, and even our mouth. We need to learn to open up our whole being and call on the name of the Lord, calling, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; We must learn to open ourselves to the Lord and to call on name of the Lord. This is the simplest and the best way. This way causes us to meet and touch the Lord. The best way to meet and touch the Lord is not to ponder or meditate on the Lord; the best way is to open ourselves to the Lord by calling &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Each of us should practice this a little at home. We do not need to be very loud; neither do we need to scream and yell in a crazy way. We need simply to learn to open ourselves up to the Lord and to call on His name. The Bible says that the Lord is rich to all who call upon Him (Rom. 10:12). The Lord is living and real. Moreover, He is within us. When we call on Him, opening ourselves to Him, we will contact Him within.</p>
<p>The second thing that we need to do in order to live with the Lord is to contact the Lord&rsquo;s word in a proper way. The way to do this is to genuinely pray-read and eat His word. To eat the Lord&rsquo;s word is to eat the Lord Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR NEEDING TO SEE AND TO LIVE THIS VISION</h2>
<p>Every one of us must see the simple vision that the Lord Jesus is the all-inclusive Spirit dwelling in our spirit. Then we must live by the Lord, daily receiving His supply, contacting Him, and being joined to Him. This requires us to open our entire being to Him from deep within. Opening to the Lord in this way is exceedingly easy. We simply need to call on His name and pray-read His word. We can use our spirit to contact the word, to eat the word, and to receive the word into us. We can also use the word to pray to Him, to seek Him, and to fellowship with Him. If daily and moment by moment we contact Him anew, receiving His fresh supply, we will be continuously refreshed, nourished, enlightened, and supplied within. Then we will be able to live, move, and walk in Him in spirit at all times. This is what the Lord desires.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John has twenty-one chapters. Together these chapters reveal that the eternal God became flesh to be the Lamb of God to accomplish redemption on our behalf. This entire Gospel also unveils that after this God entered into death, He came out of death and was transfigured to be the life-giving Spirit to enter into our spirit to live and move with us. In light of this we should consecrate ourselves to Him, stopping all of our own living and moving, and open up to Him by calling on His name, eating His word, and contacting Him, so that He can supply us and cause us to walk in newness of life. The Lord desires to gain such a group of people on the earth today. By living in this way we will not only have been regenerated and redeemed, we will also be in the process of being transformed. Day after day He will change our nature into His very nature and conform us into His very image. Then one day He will bring us into glory and all of us will be built up together to be His exceedingly glorious expression.</p>
<p>May our eyes be opened to see this one matter, and may we open our heart and spirit to Him and say, &ldquo;Lord, I stop everything. You are not only my life, You are also my living. May my inner being contact You moment by moment and constantly receive Your supply, so that in my daily living You and I will live as one entity.&rdquo;</p>
