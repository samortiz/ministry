   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Worship of the Lord Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the House of Simon the Leper</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The proper worship of the Lord Jesus can also be seen in the house of Simon the leper in Bethany where Mary, Martha, and Lazarus were John 12:1-3; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Mark 14:3; Matt 26:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These dear saints were rendering the Lord Jesus the highest standard of worship, and the Lord was happy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This meeting in this house was composed of the cleansed sinners typified by Simon the leper.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Martha was serving, Lazarus was testifying, and Mary was loving.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>While the religious service was continuing to be practiced in the temple, the Lord Jesus was sitting in the house of Simon the leper, receiving His believers intimate, personal worship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While the Lord Jesus was walking on this earth, a formal, religious, Judaic worship was going on in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At that time did God prefer the Judaic worship in the temple or the worship that can be seen in the house of Simon the leper?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Simon the leper s house, there was no sacrifice, no burning of incense, and no showbread.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By that time God was disgusted with the Judaic, religious worship by the priests according to formalities.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually in A.D. 70 the Lord allowed the Roman army under Titus to destroy Jerusalem with the temple, fulfilling the Lord s prophecy in Matthew 24:2 concerning the temple that there would not be one stone left upon another stone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The worship in religion and the worship in reality are in two different realms.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christianity has brought the church into the religious world, but today in the Lord s recovery we are endeavoring to enjoy the Lord by being rescued from Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Worshipping God by Enjoying Him</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must be deeply impressed that we should not perform in a religious or pious way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to be men of God who are talking to the Lord all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to live a life of calling on His name and talking to Him and bring this life into the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, our life becomes our worship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should worship the Lord in the way that we live; there should be no difference.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our meeting is an exhibition of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If Christ is not the content of our daily life, what we do in the meetings is a performance in which we are the actors.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To meet in this way is a falsehood to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must be genuine in our worship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God likes our human worship in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many of us may hold on to the concept of religious worship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many Christians today prefer to have big meetings according to schedules with a proper pastor and choir clothed in long gowns.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To have a big meeting with a pastor and a choir is the proper worship to God according to their concept.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The worship in many cathedrals and chapels is religious, formal, and quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is in contrast with a meeting in a home where the saints are declaring, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>O Lord Jesus, You are my food.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You are my drink.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You are my enjoyment!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus prefers that we eat Him, drink Him, enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the religious people would highly appraise the formal and quiet service.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They might say that it is not right to make noise in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the Psalms tell us that we need to make a joyful noise unto the Lord 66:1; 81:1; 95:1-2; 98:4, 6; 100:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to drop Christianity s way to meet, which is the religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The new ones whom we meet with may already have Christianity s way to worship God in their concept.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to spend time to bring them into the realization that the real worship of God is in our spirit and is a matter of enjoying Christ as our life and life supply, our food, our drink, and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to tell the new ones that the more we enjoy the Lord, the more He is worshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more we enjoy Him, the more we talk to Him, contact Him, in a friendly and intimate way, the more He will be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We enjoy the Lord by conversing with Him and opening our heart to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our enjoying Him in such a way is well-pleasing and pleasant to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We worship God in the spirit, in life, in enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the Lord s death was imminent, He enacted the New Testament by establishing the Lord s table Matt 26:26-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Concerning the bread of the Lord s table, the Lord said that this was His body and He told the disciples to take and eat in remembrance of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To eat Him is to remember Him, to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In like manner, the Lord charged us to drink the cup of the Lord s table in remembrance of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, to drink Him is to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In John 4 the Lord Jesus indicated that drinking Him as the living water was the way to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord Jesus linked the drinking of Him and the worship of God together.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These two items are one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The best way to worship God is to drink Him, to take Him as the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This real revelation of the true worship of God and the Lord Jesus must revolutionize our entire concept.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As long as we have such a realization with a revolutionized concept concerning the worship of God and the Lord Jesus, we will know how to set up home meetings.</S>
