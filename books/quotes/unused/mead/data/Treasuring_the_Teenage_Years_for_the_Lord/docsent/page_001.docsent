   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TREASURING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TEENAGE YEARS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I would like to speak to the teenagers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The teenage years are from thirteen to nineteen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After twelve years old and before twenty, there are seven years in your teens.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The teenage years are the golden years of a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These seven years are golden and crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are a deciding factor for your whole human life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You may have been careless, sloppy, doing nothing, and even bad when you were twelve or under.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After you are past nineteen, you may still try to do something bad, although that is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During the seven teenage years, however, you should not do anything wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you do, that is awful and terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is risky.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not waste one day of your teenage years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every day, every hour, every minute, and every second have to count.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I mean this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Seven years are not very long.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Very quickly your teenage years will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you do not build yourself up within these years, you are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is needless to speak of other things; this is the case even with education.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you cannot do well in these seven years to lay a good foundation for your human life, especially in your education, you are through.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you fail in school, it will be hard to redo it, even if you try.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It will be almost impossible, because your teenage years will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Keep in mind that the teenage years are your golden years in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Strictly speaking, if you do not build up a good body within these seven years, after nineteen you will be too small and weak.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you expect to be in good health and have a good body, you must do something within your golden years.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In these seven years you have to be busy, even in exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you try to enter a medical school or law school, they may check with you to see how much exercise you had in these seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you say that you did not have any exercise or participated in any sport, the school may not take you even if your grade point average is above 4.0.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In your human life there are many aspects, including education, health, your body, morality, ethics, and your relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Of all these, your relationship with the Lord is first.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even this should be built up while you are a teenager.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You should love the Lord, seek Him, and pursue after Him, particularly in these seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After these years it is hard to have a proper start, even in seeking after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is also true in learning a language.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is hard for anyone over nineteen to learn another language; you can never do it properly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I would say that after you are past your teens, you can no longer do anything like this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do you want to get the best grades?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do it during your teenage years.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you want to love the Lord in the top way?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do it now, because after your teenage years, it is hard to start.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After the teenage years, you are good for beginning nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, love the Lord in these years.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Joshua once extended a day by commanding the sun to stand still Josh 10:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The way to make the sun stand still is to treat one day as if it were a month.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not finish only one day s work in one day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You have to finish thirty days work in a day.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this way you will spend one year as if it were thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You have to endeavor, strive, struggle, and labor in seeking after the Lord, in reading the Bible, in loving the Lord, in praying, in praising, and in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How much do you pursue after the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you say not much or not enough, you are not very wise.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The smartest young person is the one who always treats one day as if it were thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I mean what I am saying.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not waste an hour or a minute within the seven years of your teens, especially in loving the Lord and seeking after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You have probably heard of Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When he was young, he made up his mind to read the New Testament fifty-two times in one year, that is, once a week continually for a year.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Eventually he became a living New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This means that he treated one of his days as many days and one year as many years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I give you this example so that you can follow it to do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This will never waste your time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even going to exercise is not a waste of time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You should budget your time, your energy, and even your breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you do this, you will not miss anything in the spiritual realm, in the spiritual kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You will get what you should get.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I advise you all to treasure your teenage years.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even if you are eighteen, you have one year to go.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Treasure this one year as a hundred years to get everything that you can.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then you will see that you will be successful in any field, even in seeking the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>So many Christians meet defeat simply because they did not lay a good foundation in so many matters.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Look at the world today.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Many people in the United States have become nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They are just a living entity breathing, eating, and sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They have become nothing because they did not lay a foundation that was good enough for them to be successful in their human life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is also true in the spiritual field.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you expect to have success in the spiritual field, in seeking the Lord, you must treasure your golden years, your teenage years.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Do everything you can.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Get into the Bible as much as you can.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Pray as much as possible, and function in the meetings with as much as you have.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Exhaust yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Try your best to do this.</S>
