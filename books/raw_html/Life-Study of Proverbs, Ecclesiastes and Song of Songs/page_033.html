<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>26. Concerning Dealing with Others</H2><P>To have respect of persons is not good, because for a piece of bread a man will transgress (28:21). The fear of man brings a snare, but whoever puts his trust in Jehovah will be exalted (29:25).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>27. Concerning Dealing with Neighbors</H2><P>Proverbs 25:17 says, "Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor's house, otherwise he will become weary of you and hate you." A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his steps (29:5). Like a madman who shoots firebrands, arrows, and death, so is the man who deceives his neighbor, and says, "Was I not joking?" (26:18-19). A man who bears false witness against his neighbor is like a club and a sword and a sharp arrow (25:18). Proverbs 25:9-10 charges us, saying, "Argue your case with your neighbor himself,/And do not reveal the secret of another;/Lest he who hears it revile you,/And the evil report of you does not go away." According to 22:28 and 23:10-11, we should not remove the ancient boundary marker, which our fathers have set up, or go into the fields of the fatherless; for their Redeemer is strong; He will plead their cause against us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>28. Concerning Dealing with the Poor</H2><P>He who gives to the poor man will not lack, but he who shuts his eyes will have many curses (28:27). Whoever closes his ear to the cry of the poor man also will cry and will not be heard (21:13). He who oppresses the poor to multiply his gain and he who gives to the rich will only come to want. Do not rob the poor, because he is poor; nor oppress the afflicted in the gate (22:16, 22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>29. Concerning Dealing with Evil Men</H2><P>Proverbs 24:1 tells us not to be envious of evil men, nor desire to be with them. We should not be incensed because of evildoers and not be envious of the wicked (v. 19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>30. Concerning Dealing with Enemies</H2><P>Concerning dealing with enemies we should not say, "I will recompense evil"; we should wait for Jehovah, and He will save us (20:22). We should not say, "I will do to him as he has done to me; I will render to the man according to his work" (24:29). We should not rejoice when our enemy falls, and we should not let our heart exult when he is overthrown; lest Jehovah see it, and it displease Him, and He turn away His anger from him (vv. 17-18). If our enemy is hungry, we should give him bread to eat; and if he is thirsty, we should give him water to drink; for we will heap coals of fire upon his head, and Jehovah will reward us (25:21-22).</P>
