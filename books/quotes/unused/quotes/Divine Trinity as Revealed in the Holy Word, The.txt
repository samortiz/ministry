The matter of the Divine Trinity has been taught and debated throughout the past nineteen centuries since the early church fathers
Some condemn us for teaching what we have seen plainly revealed in the Bible and even say that our teachings are heretical
The best way is not to argue or fight concerning particular points but to come back to the Bible to study the matter
We need to study every verse in the Bible in which the Trinity is either directly indicated or indirectly implied
Many of his teachings were good, but he made a great mistake by teaching that Christ was inferior to God the Father
Subconsciously, or unconsciously, many teachings have the thought of God as three persons and therefore three Gods
These matters require much consideration, and the most fair and accurate way is by a thorough study of the Bible
The Bible contains many explicit teachings, such as the apostle Paul's teaching concerning justification in Romans 3 through 5
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
The way the Triune God is mentioned indicates that we need to enjoy the Triune God as love, grace, and fellowship
The plural subject, God, implies the three of the Godhead, and the singular predicate, created, implies the one God
In Genesis 1:1 it is God who is creating, but in verses 2 and 3 it is the Spirit of God and God's word who are creating
The Divine Trinity being implied by God, His Spirit, and His word shows that the three of the Trinity are distinct but not separate
Elohim referred to Himself in verse 26 using Us and Our, but Moses referred to Elohim in verse 27 using His and He
Verses 13, 14, and 22 clearly reveal that one of these three men was Jehovah and that the other two were angels
We may ask if the Son of God became a man two thousand years ago or four thousand years ago, when Abraham lived
Verses 7 and 9 also mention the Angel of Jehovah, and verses 11 and 13 show that the Angel of Jehovah turned out to be Jehovah Himself
God's reference to Himself not simply as Jehovah and God but also as the Angel of Jehovah and the Angel of God implies the Trinity
Genesis 1610 211718 221112 311113 and 481516 all indicate the Divine Trinity in relation directly or indirectly to the genealogy of Christ
Abraham and Jacob are directly related to the genealogy of Christ, who came to redeem man so that God could work Himself into man
Exodus stresses two matters concerning the Trinity: the Angel of God, or the Angel of Jehovah, and the Spirit of God
In Exodus God is the Angel of God, who is sent to be with man, and the Spirit of God, who comes to reach man in a subjective way
These two, Christ and the Spirit, in the New Testament are the fulfillment of the Angel and the Spirit in Exodus
In the Old Testament there are two basic divine titles in Hebrew, the first language used for the revelation of God's Scriptures
Scofield says that Elohim is formed from El strength or the strong one and Alah to swear to bind oneself by an oath so implying faithfulness
Because Jehovah is the Warrior fighting the battle for us and triumphing over all our enemies, He is our triumph, our victory
Jehovah provides, heals, and triumphs over the enemies and shepherds us, He is our peace and our righteousness, and we enjoy Him
The Angel of Jehovah is Jehovah Himself , and Jehovah is God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob
That the Angel of Jehovah is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob implies that He is threefold, the Triune God
The God of Abraham refers to the Father, the God of Isaac refers to the Son, and the God of Jacob refers to the Spirit
Jesus Christ, the incarnated God, came not only to the New Testament saints but also to Abraham in the Old Testament
The God before whom Abraham and Isaac walked and the God who shepherded Jacob all his life was the Angel who redeemed him from all evil
Abraham was the father, Isaac was the son, and Jacob, the naughty one, was under the transformation of the Spirit
In Exodus 3 the Angel of Jehovah said to Moses, 'I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob
The thought concerning the Divine Trinity in the Old Testament is exactly the same as the thought in the New Testament
When the children of Israel were thirsty in the wilderness God told Moses to strike the rock in Horeb and water came out of the smitten rock
In 1 Corinthians 10:4 Paul says that the rock typifies Christ, the second of the Trinity, who was smitten by God to flow out living water
The lampstand reveals the Father as the substance the nature the Son as the embodiment the form and the Spirit as the shining the expression
We need much time, prayer, and appreciation to digest the details of the Divine Trinity as revealed in the Old Testament
The revelation concerning the Trinity is clear in the New Testament, but it is more detailed in the Old Testament
In these verses we can see three key items concerning the Trinity: the Angel of God, the pillar of cloud, and Jehovah
We come to the Triune God through Christ in the Spirit , and the Triune God comes to us in Christ through the Spirit
To be baptized into the Spirit is to be baptized into Christ, and to be baptized into Christ is to be baptized into the Triune God
The cloud and the fire were only the outward appearance; the inward element of the cloud was the divine nature of the Triune God
Because of religious concepts, it may be difficult for some to accept the thought that the cloud is the Triune God
The expression pillar of cloud is composed of plain words, but these words convey a picture, a sign, that allows us to see something
We may wonder why God did not do things as Himself directly but was complicated by doing things as the Angel of God and the pillar of cloud
According to verses 19 through 20, it was the pillar of cloud that protected Israel from Pharaoh and the Egyptian army
One of the compound names of Jehovah in the Old Testament is Jehovah-shammah, which means 'Jehovah Is There,' or 'Jehovah is present'
Just as the Angel came in the name of Jehovah, the Lord Jesus as the sent One of God came in the name of the Father
The Angel's voice being Jehovah's speaking is similar to the Lord Jesus never speaking from Himself but only from the Father
Exodus 23:23 says that that the Angel of Jehovah will go before Israel, but verse 25 says that Jehovah will cut off their enemies
Jehovah as the smiting God, the rock as the crucified Christ, and water as the Spirit of life signify the Divine Trinity
The spices signify Christ's death , the effectiveness of Christ's death , Christ's resurrection , and the power of Christ's resurrection
God filled the builders of the tabernacle with His Spirit not in power but in wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and workmanship
In Exodus 33 and 34 God deals with His redeemed people in a special way after their great failure of making and worshipping the golden calf
In their journey they first passed through the Red Sea, which was a type of the death of Christ and dealt with their enemies
They stood at the base of the mountain, and Moses, their representative, went up to the mount to stay with God
Additionally, there was the time required for the children of Israel to make all the furniture of the tabernacle and the tabernacle itself
In spite of all these experiences of God and of His gifts, the children of Israel made and worshipped the golden calf
They were not ignorant; their forefathers gave them much knowledge concerning God while they were there in Egypt
Moses, who was on the mount with God, surely did not expect this to happen, but God saw it and told Moses, 'Go, get down'
When Moses saw the calf and the dancing, he could not restrain himself and threw down the two tablets, shattering them
God's answer to Moses' petition for the children of Israel comprised two main aspects: God's mercy and God's government
According to His government, God should have destroyed the people, but His mercy would not allow Him to do this
To carry out what was in God's heart for His people, both God's mercy and God's government had to be satisfied
The only way God could deal with His people in a way that maintained both His mercy and His government was through the Divine Trinity
God's dealing with His redeemed people in Exodus 33 and 34 after they committed the gross sin of idolatry is a special part of this picture
We also need to see that this enjoyment can be recovered and maintained only by God's dealing through the Trinity
In Exodus 33 and 34 the Trinity is for dealing with God's redeemed people for the continuation of their enjoyment of the Triune God
In this we can again see that the purpose of the Divine Trinity is for God to dispense Himself into us so that we may enjoy Him
When Moses heard this, he must have been disappointed and wondered what he could do to save Israel from destruction
In the original Hebrew text it is not clear whether the one speaking with Moses was Jehovah or the pillar of cloud
Exodus 331014 says When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent all the people would rise up and worship
God's goodness is a general term that comprises all the divine virtues toward us, including mercy, kindness, compassion, grace, and reality
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
The details of the picture in Exodus 33 include the first of the Trinity as Jehovah, the second as His hand, and the third as His presence
Exodus 34:5-10 says, 'Jehovah descended in the cloud and took His place there with him and proclaimed the name of Jehovah
He declared His name in these two things, which indicates that He has to take care of these two things for His name
Both His merciful character and His governmental standing were preserved in carrying out this dealing through His trinity
Similarly, today the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, enables God to come to us and stay with us so that we may enjoy His presence
Because the crucified Christ, Christ in His death, is our standing and our hiding, we can communicate with and contact God
Most readers of the Bible probably do not consider that there is a picture of the Trinity in this brief portion of the holy Word
The crucial figures in this picture that show us the Divine Trinity are the tabernacle the anointing oil the cloud the glory and the fire
Immediately after the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud descended to cover it, and the glory entered to fill it
When the tabernacle was raised up, covered by the cloud, and filled with the glory, it became a full type of the Triune God
John saw the Spirit descending upon Christ, who was identified as the fulfillment of the tabernacle in verse 14 of the same chapter
The day that the tabernacle was raised up the cloud descended and covered it and the glory entered and filled it was a great day in history
In order to understand what is recorded and revealed in John 1, we must compare it with the picture in Exodus 40
It took more than twenty-five hundred years from the creation of man to reach the goal of raising up the tabernacle
You shall make it a holy anointing oil a fragrant ointment compounded according to the work of a compounder it shall be a holy anointing oil
The three units of five hundred shekels each, the measure of the spices, signify the Trinity, the three of the Godhead
Myrrh, a spice used in burial, typifies Christ's death, and cinnamon typifies the sweetness and effectiveness of His death
The cloud that was upon the tabernacle by day is the Spirit, and the fire that was in it by night is also the Spirit
As the anointing oil, the Spirit first anoints us, and then as the pillar of cloud and fire, He leads and guides us
In the night we need the Spirit as the enlightening fire, and in the day we need the Spirit as the guiding cloud
Strictly speaking, the journey of the children of Israel was actually not their journey but the journey of the tabernacle
The children of Israel journeying according to the move of the cloud was for the move of the tabernacle, which typifies Christ
The Bible does not record anything about the physical appearance of this glory; it only says, 'The glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle'
Most days we do not experience much glory, but sometimes in our Christian experience we sense that we are filled with glory
The proper living, work, and move of God's redeemed people in the Old Testament were altogether according to this mingling and dispensing
The New Testament reveals the full reality of the divine dispensing and mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed ones
It says, 'Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
The Son had not passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, and the Spirit was not yet consummated
The tabernacle typifies Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God for God's redeemed people to enter and enjoy all the inward contents
The priest shall burn the whole on the altar, as a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah'
It is difficult to understand how Christ could be God's food, since Christ as the Son is part of the Triune God
The healthiest persons are not those who know the most but those who breathe, eat, sleep, and exercise properly
In order to properly understand the Divine Trinity, we must see that God is one and yet also three who eternally coexist and coinhere
Cain's offering was rejected because he offered something to God without taking Christ as the base for his offering
In Leviticus 1, because Christ the Son is offered to Jehovah, Jehovah refers to the Father as the Receiver of the offering
In Hebrews Paul writes that Christ is our great High Priest and a Priest forever according to the order of Melchisedek
The water that washed the inward parts and legs of the burnt offering signifies the Spirit as the washing agent
Some may think that it is wrong to consider the Son as part of the fire, since the Son as the offering is burned by the fire
Especially when studying the Old Testament types, traditional, systematic teachings concerning the Trinity are altogether inadequate
The priest shall burn it as its memorial portion on the altar, an offering by fire, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah'
The items that indicate the Trinity in these verses are the meal offering, Jehovah, the oil, the priest, and the fire
When Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit, Christ's human element was mingled with the divine element of the Spirit
Christ is able to be such an offering for our peace, co-enjoyment, and fellowship through the involvement of the Divine Trinity
The anointed priest shall take some of the blood of the bull and bring it into the Tent of Meeting, and the priest shall
Christ as the sin offering deals with the source of our trespasses, and Christ as the burnt offering deals with the cause of our trespasses
The Triune God is also the elements of the offerings, such as the oil, which is an element of the meal offering
Leviticus continues to show us how God's redeemed people can enjoy God in fellowship through the offerings in the Tent of Meeting
John is only five chapters, but the twenty-seven chapters of Leviticus are a full development of the divine fellowship
Such service requires the full experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity as revealed in detail in the consecration of the priests
Although we may be cleansed, without the shining of the divine light we cannot walk or move, much less serve God
In order to serve God, we need to have our hands filled with the Trinity and to be in the shining of the divine light
When the anointing oil was poured on the head of the serving priest, it is no longer objective but became subjective to him
When it was poured on his head, it must have run down and covered his entire body, including his face and his clothing
The serving priest was sanctified not by doctrine or teaching but by being anointed with the compound ointment
The compound ointment signifies the compound Spirit which includes the Triune God mingled with Christs humanity crucifixion and resurrection
Verse 14 says He brought the bull of the sin offering and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering
The clear, plain word concerning the divine fellowship is in 1 John, but the details of the divine fellowship are found throughout Leviticus
Verse 18 says, 'He presented the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram'
The unleavened bread signifies the sinless Christ, and the oiled bread typifies Christ mingled with the Spirit
In order to serve God, it is not enough to be outwardly sanctified; we also need the nourishment of an inward supply
The sinless Christ, who is mingled with the Spirit, is the nourishing supply to sustain us in our priestly service
After the anointing oil was poured on Aaron in verse 12, it was sprinkled bit by bit on the priests and their garments
The bread of the meal offering that was in the basket of consecration also typifies Christ as the priests' food
After the consecration of the priests, Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle; then they came out and blessed the people
The fire that burned the offerings on the altar was not a fire kindled by human hands but a fire that came from God
In Exodus 40 the tabernacle and the altar were prepared, but the priests, who were required to carry out the offerings, were not yet ready
After Aaron and his sons were inaugurated into the priesthood in Leviticus 8, they immediately began to make offerings in chapter 9
As soon as Moses anointed and consecrated the priests, Aaron began to place the various offerings on the altar
As we have seen already, this fire represents the mouth of God, for God received the offerings on the altar through this fire
The consecration of the priests, the filling of their hands, was so that they might enjoy the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity
Our service must be the filling of our hands with the Divine Trinity; otherwise, our service will be an abomination in the eyes of God
Our hands need to be filled with the Divine Trinity, and our entire being needs to be daily nourished by and mingled with the Divine Trinity
The cleansing of the leper required two living and clean birds, which typify Christ the Son, who is living and pure
The bird that was killed signifies the crucified Christ, and the bird that was released signifies the resurrected Christ
The meal offering mingled with oil signifies Christ the Son mingled with the Spirit in His humanity as God's food
The rest of the oil that is in the palm of the priest's hand he shall put on the head of the one who is to be cleansed
In the cleansing of the leper we can see the relation between the trespass offering, the sin offering, and the burnt offering
We need to realize that because the source of our sins is indwelling sin, our sinful nature, we also need Christ as our sin offering
Finally, we need to realize that because the cause of our sins is our not being absolute for God, we also need Christ as our burnt offering
Outside the veil of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting Aaron shall set it in order from evening to morning before Jehovah continually
The lamps are the seven lamps , which are the seven Spirits of God, the sevenfold intensified Spirit , as the expression of God
The door was not closed for others who desired to serve God, for God also established the principle of the Nazarite
On the one hand, we are chosen by God ; on the other hand, we need to volunteer as Nazarites in order to serve as priests
Although we know that we are chosen by God, in our actual service we do not have much consciousness of being chosen
Every instance of enjoying the Trinity that we have seen throughout Exodus and Leviticus is at the Tent of Meeting
We must never leave Christ as the Tent of Meeting, because He is the ground and sphere for our enjoyment of the Divine Trinity
The Old Testament almost always uses the expression offering to Jehovah; very rarely does it use the expression offering to God
The burnt offering signifies Christ for God's satisfaction, and the sin offering signifies Christ for the Nazarite's sin
The peace offering in the Nazarite vow shows that we enjoy peace when we live a life of volunteering to serve God
If we do not live a Nazarite's life, outwardly we may have no problem with others, but inwardly we will have a problem with everyone
Few Christian teachers dare to talk about mingling, because in the early church an erroneous doctrine of mingling was condemned as heretical
The meal offering typifies Christ for God's satisfaction, and the drink offering typifies Christ for God's pleasure
Paul satisfied God as food while he was alive, and he pleased God as a drink offering at the conclusion of his life
The separation of the Nazarite was so that he might participate in the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in type
Even before a Nazarite began serving, he participated in the riches of the Trinity when he separated himself from the world unto God
Because Jehovah is mentioned three times-once in each part of the threefold blessing-Jehovah is the Divine Trinity
The first part of the blessing, 'Jehovah bless you and keep you,' implies the Father, the first of the Trinity
The second part, 'Jehovah make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you,' implies the Son, the second of the Trinity
The countenance is more particular and intimate and is mostly for pleasant expressions such as love, mercy, and kindness
Verses 11 through 17 say, 'Jehovah said to Moses, They shall present their offering, one leader each day, for the dedication of the altar
The Trinity is not for doctrinal knowledge of the Godhead but for the experience and enjoyment of God by His people
You shall bring forth water for them out of the rock and give the assembly and their livestock something to drink'
Apparently, the book of Numbers is a record of the numbering of God's people and their journey in the wilderness
The Trinity was involved in God's choosing and calling His people and His going on with His elect, mainly with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
There was the need of a beginning to bring the redeemed people, the tabernacle, the priesthood, and all the offerings into function
Because there was not a need for the Trinity in this allotment, there is little indication of the Trinity in Joshua
Every division is caused by human choice, and every human choice that is different from God's choice is related to idolatry
Because the children of Israel did not walk in a way pleasing to God, God allowed their enemies to defeat them
There was a need of several overcomers in Judges because the situation among God's people was entirely abnormal
In the abnormal situation of God's people recorded in Judges, God did something extraordinary by raising up a woman to be a leader
The second case that indicates the Trinity in Judges is the case of Gideon, who was the highest example of an overcomer
Deborah defeated the Canaanites, Gideon defeated the Midianites, Jephthah defeated the Ammonites, and Samson defeated the Philistines
Because many Christians do what is right in their own eyes, there are endless divisions with different ways of meeting
Christians may speak of Christ and the Spirit without realizing that these titles imply the Trinity and are for our experience
We most need to experience Him in abnormal situations such as today's situation, which is prefigured in Judges
Verses 15 through 16 say The princes in Issachar were with Deborah And Issachar was true to Barak Into the valley they were sent behind him
Verse 14 says, 'Jehovah turned to him and said, Go in this strength of yours, and save Israel from the hand of Midian'
As in the case of Deborah, in the case of Gideon the Angel of Jehovah was Christ as the sent One of God, and Jehovah was the Triune God
Jehovah the Angel of Jehovah and the Spirit of Jehovah imply God the Son of God sent by Him and the Spirit of God indicating the Trinity
Verse 32 says, 'Jephthah passed on to the children of Ammon to fight against them, and Jehovah delivered them into his hand'
The woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me; and His appearance was like the appearance of an angel of God
The Angel of Jehovah did not allow Manoah to offer anything to Him but told Manoah to make an offering to Jehovah
The kid that Manoah offered typifies Christ as the burnt offering for Gods satisfaction and the meal offering typifies Christ for Gods food
It is very good for the sisters to aspire to produce those who meet God's need, but they must not take the position of the head
Manoah attempted to discover the Angel's identity, first by trying to offer something to Him and then by asking His name
The Angel of Jehovah answered Manoah in a peculiar way, saying, 'Why do you ask about My name, since it is wonderful'?
When Manoah realized that he had been speaking to the Angel of Jehovah, he said to his wife, 'We have seen God'
The riches of the Divine Trinity were involved in bringing forth Samson to defeat the enemies by the mighty Spirit of the Triune God
Just as the Spirit empowered Samson to defeat the Philistines, so the Lord Jesus was empowered by the Spirit to defeat God's enemy
We take You as our sin offering and our trespass offering so that we may enter into the enjoyment of You as all the other offerings
We need to see the significance of the sequence of the books of the Bible according to the crucial points in each book
Jacob had a dream from God, and upon waking from the dream, he prophetically named the place Bethel, which means 'the house of God'
In Genesis and Exodus four basic items are revealed and applied by God: God's sent One, the tabernacle, the offerings, and the Spirit
More than a thousand years before Christ ascended in a cloud , the Angel of Jehovah, as a man, ascended in the flame of the altar
The Old Testament reveals that the Angel of Jehovah was Jehovah, and the name Jesus means 'Jehovah the Savior'
In order for all these accomplishments to reach and be applied to God's people, the sent One had to be the Spirit
The Triune God as the Spirit is mingled with His elect by entering into them as living water and covering them as the anointing ointment
Primarily through these items, we have seen the Divine Trinity in Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Judges
God's purpose for His people was not merely to defeat the enemies and take full possession of the land but for them to set up a kingdom
When the Lord taught His disciples how to pray, He began, 'Our Father who is in the heavens, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come'
Many Christians today preach the gospel of a heavenly mansion, but the New Testament preaches the gospel of the kingdom
The children of Israel were brought out of Egypt and through the wilderness, where they built the tabernacle for God
In 1 and 2 Samuel the first person God used to bring in His kingdom was another female, Samuel's mother, Hannah
There is no book in the Old Testament called David; instead, the record of David is included in 1 and 2 Samuel
Samuel was a Levite but he was not born into the priesthood because he was not of the house of Aaron the family of priests ordained by God
After he was born and weaned, his mother brought him to the house of God and left him in the care of Eli the priest
In order for such a one to be raised up and carry out his commission, there was a crucial need of the Divine Trinity
Because Jehovah had shut up Hannah's womb, she was forced to pray a desperate, consecrated, and consecrating prayer
Our present situation and God's need today are the same in principle as the situation and the need at the time of Samuel
Samuel was the last judge because God used him to terminate the confused situation among God's people, who were without a king or a kingdom
God needs such ones who are qualified to terminate the negative situation and bring in the king and the kingdom
In a sense, Christ our King is not here yet, and we are still in a confused situation, just as in the age of the judges
Similarly, in order for us to pray to meet God's need today, we need Christ as the embodiment of God and the reality of the offerings
Samuel 1:3-7 says, 'This man went up from his city year by year to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh
The bulls, flour, and wine signify the Christ whom we experience and bring to the house of God to offer to Him
Samuel 24:25 says, 'There David built an altar to Jehovah, and he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings'
The burnt offerings typify Christ for God's satisfaction, and the peace offerings typify Christ for the peace between God and His people
Verses 6 through 10 say, 'The Spirit of Jehovah will rush upon you; and you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man
As in the previous verses, the Spirit of Jehovah is the third of the Trinity reaching man, and God in Hebrew is Elohim, the Triune God
In order for Saul to be anointed as a ruler over God's people, there was the need of Christ's redemption and the Spirit
The Triune God, with His embodiment, His redemption, and His Spirit, is constituting us into useful persons for His coming and His kingdom
The book of Ephesians mentions the Trinity in every chapter and is thus constructed with the Divine Trinity as its basic structure
