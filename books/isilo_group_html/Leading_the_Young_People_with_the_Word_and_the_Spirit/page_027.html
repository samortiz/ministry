<h1 class="title">LEADING THE YOUNG PEOPLE<br />
TO EXERCISE THEIR SPIRIT TO PRAY USING THE WORDS OF THE SCRIPTURES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: July 21, 1961</h1>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE SCRIPTURES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Scriptures Supplying Us<br />
with the Food of Life</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning how to turn our reading of the Scriptures into prayer so that we may help the young people to use their spirit to pray and touch the Lord. Even though the Bible contains teachings, we should explain to the young people that the purpose of the Bible is not to give us teachings but to supply us with food. The Bible is more than teachings; its teachings are merely a means to supply our spirit with God&rsquo;s word as food in order for us to be nourished with life.</p>
<p>We need to be rescued from the natural concept that a book is an instrument of teaching to convey knowledge. On the surface, the Bible is a book like any other book in the world, with black letters printed on white paper. Hence, when a person receives a Bible, he often regards the Bible as if it were the same as any other book that can impart some knowledge. Many Christians have this concept. However, we must show the young people that the Bible is different from any other book. The Bible is not a book that contains merely teachings. Rather, the Bible supplies us with spiritual nourishment by means of its teachings. Hence, when we stress the matter of reading the Bible, we should not emphasize the matter of receiving teachings but the matter of receiving spiritual nourishment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Scriptures Supplying Us with Christ</h2>
<p>We should explain that the nourishment we receive from the Scriptures is not food for the soul. Newspapers, magazines, novels, or scientific studies provide food for the soul or for the mind because these printed materials convey knowledge and theories about the world. In contrast, the Bible supplies us with Christ, the Lord Himself. We should read the Bible in order to receive spiritual nourishment related to life. This means that when we read the Bible, we should receive the Triune God. The Triune God&mdash;the Father in the Son as the Spirit&mdash;is embodied in the words of the Bible. Hence, when we contact the Bible, we need to read the Bible with prayer so that we may receive spiritual food by touching Christ and receiving the Lord Jesus in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Teachings in the Scriptures<br />
Being Centered on Christ</h2>
<p>When we speak of touching the Lord as we read the Bible, some may say that this is not possible, because there are many portions in the Scriptures that do not contain teachings related to Christ. For example, 2 Corinthians 6:14 says, &ldquo;Do not become dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers,&rdquo; which concerns marriage and friendship. Such a word seems to be unrelated to Christ. The Bible also speaks of diligence in Romans 12:8 and in 2 Peter 1:5 and 10, which again seems unrelated to Christ. It is possible to cite numerous examples in the Bible that do not appear to be related to Christ on the surface. However, we must realize that Christ is the center of the Bible; all the words in the Bible take Christ as the center and extend outward to the circumference of every matter. If our thought in reading the Bible is limited to merely receiving teachings, we will not touch Christ or see the relationship between teachings and Christ.</p>
<p>When we read the Scriptures, we should take Christ as the center in order to see the connection between a teaching and Christ. Christ can be compared to the hub of a wheel. Many spokes spread out from the hub of a wheel to the rim of the wheel, forming a complete wheel. The truths in the Bible should be considered from the standpoint of a complete wheel, that is, Christ being the center of the wheel and all the teachings coming out of Him as spokes and being related to Him as the rim. Some teachings are directly related to Christ, and others are indirectly related; however, all are connected to Him. If we have such a concept, we will discover the proper place for each teaching in its relation to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Teachings in the Scriptures Keeping People<br />
in the Experience and Enjoyment of Christ</h2>
<p>If we read the Scriptures with the intention of touching Christ and contacting Christ, we will receive the Lord as our food. Thus, when we read 2 Corinthians 6:14, which says, &ldquo;Do not become dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers,&rdquo; we will clearly realize that believers and unbelievers should not have intimate friendships or be dissimilarly yoked in marriage, because this will hinder us from experiencing Christ. When a believer marries an unbeliever, it will not be a help to the believer in gaining more of the Lord; rather, it will hinder his experience. Hence, a believer not being dissimilarly yoked with an unbeliever will keep the believer in the best possible condition to experience and enjoy Christ.</p>
<p>It is in this regard that the Bible speaks of virtues such as diligence and prudence. A slothful person will miss numerous opportunities to experience Christ, and a careless and sloppy person will not be able to grasp many opportunities to experience Christ. A person who experiences Christ must be diligent, quiet, careful, and prudent. This does not mean, however, that a person who has these qualities will experience Christ automatically. It only means that a person who does not have these qualities will have great difficulty in experiencing Christ. If we read the Bible in this way, we will realize that it contains many teachings that will keep us in a condition to experience Christ.</p>
<p>If we desire to remain in a condition that is most favorable to experiencing Christ, we need to receive the teachings in the Scriptures. If we go against these teachings, we will not be protected, restricted, or regulated. As a result, we will lose our ground to experience Christ. The Bible contains many teachings that serve to protect, restrict, and regulate us to keep us on the proper ground for the experience and enjoyment of Christ. If we touch the Bible in this way, the connection between these teachings and Christ will gradually become clear. For example, we may read 1 Corinthians 1:2, which speaks of Jesus Christ as being &ldquo;theirs and ours.&rdquo; This word means that Christ is the portion of all the believers. Verse 30 continues, saying, &ldquo;Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&rdquo; This shows that all the teachings in 1 Corinthians are related to the believers&rsquo; being in Christ. We can connect all the teachings in the Bible directly or indirectly to Christ because He is the center of the Bible.</p>
<p>Since the Bible is not merely a book of teachings, receiving teachings from it should not be our first consideration. Rather, we should read the Bible by praying over it to absorb the Lord. The Bible is a book that supplies life; the Bible is the bread of life. When we read the Bible, we should receive a supply of life from it. This supply of life is Christ Himself. Although there are many items in the Bible that do not speak directly about Christ, they keep us, restrict us, and put us in a position to experience Christ and turn our being toward Him. Hence, all the teachings in the Bible are related directly or indirectly to Christ.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Leading the Young People with the Word and the Spirit &nbsp; pg 27</div><br></body></html>
