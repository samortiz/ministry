   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HAGAR SYMBOLIZING THE COVENANT OF LAW A. Bringing Forth Children unto Slavery</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>according to the Law of Mount Sinai</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hagar, the concubine of Abraham, signifies the covenant of law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, the position of the law is like that of a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As such, the law has no rightful position in God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Like Sarah, grace brings forth children unto sonship; like Hagar, the law brought forth children unto slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Galatians 4:24 says, One covenant from Mount Sinai, bringing forth children unto slavery, which is Hagar.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Mount Sinai is the place where the law was given Exo 19:20; 24:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The covenant of law, symbolized by Hagar, brings God s chosen people into the bondage of the law, making them slaves under the law, separated from the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. Being Born according to Man s Flesh,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>not according to God s Grace</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Galatians 4:23 says, The one of the maidservant was born according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Abraham brought forth Ishmael through the maidservant Hagar by his fleshly effort and not by God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, Ishmael, as the issue of man s fleshly effort according to the law, was rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When man ignores the work of God s grace and attempts to do something by himself to please God, this brings in the law and joins man to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, what is brought forth in this way cannot remain in God s economy, and it is of no use for the accomplishment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to God s intention, the covenant of promise came first Gen 12:2, 7; 13:15-17; 15:4-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God had no intention of bringing in the law or of having man endeavor to keep it for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, through the effort of man s flesh, the covenant of law, signified by Hagar, was brought in to frustrate God s work of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>C. Having No Share in God s Promised Good Land</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Genesis 21:10 Sarah said to Abraham, Cast out this maidservant and her son, for the son of this maidservant shall not inherit with my son Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The bondwoman Hagar symbolizes the covenant of law, the position of which is like that of a concubine Gal 4:22, 24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, what was brought forth through her was not accepted as an heir to the inheritance and had no share in God s promised good land.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By this we see that the two kinds of children brought forth by the two covenants, the covenant of God s promise and the covenant of law, signified by Abraham s wife Sarah and by his concubine Hagar, are different in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those brought forth by the covenant of law are born according to the flesh; those brought forth by the covenant of promise are born according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The children born according to the flesh have no right to participate in God s promised blessing, but the children born according to the Spirit have the full right to inherit God s promised blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We, the believers in Christ, are not children of the maidservant but of the free woman Gal 4:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are not children of the law under the slavery of the law but children of grace under the freedom of grace to enjoy the God-promised all-inclusive Christ with all His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE COVENANT OF GOD S PROMISE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>CONFIRMED WITH THE COVENANT OF CIRCUMCISION</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After God called Abraham, He gave him the promise, which concerned mainly the seed and the land Gen 12:1-2, 7; 13:15-17 , and then He confirmed the promise by making a covenant with him 15:4-5, 18-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, after Abraham received the covenant, he accepted his wife s proposal and by his own flesh he brought forth Ishmael through his maidservant Hagar.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was a serious offense against God s economy for His eternal purpose, and it interrupted the fellowship that came from God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For a long period of thirteen years, Abraham, a man called by God, missed God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was not until he was ninety-nine years of age that God appeared to him again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then God revealed to Abraham that His name is El-Shaddai, the all-sufficient Mighty One, implying that He would be the source of the rich supply of grace to keep His covenant for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Moreover, He again made a covenant with him 17:1-2, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In making this covenant, God used circumcision as evidence of the covenant to confirm the covenant of promise which He gave to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This shows us that although the promise of the good land given by God to His chosen people had been made a covenant by God to His elect, there was still the need to confirm the covenant of God s promise with the covenant of circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Circumcision was the procedure which God s chosen people had to pass through to inherit God s promise.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It signifies that God s elect in the New Testament must pass through the dealing of the cross so that they may inherit and enjoy all the riches in Christ promised by God.</S>
