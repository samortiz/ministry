   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We must be careful not to consider the substitutionary death of the Lord Jesus and our co-death with Him as two separate matters.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Those who pay attention to knowledge and understanding have this tendency.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, it must not be so in our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Substitutionary death and co-death should be differentiated but never separated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When one believes in the substitutionary death of the Lord Jesus, such a one has already died with Christ Rom 6:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To believe that the Lord Jesus took my place of punishment is to believe that I have already been punished in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The penalty of sin is death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The punishment suffered by the Lord Jesus for us was also death; therefore, in the Lord Jesus I am already dead.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Otherwise, there is no saving way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To say that He died in my place is to say that I have died in Him and have been punished in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who trust in this fact will have this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The faith by which a sinner believes in the substitutionary death of the Lord Jesus is the believing into Christ to be joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although many times he may only see the problems regarding the penalty of sin and not have any realization of the aspect of the power of sin, this matter of being joined to the Lord is common to every believer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One who is not joined to the Lord has not believed in the Lord and has nothing to do with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Believing into the Lord in this way is to be joined to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To be joined to the Lord means to experience all that the Lord has experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What the Lord Jesus spoke in verses 14 and 15 of John 3 has made clear what it is to be joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is to be joined to Him in His crucifixion and His death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Each believer in the Lord Jesus at the least has been united with the Lord's death positionally.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But "if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection" Rom 6:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, everyone who believes in the substitutional death of the Lord Jesus has been raised up positionally with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although at the time he has not yet fully experienced the meaning of the Lord Jesus' resurrection, just as he has not yet entirely experienced the meaning of the Lord Jesus' death, God has raised him up with the Lord Jesus, and in the resurrection life of the Lord Jesus he has gained a new life and is born again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must avoid the thought that man ought to have the experience of dying and resurrecting with the Lord before he can be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the Bible, once a person believes in the Lord Jesus, he is born again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"But as many as received Him...who believe into His name...were begotten...of God" John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We ought to realize that our co-resurrection with the Lord is not an experience after regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our being born again is our co-resurrection with the Lord because the Lord's death in other words, our death with Him terminated the problem of our sinful life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then, at the resurrection of the Lord in other words, when we were resurrected with Him , He gave us a new life with which we began our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That is why the Bible says, "God...has regenerated us...through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead" 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This shows that every born-again Christian has already been raised up with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, the apostle Paul in Philippians 3 told us that every Christian still needs to pursue to know "the power of His resurrection" v. 10 . Many Christians are born again and have participated in the Lord's resurrection but lack the manifestation of the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, we must not confuse position with experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When a person believes in the Lord Jesus, although he is still very weak and ignorant, God has placed him in a position of being reckoned as having completely died, resurrected, and ascended with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those who are accepted in Christ are accepted just as Christ is; this is position.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, the believers may not necessarily have the experience of this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Positionally speaking, a believer in the Lord possesses all the experiences of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Experientially, at the minimum, he is born again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This rebirth is not because he has already experienced the Lord Jesus' death, resurrection, and ascension to a certain degree, but because he believes in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His position causes him to have the experience of being born again.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although in experience he still does not know the power of Christ's resurrection Phil 3:10 , he has already been made alive, raised, and seated in the heavenlies together with Christ Eph 2:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord" Prov 20:27, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At the time of regeneration the Holy Spirit comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He enters into man's spirit like the lighting of a lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the "new spirit" spoken of in Ezekiel 36:26.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because the old spirit was dead, the Holy Spirit puts the uncreated life of God inside it, causing it to have life and to live.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before regeneration, man's soul ruled over his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His "self" dominated his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His lust governed his body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The soul became the life of the spirit, the "self" became the life of the soul, and the lust became the life of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After man's regeneration, the Holy Spirit rules his spirit, causing his spirit to govern his soul, then through the soul to rule over his body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now the Holy Spirit becomes the life of the spirit, and the spirit becomes the life of the entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At the time of regeneration the Holy Spirit revives the human spirit and renews it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the Bible, regeneration refers to the step in which a man comes out of death and enters into life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This regeneration, like the physical birth, occurs only once, and once is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is at this time of rebirth that man receives God's own life, is born of God, and becomes God's child.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>"Being renewed" in the Bible refers to the Holy Spirit's work of increasingly filling and permeating our being with His life and thus completely overcoming our life in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is a lengthy, continuous, and progressive work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In such a regenerated one, the original order of the spirit and the soul is restored.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is another point we ought to pay attention to.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That is, regeneration not only restores us to the condition of Adam before his fall, but it also affords us something additional.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Adam had a "spirit," but that spirit was only created by God and did not contain the uncreated life of God Himself, as signified by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There was no life-relationship between Adam and God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As the angels were called sons of God, Adam was also called a son of God Luke 3:38 , because he was created directly by God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We who believe in the Lord Jesus are "begotten" of God John 1:12-13 and thus have a life relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The life of a father is the life inherited by the sons.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Since we are born of God, we automatically have the life of God 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If Adam had been willing to receive the life which God offered him by means of the tree of life, Adam would have had the eternal life, the uncreated life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>His spirit came from God and exists forever, but how this life would become everlasting depended on how he regarded God's command and how he made his choice.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What we Christians obtain at regeneration is God's life, a life which was possible for Adam to obtain, but he did not obtain it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Regeneration serves not only to restore man's spirit and soul from the original state of confusion and darkness but furthermore puts man in possession of the supernatural life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Man's deadened, fallen spirit is made alive by receiving God's life imparted through the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The basis upon which the Holy Spirit regenerates man is the cross please read John 3:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The eternal life in John 3:16 is the life of God which is put into man's spirit by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Because this life is God's life, which can never die, all who have been regenerated have this life and are said to "have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If God's life were to die, man's eternal life would immediately perish!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After regeneration, man's relationship with God is that of birth.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Regardless of what happens, once a man has been born of God, God cannot deny that He has begotten him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Therefore, man, once born of God, despite how long eternity may be, has a relationship and position which cannot be canceled.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Man obtains this through regeneration by believing in the Lord Jesus as Savior and not through his progress, spirituality, or holiness gained after believing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>What God gives to the regenerated ones is eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Therefore, this position and life can never be annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When man is regenerated, he obtains God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is the starting point of a Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is the minimum for every believer.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Whoever has not believed in the death of the Lord Jesus and received a supernatural life which he originally did not have, regardless of how zealously he may be progressing in the areas of religion, morality, and learning, is still a dead man in God's sight.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>All who do not have God's own life are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>With regeneration as the starting point, the spiritual life now has the possibility to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This rebirth is the first step in the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>At such a time the spiritual life is complete but not mature.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The capabilities of this life are complete and able to reach the highest plane.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>However, because this life is newly born, it is not grown-up or mature.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It is like a fruit which is green; the life is complete, but it is still unripe.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The completeness is in its life capabilities, not yet in all of its organic parts.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Man's regeneration is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>After regeneration there is still an immensely great capacity in God's life that will allow him to advance unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>From here on, the Holy Spirit can lead him forward until the body and soul are totally overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>TWO CATEGORIES OF CHRISTIANS</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The apostle in 1 Corinthians 3:1 classified all Christians as either spiritual or fleshy.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>A spiritual Christian is one who has the Holy Spirit dwelling in his spirit and ruling over his whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>What then is a fleshy one?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The flesh in the Bible signifies all of the nature and life of an unregenerated man the totality of the unregenerated man, including all the matters belonging to his sinful spirit, soul, and body Rom 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Therefore, a fleshy Christian is one who, having been reborn and having received God's life, is unable to overcome his flesh, and is instead overcome by his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We have already seen that in a fallen man, his spirit is deadened, and he is governed by his soul and body.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>A fleshy Christian, therefore, is one who follows his soul and body to sin, act, and behave.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If after regeneration, a believer remains for a prolonged period of time in the flesh, God's saving way will not be manifested to be perfected in him.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>It is when he grows in grace to become spiritual that salvation is perfected in him.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The saving way of Golgotha is that God has already prepared salvation for every sinner to be regenerated, and that every regenerated one may attain to the status of a spiritual man who is able to overcome the "old creation."</S>
