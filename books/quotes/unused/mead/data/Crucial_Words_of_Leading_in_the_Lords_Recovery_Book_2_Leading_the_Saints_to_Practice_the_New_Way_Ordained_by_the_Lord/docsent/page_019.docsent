   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NEEDING TO VISIT PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR GOSPEL PREACHING TO GAIN NEW ONES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the past few years of experimenting, we have discovered several factors that are important and effective in regard to preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first factor is door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Compared to the traditional way of preaching the gospel, door-knocking requires us to pay a higher price.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the past, when we preached the gospel, all we needed to do was make a few phone calls to invite people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now we need to go out personally to knock on people s doors.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The experienced ones know that it is difficult to knock on the doors of strangers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even if a stranger welcomes us into his home, it is not easy to begin a conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This requires that we pay a price; nevertheless, paying the price to knock on doors is guaranteed to be effective.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A team of three saints may visit people by knocking on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On average, out of twenty homes, they will be able to baptize at least one person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is certain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suppose that there is a church with one hundred saints meeting regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If twenty-five of them are divided into eight teams that consistently visit people for two hours every other week, they will be able to spend twenty-six weeks per year visiting people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If every team gains an average of one person each time they preach the gospel, they will gain two hundred eight people within one year.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This would be wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When a person engages in business, teaching, or a profession, he cannot succeed if his labor is inconsistent and intermittent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be successful one must be regular, consistent, and continual.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the process of door-knocking, we should not aim at being fast.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes the Lord may be merciful to us and give us a son of peace, one who has a very good response, at the first door we knock on.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this case, we should not leave too quickly but should talk with him for as long as two hours.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can talk with him about heaven, earth, God, the Spirit, the Savior, or any other matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As long as we do not annoy him, we should talk with him earnestly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the saying, we should strike while the iron is hot.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must grasp the opportunity to work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our experiments have produced fruit; this is why we have the assurance to endeavor to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>NEEDING TO HELP THE NEW ONES</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>BY ESTABLISHING MEETINGS IN THEIR HOMES</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a team of three gains one new one every week, the team should take care of these new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is easy for three people to take care of a home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After a second week, they may gain another one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then there will be two new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A week later they may gain another one, and thus there will be three new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As they gain more and more people, there will be a need for them to bring other brothers and sisters with them, who can begin to take care of the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In a church of one hundred people, twenty-five may knock on doors, and another fifteen to twenty-five may go with the door-knocking ones to take care of the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This should be easy for the saints to do because the price is relatively small.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moreover, since a home meeting has a fixed time and place, the saints simply need to join themselves to those who have been door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After those who knock on doors have gained a good number of people, they should then bring some brothers and sisters who can take care of the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this way they can have face-to-face fellowship with the new ones who need the care.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The door-knocking saints can introduce their brothers and sisters to the new ones by saying, These are our brothers and sisters in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We three have gained many people through door-knocking, and we cannot take care of everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As a result, we have asked these brothers and sisters to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We want to introduce you to them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They will take care of you from now on.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this way, those under their care will be handed over to others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is truly feasible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One matter we need to pay attention to is that the first home meeting should be longer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If possible, within the first month we should have ten home meetings with the new ones; we may visit them every three days for ten times.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These ten visits will be truly effective.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After the first month, we may be able to reduce our visits to once a week; then after approximately three months, they will be brought into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If three months are not enough, half a year may be sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The new ones should first be brought into the home meetings; then through the small group meetings, they may be brought to the district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This can be done within half a year.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to realize that if we are able to bring a person into the church life within half a year, this will have a very positive impact on the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this way we will save much manpower so that many can continue to knock on doors and gain many more people.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Based on these figures, if we are consistent, we will reap a hundredfold increase; that is, we will double our number within one year.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even if we do not double our number, a thirtyfold increase would be very good.</S>
