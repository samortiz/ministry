<ol class="upper-roman" start="3">
<li>The faith of the believers:
	<ol class="upper-alpha" start="24">
	<li>Faith is the first issue of the Lord&rsquo;s superabounding grace&mdash;1 Tim. 1:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The superabounding grace of the Lord is the processed and consummated Triune God to be within us our enjoyment of the divine unsearchable riches in Christ&mdash;John 1:17; Eph. 3:8.</li>
		<li>The enjoyment of the Lord&rsquo;s superabounding grace issues in all the matters related to the divine life&mdash;Rom. 5:17, 21.</li>
		<li>The first issue is faith that links us to the unsearchable riches of the Divine Trinity and which is the source of all the virtues of a believer&mdash;Eph. 3:17a; 2 Pet. 1:5-8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Faith is the indicator of the believers&rsquo; life in the enjoyment of the Divine Trinity&mdash;1 Thes. 1:3, 5, 7-8; Rom. 1:8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The faith of the Thessalonians was highly appraised by the apostle&mdash;1 Thes. 1:3.</li>
		<li>Their faith in its much assurance became an indicator of their abundant enjoyment of life in Christ&mdash;v. 5.</li>
		<li>Their faith made them a pattern to the believing ones in Christ and became a part of the preaching of the believing ones in Christ&mdash; vv. 7-8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The linking faith qualifies the overcomers to meet Christ in His triumphant return&mdash;Luke 18:8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ expects to find, at His coming back, the ones who live by the linking faith.</li>
		<li>The believers who live an overcoming and exulting life by the linking faith will be found by Christ at His return as the treasures ready to receive the salvation of their souls as the end (result) of their faith&mdash;1 Pet. 1:8-9.</li>
		<li>They will be rewarded by Christ with the co-kingship and the top enjoyment of the divine life with Him in the millennium&mdash;Rev. 20:4, 6; Matt. 25:21, 23.</li>

<p>Prayer: Lord, how we praise You that You are the faithful One. Lord, You make us believe in You and trust in You. Again, Lord, we are here with You. Thank You that all the days You have been with us moment by moment. So we trust in You for the speaking and for the listening. Be our speaking and be our listening. We are not, but You are. Grant us the utterance, the up-to-date utterance, the new utterance, the instant and the constant utterance. Amen.</p>
<p>In this message we would like to fellowship three more points in our crystallization-study of the essence of the faith of the believers. This makes twenty-six points which we will have covered concerning faith.</p>
