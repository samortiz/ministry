   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS BEING OVER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we ascend to the mountain, to a higher place, we see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here we have God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the time the Lord was transfigured on the mountain, He manifested Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the mountain the disciples beheld the true image of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They also saw Him talking to Moses and Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Peter was a talkative person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are many descendants of Peter today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church is full of men who are as addicted to talking as Peter was!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They talk, but they do not realize what they have said.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As usual, Peter was talkative on that day; he could not keep quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this wonderful revelation, the true image of Christ Jesus was revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The disciples knew the Son of God, and they saw the most important figures in the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was a great opportunity for them to express something.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Peter asked whether the Lord wanted him to set up three tents, "one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah" Luke 9:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Peter's mind the Lord Jesus was the greatest, and the first place should go to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But after Him there were still a number two and a number three, who also deserved tents.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the Bible says that Peter did not know what he was saying v. 33 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moses represents the law, and Elijah represents the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The two represent the law and the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Peter's knowledge Christ was the center, but there also was a place for the law and the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But God could not tolerate such a thought.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If this thought remained, the Christian faith would have been over.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a consequence, God immediately unveiled His will from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God surrounded them with a bright cloud and took away Moses and Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the disciples lifted up their heads, they saw Jesus only.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the same time, they heard a voice from heaven, saying, "This is My Son, the Beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hear Him!"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Mark 9:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God was telling them that it was not their time to speak, and that they should be quiet and listen.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They should not have any say in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They should only listen to the Beloved Son.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Being a Christian has to do with knowing Christ in an inward way; it has nothing to do with the outward law and prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The law is the outward ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is written on the tablets of stone, and it tells us what we should and should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The law gives us an outward standard of right and wrong; it tells us what is and is not correct in an outward sense.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many people do not know the inward leading of the Spirit, and they have never learned to obey the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They say what others say and deny what others deny.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Bible says that such and such is right, they repeat it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But they have no inward revelation and have never learned to obey the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE LEADING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>WITH THE TEACHING OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A brother once asked me, "I want to do a certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What is the biblical teaching concerning it?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I said, "In the name of the Lord, let me ask you a question.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you do not have the teaching of the Bible, does this mean that you do not know God's will at all?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Old Testament age men were given the law.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They knew only these few items of the law, and the standard of right and wrong was according to these items.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Old Testament age there were ordinances; there was not the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But the New Testament age is different.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the New Testament age the Spirit lives within men and leads them to obey God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In contrast to the Old Testament age, the Spirit is living, while the law is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is very dangerous for a man to know only ordinances without knowing anything about the leading of the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the Old Testament age there was only the Holy Bible; there was not the Holy Spirit in an inward way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But in the New Testament age the Holy Spirit is within man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is here in addition to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He tells us what is right and what is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a man only considers the teaching of the Bible without considering the Holy Spirit, he is living in the Old Testament age, not in the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We do not despise the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I am only saying that as precious as the Bible is, it cannot be compared with the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Brothers and sisters, if we agree that the New Testament age is better than the Old Testament age, we have to agree also that the Holy Spirit is better than the Holy Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some Christians think that being free from the Ten Commandments means being free from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Little do they realize that the law is a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When they are under the law, they can have no confidence to do anything apart from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The law tells them what is right and what is wrong; other than what has been told to them, they know nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Bible is a wonderful book.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But even the Bible cannot be a substitute for the Spirit; it cannot be the standard of our walk or the yardstick of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Bible is important, but we must have the leading of the Holy Spirit in addition to the truth of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Once a brother who is in fellowship with us was talking to another brother in a denomination concerning the truth of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our brother was behaving very much like a member of the Baptist Church because he would not talk about anything other than baptism by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The minute he opened his mouth, he would persuade others to believe in baptism by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When he spoke to the brother in the denomination about baptism, the brother in the denomination was convinced by his speaking about baptism by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He came and asked me to baptize him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I asked him why he wanted to be baptized, and he answered that the Bible says that a person should be immersed, not sprinkled.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I asked him whether he had prayed about it or whether the Spirit had led him to do it, and he answered, "As long as the Bible says it, I am going to be baptized."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I said, "Please go home.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I will not baptize you, because you do not have the revelation."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This person only had the law.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Brothers and sisters, our work today is not to help people obey the Bible; rather, it is to obey the biblical truth through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I am not despising the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I am only saying that we should have the Bible plus the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Having the Bible without the Spirit is the same as being in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Today we do not need the law; we need the living Christ living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have to follow His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Bible is not a law.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Many people have made the Bible a law.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Some read the Bible and receive revelation and guidance through the Spirit, and they have life.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But some have taken the Bible merely as an outward law, a kind of standard of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is a matter of life and death, the difference between Judaism and Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we are not clear about this, we cannot expect to see a great revival or any great work here in Southeast Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>There was a doctor in Tsinan, Shantung province, who had a maid servant.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The maid servant visited Shanghai once and was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When she saw the sisters covering their heads in the meetings, she asked what it meant.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Someone told her that they were obeying the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>When she heard this, she also covered her head.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>After she returned home, her mistress asked why she was covering her head.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>She did not know what to say, and so she answered, "I cover my head because the Bible says so.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Others are covering their heads, so I cover my head as well.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I do not know why I should do this."</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When I was at their house, her mistress told me about the head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>I asked that she be sent to me right away.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>When she came, I said, "On behalf of the church in Shanghai I was a brother in the church in Shanghai at that time , I forbid you to cover your head again, because we do not have head-covering sisters like you among us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Your head covering is a law."</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We must be clear that if a person pays attention to outward ordinances and teachings, he can turn the spiritual Bible into a dead book of law.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>On that day God told Peter to hear His beloved Son and to forget about the law and the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>His word for Peter is for the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Thank God that Christ is living not only in heaven but also within us.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We should listen not to the law but to the living guidance of the Christ within.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The law is dead ordinances, while the prophets are living persons.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The law cannot spell out the standard of right and wrong for every move we make.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Should I have rice or porridge for dinner tonight?</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>How should the meetings of the church in Singapore be conducted?</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Answers to such questions cannot be found in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The ordinances of the law are not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>All laws are good, but they do not cover everything.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>This is why there were not only dead laws in the Old Testament but also living prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>What one could not find in the law, he inquired of God through the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The prophets fulfilled what was lacking in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>One could not go to God directly; he had to seek counsel through the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The prophets conveyed God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Being freed from the Ten Commandments alone is not freedom from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>The law includes all the other outward ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Being according to the prophets means to walk according to what other men say.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Failing to understand God's will by oneself and seeking counsel from others is walking according to the principle of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Thank God, not only does the law have to go, but the prophets also have to go.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Moses must go, and Elijah must also go.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Both the law and the prophets are over.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>The work of the prophets is to prophesy, preach, and inquire of God's will on behalf of others.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>But the prophets are gone, and we cannot depend on any men to inquire of God for us any longer.</S>
