<p>We must also meet to remember the Lord and worship God. This is a crucial, basic principle which we have to practice. In the church meeting we must do two things&mdash;remember our redeeming Lord and worship our God the Father. We remember the Lord by two means&mdash;by breaking and eating the bread and by drinking the cup (1 Cor. 11:24-25). This should not be something official or formal; it must be real. This eating and drinking indicates our enjoyment of the processed Lord in His death and resurrection. It is not a mass or holy communion. It is altogether an enjoyment through partaking of the processed Christ through His death and in His resurrection. Whenever we remember the Lord, we have to be in His resurrection through His death that we may enjoy Him as a feast. Furthermore, this feast is constituted with His body and blood.</p>
<p>Although we may know this, we still have many newcomers and new ones added among us. This teaching should be carried on all the time. We should train the members in the church to know how to remember the Lord. This is more important than the teaching, the preaching, and the prayer. This is to remember Him by enjoying Him.</p>
<p>At the same time we should worship God the Father. This worship is not in the way of Christianity, the traditional way of worship. Hebrews 2:12 reveals a very particular worship to God. This is the worship to the Father by the Son, not only in the church but through the church and from within the church. He says, &ldquo;I will declare Your name to My brothers.&rdquo; Then He changed brothers to a synonym, saying, &ldquo;In the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise unto You.&rdquo; To sing praises to the Father is the worship to the Father, yet this is a very particular worship. This is the church, constituted with all the believers, worshipping God with Christ in them as the worshipping Person. Have you ever heard that the believers constituting the church worship God with Christ in them as their worshipping Person? The real worship the Father wants today is His Son worshipping Him from within all the believers as the church. This is quite deep. This is not just to have a worship with certain hymns and bowing of the head and kneeling down. The only verse that you can find telling us so particularly how to worship the Father in the church is Hebrews 2:12. Certain verses tell us to worship or serve God in spirit and by the Spirit (John 4:24; Phil. 3:3), but even those verses are not as clear as this verse. The particular way revealed in the New Testament to worship God the Father is in Hebrews 2:12. This is what the Father wants&mdash;a genuine, real worship which is the worship of all the saints of God with the firstborn Son in them as the real worshipping Person.</p>
<p>Hymn 52 in our hymnal is a very good hymn. It indicates that we are worshipping the Father with the Son. Yet that hymn is not up to the highest standard. It does not give any indication that we worship the Father with the Son inside of us. This hymn says that He leads the praise, but there is no indication that the Son is worshipping the Father within us. The Brethren were brought on further, but after over half a century we are now somewhat advanced. Standing on their shoulders, we have been lifted higher. Today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we should not follow the way of worship from the past. We must come back to see what is revealed in the New Testament economy. This is the worship we need to render to God our Father, not less than every Lord&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETING TO PRAY<br />
AND TO READ THE WORD OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>Lastly, we meet to pray and read the Word. Colossians 4:16 says, &ldquo;And when this letter is read among you, cause that it may be read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you also read the one from Laodicea.&rdquo; Perhaps many of us did not realize that this reading was a reading in the meeting. It does not refer to reading by passing the letter to each one of the members. Rather, it is in a gathering. To read the Epistle to the Colossians in the meeting is simply to read the Bible, to read the Word of the Lord.</p>
<p>Every church needs some training regarding the meetings. You must set up at least one week to gather all the saints together. You need to spend at least six nights, Monday through Saturday, to train the saints according to the basic principles of meeting, to train them to meet in the way of the New Testament economy, not in the way of Christianity, in the religious, traditional way. We must uplift the standard of our meetings.</p>
<p>Do not forget that to set up any way for meeting which is not according to the revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy always leads to opinion and division. Be careful concerning this. Opinion can result in division. Do not easily propose any way to meet.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 08: The Life-Pulse of the Lord's Present Move &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
