   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO PARTICIPATE IN GOD'S BEING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Next, the God-men have the divine right to participate in God's being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our basis for saying this is Paul's word in 2 Corinthians 3:18 about our being transformed into the Lord's image "even as from the Lord Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that the work of transformation is done not by something of the Lord Spirit but by the Lord Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, we are being transformed with God's very being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Ephesians 3:8 Paul speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ, indicating that these riches have been dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The unsearchable riches of Christ are the riches of Christ's being, the riches of what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For the unsearchable riches of Christ to be dispensed into us means that we participate not only in God's life, nature, and mind but also in His being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>V. TO PARTICIPATE IN GOD'S IMAGE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As God-men we also have the divine right to participate in God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we are being "transformed into the same image."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In God's creation man was made in God's image in an outward way, but the image into which we are being transformed is something inward.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be transformed into the same image is to be conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ as the firstborn Son of God, to be made the same as He is Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Transformation is a kind of metabolism.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The metabolism involved in transformation is comparable to that which takes place in our physical body after we eat, digest, and assimilate food.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Transformation is the metabolic function of the divine life in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We Christians, who are God-men, all have the Lord Spirit within us, and the Lord Spirit is in the process of carrying out a metabolic change in our being, transforming us into the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To be metabolically transformed into the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ is to participate in God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>TO PARTICIPATE IN GOD'S GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, we will be brought into God's glory to participate in His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hebrews 2:10 says that God is leading many sons into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul refers to this in Romans 8:30: "Those whom He predestinated, these He also called; and those whom He called, these He also justified; and those whom He justified, these He also glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Glorification is the step in God's complete salvation in which God will completely saturate our body with the glory of His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this way He will transfigure our body, conforming it to the resurrected, glorious body of His Son Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the ultimate step in God's organic salvation, wherein God obtains a full expression, which will be manifested ultimately in the New Jerusalem.</S>
