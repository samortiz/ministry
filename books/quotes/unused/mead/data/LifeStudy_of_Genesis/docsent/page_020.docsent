   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4 The Separation of Light from Darkness 1:4-5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first separation was between light and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This was the fourth requirement for generating life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This separation was for the purpose of discerning day from night, causing the light to be set apart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is more difficult to understand, but an illustration will make it clear.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Immediately after you were saved, you didn't have any discernment and were unable to distinguish between light and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After you were saved awhile and had gone on with the Lord, gradually there was a separation within you and you had the discernment to say, "This is light and that is darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I will keep the light, but not the darkness."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before we were saved, we had no day at all, only a night of twenty-four hours.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We were constantly in the night, a dark and cloudy night with no stars.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But, praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From the day we were saved, something began to dawn like the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Perhaps your first day was only four hours long, and then evening came again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Regardless of how long it was, you had your first day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After ten hours of night, you came to a meeting and in that meeting you saw the dawn.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was another day and you shouted, "Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then you went to school or to work and evening came again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Don't be disappointed evening is a sign that morning will come.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Also, when you are in the morning, be prepared for the evening to come again.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Genesis 1:5, it doesn't say morning and evening; it says evening and morning because we came out of the night.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"And evening and morning were the first day."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>With the young people the night is always longer, but with the old folks the night is shorter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because I am experienced, my spiritual day is longer than yours.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>My spiritual day is nineteen hours and my spiritual night only five hours.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we get into the New Jerusalem, there will be no night at all Rev 21:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Perhaps your day is just ten hours and your night fourteen hours.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You need to grow for your days to be longer and your nights to be shorter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need the separation of day and night, the discernment between light and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 2 Corinthians 6:14, Paul asks, "What fellowship has light with darkness?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This word must also refer to Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God has separated light from darkness; so don't try to mix them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Light has nothing to do with darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What kind of fellowship can light have with darkness?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that we are children of light and that we shouldn't be yoked or mingled with the people living in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must maintain the separation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are children of darkness and we are children of light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all must say, "What communion can there be between light and darkness?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a real separation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we keep this requirement, we will have more light.</S>
