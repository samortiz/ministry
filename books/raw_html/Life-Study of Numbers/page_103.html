<H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) To the Sons and Daughters of the Priests</H2><P>The heave offering and wave offering were given not only to the priests but also to the sons (the stronger ones) and daughters (the weaker ones) of the priests. This indicates that as long as we belong to the priestly family, whether we are strong or weak, we can enjoy such a Christ. If we are weak, the enjoyment of Christ will strengthen us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) To Be Eaten by Every Clean<br>One Who Was in the Priests' Houses</H2><P>"Every one who is clean in your house may eat of it" (Num. 18:11b). Here "house" denotes a family. Every clean person who belonged to a priestly house, a priestly family, could eat of the heave offering and the wave offering.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. All the Fat of the Oil,<br>All the Best of the New Wine and of the Grain,<br>the Firstfruits Given to God, All the First Ripe&#151;<br>to Be Eaten by Every Clean One<br>Who Was in the Priests' Houses</H2><P>"All the best of the oil, and all the best of the new wine and of the grain, their firstfruits which they give to Jehovah, I give to you. The first ripe of all that is in their land, which they bring to Jehovah, shall be yours; every one who is clean in your house may eat of it" (vv. 12-13). Literally, the Hebrew word translated "best" means fat. The fat of the oil signifies Christ's best part, which was for God, and the best of the new wine and of the grain signify the Christ who was poured out to God. The firstfruits and the first ripe of all that is in the land both signify the resurrected Christ. These portions were given to be eaten by the priests and by every clean one who was in the priests' houses.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. Every Devoted Thing in Israel</H2><P>"Every devoted thing in Israel shall be yours" (v. 14). These devoted things also refer to Christ.</P><P>We need to give ourselves to know Christ. The Apostle Paul desired "to know Him and the power of His resurrection" (Phil. 3:10). This "Him" is too great; He is the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:23). Because we have the Bible, it is possible for us to know such a One. I hope that many of the saints, especially the young people, will devote themselves to know Christ not only according to the New Testament revelation but even more according to the Old Testament typology.</P>
