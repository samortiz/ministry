<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Serving Not by Way of Compulsion, but Willingly,<br>according to God; Not Seeking Gain<br>by Base Means, but Eagerly</H2><P>The elders serve not by way of compulsion, but willingly, according to God; not seeking gain by base means, but eagerly (1 Pet. 5:2b). Because the church is God's allotment and is where the elders' love is, whatever they say and do for the church and in the church is not something done by compulsion. This is the way with parents, especially with mothers. The best mothers never complain. They are always willing. The elders serve willingly and eagerly, according to God. They should not serve in the way of seeking gain by base means. The elders should not care for money. They should simply be for the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Needing to Be the Lord's Messengers<br>as Shining Stars</H2><P>The elders need to be the Lord's messengers as shining stars (Rev. 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14). A messenger is one that brings a message from the Lord to His people. Every elder should be one that always speaks for the Lord and brings some word, some message, from the Lord. The elders also should be the shining stars. To say that there should not be elders in the church is anarchy. However, it is wrong for some to be elders legally, simply according to the letter. Some elders may not have a proper knowledge of the Lord's heart and may not have a message, a word, from the Lord to the church. This kind of elder is not adequate. An elder must be apt to teach (1 Tim. 3:2). To be apt to teach is to bring a word, a message, from the Lord to His people. One who does this is a messenger. Such a one is not simply speaking with his mouth, but also shining by what he does and what he is. The messenger himself is a star. A star simply shines. On the one hand, we need to be messengers, and on the other hand, we need to be the shining stars.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Reward to the Elders</H2><P>The reward to the elders will be the unfading crown of glory, which they will receive at the manifestation of the Chief Shepherd (1 Pet. 5:4). In 1 Peter 5 there is a great promise concerning the reward to the elders. At the apostles' time, crowns were given to victors in athletic games and warfare (1 Cor. 9:25; 2 Tim. 4:8). Those were corruptible crowns, whose glory faded. The crown given by the Lord to the faithful elders will be a reward for their loyal service. The glory of the crown will never fade. It will be a portion of the glory for the overcomers' enjoyment in the manifestation of the kingdom of God and Christ (2 Pet. 1:11).</P>
