   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING ALL GENUINE CHRISTIANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the church we receive all genuine Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We receive those who speak in tongues and those who do not speak in tongues; those who have been immersed and those who have been sprinkled; those who wear a head covering and those who do not wear a head covering; those who practice foot-washing and those who do not practice foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In fact, we would receive even Catholic nuns and priests who are true believers in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We receive all Christians, no matter what kind of Christians they are.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It seems that no two Christians are the same in opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They all have different opinions about various matters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Praise the Lord that in the church we do not touch these differing opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all have locked our opinions away, knowing that if we bring them into the church, they will cause division.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We only care that people believe in the Lord Jesus, are saved, and love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We would encourage them all to go on by loving the Lord, by growing in His life, and by realizing the proper church life to satisfy the desire of God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>UNIVERSAL FELLOWSHIP, NOT ISOLATED FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There may be some Christian groups who claim to have no particular name, fellowship, or teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They declare that they hate any name other than the name of the Lord Jesus and that they do not hold any particular fellowship or teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, they receive all kinds of genuine Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If this is the case, then we must check three other matters, none of which is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Firstly, we must see what kind of fellowship they have.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although they may not have a particular fellowship, their fellowship may be isolated, not universal.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although they receive all true Christians, they do not fellowship with any other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Their fellowship is very limited and isolated in their own realm.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not universal or even fully local.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This makes them a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Such a group is not a local church it is a local sect.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This matter is very delicate, and few are able to perceive it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is easy to see that those with a particular name, a particular fellowship, and a particular teaching are sects.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But it is difficult to see that a group without these things may still be a sect if its fellowship is isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although such a group claims to be the church in its locality, it is actually a local sect.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>NO SEPARATE ADMINISTRATION</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There may be a group that has no particular name, teaching, or fellowship, and whose fellowship is not isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nevertheless, they may insist on having a separate administration, a separate eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This separate eldership constitutes them a division.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No matter how many believers there may be in a particular church, the church in that locality must be under one eldership with one administration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The city of Anaheim has one mayor and one city hall.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the city of New York, which is vastly greater than Anaheim, still has just one mayor and one city hall.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the city of New York had more than one mayor, it would be a sign that the city had been divided.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although there were tens of thousands of believers in Jerusalem Acts 21:20 and although they met in various homes, they had only one set of elders.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There was still just one eldership, one administration.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Suppose there is in Anaheim a group of Christians whose practice closely resembles ours.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They have no particular name, fellowship, or teaching, and their fellowship is open to all, to the whole church throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nevertheless, they insist on keeping a separate eldership with a separate administration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because that separate administration is a cause of division, this group is also a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If there are two administrations in a city, then there are two churches in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is like having two mayors and two administrations in one city.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If this is the case, then that city must be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From all these points we can see that it is not a simple matter to know the church.</S>
