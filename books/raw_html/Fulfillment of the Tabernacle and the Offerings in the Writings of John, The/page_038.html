<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SERPENT AND THE BRIDE</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 3:9-16, 22-36</h1><p>It is according to the Scriptures to speak of the serpent and the bride. We may say that, considered as a whole, the Bible unveils to us the matter of the serpent and the bride. Some Christians may say that they have never heard that the Bible tells us about the serpent and the bride. They know that the Bible reveals God the Creator, and it also reveals Christ, our Redeemer, Savior, and Lord. It is, of course, correct to say that the Bible reveals God and Christ. However, this may be a rather superficial understanding of the Bible. It is superficial to see merely that Jesus Christ is our Savior. If we have a deeper understanding of the Word, we shall see that Christ was also a brass serpent (3:14), a serpent in form but without the poisonous nature of a serpent. Actually, it is because Christ became a brass serpent that He could be our Savior. If He had not become such a brass serpent, He could not have been our Savior.<p>John 1:29 speaks of Christ as the Lamb of God. But if we go deeper into the Word, we shall see that the Lamb of God in 1:29 is the brass serpent in 3:14. The Lamb satisfies the requirements of God’s righteousness, holiness, and glory, for the Lamb is pure, perfect, and without blemish. The brass serpent represents us, for we are serpentine people, not lambs. As the Lord was speaking to Nicodemus, He indicated to him that He Himself would be lifted up as the brass serpent to be Nicodemus’ Substitute. Therefore, the Lamb of God satisfies God’s requirements, and the brass serpent represents us. Because we are serpentine and are not lambs, we need Christ as the brass serpent to be our Substitute. This brass serpent is the real sin offering.<h2 class=head1>THE IMPORTANCE OF EVE</h2><p>The story of the Bible is a story of the serpent and the bride. In Genesis 2 we have the bride, and in Genesis 3 we have the serpent. The serpent did not come to contact the man, but he contacted the woman, the bride in Genesis 2. God had indicated that it was not good for Adam to live alone. If Adam had remained alone, nothing could have been produced for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. God needs a people. Without a wife, Adam could not have produced this people. Therefore, God increased Adam with a wife.<p>We know that Eve was not a separate creation, having nothing to do with Adam. Rather, Eve was made from a part of Adam’s being, from his rib. At first Adam was alone. Then God used Adam’s rib to bring forth the increase of Adam. The result was a couple to produce a people for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. Eve, therefore, is vital and crucial in fulfilling God’s purpose.<p>The sisters are very important in the church life. In a sense, the sisters are more vital and necessary for the fulfillment of God’s purpose than the brothers are. This is the reason the old serpent often comes to visit the sisters. They are his special food.<p>In Genesis 3 the serpent visited the bride and succeeded in capturing her. Then through the woman he also gained the man. But God is greater, higher, and wiser than the serpent. In His judgment upon the serpent, God indicated that the woman would bring forth a seed to bruise the serpent’s head: “And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel” (Gen. 3:15). Furthermore, there is an indication in Genesis 3:21 that the seed of the woman would not only bruise the head of the serpent, but also become righteousness to the very ones who were poisoned by him: “Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.” These coats of skins typify Christ as righteousness for fallen man.
