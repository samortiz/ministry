   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Paul Becoming the One to Usher in the New Testament Ministry Completing the Word of God the Revelation of God's New Testament Economy</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In principle, Paul was a person more or less the same as Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He brought in the New Testament ministry and completed the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Colossians 1:25 he said, "I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To complete the word of God is to complete God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This revelation centers mainly on two things: the mystery of God, which is Christ, and the mystery of Christ, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On these two points, Paul completed the word of God and revealed to us God's economy in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Building Up the Body of Christ the Habitation of God in the Universe</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moses' building of the Tabernacle was a type.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the New Testament, the Apostle Paul's building up of the Body of Christ was a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul Receiving the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 2 Timothy 4:18 Paul said, "The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto His heavenly kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, Paul was also able to enter into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Please remember that when he spoke this word, he was being rejected by all the churches in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, he knew that though he was rejected by earthly men, God would save him into His kingdom, because he had given up the world to gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE COMING JOY RESULTING FROM BEING SPENT FOR CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second Corinthians 12:15 says, "But I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your souls."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is worthwhile for us to spend and be utterly spent for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul said that he would most gladly spend for the saints not only his money, but himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He spent both his money and himself for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He put out all his money, time, energy, and even his own life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His labor for the saints was such that it was unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today we should not keep our money in our own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, we should give it away for Christ's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not only do we have to give our money, but we have to give ourselves as well.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Being Welcomed into the Eternal Tabernacles by Those Who Receive Help from You</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Luke 16:9 the Lord said, "Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Mammon belongs to Satan's world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is unrighteous in position and in existence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Satanic world passes away, mammon will become useless in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this reason, we have to seize the opportunity today to make friends by means of our mammon, which is to spend our money to preach the gospel and to bring sinners to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the Lord comes back, all those who have been saved by the gospel through your help will line up to welcome you into the eternal tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you have never brought one to salvation, on that day others will have welcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But you will be all alone and will be put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we are busy day in and day out all day long here on earth, in the end what eternal value will there be to our labor?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The only result that is everlasting is our sacrifice for the Lord in bringing others to salvation and helping them to be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Having the Ones Who Received Help as One's Crown and Joy at the Coming of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Lord comes back, there will be those who line up to welcome Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There will also be those who are Paul's crown and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 1 Thessalonians 2:19-20 Paul said, "For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Are not even you, before our Lord Jesus at His coming?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For you are our glory and joy."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Lord comes back, those who have been saved through you will line up to welcome you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who have been edified, supplied, shepherded, and led by you will even be the crown on your head and will be your joy before the Lord and before the whole universe.</S>
