<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;This cup is the new covenant established in My blood, which is being poured out for you&rdquo; (Luke 22:20). The cup of the Lord&rsquo;s table is not only a doctrine; it implies the truth. In the Bible <em>cup</em> means &ldquo;portion.&rdquo; For example, the cup of salvation is the portion of God&rsquo;s salvation (Psa. 116:13), and the cup of blessing is the portion of God&rsquo;s blessing (1 Cor. 10:16). Negatively, the cup of God&rsquo;s wrath is the portion of God&rsquo;s wrath (Rev. 14:10). Thus, a cup is quite significant, whereas a bottle conveys no truth.</p>
<p>Whenever we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table and see the loaf, we should see the Body of Christ and thank the Lord for making us members of His Body. All that Christ is and has accomplished is in His Body, in which we are participating. When we see the cup, we should thank the Lord for such a portion of blessing that has been given to us. God Himself is in this portion as our blessing. Thus, the cup is related to the truth of the Lord&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>We are not for keeping forms. Rather, we are for practicing the truth and apprehending the reality. By partaking of the loaf, we participate in the Body of Christ. By drinking the cup, we receive the divine portion given to us by our redeeming God. There is truth in these outward practices.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO KNOW AND PRACTICE THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>The young brothers and sisters in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery need to learn the truth. The United States has become a strong nation because it has a strong constitution. Even the president must follow the Constitution. The church should be like this. We care for the truth. The truth is the &ldquo;constitution&rdquo; of the church. If we follow persons rather than the truth, the church cannot be strong.</p>
<p>The young brothers and sisters must spend time to study the Word of God in order to know the truth. First Timothy 4:3 mentions &ldquo;those who believe and have full knowledge of the truth.&rdquo; We need not only to believe in the Lord Jesus but also to know the truth. Therefore, we all need to study the Bible to know the truth, not merely the doctrines. In 3:15 Paul says that the church is the pillar and base of the truth. The church includes every believer. God&rsquo;s truth today rests upon the church, including the young people. Everyone in the church should bear the truth. We are the pillar and base of God&rsquo;s truth.</p>
<p>Suppose a Christian speaker tells the saints in a large church that they should take the lead and that the other churches should be subject to them. This may seem to be a good idea. However, placing one church over others is something of organization and hierarchy, which insult the headship of Christ. If we do not have the adequate, thorough knowledge of the truth, it is difficult for us to have the necessary discernment in such matters.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 14:29 says, &ldquo;As to prophets, two or three should speak, and the others discern.&rdquo; When anyone is speaking, all the brothers and sisters should exercise discernment. If we all are watching over a speaker in this way, we will be protected. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we care only for Christ, and Christ is the truth, the reality. In order to learn the truth and be brought to the full knowledge of the truth, we need to spend time in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRUTH LEADING TO GODLINESS</h2>
<p>The truth leads to godliness. First Timothy 3:15b-16a says, &ldquo;The church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth. And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh.&rdquo; Christ first ascended to the heavens and then was preached among the nations. However, in verse 16 <em>taken up in glory</em> is listed after <em>preached among the nations.</em> Therefore, <em>taken up in glory</em> refers also to the church&rsquo;s rapture. This indicates that the manifestation of God in the flesh mentioned in this verse refers not only to Christ but also to the church. It is logical to say that the manifestation of God in the flesh is both Christ and the church, for Christ is the Head and the church is His Body. If the Head, Christ, is the manifestation of God in the flesh, surely the church, His Body, also is the manifestation of God in the flesh.</p>
<p>The mystery of godliness is God manifested in the flesh. Godliness is simply to manifest God. Verse 15, which concerns the church being the pillar and base of the truth, being followed by verse 16, which concerns godliness, indicates that the truth leads to the manifestation of God. Whenever we practice the truth, the result will be the manifestation of God in the flesh.</p>
<p>We should not argue about doctrinal points. If we argue, we will become disoriented. We only need to know and practice the truth. Truth leads to godliness, which is the manifestation of God in the flesh. We should care for reality, which leads to godliness. We are the witnesses of the Lord Jesus (Acts 1:8), and our living should be a testimony of Jesus. Whatever we do and say and the way we act should cause others to see God manifested in us. This is the truth leading to godliness. We care for this truth, this reality, which is Christ as the embodiment of our Triune God. This is the proper way to practice the church life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Healthy Word &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
