   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTY-FOUR A LIVING FAITH Date: August 7, 1937</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Singapore</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Mark 11:24 FAITH AND OBEDIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During the past few evenings we have seen four things concerning the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen the blood, the flesh, the crucifixion, and the bearing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have already seen the first two items in detail, concerning how Christ propitiated our sins with His blood and how He crucified the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The blood and the crucifixion are related to our being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The flesh and the bearing of the cross are related to Christ being in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The work of Christ can be divided into two parts: we in Him and He in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In John 15:4 the Lord said, "Abide in Me and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first two items of the work of Christ relate to "Abide in Me."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The last two items relate to "I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The blood and the crucifixion relate to what we have obtained in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The flesh and the bearing of the cross, which we will talk about, relate to what Christ will accomplish within us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order for us to be in Christ, we must believe, and in order for Christ to be in us, we must obey.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Believing and obeying are the two most important matters to a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Believing means believing that we are already in Christ and that we are already one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All that He has is ours, and all of His experiences are our experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A living faith believes that all that Christ has is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, Christ being in us requires not only faith but also obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to obey His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes He works in us by urging us and sometimes by stopping us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes when we remain still, He lets us know what we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes when we act by our flesh, He stops us inwardly and discourages us from doing what we should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord is either urging or stopping us all the time from within.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Believing and obeying mean that we are willing to go along with His urging and stopping.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Very often we sense a voice that is not quite a voice, a feeling that is not quite a feeling; it is something that we cannot see, hear, or touch, yet something quite visible, audible, and touchable.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This something within us tells us what we should or should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Often when we talk too much, this something within will stop us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Obedience means obeying this something.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not just obeying the Scriptures but also obeying this inward leading.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to live an overcoming life, one must know what faith and obedience are.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If there is no living faith or obedience, we will only have doctrines in our mind; there will be nothing in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A Christian should receive all that is in Christ through faith and receive all that Christ is in us through obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The way of victory consists of two things faith and obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The blood is related to faith rather than obedience because the blood is a work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ's work can only be obtained by faith, not by obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Similarly, the crucifixion of the old man is by faith, not by obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must exercise our faith to believe that we are already in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED THEM,</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>AND YOU WILL HAVE THEM"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Tonight let us consider the meaning of a living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only after we know what a living faith is can we exercise this faith.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How can we receive the riches of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everyone knows the word faith, but the faith of many people is not truly faith; their faith does not produce any effect on them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Bible tells us that the old man is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many people say that they believe this, but their faith is not effectual.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They do not seem to have died at all.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let us look into the Scripture to find out what kind of faith is truly faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To many people, faith is merely a mental consent; it is not a genuine believing in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In their mind they agree that something is good and logical.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brothers and sisters, never consider this as faith; this is merely a mental reckoning.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After one hears a doctrine, he may appreciate its excellence and logic.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But knowing a good doctrine does not mean that one has faith in the doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Let us consider what the Lord said in Mark 11:24: "All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the only place in the entire Bible that tells us what faith is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must understand what is being said in this verse before we can know what faith is.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the only verse in the entire Bible that tells us the way to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"Believe that you have received them, and you will have them."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Faith is believing that we have already received.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is not believing that we can receive, will receive, shall receive, or want to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Faith is believing that we have already received.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Perhaps you do not realize how great a difference this makes.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If a person believes he can receive, may receive, will receive, or wants to receive, his faith is not real.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Only one kind of faith is real living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Only one kind of faith can receive God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Only one kind of faith secures the riches of Christ for us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is the faith that believes that we have already received.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The problem today is that many of God's children think that they have faith and that they will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They do not realize, however, that even if they believe ten million times that way, they still will not receive.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God does not consider this kind of believing as faith; He ignores it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Only one kind of faith is acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The word "have" in Mark 11:24 is a very important word.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we believe that we have received something, we will have it.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we hope that we will receive it, whatever we have is not faith.</S>
