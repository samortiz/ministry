   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ONENESS OF THE BELIEVERS IN JOHN 17 In the Father's Name and by His Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Son has been given authority to impart eternal life to all those whom the Father gave Him v. 2 . Now He prays, "Holy Father, keep them in Your name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I was with them, I kept them in Your name which You have given Me, and I guarded them" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The life and the name are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without the Father's life, how could we have His name?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we were not born of Him, He would not be our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is our Father because we have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus we call Him "Abba Father!"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By the Word</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Besides giving the believers eternal life, the Lord says, "I have given them Your word, and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And I do not ask concerning these only, but concerning those also who believe in Me through their word, that they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, that the world may believe that You have sent Me" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>14-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word which the Lord has given the believers separates them from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They do not belong to the world, but to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The sanctifying word keeps them, even while they are left in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus through the word, the life, and the name the believers can be brought into oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By the Glory</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Son has been given the Father's life and nature that He may express the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The glory of the Son is that He expresses the Father by having the Father's life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Suppose the President has a son whom he sends as his representative.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The glory of this son is that he expresses the President in life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Son of God has received glory from the Father in that He has the Father's life and nature to express.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This very glory of the Son He has given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We share the Father's life and nature and have the position and right to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have this glory!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are brought into oneness, then through the life, in the name, by the word, and in the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This oneness is genuine because it is in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are mingled with Him in such a oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are here for this genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Oneness in the name of the Father through His life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Oneness in the Triune God by His word, which separates us from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Oneness in the glory to express God with His nature and life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the glorification of the Son and of the Father!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And this is the church life!</S>
