   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This book covers some important matters concerning the young people going to the college campuses to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This work, however, should not exclude the other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the young people go to the campuses, they need the backing of the older and middle-aged saints.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When saints of all ages stand together in an excellent coordination, we will have an effective and fruitful work of preaching the gospel on the campuses.</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the next chapter, we will cover three more points prayer, the Word, and the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need prayer, the Word, and the homes to be effective in preaching the gospel on the campuses.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE REVELATION OF THE SPIRIT AND THE BODY The Revelation of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Lord's recovery, we have been opposed because of our stress on the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This opposition is related to religious traditions, especially traditions based upon the creeds.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the past some of us may have read and even recited the creeds.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Fifty years ago, however, we dropped the creeds because they are incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They cannot contain the entire divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Nicene Creed, there is no mention of the seven Spirits revealed in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The book of Revelation was written to seven churches with peace and grace from the seven Spirits 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The seven Spirits are the seven lamps of fire burning before God's administrative throne Rev 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that the seven Spirits are for God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The seven Spirits are also the seven eyes of the Lamb sent forth into the whole earth 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The seven Spirits are revealed in this book, first for the seven churches, second for God's administration, and third for Christ to be brought to all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These are important matters, but there is not a word in the Nicene Creed about them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have been opposed because we have dropped the creeds and the traditions of men to take the entire Word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Martin Luther was also greatly opposed by the Roman Catholic Church because he refused to go along with their traditions and councils.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He stood for what the Bible said about justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We also must come back to the Word because the creeds are incomplete in their presentation of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the young people go to the campuses, they must know how to fight the battle because there is still strong opposition to the truth concerning the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the opposers challenge you with the creeds, bring them to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You may say to them, "Do you know that Revelation 1:4 mentions not just one Spirit, but seven Spirits?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Check with them, "Do the creeds say anything about the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not just our teaching or interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible plainly says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the opposers believe in the Bible, the truth will vindicate you, and the pure Word will convince many of them.</S>
