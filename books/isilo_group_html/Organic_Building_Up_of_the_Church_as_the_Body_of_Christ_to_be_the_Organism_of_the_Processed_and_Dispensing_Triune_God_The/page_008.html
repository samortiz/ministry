by Its Gifted Members</h2>
<p>The church grows through eating, and also through the watering on the Body of Christ by its gifted members (1 Cor. 3:6). We believers are living plants who have been planted into Christ (1 Cor. 3:6a, 9b). Christ is our good ground, our earth. He is the rich soil into which we have been planted and in which we grow. Once a plant has been planted, it needs to be watered. Southern California used to be very dry with very little plant life. Then southern California began to receive water from the state of Nevada, and the result is that it has become very green and beautiful. The sprinklers in many yards in southern California water the lawns to keep them green and growing. In a spiritual sense, we need such watering so that we may grow. Paul said, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered&rdquo; (1 Cor. 3:6a). We need the watering by the gifted persons. For our spiritual growth, we need the food that the Word provides, and we also need the watering that the gifted ones provide.</p>
<p>If you are in the meetings of the church, you will be blessed with much watering. Regardless of how much time you spend reading the Bible in your home, it cannot replace the meetings of the church. Some saints may become unhappy with the elders or with some brother or sister in the church. They may reason, &ldquo;I do not need to go to the church meetings. I have the Bible, so I will stay home and read my Bible. The Lord is omnipresent, so I will dedicate the meeting time to stay at home and read my Bible for two hours.&rdquo; However, they will find that such an attempt leaves them short of the great benefit received in the church meetings.</p>
<p>You may say that you do not like the meeting, but whether you like the meeting or not, the &ldquo;sprinklers&rdquo; are there &ldquo;sprinkling.&rdquo; Regardless of how much you endeavor to get something in your home away from the meeting, there is no &ldquo;sprinkler&rdquo; watering you in your home. The church meeting may not seem so good to you, but you will still be watered in the meeting. Sometimes some saints may sleep in the meeting, but they still experience the watering.</p>
<p>In the meetings of the church, we are always dealing with the Bible. As we have fellowshipped, God the Spirit is totally involved with this book. When we go to the meetings of the church, we are always touching His Word, so we are always receiving something of God. Some have said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you should not ask the saints to read so many verses. It seems that sometimes there are fifty verses.&rdquo; I responded that even fifty verses is not that many. Psalm 119 has one hundred seventy-six verses. It would be wonderful if we could read this entire psalm in some meeting. Years ago, when the saints were still meeting at Elden Hall in Los Angeles, they came together for a prayer meeting and pray-read the entire book of Ephesians. The saints who were in that meeting testified how wonderful it was. When we are in the meetings of the church, we get thoroughly watered because we are under the &ldquo;sprinkling,&rdquo; the watering.</p>
<p>The gifted members of the Body of Christ, the servants of God, are like the sprinklers on the lawns; they have the ability to sprinkle us with water. The more they talk to us about the Bible, the more they sprinkle us with water. We can testify that when we come to a ministry meeting and listen to the speaking of the gifted persons with all the Bible verses, we can never be the same. Whether or not we understand everything, we always go away from such meetings with the water of the Bible. I do not have much knowledge in fields other than the Bible, but by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I somewhat know this holy book. I can open this book and water the saints. My speaking in the ministry of God&rsquo;s word is the sprinkling. We need to come to the meetings of the church and of the ministry to take a &ldquo;shower&rdquo; or a &ldquo;bath&rdquo; in the water of the word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Through the Giving of Growth in Life<br />
to the Members of Christ by God</h2>
<p>The intrinsic growth of the church is through the giving of growth in life to the members of Christ by God (1 Cor. 3:6c). The gifted ones may do the planting and the watering, but it is God who gives the growth in life. This is why I must always take some time to pray before I come to speak in a meeting. I pray that the Lord would be one with me and infuse me with Himself so that whatever I speak would be in Him. I believe He has richly answered these prayers because quite often, as I am speaking, I feel supplied within to speak with new light and instant utterance.</p>
<p>We need the feeding from the Bible directly, and we need the watering from the ones who know the Bible more. God goes along with our reading of the Word and with the speaking of the gifted members to give us the growth. The feeding and the watering are the top means used by Him to give His life to us. When we get into the Word, we are feeding. When we get under the speaking of the word, we receive the watering. Then God gives the growth.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Organic Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ to be the Organism of the Processed and Dispensing Triune God &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
