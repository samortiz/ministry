   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Measure of the Spices</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The proportions of the spices used is also meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The ointment had five hundred shekels each of myrrh and cassia, the first and last spices listed, and two hundred fifty each of cinnamon and calamus, the middle two spices.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First let us consider the number five hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Five in the Bible means responsibility; it is composed of four plus one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Four, like the four fingers of our hand, signifies the creature; one, like the thumb, signifies the unique Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By this arrangement of our fingers and the thumb, our hand is able to carry out what needs to be done.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Four plus one means man plus God, or responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With the number five hundred, we have responsibility increased a hundredfold.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Myrrh and cassia, then, each form a unit of five hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Cinnamon and calamus, the middle spices, are only a half unit each, two hundred fifty shekels.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The two of them together form a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why is this second unit split?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All these spices, in three units of five hundred, signify the Triune God, the Second of whom was split when He was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first half is connected with His death, the second to His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The number of spices was four, the human number.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The measure of the spices was three units, the divine number.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All these four are mingled with one hin of oil, again giving us four plus one, or five, the number of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After this compound ointment was made, it was used to anoint both the tabernacle and the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This ointment, then, was mainly for God's building and for His service.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are God's dwelling place and also His priests.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This anointing is for us!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The anointing in Exodus 30 corresponds exactly to the anointing in 1 John 2.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Numbers Related to God's Building</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The numbers most used in the compounding of the anointing ointment are three and five, both of which relate to God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His first building was Noah's ark, the measurements of which are mostly multiples of three and five.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was three hundred cubits long, thirty cubits high, and fifty cubits wide Gen 6:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was of three stories v. 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Three and five are also the basic units of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Consider these dimensions or amounts:</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>1 The altar 5 x 5 x 3 Exo 38:1</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2 The ark 2 x 1 x 1 Exo 37:1</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>3 Sections 3 outer court, inner court, Holy of Holies</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>4 Boards 10 x 1 Exo 36:21</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>5 Length of tabernacle 30</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>6 Curtain loops 50 Exo 36:17</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>7 Brass taches 50 Exo 36:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Notice how all these measurements are either three or five, or are multiples or halves of three or five.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every single measurement is full of meaning, but for the present I would simply point out that these two numbers, which figure so prominently in the anointing ointment, are related to God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The anointing is the moving of the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Its purpose is not for our individual spirituality but for the building and the priesthood, which are corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As this ointment moves, the ingredients of which it is made will be applied to the very place where it moves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ's divinity, humanity, death, and resurrection will be applied to your being.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When you contact the Lord in a living way, the effectiveness of His death will be present.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you take antibiotics, they will kill the germs.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no need for you to reckon that they are killed; the killing power is in the antibiotics, not in your reckoning.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Besides the killing power, the anointing's other rich ingredients will be applied and wrought into your being.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Suppose you have a bad temper.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Surely from your experience you can testify that the only way to be rescued from it is to contact the living Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Within Him is a divine ingredient that kills the germs of your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By contacting the Lord, you are experiencing the application of the anointing to your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How can we participate in this anointing?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is simply by abiding in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This means we must be always in touch with Him without any insulation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we thus keep directly contacting Him, we shall experience the anointing applying the divine ingredients to our being.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"Ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and ye know all things."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Day by day you will be transformed, not by following outward regulations but by having these divine ingredients added to you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The anointing in 1 John 2 points directly to the anointing ointment in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we consider the ingredients of this compound, we have to worship the Lord for such an accurate, unveiling picture.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our God has been compounded with all these wonderful ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Because He has transferred us out of Adam and into Himself, we now have the position to abide in Him and let Him abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we thus keep ourselves attached to Him, we shall all the time be participating in what He is and what He has accomplished for us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By way of the anointing He will work Himself into us.</S>
