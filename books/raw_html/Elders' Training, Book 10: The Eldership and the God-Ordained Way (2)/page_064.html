<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>The letter John referred to in this accusation is related to the one accord which I spoke about to the elders in February 1986. Now, John and some of those who are with him condemn the writing of that letter. Concerning such a matter, again I would say that it all depends on what vision he and some of those who are with him are under, what view they hold, and what motive they have. In principle, according to the Lord's prayer in John 17 that all His believers would be one, the Lord is always pleased when we, the believers, are one in the things that are for His interest, and the Lord is surely offended if in anything that is for His interest we would not be one. At any rate, to be one is better than to be divided, than not to be one; to be in one accord is better than to be in confusion, in discord. Thank the Lord that those who would retract their signatures from the letter that John spoke about in the above paragraph are few, a small percentage of the more than four hundred who appreciate their signing of that letter. Some of the signers did express to me that they would like to keep that letter, with their signatures, for the sake of history.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>6. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;<br>the Centralization of the Churches and the Work</H2><P>"There has been quite an emphasis, at least in practice, on a kind of centralization of the churches and the work, which we also find contrary to the Word of God."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>In the Lord's recovery there is no such practice of a "centralization of the churches" and a "centralization of the work." We do emphasize that all the churches should be one in the Body of Christ, not by the way of forming a federation but in the way of adequate fellowship in the Spirit in the organic union of the divine life. We also stress that the co-workers should not work independently but corporately under one leadership. It is clearly revealed in the New Testament that the co-workers among the Jews worked together corporately under the leadership of Peter, and the co-workers among the Gentiles worked corporately under the leadership of Paul. This does not mean that all the co-workers are centralized, but it does mean that the co-workers who are working in a certain region all work as one. This is the way to bring in the Lord's blessing. We do not practice any kind of centralization; we treasure only the proper oneness in the Spirit by the divine life, both of which unite us together organically, whether in the church life or in the work for the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>7. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;<br>a Pervasive Control over the Church</H2><P>"There has been a pervasive control exercised over the church. Now at least I can speak for Anaheim. I know this to be a fact, and I'm in a position to know this. There has been much outside influence exercised upon the church which has made it very difficult to go on by getting our leading directly from the Lord. This control has not been exercised so much directly, but very much indirectly, through videos, conferences, trainings, and elders' meetings."</P>
