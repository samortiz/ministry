   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SOME PRINCIPLES CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE STUDENTS WORK AND THE TRAINING CENTER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is a need for some explanation regarding the students work and the training center.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If in our understanding the students work, the ministry, and the training are combined together, this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have no such intention.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At present, all the full-time serving ones are in the training, and as a result, the personnel is temporarily in the hands of the training.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Consequently, regardless of the specific service, whether with the high school or junior high students, if there is a need for the help of the trainees, we can fellowship with the training center and let the training center arrange for some to work with the high school students and some with the junior high students.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No one should go to the training center and summon a certain number of trainees to help with a specific student work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This kind of fellowship is neither proper nor right.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The arrangement of personnel should be under the direction of the training center.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the saints serving full time, whether they are laboring in colleges, communities, high schools, or junior high schools, are being trained in the training center.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the training there is a specific time for classes and for work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The living arrangements and rest schedule of the trainees is completely planned and arranged by the training center.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, this should not change the nature of the students work and cause it to merge with that of the training center; this is an erroneous understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The students work is absolutely an independent work, and it cannot be interfered with easily.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If there is a need in the churches due to the full-timers participation in the training, the churches should fellowship with the training center through the proper channel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For instance, if there is a need for fifty people to labor in the college work, the training center will consider this need and fellowship with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They will assess the situation and consider how many the community needs, how many the colleges need, and how many the high schools and junior high schools need.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this way the training center will determine a number for each work; perhaps only forty people will be available for the college work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This will provide an overall strategy that keeps the whole work in view.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It would be foolish to merge the students work with the training center.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, the Ministry of National Defense does not need to merge with the Ministry of Finance simply because the former needs money from the latter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If this were the case, the Ministry of National Defense would not be able to engage in warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Ministry of Finance does not know how to fight; this is the job of the Ministry of National Defense.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Ministry of National Defense needs money, it must use its budget through the proper procedures and channels.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every nation has a system to budget for national defense.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This enables it to carry out matters related to national defense according to a budget.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Ministry of National Defense does not need to merge with the Ministry of Finance simply because it needs money.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The proper way for us to serve is to arrange for certain ones from the entire work to labor on the colleges, that is, to make them ministers of the national defense.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When they serve on the various campuses, they should serve according to their capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For instance, in Taipei we need to see how many universities there are, how many brothers and sisters are studying in each one, and how many among them are able and have a strong desire to be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Based upon this, we can decide how many trainees will be needed to cooperate with the college work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because the trainee brothers and sisters are now in the training, it is more than appropriate for us to fellowship our need with the training center.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not go to the training center to recruit people secretly; this is not permissible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Each church or school should inform the training center regarding the number of people and the age group they need; then the training center can allot the needed manpower to the churches and schools according to the actual situation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After we hand over the manpower, the training center will not interfere with the work in the churches and in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The trainees are restricted in their time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For instance, after being sent out to labor for a while, they need to come back to the training center to receive more training and do their assigned homework.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, if the college work desires to use some of the manpower from the training center, it needs to cooperate with the training center.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If it does not cooperate, the training will not be able to proceed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The responsible brothers from all the churches need to pay attention to this matter and cooperate with the training center.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since most of the trainees are young people, the training has arranged a comprehensive and integrated training curriculum to strengthen them in such matters as truth, life, the gospel, the church, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In regard to their character, we need to train them in the habits of rising early and having a set schedule for work and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For instance, they are assigned certain times to read the Bible, read the ministry, discuss the ministry mutually, and attend Greek class.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All these items are included in their training.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every day they also need to allot some time to carry out the student work, either in the colleges, high schools, or junior high schools.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>With this kind of comprehensive training, we believe that they will be able to accomplish much.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the training is in session, the training center will surely cooperate with any need related to the work with the students.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, since the trainees are on loan to the various services in coordination, they need to return to the training center after serving.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These trainees are still required to follow all the regulations set up by the training.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In other words, even their campus work is part of their work related to the training.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some people may be under the wrong impression and believe that the training has taken over everything.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should be clear that these trainees are the possessions of the churches; similar to a big family, all the children are ours, but we also send them to school.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every school has its class schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For instance, often the first session begins at 8:00 A.M., and the school dismisses at 3:30 P.M.; the school has a set timetable.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If a father tells the school that his child s grandfather is visiting and wants to take the child out for lunch, I believe that the school would not be very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although the child belongs to the father and the father has all the rights to the child, he should abide by all the regulations of the school because he has committed his child to the school; otherwise, he makes it difficult for the school to function.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, if parents desire that a school provide their children with a good education, they should have the peace of mind to give them to the school and let them abide by the school s regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some schools may require the students to live in dormitories and may have certain regulations related to the dormitory.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No parent would like a school if it had no regulations and the students were free to wander about after class and return to the dormitory in the middle of the night.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Since the parents have given their children to the school, they surely desire that their children abide by the school regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For example, often students are allowed to leave the dormitory after 2:00 P.M. on Saturday but must be back to school at 7:00 P.M. on Lord s Day evening.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>During this period of time, the school gives the children back to the parents and has no responsibility over them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the principle of schooling the parents must cooperate with the school s timetable; only then can the education be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This example is to show the saints that we cannot incorporate the work with the training center; this would not be right.</S>
