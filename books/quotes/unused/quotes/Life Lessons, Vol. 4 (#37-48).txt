In the previous three volumes we covered thirty topics concerning the matters between God and us, and between us and God
We will first look into the way to enjoy God's full salvation; then we will consider the different aspects of God's full salvation
According to the divine revelation in the Bible, there are clearly three steps which constitute the way to enjoy God's full salvation
The sanctification of God the Spirit separates us from the world that we may belong to God and enjoy God's full salvation
The sanctification of the Holy Spirit is the first step in our receiving salvation, and our repentance is the second step
On the positive side, when we believe, we believe into Christ and receive God into us, that we may obtain Him and His eternal life
3) 'But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name'
Our believing into Christ makes us those who are in Christ; our receiving Christ causes Him to be the One who is in us
4) 'Those who have been allotted like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ'
The faith through which we believe into Christ and receive Christ, and by which we are saved , is the like precious faith allotted to us
In the New Testament, God gives this rich Christ as an allotted inheritance to all those who were chosen by Him
The Triune God enters into His chosen people to be their faith, causing them to enter into Him to be joined to Him as one in His divine life
As the flood rescued Noah's family from that corrupted generation , baptism rescues us from the corrupted world
Through the resurrection of Christ that is through Christ becoming the Spirit of life in resurrection they are organically united with Him
When we receive God's full salvation, the first items we enjoy are God's forgiveness of our sins and His cleansing away of our sins
Unless our sinful deeds before Him are eliminated, the righteous God cannot grant us the remaining items of His redemption
Forgiveness of sins means the elimination of our record of sin before God that we may be delivered from the penalty of God's righteousness
Because we had a record of sin before God and were condemned, we should have suffered God's righteous punishment
Forgiveness of sins' ; 'The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all' ; 'Himself carried up our sins in His body onto the tree '
God put all our sins on the Lord Jesus that He might carry them all to suffer Gods punishment for us and cancel our record of sin before God
Unless His righteous requirement is satisfied, His righteousness cannot allow Him to forgive sinners of their sins
On the negative side, to repent is to turn away from sins, while on the positive side, to believe is to believe into Christ
When God forgives us of our sins He exempts us from the penalty of sins when God cleanses us from our sins He erases the traces of our sins
We enjoy the cleansing away of sins in God's full salvation both in our outward position and in our inward disposition
If the demand is not met, the problem between the two parties will not be resolved, and the two will not be able to be reconciled
1) 'Whom God set forth a propitiation-cover through faith in His blood, for the showing forth of His righteousness'
Man needs a thorough change toward God; that is, he needs to be reconciled to God through the redemption of Christ
1) 'But all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation'
2) Boasting in God-'We also are boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation'
Literally, the word 'boasting' here includes the meaning of rejoicing, exulting, extolling, and being filled with pride
Since we have been reconciled to God through the Lord Jesus Christ and have gained God, God Himself has become our eternal portion
The first is that when we were sinners, we were reconciled to God, being delivered from sins and being justified by God
The meaning of Sanctification, whether in the Hebrew of the Old Testament or in the Greek of the New Testament, is mainly separation
Holiness is the state of God's nature, which is not only sinless and without evil, but also different from all and distinct from the common
Before we can be sanctified, we must first be cleansed from our sins; likewise, before we can be justified, we must first be sanctified
In the second stage, the sanctification which we receive in God's full salvation is both positional and dispositional
Once we are bought back by the Lord's blood, we are separated from the world, receiving a sanctified position and being made holy unto Him
Out of' indicates that this sanctification is out of the divine life of God the Father, which is both in His Son and in us
The sanctification mentioned here is not the sanctification which we obtained objectively in our position through the Lord's blood
We entered into an organic union with Him, partook of His divine life and nature, and were sanctified dispositionally
These three-the life of Christ, the light of the holy Word, and the power of the Holy Spirit-work together to sanctify us
After obtaining the forgiveness of sins and the cleansing away of sins, and after being sanctified, we have no further problems before God
Man is justified by God not only by God's grace and through the redemption of Christ Jesus, but also through his faith in Christ
Both the grace of God and the redemption of Christ Jesus are on God's side, whereas the faith in Jesus Christ is on our side
Father God, Thou hast accepted Jesus as our Substitute; Judged the Just One for the unjust, Couldst Thou change Thy attitude?
As a proof of perfect justice, At Thine own right hand He sits; He, as Thy full satisfaction, Righteously Thy need befits
We have obtained the objective and positional justification by God's grace, through the redemption of Christ Jesus, and through our faith
When we live by God's life, which we received in our positional justification, we bear the fruit of righteousness through the Lord Jesus
Objective justification causes us to have life; subjective justification enables us to grow in life and be transformed unto maturity
To be in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is to be in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ, that is, to be in the Lord Jesus Christ Himself
When we were saved, the Spirit of God entered into us to bring to us the life of God, that we may be justified subjectively by God in life
We obtain subjective justification in life by God's life, through the resurrected Christ, in His person, and in the Spirit of God
The six steps of experience from forgiveness to justification are all in the redemptive aspect of God's full salvation
He is sold under sin and belongs to sin, and he is estranged from the life of God and has nothing to do with God
Whether it is good or bad in man's eyes, that which the fleshly man has is merely a human life of the flesh, not the life of God
What man is and what God is are basically different, being in two different realms and in two different kingdoms
Man must be born of God, that is, he must be regenerated that he may have God's life and may enter into the kingdom of God
Although he understood correctly the literal meaning of 'born anew,' he misunderstood the significance of the new birth
The water of baptism indicates death and burial symbolizing Christs death and burial for the termination of the repenting and believing ones
Regeneration is also God's Spirit begetting our spirit, that is, the Spirit of God regenerating our human spirit with God's life
When Christ was resurrected, we who believe into Him were all included in Him and were raised up together with Him
The Holy Spirit first convicts us concerning sin, concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment, causing us to repent and to believe
After we repent and believe, He brings God's life into our spirit that we may obtain God's life and may be regenerated
3 Through the word of GodHaving been regenerated not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible through the living and abiding word of God
Once we receive through faith God's word of the gospel, this word sows the life of God as the seed of life into us
2) Becoming the children of God-'To them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name: who were born
In the life aspect of God's full salvation, after we experience regeneration, the experience that follows immediately is renewing
Although regeneration is accomplished once for all, the effectiveness of its washing continues along with the renewing of the Holy Spirit
After we are regenerated, we are saved at every time by continuing daily, even hourly, in the ceaseless renewing of the Holy Spirit
When we are regenerated, God not only imparts to us His life, but He also gives us a new heart and a new spirit
When we desire God and love God according to this new heart and receive God by this new spirit, we are constantly renewed
After being regenerated, we still need the experience of putting off the old man and putting on the new man moment by moment in our living
Our Christian life is not a matter of religion or self-improvement, but of being a new man of the new creation
We have seen that in God's full salvation, when sanctification is applied to us, it is divided into three stages
The first stage is for our repentance, the second stage is for our justification, and the third stage is for our transformation
Gods nature is holy and the word of God brings the reality of such a nature to us that we may obtain it as the reality of our sanctification
The Father of spirits, our Father who regenerates us in our spirit, desires that we may enjoy the holiness of His nature
If we do not cooperate with Him, He disciplines us, forcing us to be willing to pursue His holiness, that He may perfect us in His holiness
In God's full salvation, we must enjoy God's sanctification to such an extent that our entire being is in this enjoyment
In the life aspect of God's full salvation, every step, from regeneration to glorification, gradually progresses forward and upward
The first part means 'change,' while the second part means 'the inward form,' which implies 'element' and 'essence'
When we turn to the Lord from all other goals, such as the law and good deeds, the Lord, who is the Spirit, immediately frees us
If we aim at any matter other than the Lord we will be occupied and bound by it so that the Lord Spirit will be unable to do anything for us
If we do not grow and mature we will remain in the childish stage unable to comprehend Gods word of righteousness which is like solid food
To enter into God's New Testament economy, into God's eternal plan, requires that we grow and mature in the life of God
1) 'Whom we announce, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full-grown in Christ' ; 'Who
Always struggling on your behalf in prayers, that you may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God'
We grow in the spiritual life by holding in love to Christ as the truth and growing up into Christ as the Head in all things
Holding the Head out from whom all the Body by means of the joints and bands being supplied and knit together grows with the growth of God
In God's full salvation, after we have enjoyed the growth and maturity in the life of Christ, the next step is conformation
Conformation comes from the life of Christ within us, and this conformation in turn becomes our experience and enjoyment in His life
Through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead' ; 'He should be the Firstborn among many brothers'
They then are gradually transformed into the same image as Christ's in the Lord Spirit to become more like Him
1) 'Whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers'
We were regenerated in the resurrection of Christ to be the sons of God, who are like Him, the firstborn Son of God
Following this, we are being transformed daily in the Lord Spirit into the same image as Christ's, who is the firstborn Son of God
By that time we shall be completely conformed to His image to be fully like Him even in our body enjoying with Him the eternal divine glory
We are told that God's purpose in calling us in Christ Jesus and in giving us all grace is that we may enjoy His eternal glory
In eternity past He predestinated us according to His foreknowledge, and in time He called us and justified us that we may be glorified
Our sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with 'the coming glory to be revealed to us' , that is, God's own glory
Since God predestined that we should enjoy His own eternal glory, beginning from the day of our salvation, He leads us into His glory
As the Creator of all things He orders and arranges all things causing them to work for us that through them He may lead us into His glory
1) 'Our momentary lightness of affliction works out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory'
Our momentary lightness of affliction works out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory
It is not only a glory which we desire to enjoy, but also a glory that the whole creation is eagerly expecting
