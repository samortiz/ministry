   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>According to the two passages we just quoted, it is possible for one's name to be removed from the book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Even the Scripture which we are considering now contains this meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Only the overcoming saints will not have their names erased from the book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that the defeated Christians will surely have their names erased.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, Revelation 20 tells us that at the judgment of the great white throne, all those whose names are not in the book of life will be cast into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Does this therefore mean that a saved person can still perish?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a hard point to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who believe in the possibility of perdition for believers will hold on to this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those who do not believe in the believers' perdition will try to explain this verse with many concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But according to the teaching of the Bible, the problem here is the same as the one in 2:11.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We believe that our explanation in 2:11 is fully scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every careful reader of the Bible has to agree that on the one hand, the Lord's sheep can never perish, but on the other hand, he cannot say that a sinning believer will never be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, this, like other passages, refers to the temporary removal of the defeated believers' names from the book of life, particularly at the time when God rewards the overcomers in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the end of the millennium, their names will be reinstated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, by the time the last judgment comes 20:15 , they will still be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When God first put the names there, it was out of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although His calling and reward are without repentance, how can God tolerate the believers' sins and act contrary to His own nature?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who believe in the Lord Jesus will be saved forever, but when God comes to reign over the world in righteousness, some will suffer punishment for the sins they commit after they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How precious is this promise!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the present time, when believers follow the Lord, the church erases their names and considers them as evil Luke 6:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although their names can be removed from man's register, the Lord promises this little flock that their names will by no means be erased from the book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Man can reject them, but the Lord will receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What a comfort this is!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>3 "And I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord did not say that He will confess the overcomer's name before the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Perhaps the world will not know them, yet before the Father, He will confess their names, because the Father sees everything in secret Matt 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He will also confess their names before the Father's angels.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The angels are paying attention to their conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They even notice when a female believer covers her head 1 Cor 11:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although it seems a small thing to be separated from the sin of the Protestant church, and perhaps men would despise this, in that day, the Lord will extol the names of these believers before the Father and before the heavenly hosts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What a promise this is!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord will confess our names!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are faithful, one day our Lord will call forth our humble names before the myriads of angels and before the Father!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our neglected and despised names will be in the mouth of the Lord and in the ear of the Father and His angels, as well as in the book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>May everyone of us have an ear to hear the Lord's word to Sardis, and may none of us be lacking in the characteristics of the overcomers in Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>APPENDIX</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>FULFILLMENT IN HISTORY</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church in this period is the Protestant church after Luther's Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord's rebuke, warning, expressions, and promise have much to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What we contact every day and what we live with all the time are the Protestant denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we understand the Lord's intention towards the Protestant denominations as revealed in this letter, we will know how to act.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The characteristic of the various Protestant denominations is that they are living in name and dead in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are prosperous in all kinds of institutions, charitable works, social aids, and educational and medical enterprises.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Man easily admires their achievements, but their spiritual condition before the Lord is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even their work of preaching is no exception.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are two kinds of Protestant churches: one is the state churches, like the Anglican Church in England; the other is set up freely by the people, such as the Methodists.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Among both kinds of churches, life and death are mixed together.</S>
