Publishing the full text of these messages will not only be time-consuming as far as the editing work is concerned, but it will also take up too much room. We roughly estimate that there would be over two hundred thousand words. Therefore, in this issue we will only publish the outlines. We hope that in the future, we can publish in separate issues the detailed record of every message. For this we need the readers' prayers.</P><P>April 18, 1934</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
