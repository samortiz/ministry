   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Greetings to X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On February 24 I received a letter from Ning-Hai.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I was very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The brothers are scattered because of the war, and it is difficult to get messages to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I received your letter, it was as if I were seeing your face.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I was so comforted!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Your remembrance of our brothers and sisters in Shao-Shing is with the same burden as our remembrance of the brothers and sisters in other localities.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although the brothers and sisters in Shao-Shing were all forced to scatter to other places, they are all safe and well.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Please do not worry.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The only problem is that Miss Chang Shi-jeng was in Li-Zhu originally.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A few months ago I hired a boat to go and visit her, but I discovered that she had moved to Hsie-Jia-Chun in the area of Lou-Gung because Li-Zhu was too dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is difficult to get messages to her, and there is no way to communicate with her.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are not lonely in Jou-Shan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every Lord's Day there is a meeting in Brother Ma Ting-chi's home.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Mrs. Lau from Hsiang-Li comes every Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The number of believers from Jou-Shan itself has increased quite a bit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God Himself did the work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Oh, praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to pray much for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>May God always give grace and protect us and all the other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Peace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Greetings to Brother X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although the Lord's people were scattered in every place as the war spread, the Lord's gospel followed them into the mountains, bays, and coastal regions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I used to live in Shao-Shing, but I fled to my ancestral home Dan-Ju-Wu because of the war.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In these few months several people have been saved through God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is now a home meeting every Lord's Day in Dan-Ju-Wu.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is also a prayer meeting every night.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>May God be with our work and may He also send more workers to reap His harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Please send six copies of The Open Door to this address.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Peace on your way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The least on the way,</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Han Xiang-fu</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Greetings in the Lord to Brother Jing-yuan:</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord has protected me with His grace since we parted.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although we have passed through many difficulties and hardships, we have seen God's saving power in delivering us from danger.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thank and praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The brothers and sisters returned from Hsiao-Shu to Hsie-Chun in three groups.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All were safe.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Eighty percent of the houses in the village were completely destroyed by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The houses of the believers, however, were mostly preserved by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Brother Zhang Lin-yu's house and store were burned.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The whole town of Ma-Yao was destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The only buildings left standing were the Presbyterian Church and the Apostolic Faith Church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although Hsie-Chun is no longer in danger, it is not yet stable.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We ask the brothers and sisters to please pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Peace in the Lord.</S>
