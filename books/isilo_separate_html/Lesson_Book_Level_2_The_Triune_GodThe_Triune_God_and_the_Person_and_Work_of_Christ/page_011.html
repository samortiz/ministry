If you study these verses more carefully you will see something marvelous about the Triune God.</P><P>These verses tell us that it was God the Father who planned in eternity past how everything would work together to produce the church. He chose and predestinated many people to be His sons. Yet, to accomplish this required the work of the Son&#151;"in Whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses." The Lord Jesus accomplished this by dying on the cross. We know that His death was all-inclusive (included everything): it crucified our sinful nature, crushed the Devil's head, and released God's divine life (just as burying a grain of wheat releases the life within it). Hallelujah for the work of the Son! Finally, we read that we "were sealed with the Holy Spirit." This simply means that what the Father planned and the Son accomplished is applied to us by the Spirit. The Father is the planner, the Son is the accomplisher, and the Spirit is the applier. This is the Triune God in His economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. GOD'S ECONOMY BEING THE DISPENSING<br>OF HIS ESSENCE (LIFE AND BEING) INTO US</H2><P>Do not forget, though, that the Father, Son, and Spirit are essentially one. When the Father planned, He was coinhering with the Son and the Spirit. When the Son came to accomplish, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit. The Son was in the Father and the Father was in Him; He was even called the Father. After His death and in His resurrection, the Son became the life-giving Spirit. When the Spirit applies, He brings us both the Father and the Son. This Spirit is just the ultimate consummation of the Triune God applying to us all that the Triune God has planned and accomplished. Without this Spirit, man cannot enjoy the Father's selection or the Son's redemption. The Spirit is the application. Hallelujah! We are not a people who merely have the knowledge of God or some doctrine of the Bible. By this Spirit, we are able to enjoy all that the Father has planned and the Son has accomplished. Now all that God is, all that Christ is, and what Christ has accomplished, obtained, and attained is made real to us by the Spirit. That is why the Spirit is called the Spirit of reality (John 14:17).</P><P>Do you now see why God must be triune? He is essentially one yet economically three in order that we can enjoy Him. God's economy is to dispense His entire being into us, yet if He were only one essentially but not three economically, He could not carry out His purpose. Then on the other hand if the Father, Son, and Spirit were three Gods but not one, we could receive only the Spirit, one of the Three. We would miss all the riches of the Father and all the accomplishments of the Son. But praise Him, He is three-one! He as the Father has planned, He as the Son has accomplished, and He as the Spirit is now ready to apply the Triune God to us. When we call "Lord Jesus," the all-inclusive Spirit comes into us bringing us the whole Triune God. We get the Father, the Son, and the Spirit with all that He is and has accomplished. This Spirit is the all-inclusive package. Amen!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>What is God's economy?</li><li>What are the distinct functions of the Father, Son, and Spirit?</li><li>What does it mean when we say the Father, Son, and Spirit are "essentially" one?</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Quoted Portions from (Lee/LSM) Publications</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>The Divine Dispensing of the Divine Trinity in Ephesians, pp. 3-9.</li><li>The Divine Dispensing of the Divine Trinity, pp. 5-6, 14-15, 26-28.</li><li>Concerning the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, pp. 14-15.</li><li>The Economy of God, pp. 9-15.</li></ol><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
