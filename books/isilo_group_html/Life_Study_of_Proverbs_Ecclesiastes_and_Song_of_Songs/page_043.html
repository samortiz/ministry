<P>All remain the same, generation after generation, like the phenomena in nature (vv. 4-7).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. All Being Wearisome</H2>

<P>All are wearisome, nothing is satisfying, nothing is new, and nothing is remembered (vv. 8-11).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Writer's Experiments</H2>

<P>Ecclesiastes 1:12&#151;6:12 is a lengthy section concerned with the writer's experiments.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. In Wisdom and Knowledge</H2>

<P>The first experiment is in wisdom and knowledge (1:12-18). The writer says that it is grievous travail that God has given to the children of men to travail in (v. 13). What is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is lacking cannot be counted (v. 15). In much wisdom is much vexation, and the increase of knowledge increases sorrow (v. 18). To know wisdom and to know madness and folly also are a chasing after wind (v. 17).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. In Pleasure</H2>

<P>In 2:1-11 we have the experiment in pleasure, in particular of enjoyment (vv. 1-2), drinking (v. 3), building and planting (vv. 4-6), possessions (v. 7), silver and gold (v. 8a), music (v. 8b), and the delights in concubine after concubine (v. 8c). Solomon's unparalleled experiences of these pleasures with his wisdom were all found by him to be vanity and a chasing after wind, and there was no advantage under the sun (vv. 9-11).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. In Being a Wise Man or a Fool</H2>

<P>Verses 12 through 26 describe the experiment in being a wise man or a fool.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. To Be a Wise Man Being Better than to Be a Fool</H2>

<P>To be a wise man is better than to be a fool, but after death both become a vanity, a chasing after wind. So Solomon hated life under the sun which was grievous to him (vv. 12-17).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs &nbsp; pg 43</div><br></body></html>
