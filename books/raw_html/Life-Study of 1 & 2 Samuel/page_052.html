<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Saul's Confession and Begging</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Saul Confessing His Sin<br>with an Excuse of His Being Afraid of the People</H2><P>Saul confessed his sin to Samuel with the excuse that he had transgressed the commandment of Jehovah and Samuel's words because he "feared the people and obeyed their voice" (v. 24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Saul Begging Samuel<br>to Pardon His Sin and Return with Him</H2><P>Saul begged Samuel to pardon his sin and return with him, but Samuel refused to do so because of Saul's rejection of Jehovah's word and Jehovah's rejection of Saul's kingship (vv. 25-26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Samuel's Word to Saul<br>concerning Jehovah's Tearing Away<br>the Kingdom of Israel from Him</H2><P>When Samuel turned around to go, Saul seized the corner of his cloak, and it tore. Then Samuel told him that Jehovah had torn the kingdom of Israel away from him that day and had given it to an associate of his, who was better than he. This associate was David. Samuel went on to say, "Moreover the Eminence of Israel does not lie nor repent, for He is not a man that He should repent" (vv. 27-29).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Saul Begging Samuel to Honor Him<br>before the Elders of His People and before Israel</H2><P>Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned. Honor me now, I beg you, before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me so that I may worship Jehovah your God" (v. 30). Then Samuel returned after Saul, and Saul worshipped Jehovah (v. 31).</P>
