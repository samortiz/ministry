   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE FORTY-FOUR THE BEAST OUT OF THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to the second beast, the beast out of the earth 13:11-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I. JUDAS ISCARIOT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Revelation 13:11 says, And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This beast is the false prophet 16:13; 19:20; 20:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since the earth, the land, signifies the nation of Israel, this beast, the false prophet, will come out of the Jewish nation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some students of prophecy believe that the false prophet will be Judas Iscariot.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I believe this view is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to Acts 1:25, after his death Judas went to his own place, rather than to his people, as was the case with others recorded in Scripture Gen 25:17; 35:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although there have been many false persons in history, no one was as filled with Satan as Judas was.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jesus said, Did not I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now He spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, being one of the twelve, would betray Him John 6:70-71 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here we see that the Lord Jesus even called Judas a devil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because Judas was filled with the Devil, he was one with the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No one other than Judas matches the description of the false prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let us consider further the significance of Judas going to his own place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the record in the Bible, Elijah was raptured to God, and the body of Moses was kept by God for a specific purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In addition, we have seen that the spirit of Nero is being kept in the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Undoubtedly, the spirit of Judas is also being kept in a particular place.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only when we come to the book of Revelation do we see why the Bible gives us this particular record of these four people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During the time of the great tribulation, the Lord s people on earth will need strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because God foreknew this, He has sovereignly kept Moses and Elijah for His testimony during that time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is also keeping Nero and Judas, but, in contrast to Moses and Elijah, they are not in a pleasant place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One is in the abyss, and the other is in his own place.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although I do not know what this place is, I am confident that it is not a place of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, two people have been kept by God for His positive purpose and two others have been kept for His negative purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The spirit of Nero is being held in the abyss until the time it will fully constitute the last Caesar of the Roman Empire as Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Judas is kept in his own place until he appears as the false prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By God s sovereign keeping of these four people, we can see that the whole universe and the entire human race is under God s sovereign hand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nothing happens accidentally.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, everything takes place according to God s sovereign arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Centuries ago, God prepared Moses and Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As we have pointed out, Moses represents the law, and Elijah, the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In ancient times, the Jews referred to the Old Testament as the law and the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because Moses and Elijah are two witnesses, they have been purposely kept by God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One day, after Satan has been cast down to earth and embodied in Antichrist, who will exercise satanic power to persecute God s people, God will send these two witnesses back to strengthen His people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At that time, Satan will call out Judas to work for him as he did once before.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Just as the spirit of Nero will emerge from the abyss to become Antichrist, so Judas will come out of his own place to become the false prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, during the three and a half years of the great tribulation, four special persons will be on earth Moses, Elijah, Nero, and Judas.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Probably all four will meet one another face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I wonder what Moses and Elijah will say to Judas.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Moses and Elijah will be the anti-testimony to Antichrist and the false prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Imagine what a situation that will be when these four confront one another!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>COMING UP OUT OF THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Revelation 13:11 says that the other beast, the false prophet, will come up out of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Geographically, he will come from underneath the earth, and symbolically he will come from the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have seen that the land signifies the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For this reason, the false prophet will certainly come out of the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He must be one of the Jewish people.</S>
