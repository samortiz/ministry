   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONE MUST HAVE REVELATION BEFORE HE CAN WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Watchman Nee: The above three basic lessons can be summarized under one basic principle seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once a man sees, he will spontaneously be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without God's revelation, we will only see the rod, we will see that our hands are clean, and we will regard the supply of Egypt as nothing but river water.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But once we have God's revelation, we will not feel the same.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We will see that the rod in our hand is a serpent, that our hands are not clean, and that the world is full of death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Exodus 4 is a chapter of contrast between God's revelation and man's view.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many people have asked me, "How can I have God's revelation?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a matter of whether or not you have seen that the rod is a serpent, that there is leprosy in your hand, and that the water is blood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Young people have ambitious dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I hope that you can wake up from your beautiful dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God not only commanded Moses to see and perform these miracles, but to go to the Israelites and perform the same.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's intention was for Moses to bring deliverance to the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was an impossible task to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But once he received God's revelation, his feeling changed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose there is a worm at the bottom of this cup.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Being thirsty, I drink from this cup.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I get to the bottom of the cup, however, I see the worm.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I want to drink again, what will I feel when I see the cup?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am afraid I will have the "feeling" of the worm inside me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is what revelation will do to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Originally, I had no feeling about a certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Moses did not have any feeling about his rod before the miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But after it was turned into a serpent, his feeling about the rod changed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can say the same thing about our feeling for the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to know that sin is not only in the world but also in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Violence is not only in the world but also in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the past we did not have this feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One day we took our hand out from our bosom, and we discovered that we were leprous.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From that day onward, every time we stretched forth our hand, we would think of leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some people pretend to be humble, weak, and obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But their performance is artificial.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a man does not have revelation, he can be humble only when he consciously acts this way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But once he forgets to act, he is no longer humble.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He has to be on guard all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we speak a word of exhortation or rebuke, we have to realize that the words from "our bosom" may be leprous.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Please remember that the Lord did not call us to the work based on how much we have handed ourselves over, but based on how much revelation we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A brother once said to me, "Even if I am weaker than I once was, I am still stronger than those two brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am afraid he has never seen his own depravity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A servant of the Lord must also have a feeling for the water of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The quenching of thirst is for the purpose of satisfying our need.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Perhaps some of us have been praying for years for a worldly position or blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I hope we will have a burning revelation from God to see that every fulfillment from the world is nothing but blood.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the eyes of those who have revelation, water is nothing but blood.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is possible to have water turned into blood even in such minute details as shopping for towels and socks.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we want to serve the Lord, we should not remain in Egypt and drink the water of the Nile.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should instead go into the wilderness to drink of the flowing water from the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here we all have to see what we did not see previously.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All those who have received a revelation will say that they have witnessed something mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To man, it is a rod, a hand from the bosom, or water from the Nile.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But once we have God's revelation and vision, we will know the true nature of things, and we will see that they are a serpent, the flesh, and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We will run away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We will be afraid and shrink back.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only God's revelation will give us the true knowledge of the things that we put our trust in. Only God's revelation will show us that our greatest sin is the self, and only His revelation will show us the evil of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the world a rod is something to rely on, the self is good, and the water is drinkable.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But I would join Brother Lee to implore you to receive a clear revelation from God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You have to see the world, the self, and the true picture of everything around you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only then will you be able to work for God, and only then will you be acceptable to Him.</S>
