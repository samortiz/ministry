<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Charged by Jehovah</H2><P>In verses 17 through 19 we see that Jeremiah was charged by Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Gird Up His Loins<br>and Rise Up to Speak His Words to Israel,<br>Not Being Dismayed before Them</H2><P>Jeremiah, who was born a priest but was called to be a prophet, might have been a timid, fearful person. This timid person was given a charge by Jehovah. In the first part of this charge, God said to him, "You therefore gird up your loins, and rise up and speak to them everything that I command you. Do not be dismayed before them, lest I dismay you in their presence" (v. 17). If Jeremiah had been dismayed before the people, God would have dismayed him.</P><P>Today, in the matter of functioning in the church meetings, many saints are dismayed. But we should not be dismayed by anyone, and we should not be afraid of anyone. No matter who is present in the meeting, we should not be dismayed. Rather, we should function to speak for the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Be Made by Jehovah into a Fortified City,<br>into an Iron Pillar, and into Brass Walls</H2><P>In verses 18 and 19 we have the second part of Jehovah's charge to Jeremiah. "I am now making you today into a fortified city and into an iron pillar and into brass walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land. And they will fight against you, but they will not prevail against you; for I am with you, declares Jehovah, to deliver you." Why was it necessary for God to make Jeremiah into a fortified city, into an iron pillar, and into brass walls? This was necessary because a battle was raging. The kings, the princes, the priests, and the people of the land were enemies not only to Jeremiah but also to God. These enemies were fighting against God, and Jeremiah was sent to represent God and fight for Him. Those who fought against Jeremiah fought against Jehovah because Jeremiah and Jehovah were one. For this reason, God wanted Jeremiah to know that He was with him and that He had made him into a fortified city, into an iron pillar, and into brass walls.</P><P>The Bible tells us that on earth there is always a battle raging between God and those who oppose Him and fight against Him. God does not fight by Himself directly but through His servants who have been sent by Him. This was the situation in Jeremiah's time. God sent His army&#151;a young man named Jeremiah&#151;to fight against those who opposed Him. Jeremiah was equipped by God to such an extent that he became a fortified city. Because God was with him to deliver him, the opposers would not prevail over him.</P><P>In the Lord's recovery today, we also face opposition, condemnation, and rejection, and we also must fight for God. As we are sent by God to fight for Him, He fights through us. In this fighting our weapons are God Himself and the truth revealed in the Bible.</P>
