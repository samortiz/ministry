Ephesians 6:18 says, "By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance." Our prayer should be by all means and at every time. We should have general prayers, and we should also have specific prayers. Many of our prayers are too loose and too careless; there are too many loopholes. This is why Satan finds many opportunities to creep in. If our prayers are fine and careful, and if we cover everything in prayer, Satan will not be able to do anything.</p><p>Suppose a brother is about to travel to another place to preach the gospel. You should lay the tracks for him so that God's will can be fulfilled in him. If you only pray a few words for him and ask only that God bless him, protect him, and supply him, this prayer-net is too loose. If you want to pray for a person, you need to lay a very careful prayer-net for him so that Satan cannot creep in from any direction. How should you pray? You should start from the time he leaves his home. You should pray for his health, his luggage, and his train. You should pray for the time he will board the train, his food, and his sleep on the train, as well as the people he will meet on the train. You should also pray for everything he will encounter after he leaves the train and for the house where he will eventually be staying. You should pray for the neighbors and the things he will need while he is staying there. You should pray for the time of his work and everything related to him. After you have prayed for him in such a thorough way, Satan will find it very difficult to identify any loopholes from which to attack him. Hence, the work of prayer is a very practical work. Whoever is lazy, foolish, and loose cannot participate in the work of prayer. After we have earnestly prayed over all the aspects of a certain matter, we often find the matter eventually being accomplished.</p><p>There is still one lesson that we have to learn. Satan is full of deception, and we can never anticipate all the schemes that he has. It is impossible for us to pray over them one by one. We can only pray, "Lord, please deal with everything from Satan with Your precious blood." We must realize that the blood is the answer to all the works of Satan. Such a prayer is the best way to deal with Satan. He can never penetrate through these prayers to attack us.</p><p>Every time we pray we have to see three things. First, we must see to whom we are praying. Second, we must see for whom we are praying. Third, we must see against whom we are praying. Many times we remember only two of the three aspects; we remember that we are praying to God and for men, but we put Satan aside. In our prayer, we must not only know to whom we are praying but also against whom we are praying. We must not only know for whom we are praying but also that an enemy is out there to damage us. Our prayer is to God; it is for men, and it is against the devil. If we deal well with these three aspects, God will work for us.</p><p>Everyone who has a genuine desire to work for the Lord must set up a prayer-net so that God can work through him. God is not reluctant to work; He is waiting for men to pray before He will work. He is looking for some who will have a life of prayer. His will is waiting for man's prayer. There is often no predisposed intention to pray, yet something within urges you to pray. This means that some items of God's will are waiting for your prayer. When you have a burden to pray, and you pray accordingly, that prayer is according to God's will; it is the Holy Spirit who is urging you to pray a prayer that is according to God's will. When the Holy Spirit urges you to pray, you should pray. If you do not pray then, you will feel clogged up, and you will feel that something is left undone. If you continue to refuse to pray, you will feel more clogged up. If you insist on not praying to the end, the spirit of prayer and the feeling for prayer will become dull, and you will not be able to easily pick up the same feeling again later. You will have failed to pray according to God's will.</p><p>Every time God wants to put a burden for prayer within us, the Holy Spirit will first give us a feeling and a burden to pray for certain things. Once we have such a feeling, we should immediately pray conscientiously; we should pay a price to pray for that matter. Once we have the prompting of the Spirit, we will immediately have a burden in our spirit, and the burden will remain there. Once we pray, we will feel released, and the rock will be removed. If we do not pray for it conscientiously, we will feel that something is still there. If we do not pray for it, we will feel that we are not being one with God. If we are faithful to prayer and pray immediately after we have a burden, our prayer will not become a burdensome task but an easy and refreshing work. Unfortunately, many people quench the Spirit; they quench the feeling for prayer which the Holy Spirit has put within them. After a while, these feelings no longer come to them, and they are no longer useful vessels in God's hand. They can no longer accomplish anything for the Lord or execute God's will by prayer. Brothers and sisters, if we are this way before the Lord, having lost all feeling for prayer, we are probably in a very dangerous condition. We have lost our fellowship with God, and God can no longer use us for His work. We must be very careful with the feeling that the Holy Spirit gives to us. Anytime we have a burden to pray, we should immediately ask, "God, what do You want me to pray for? What do You want to do now? And what do You want me to pray about?" If we get through in our prayer with this one burden, the Lord will entrust us with a second prayer. If we have not released our first burden, we will not receive a second burden.</p><p>We need to ask the Lord to make us a faithful praying person. Once there is a burden, we should release it immediately; we should express it through prayers. If the burden is too heavy and we cannot release it through prayer alone, then we need to fast. Anything that cannot be released through prayer can only be dealt with by fasting. Fasting can release the burden of prayer quickly; it can help us to unload our heaviest burdens. If we continue to engage ourselves in the work of prayer, we will become a flowing channel for God's will; He will come to us whenever He has something that He wants us to pray about. Brothers and sisters, God's will is always seeking an outlet; God is forever seeking men to be the spokesmen for His will. If many people are raised up to do this work, God will accomplish many things through their prayers.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 38: General Messages (2) &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
