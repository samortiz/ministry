<h1 class="title">DEAD UNTO SINS AND<br />
LIVING UNTO RIGHTEOUSNESS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: 1 Pet. 2:24</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Living unto sins and dead unto righteousness
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The real condition of man is that man is living unto sins and dead unto righteousness. When you mention a crime, everyone is living. But when you talk about righteousness, everyone is dead.</li>
	<li>Give examples to prove that man has the instinct to commit sins. For instance, a child does not need to be taught to lie.</li>
	<li>Also give examples to prove that in doing good works man is as weak and impotent as a dead person.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s saving way
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We are incurable. The nature of our life is prone to sin and cannot work righteousness.</li>
	<li>Yet, in God&rsquo;s regeneration, we receive His life in addition to our original life.</li>
	<li>When God&rsquo;s life gets into us, we are born again and our old life is replaced by a new life.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Dead unto sins and living unto righteousness
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As soon as God&rsquo;s life enters into man, man is dead unto sins and living unto righteousness.</li>
	<li>Give examples to prove that a man is dead unto sins as soon as he is saved. Point out that formerly he was proud in committing sins, but now he is not.</li>
	<li>Then give examples to illustrate a man living unto righteousness. Point out that now he is lively and full of strength in doing good and working righteousness.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to have such a change
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Confess that you are weak and incapable of doing good, and that all you can do is commit sins.</li>
	<li>Repent, turn to God, and receive God&rsquo;s life into you.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
