   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SIN AND SINS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us go on by asking how man sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The act of sin involves a process.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible, in particular the book of Romans, tells us that the act of sin involves a process of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, sin dwells in man's flesh because he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second, the sin in man urges, tempts, and stirs up his lustful desire.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Third, if man follows this urging, he commits a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The acts of sin that are committed outwardly can be counted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, one can say, "Yesterday I committed one or two sins more than before.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today I committed one or two sins less."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Outward sins can be counted in number.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The number of sins may not always be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, within us there is another thing called the power of sin, which is always the same; it always induces us to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, there is a distinction between sin and sins in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In English, one is singular and the other is plural.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the original text, the distinction is even clearer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sins refer to the outward acts that can be counted item by item, while sin is something that cannot be counted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It refers to the sinful nature within man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The sin within man is a kind of power, a law, an inclination that continually pulls man downward and compels man to go down the path of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Pride, jealousy, and temper are all things within man which compel him to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order for one to sin, he must first have the inward power to commit the sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Just as there must be an inward power to perform good before one can do good, there also has to be the inward power to sin before one can actually commit any sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If there were no power within man, it would be difficult for him to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man's indwelling power to sin is just sin itself, the singular sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The outward sins committed by man are the acts of sins, the plural sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sins and sin are entirely different, and we must realize the difference between them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Romans is a book that deals particularly with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Chapters one through eight speak over and over again about sins and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Romans 1 5:11 speaks of sins, that is, the outward sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From 5:12 to the end of chapter eight, it speaks of sin, not sins.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The dividing line is verse 12 in chapter five.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Prior to 5:12, Romans deals with plural sins and covers such things as justification, forgiveness, etc. From verse 12 on, Romans deals with singular sin and covers such things as sanctification and freedom from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The two sections are totally different.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Blessed are those who have the grace to realize that the former section refers to plural sins, and the latter section refers to singular sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How do we deal with sins and sin?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First, let us look at how sins are committed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, temper is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If someone says something about you which is not nice, you may take their words into your ears and heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You may not feel happy, and you may lose your appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Something may rise up within you, and you may try to suppress it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the person continues to say unfavorable things about you, you may try to suppress your feelings even more.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, the more he speaks, the more your temper rises up within you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Should a Christian lose his temper?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Of course not!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Temper is a damage to the glory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But there is also a kind of power within you that wants to be let out.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the temper within is not let out, you will not feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Suppressing your temper may even give you a bleeding ulcer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the end you may lose your temper so violently that even your face and ears turn red.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Here we see two things in man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The first thing is the urge within that induces one to sin; this is the singular sin that is spoken of after Romans 5:11.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The second thing is the angry face, red ears, inflamed eyes, raised fists, etc. These are the many sins spoken of prior to Romans 5:12.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sins are outward, and they are countable item by item.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sins can be temper one time, pride the next time, and filthy thoughts another time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There can be hundreds and thousands of different sinful acts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But these hundreds and thousands of sinful acts all come from the singular sin within.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Here we see that a sinner has two different kinds of sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Consequently, there are two different kinds of salvation before God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The outward sins committed by the sinners, that is, the plural sins, require God's forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The many sins that separate us from God require forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When the conscience in us is at peace, we know that the sins separating us from God have been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, even though the outward sins are forgiven, the power within still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sometimes it compels a person to be proud or to lose his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Sometimes it compels him to become lustful or to have unclean thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>While the outward acts of sins have been forgiven through the blood of Christ, there is still something within pulling and dragging us to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, in order for God to save us, He must not only forgive our outward sins but also save us from the inward power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our outward sins need God's forgiveness, and our inward sin needs God's liberation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Forgiveness deals only with outward sins.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Liberation deals with the inward sin.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The plural sins refer to the various kinds of sins committed outwardly; the singular sin refers to the sin within that compels a person to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we want to understand these two kinds of salvation, we must first understand that there are two different kinds of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One is inward and the other is outward.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is unfortunate that after many Christians are saved, they merely experience the forgiveness of outward sins without experiencing any release from the inward sin.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must realize the difference between sin and sins before we can obtain God's full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Let me summarize the difference between sins and sin with the list below:</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>SINS</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>SIN</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Plural Outward Conduct Acts What we do Require forgiveness</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>before God Conscience is not at peace</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>if not forgiven before God Conscience Living</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Singular Inward Flesh Inward power What we are Requires liberation</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>within man Heart is not sanctified</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>if man is not released Heart Life</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Once we are clear concerning the scriptural distinction between sins and sin, and once we are clear concerning their difference in our living, we will see the way that God delivers us from our sinful living and sinful life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We will know how God forgives our sins and how He gives us the power to be free from our sin.</S>
