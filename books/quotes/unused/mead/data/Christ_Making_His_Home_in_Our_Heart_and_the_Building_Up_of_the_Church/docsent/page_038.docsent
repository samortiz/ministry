   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING THE LESSONS FROM OUR TRIALS Needing to Pass through Trials</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in Following the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The saints who are serving are still passing through trials.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For this reason, many do not have a sense of freshness concerning spiritual matters, including their service and spiritual pursuit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is something we all experience in following the Lord, because we all must pass through trials.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The truths we know need to be tested, our way needs to be tested, and our faith also needs to be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we are saved, we sense the sweetness of God s salvation, and our feeling is fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, we have the full assurance that God exists, that the Lord is our Savior, that we have been forgiven of our sins, and that we have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These things seem to be more real to us than physical things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, we will eventually be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God will test us, and He will let us test His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He will even allow us to test Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every person who is saved has doubts concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After I had been saved for some time, I was tested and began questioning myself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I asked whether I made a mistake in believing and whether God was dependable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although I testified often concerning God s answering my prayers, I still had questions concerning God, Christ, and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I believe that every brother and sister has experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Perhaps some are still on a honeymoon and have not had such a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, we all will pass through trials and experience a time of testing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Being Different in Our Way, Living, and Pursuit</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In many aspects we are different from those in Christianity because of our need to depend on faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our way is different from the way taken by those in Christianity, our living is different from their living, and the spiritual goal that we pursue is different from theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These three matters are rather serious.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our way, living, and pursuit differ from the way, living, and pursuit of those in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Most people in Christianity believe in God s existence, Christ s redemption, and man s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In addition to this general faith, we have seen the way of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are taking a way that is rejected by Christianity; hence, our way is different from theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the first difference.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Next, we are living a life of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I can testify that we live a life that is simple, yet it is a life of uncertainty.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have no assurance of our future.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We do not know how we will live next year.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even though we have no assurance concerning our future, we continue to live this way before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are willing to live a life of faith because we know the object of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are here to please the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Otherwise, we would not be able to live a life in poverty or simplicity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, we are pursuing to know the Lord and to allow Him to grow in us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We pursue to live in Him and to please Him so that when we see Him face to face, we will not be put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, most Christians do not have such considerations.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They know that in their Christian life they should not commit sins, especially gross sins, and this is sufficient for them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The way we take, the life we live, and what we pursue are all matters of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These matters cause us to go through trials so that we can know whether our way of faith, our life of faith, and our pursuit of faith are right.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some believers think that it is not necessary to have this kind of faith in order to be a pious Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They think that it is sufficient to pursue an overcoming life, growth in the Lord, and spiritual maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There are also believers who think that it is not necessary to live by faith or that it is wrong to experience poverty when serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even though such thoughts seem correct, intrinsically it is a matter of our attitude and our intention.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In 1935, after the first crisis in the church in Shanghai, I was tested severely with not only trials but also temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church in Shanghai began meeting in 1927.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In 1934 a crisis broke out, and all the burdens fell on my shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I did not suffer because of the crisis, but I suffered because the senior co-workers, both brothers and sisters, all left Shanghai when the difficulties began.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Consequently, the burdens and the situations that they left fell on my shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even though I was thirty years old at the time, the entire situation fell on my shoulders, requiring that I deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When I saw the situation, I could not but question the way I took and the object of my faith; I was tested.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I asked myself whether this was the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I knew that I was called by the Lord, but was this the way to serve Him?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At the time I felt that this way was extremely difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There was no one who could bear my burden or share the responsibility with me.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I was tested.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At the same time, the object of my faith was severely tested.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I questioned why I should walk on this way, why I should serve in this way, why I should live in this way, and why I should pursue in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Every aspect of my being was tried.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, as a result of this testing, I decided, Since I am a man, I must be a Christian, and since I am a Christian, I must take the way of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If I would not take this way, I would not be an absolute Christian, and if I am not an absolute Christian, I should not be a Christian at all.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>My choice was clear.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I saw clearly that I could not shrink back, even though I had passed through many trials.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As a conclusion I said, If I am a Christian, I must be absolute to serve the Lord, and if I am one who serves the Lord, I must take the way of the church, live a life of faith, and have a spiritual pursuit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I cannot take another way, live another kind of life, or have another pursuit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>While I was passing through trials, I made up my mind that no matter how poor or how difficult my life would be, I would take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even if others would not take this way, I would press forward and take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In 1943 I was imprisoned by the Japanese army and entered into a very deep and dark valley of the shadow of death.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It was an unprecedented time of trials.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>To this day I have not been tried in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The livelihood of my family was in question.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I was sick in bed and could not take care of my children; my family was in a destitute situation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>On one hand, I was being tried, but on the other hand, I was testing this way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I doubted whether this was the right way and whether I was right concerning this way.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Otherwise, how could I have been in such a situation?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>During my years of service to the Lord, I have sensed the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>His presence was especially strong in 1942.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>At this time the church in Chefoo had a great revival, and the work was blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>However, the trials that came in 1943 really caused me to question.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>One day as I was reading the Bible, I came across four small words that opened my understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In 1 Corinthians 4:11 the apostle Paul said, Until the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked and buffeted and wander without a home.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I was very familiar with this portion of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>However, when I came to the four words until the present hour I received a fresh revelation and realized that I was taking the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The apostle said that he was suffering until the present hour.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Could I expect less than the apostle?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>On that day in the winter of 1943, I put an end to my questions.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>From that day until today, for sixteen years, I have never tested this way again.</S>
