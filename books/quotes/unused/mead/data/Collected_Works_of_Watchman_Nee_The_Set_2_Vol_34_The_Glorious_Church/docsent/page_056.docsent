   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 10 says, "I was in spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord's Day here refers to the first of seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is not the same as "the day of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Bible, "the day of the Lord" especially refers to the day of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John saw the vision on the Lord's Day the first day of the week and not on "the day of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In spirit John heard a loud voice behind him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The spirit has to do with the God-consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is the organ with which we worship God and the organ by which we hear God's voice through the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John's spirit was free and uninhibited by the surroundings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He had the life of ascension Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His spirit was neither bound nor stirred up by his soul, and he was able to fellowship freely with the Lord and receive fresh revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although his body lost its freedom on the island of Patmos, his spirit was not bound.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The island of Patmos could not block the heaven above his head.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the contrary, it brought his spirit in touch with heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is unfortunate that God's children often misunderstand God's ordained "Patmos."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John went through extraordinary experiences on the island of Patmos.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was led away by the Holy Spirit from his own feelings into the realm of the spirit to hear God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before God showed him the future glory, He first turned his attention to the present condition of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, after he heard behind him "a loud voice like a trumpet," he "turned to see" v. 12 . What did the loud voice say?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 11 says, "What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John was charged to write to the seven churches in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But why was he charged to write to only seven churches?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At that time, in addition to the seven churches in Asia, there was also the church in Colosse and the church in Hierapolis Col 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why did God not charge John to write to them as well?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Seven is the number of perfection in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God chose these seven churches to represent the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The condition of the church from the time of the apostles until the Lord's coming is represented by these seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These seven churches were actual churches in John's days.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the Lord Jesus had come then, the words in the seven epistles would have been fulfilled in the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But at the same time, the Holy Spirit used these seven churches to represent all the churches after the time of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the condition of the seven churches described in the seven epistles has a double meaning: 1 the actual condition of the various churches is depicted, and 2 the churches represent the conditions of the visible church throughout the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verses 12 and 13 say, "And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me; and when I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands, and in the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The seven lampstands that John saw were the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These seven churches depict the conditions of seven local churches on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The seven lampstands are not joined as one, but they are seven separate lampstands, each being responsible for shining in its own locality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church is one in life; it is one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, in their outward appearance on earth, the churches have separate administrations; each church is responsible to the Lord alone as one of the seven lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In reading Revelation 2 and 3, the condition, work, circumstance, responsibility, failure, reward, and punishment of each of the seven churches are different.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we neglect this fact, we will fall into error.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These seven churches do not have a common name.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are called the church in Ephesus, in Smyrna, in Pergamos, in Thyatira, in Sardis, in Philadelphia, and in Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One locality can have only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There cannot be more than one church; neither can a few localities combine together to form a church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God has ordained that there be only one church in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, we see only the church in Ephesus, and the church in Smyrna, etc. There is not such a thing as the churches in Ephesus or the churches in Smyrna.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God has also ordained that no local church can be joined to another local church to form one church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is why the Bible says, "The seven churches which are in Asia" v. 4 , and not "the church in Asia." Asia is a province, and there is more than one locality in a province.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God's order in the church is that spiritually we submit to the authority of the Holy Spirit, and that we keep the locality as the boundary outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we know the Bible and if we know the Holy Spirit, we will acknowledge that there can only be one church in one locality.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is not scriptural to make a church out of a few localities or to have several churches in one locality.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Forming one church out of several localities demands a oneness that is not found in the Bible, while having more than one church in one locality divides the oneness that the Scripture demands.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are mindful that the seven lampstands are the seven churches, we will be reminded of the proper standing of the church in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is very meaningful that in the Bible the lampstands represent the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the Bible gold symbolizes God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The responsibility of the church is to express God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A lampstand does not have any light in itself; its light comes entirely from the oil as well as from the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In order for the church to shine for the Lord, it should trust continuously in God's Spirit and His holy fire.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Otherwise, it will not shine.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How we wish to see the church shining "in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation...as luminaries in the world, holding forth the word of life" Phil 2:15-16 .</S>
