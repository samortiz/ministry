   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After suffering for thirteen years, Joseph was enthroned to be the ruler of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He certainly longed to see his father.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may wonder why he did not do something to satisfy this longing as soon as he was enthroned.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He could have sent chariots from Egypt to bring his father to him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, it was nine years before he had Jacob brought to him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Joseph had the power and the position to do something, but he did not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If I had been Joseph, I would have done something immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I would have taken an army of chariots and gone to visit my father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Had I found that he had died, I would have visited his sepulcher.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Certainly it would have been normal for Joseph to do such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The fact that Joseph did nothing about this for nine years does not mean that he had no thought of his father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Joseph was not stone or wood, but a living person full of emotion, a person who loved his father very much.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Having been separated from his father for many years, he must have thought about him a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He probably realized how close Egypt was to his father's home in the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He knew that the journey there would take just several days.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, because he was under the sovereignty of God, he did not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Joseph preferred to remain under God's sovereign hand and not to initiate anything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He might have prayed, "Lord, it was You who sent me here, brought me through all the sufferings, and put me on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was You, Lord, who kept me from my father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Lord, I realize that all this has been of You.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, I dare not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, I would like to wait for Your sovereign time."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I definitely believe that Joseph prayed this way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This reveals that he was a self-denying person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although he had been enthroned to be the ruler of the earth, he nevertheless did nothing for himself or for his own enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was wholly for God's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Joseph's life was a life that waited for God's sovereign timing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead of initiating the contact with his father himself, he remained continually under God's sovereignty, praying, "Lord, You do it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Unless You do it, I will not do anything."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Young brothers and sisters, I expect the Lord to do much with you for His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But you must learn the lesson not to go ahead by yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Don't do anything on your own.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, keep yourself under God's sovereignty and let Him initiate something.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whatever needs to be done must be initiated by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How sweet is the record of Joseph's life!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because Joseph was fully under God's guidance, there was no need for him to regret anything he did.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Joseph is a living illustration of what is revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was a self-denying person who had no self-interest, self-enjoyment, self-feeling, self-ambition, or self-goal.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Everything was for God and for God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, when the time was right, he extended a warm invitation for his father to come to him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can learn many lessons by considering Joseph's life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Joseph had dreams and he interpreted his dreams and the dreams of others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All these dreams were fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nevertheless, Joseph realized that he still lacked one thing, and that one thing was his father's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Humanly speaking, nothing could satisfy Joseph except the presence of his father.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, he did nothing of himself to secure his father's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Instead, he was patient, constantly waiting for the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For nine years he did nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Finally an opportunity came to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But, realizing that the perfection of his brothers had not yet been accomplished, he still did nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only when his brothers had been edified did he extend the invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This invitation was initiated by God's sovereign hand.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God sovereignly prepared the environment to indicate that the time was right for Joseph to send for his father.</S>
