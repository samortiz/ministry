        <h2 class="head1">EXPRESSING GOD&rsquo;S GLORY</h2>
<p>The incarnation of the Lord as the Word speaks of the only begotten Son of the Father becoming flesh. However, the incarnation of the Lord has also been enlarged to include you and me and all who have believed in Him. Everyone who believes in Him has the reality of the incarnation and is a part of this tabernacle. The principle of incarnation and tabernacling should be applied to us all.</p>
<p>The significance of the incarnation is the mingling of God with man and the living out of God in man. As a result of this mingling, we become His habitation, a tabernacle, in which He may rest and make His home. Whenever and wherever a group of people live in the principle of incarnation and tabernacling, there will be glory. Such ones may look very ordinary, but among them and within them there will be the manifestation of glory. Being a Christian is not related to doing good deeds. Christians must cause others to touch a sense of glory in them, not just a sense of good.</p>
<p>Before I was saved, there was a fire at my place of work, and everyone was busy moving things away from the affected area. During this time I saw a small ink bottle made of fine china with a small Western brush that I liked very much, so I secretly took them home with me. After I was saved, the Spirit told me to deal with this unrighteous matter. Although I still had the ink bottle, I had lost the brush. Therefore, I decided to pay for its loss with money. I took the ink bottle and a dollar and went to see the owner. I confessed shamefully to him that I had taken the two items and that I was returning them willingly. After he listened to me, he insisted that it was not necessary for me to return them. After I pleaded with him repeatedly, he said, &ldquo;I will accept the ink bottle, but I cannot accept this dollar.&rdquo; Then he saw that I was holding a combined solar-lunar calendar, which were very popular calendars but not easy to obtain, and he said, &ldquo;I will accept your calendar as a substitute for the brush.&rdquo; Although I did not want to part with my calendar, I gave it to him because I was indebted to him. When I left, I still felt that I should not keep the dollar. So I prayed, &ldquo;Lord, please show me a beggar to whom I can give this dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I returned home, it was dark, but shortly after I shut the door, someone knocked on my door. I opened the door and saw a stranger who was asking for help because he had not eaten for the whole day. I immediately felt that he had been sent by God. I took him in, fed him, and gave him some steamed buns for his journey. Since he was unfamiliar with the surroundings, I helped him find a place where he could stay for the night. While we were on our way, I took out the dollar and put it in his hand. He was very surprised and said, &ldquo;I cannot take this.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Please do not refuse. You must take it.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Sir, you are very good. You are a really good man.&rdquo; I smiled and said, &ldquo;You are wrong. I am not good. I am a sinner. I am not good at all. Jesus is good. Jesus told me to feed you, and Jesus told me to give you the dollar.&rdquo; When we came to a crossroad, I pointed to a place where he could find accommodations. He thanked me and left. At that very moment, a brother called to me from across the street, saying, &ldquo;Brother Lee, where are you heading?&rdquo; Then he walked over to me and gave me a package. &ldquo;This is for you,&rdquo; he said. When I returned home, I opened the package, and incredibly, it was a combined solar-lunar calendar. The joy in me at that time was indescribable.</p>
<p>I had this experience when I was young. I was led by the Lord to confess and deal with my sins and to receive a stranger. This was not something that I would normally do; it was the Lord in me. This kind of behavior surpasses human goodness and morality. This is glory. As Christians who pursue the Lord, we should have daily experiences of incarnation so that people can see glory in us.</p>
<p>On the outskirts of Foochow, there were two flesh brothers who were also brothers in the Lord. They were farmers, and their land was on the hillside. Whenever there was a drought, they had to manually carry water up to their field to irrigate it. During one drought they carried water all day up to their field. The next day they discovered that their neighbor had dug a hole at the ridge of their field and had drained their water into his field which was located on a lower terrace. They did not want to say anything, so they plugged the hole and again watered their field. However, when they went to their field the next day, they found that the neighbor had again stolen their water. The brothers were very angry, but they did not want to have an argument with him because they had recently preached the gospel to him. They went to see a brother to ask him what to do, and this brother led them to pray and read from Matthew 5:39-42, which says, &ldquo;Whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also. And to him who wishes to sue you and take your tunic, yield to him your cloak also; and whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two. To him who asks of you, give; and from him who wants to borrow from you, do not turn away.&rdquo; After reading the Scripture and praying, the two brothers irrigated their neighbor&rsquo;s field, and then they irrigated their own field. When the neighbor came to steal their water, he was surprised to see that his field was already irrigated. This occurred over a period of several days, and it greatly puzzled the neighbor. When he discovered that the two brothers were irrigating his field for him, he said in his heart, &ldquo;Even though I stole their water, they have not rebuked me; instead, they have irrigated my field. What kind of thing is this?&rdquo; The neighbor was greatly moved by their actions, and he apologized to the two brothers. Shortly thereafter he was saved.</p>
<p>This is an experience of incarnation. It is not being merely good or ethical. It is a mystery; it is the Lord Jesus living within people and living out from within them. I hope that these two simple testimonies will help you understand this principle. The One who was the Word in the beginning has been incarnated, and furthermore, He has come into us as life and has mingled Himself with us. He is now tabernacling in us. As we experience this mingling and His tabernacling, God will be manifested through us. We will have wisdom and discernment that others lack, and we will be able to endure sufferings that others cannot bear. In us there will be a situation that surpasses mere human goodness and virtue because God is being expressed through us. This is glory.</p>
<p>This is according to our experience. Before we were saved, we were full of pride and critical of others. Furthermore, we were estranged from others. Then we received the gospel, and we were regenerated. At that time there was no need for anyone to speak to us about our pride or to advise us to be reconciled with others. These responses were manifested in us because we met the Lord Jesus inwardly. In considering these responses, a husband may say, &ldquo;My wife has changed,&rdquo; and a neighbor may say, &ldquo;Oh, she is so different.&rdquo; Even parents may say, &ldquo;My daughter is a different person.&rdquo; The more we contact the Lord, the more we are changed, and the more people will speak of God&rsquo;s glory being in us. Although our response may be manifested seemingly as mere zeal, patience, or goodness, the source of these virtues is mysterious and marvelous.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PEOPLE RECEIVING GRACE AND TOUCHING REALITY WHEN THEY SEE GLORY</h2>
<p>When people see God&rsquo;s glory in us, they can receive God through us as grace. They can also meet God and touch God in us as the reality. John 1:14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father), full of grace and reality.&rdquo; The Lord is full of grace and reality because of glory. When people receive glory, they receive grace; when people touch glory, they touch reality. Glory, grace, and reality are related to the manifestation of God.</p>
<p>The living and the tabernacling of Christ that are seen in the Gospel of John are related to our Christian living. The Word became flesh, and as the tabernacle of God, He was filled with God&rsquo;s glory and He manifested God&rsquo;s glory. We have beheld His glory, and others can see this glory by receiving grace and touching reality through us.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
