   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Suffering from Dissenting Ones</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From the beginning of the church life in mainland China, there was a sister who was dissenting toward Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She was about twenty-five or twenty-six when Brother Nee was twenty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>She was a gifted sister who eventually became a traveling preacher and was considered very highly by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Following the six brothers who excommunicated Brother Nee, she was the major one who was always dissenting toward him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In January of 1934, while we were in the third Victory Conference in Shanghai, she was in the meetings in a dissenting way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>While Brother Nee was speaking, she was shaking her head in disagreement.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She was older than him and received respect from many directions, yet she was dissenting toward him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I saw many dissenting ones throughout the years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This sister was one of the strongest of these dissenting ones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>She was in the church life in the beginning in China, but eventually she left.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such dissenting ones were a real suffering to Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Suffering from Others'</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Immaturity and Incompetence</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brother Nee also suffered because of the immaturity and incompetence of those around him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was bearing the responsibility with the brothers, but there was no comparison between him and all the other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was very mature and competent, but the others were immature and incompetent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the early days of the Lord's recovery in mainland China, Brother Watchman Nee was a unique, extraordinary person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Spiritually, he was far beyond the other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He saw many things which the brothers did not see.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Most of us do not realize much concerning this kind of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Suppose that a brother who is thirty-four years old had to serve and bear responsibility with a brother who is only fifteen years old.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This illustration may give us some idea of Brother Nee's suffering in this regard.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because of the immaturity of the brothers, Brother Nee also had to endure their stubbornness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The practice of the church life in China began in 1922, and I came into the work in a practical way in 1933.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before I entered into the work with Brother Nee, I went to visit him in Shanghai for four months.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the end of that four-month period, Brother Nee said to me, "Witness, we brothers feel that you should move your family here and stay with us so that we can work together.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Please open to the Lord concerning this matter."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I went to the Lord, and I became clear that I had to move to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I entered into the work with Brother Nee, he put me into a position of bearing the responsibility with him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At first I wondered why he did this since I could be considered as a "new hand" in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A few of the others had been in Shanghai with Brother Nee for six or seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I was a new person in the work, but I was immediately brought into such a heavy responsibility with Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then I found out that all the other brothers were busy taking care of their jobs and businesses.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only one brother there was a co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whereas I was two years younger than Brother Nee, this brother was about seven years older than him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before this brother came into the Lord's work, he had been a postmaster.</S>
