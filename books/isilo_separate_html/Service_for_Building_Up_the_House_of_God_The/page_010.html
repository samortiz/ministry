<p>There must be fellowship in order to have church service. Hence, we should endeavor to fellowship. We should contact and fellowship with the saints before and after the meetings. In addition, the responsible ones need to fellowship with one another often. Our fellowship should not be limited to a particular matter. Our fellowship might be concerning a brother who has not been meeting lately or concerning the gospel. According to the Lord&rsquo;s leading, we can fellowship about anything, whether it is concerning the pursuit of life, the knowledge of the truth, or motivating others for church service.</p>
<p>Sometimes we need to invite the saints to a love feast in order to fellowship with them. We can invite everyone in the district to the love feast or have love feasts in the homes of the brothers and sisters. For instance, I can invite the brothers in my group meeting to have fellowship in my home, a responsible sister might invite the sisters in her group meeting to have fellowship in her home, or I can invite two families to my home for fellowship. Every responsible one should endeavor to fellowship with the saints. Through such fellowship unsaved family members can be brought to salvation, and the love of those who are cold can be rekindled. If the responsible ones in a locality focus on the meetings, visitation, and fellowship, the locality will be living, strong, and fresh.</p>
<p>A locality that neglects the meetings, visitation, or fellowship will not be strong. A locality that does not have meetings will be dead, and a locality without visitation and fellowship will be weak. Therefore, we must have meetings, visitation, and fellowship. The more fellowship we have the better.</p>
<p>In the church life we do not try to solve problems, but we endeavor to fellowship. Every problem is resolved with fellowship, for fellowship is the blood circulation of the Body. Doctors say that a person with normal blood circulation is healthy and less vulnerable to disease. A lack of fellowship issues in opinions and negotiation, which in turn produce problems. Therefore, we should not rely on negotiation but on fellowship. Fellowship is the means by which the spiritual blood circulates; that is, the grace of life flows. Hence, there should be continual fellowship among the saints. Misunderstandings, ignorance, and opinions are the result of a lack of fellowship. When we have thorough fellowship, your thought becomes mine, my thought becomes yours, and we spontaneously have the same blended and mingled thought. All the problems among the saints can be solved through fellowship.</p>
<p>The meetings are for supplying, propagating, motivating, and perfecting. Visitation is for shepherding and teaching. Fellowship is communion that lets life both solve the problems among us and supply our needs. In the church service every locality should pay attention to these three matters: meeting, visitation, and fellowship. I hope that the responsible ones in every local church will focus on these three items so that the meetings will be strong, the visitations extensive, and the fellowship thorough.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>When we are in life, then the truth is secure, the meetings, visitations, and fellowship are strong, and it is time to preach the gospel. This is how the gospel is preached. When the saints are enlivened and are serving, we must spread the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom by endeavoring in the gospel. If the saints have unsaved family members, we must encourage the saints to bring their family members to salvation. The Bible says, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household&rdquo; (Acts 16:31). The saints should be so burdened that they would weep before the Lord until this promise is fulfilled. The saints might also fast and petition the Lord desperately so that this word may be fulfilled. After our family is saved, we need to bring our other relatives and our friends, neighbors, colleagues, and schoolmates to salvation. We must motivate the saints to spread the gospel.</p>
<p>We should have gospel activities. We can have a gospel meeting for the whole church, distribute tracts and gospel booklets to our neighbors, or post gospel banners. Sometimes we may preach the gospel in the homes of the saints. The saints should not wait on a particular person in order to preach the gospel. A brother should be free to invite family and friends to his home in order to sing hymns with them. A sister might want to give her testimony to her family and friends or to read the Bible with them. We should also ask our gospel friends to speak, and then, according to their speaking, bring them to salvation. Preaching the gospel in the homes is not a quick way to bear fruit, but those who are saved in the homes experience a thorough salvation.</p>
<p>In addition, we can sometimes combine several group meetings and preach the gospel together, or two localities can have a large gospel activity. We must actively preach the gospel.</p>
<p>This fellowship is merely an outline. Every local church should pay attention to life, the truth, the church, and the gospel. This is not doctrine. This fellowship must be our practice. I hope that the saints in every church can be involved in these four matters.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
