<H1 CLASS=TITLE>LOVING GOD</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 37</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 22:37-38</H1><P>Several months ago, a certain Western missionary passed away in Fukien province. I once remarked that among the people I have known, she was a very deep person in the Lord. Since I am more knowledgeable about her affairs, I have considered writing a biography for her and have been collecting her lectures, articles, and essays for editing purposes. A package of her belongings arrived several days ago including a piece of paper with the following words written on it: "O God, I thank You, because You have a commandment saying you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind!" Oh! How profound this is! I do not know how many Christians would say, "God, I thank You because You have a commandment which says you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." Indeed, since we are all believers, we ought to love God. No other religion speaks of loving God like ours. Loving God is unique to Christianity.</P><P>The Bible says that he who believes in the Son has life. Believing is adequate because it does not say to believe with all your heart. He that believes will have eternal life. We are never told to believe with all our heart. However, loving God requires all our heart, all our soul, and all our mind.</P><P>This is the first commandment. No matter where it is placed, this commandment is always the first. This is also the greatest commandment. Wherever it may be, it is the greatest. Today we must praise God for commanding us to love Him.</P><P>God desires that we love Him because this profits Him. To believe in the Lord and have eternal life are for our profit. God not only wants us to believe in Him, but also to love Him. Loving God profits Him.</P><P>What kind of condition will we enjoy if we love God? We must look at several matters:</P><P>First John 2:15 says, "Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him." If any man loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. The love of the Father is something that can be put in us or can leave us. If we let this love of the Father be placed in us, we are able to love the Father.</P><P>Many young ones cannot forsake the world. When they are stirred by others in a meeting, it seems that they will not love the world anymore. At a different time they seem to be totally inseparable from the world. We must possess something better within us in order to drop the heart that loves the world. Once there was an art exhibition. While most of the works could be appreciated from a distance, it was necessary to study one of the paintings from close-up in order to understand its meaning. This particular painting, involving a child who was oblivious to all the lovely toys on the floor surrounding him, aptly illustrates a Christian's experience. The child's attention was focused on the windowsill, and he had up-lifted eyes and outstretched arms. The scene was perplexing from a distance, yet after careful observation, one could see a beautiful dove on the windowsill. The caption explained that in order to have the little dove, the child dropped all the toys on the floor. The moral of the painting was that one only discards the second best for the very best. God never demands that we throw anything away. He only places what is better in front of us. In order to obtain it, we will spontaneously forsake many other things.</P><P>A young believer who lived with me for two months once told me that he could not forsake the world. He told an old believer, "You can sacrifice because you have tasted all that this world has to offer. But I cannot." This young man knew about believing in God, but not about loving God. While believing in God can save us from sin, only loving God will deliver us from the world. Brothers and sisters, we must allow God's love to enter into us. Once the love of God enters, the world simply slips away.</P><P>First John 4:20 says, "If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen." This is a familiar verse to many, including unbelievers. This verse does not refer to loving the brother in your family, but your brother in Christ. Although the attitudes and behavior of many discourage you from loving them, once God's love enters into you, you will be able to love them. It is not loving the brother whom you love, but all the brothers. It is also not loving a lovable brother, but all the brothers. If you do not love all the brothers, the love of the Father is not in you; but if you have the love of God, you cannot help but love them.</P><P>The father of a man was killed; afterwards, the man was determined to get revenge. However, he was a genuine Christian. During the bread-breaking meeting one day, he found himself, along with others around a huge round table, sitting next to his adversary, the one who had killed his father. He left the table and went out because a battle had risen up within him. Should he kill him, or should he return to take the bread with him? At that instant God showed him the love of Christ. He saw that though he himself was an enemy to God, Christ saved him. He was melted by God's love. Wiping his tears, he went in to break bread with his enemy. When they were leaving, he no longer looked upon the man as his adversary, but his brother in Christ. If we truly have the love of God, we are able to love even an unlovable brother.</P>
