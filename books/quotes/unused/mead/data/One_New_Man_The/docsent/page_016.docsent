   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AS THE LIFE AND PERSON OF THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The new man is not a movement, such as the ecumenical movement, and is not an organization but a man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As a man, the new man must have life and he must have a person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The life of this new man must be Christ, and the person of this new man must also be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this new man there is no place for anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Jew, the Greek, the circumcised, the uncircumcised, the barbarian, the Scythian, the slave, and the freeman all have no place, but Christ is all and in all Col 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For one to say that Christ is his life and Christ is his person is not good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must say in the plural that Christ is our life and Christ is our person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord's recovery is here to bring forth the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Lord's recovery the Lord does not care for a movement or an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What He has been doing, and what He is now doing, is bringing forth the new man with Himself as the life and person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many among us will pick up the burden to move to other localities to start the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But at the same time, none of us should take this as an opportunity to be a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No doubt many leaders will be raised up because in every small church there should be some leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But we should all be willing, once a church is established, to follow the Lord's leading to go to still another place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not desire to be a leader, and we should not desire to have a "nation."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a great snare in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every Christian denomination is a "nation."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even every free group is a nation, an empire.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this situation there could never be the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Lord's recovery, among all the local churches, there should be no "nations."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the whole earth all the local churches are not "nations," but one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we have many "nations," spontaneously there will be organization.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if we do not have such nations, we will be simply, singly, and uniquely the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not care for the leadership, but we care to bear the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not care to have an empire, a little nation, in which we can be a little king.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, we are all in the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>TAKING THE SUBJECTIVE CHRIST AS OUR LIFE AND OUR PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Practically, we all have to learn how to take Christ as our life and our person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This very Christ who is our life and our person is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to traditional teaching, Christ is merely objective and in the heavens to be worshipped, adored, and praised.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, according to the New Testament, our Christ is the life-giving Spirit, who indwells our spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is not merely objective but altogether subjective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is the Spirit dwelling in our spirit, making our spirit one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today we are not simply worshipping an objective Christ in the third heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are experiencing, enjoying, and partaking of a very subjective Christ who is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all must learn to say, "Lord Jesus, since You are such a Spirit, I surrender myself and my all to You.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I surrender all my knowledge, ordinances, practices, rituals, works, doings, and everything to You.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I do not care for these things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Lord Jesus, I would simply take You as my life and my person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Lord Jesus, it is not I, but You who live in me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I do not like to do anything, be anything, or say anything that You would not do, be, or say.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Lord Jesus, You are my life and You are my person."</S>
