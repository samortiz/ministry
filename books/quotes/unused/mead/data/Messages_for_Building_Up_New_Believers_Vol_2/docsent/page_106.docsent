   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD S COMMAND BEING FOR US</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO TERMINATE OUR WORLDLY FRIENDSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God, however, has ordained that we terminate our friendships after we have believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. Friendship of the World Being Enmity with God</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>James spoke of friendship of the world James 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The world here means worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The friendship of the world is enmity with God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Please remember that the love for the Father is not in us if we love the world 1 John 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be a friend of worldly people is to be an enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A new believer must be very clear that as soon as he becomes a Christian, he has to replace all of his friends.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you have just accepted the Lord, you must replace your friends.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the same as changing one s attire and everything else when one believes in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Friends also need to be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One has to have an entirely different set of friends.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I know what I am talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A new believer will live a poor and shallow spiritual life if he does not change his friends.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A person should terminate all of his old friendships as soon as he believes in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is wonderful to note that when God s love comes in, man s love departs.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Lord s life comes into us, the world can no longer be a friend to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But our Lord did not say that we have to hate the world in order to love God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This does not mean that we have to ignore the world or that we can no longer greet our friends on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, it means that whoever befriends the world is at enmity with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We do not have to treat the world as our enemy, but our deep friendship and our devotion to fellowship with it must be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may still love our friends, but now our goal should be to save them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may still treat them as friends, but our goal should be like that of Cornelius to bring them the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Cornelius invited two groups of people when Peter came to his house: his relatives and his intimate friends Acts 10:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He knew that God wanted him to invite Peter, and he invited his relatives and intimate friends as well to listen to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the goal of our continued acquaintance; it is not to maintain our former ties.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A man cannot stop knowing a person whom he has known already.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A friend is still a friend.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One cannot cut off his relationship with those who have been acquainted with him for years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Dealing with our friendship means that we have a turn in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It means that all former relationships cease.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From this point forward, we still talk to our friends when we see them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We still discuss things with them if we have problems.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But we have a new life, while they do not have such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our relationship should not ignore this change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A person becomes a friend by first becoming acquainted with another, then by loving him, and finally by socializing with him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we continue such a relationship with our friends after we are saved, we are at enmity with God, and spontaneously we will not be able to go on in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In running a race, the lighter the weight one has on his body, the better it is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more one deals with sins, the lighter his weight will be.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more recompenses one makes, the lighter his burdens will be.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more friends you leave behind, the less weight you will have.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you add a few friends to yourself, you will find yourself being pressed down.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I have seen many brothers and sisters who have been held down by their friends.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They cannot be absolute to God s way; it is hard for them to be good Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>An unbeliever s standard of morality and conduct will always be that of an unbeliever s. They may not drag you down, but they will surely not lift you up.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>B. Not Being Dissimilarly Yoked</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>with an Unbeliever</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Second Corinthians 6:14 says, Do not become dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many people think that this is a word for marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I agree that being dissimilarly yoked does imply marriage, but it also describes all other relationships between believers and unbelievers.</S>
