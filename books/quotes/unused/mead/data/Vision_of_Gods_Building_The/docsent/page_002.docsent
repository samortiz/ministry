   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE GOD'S INTENTION A LINE IN THE SCRIPTURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From the beginning of Scripture to the very end there is a definite line of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Among the many items of His creation recorded in Genesis one and two, God mentions three precious substances: gold, bdellium pearl and onyx stone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why are these items mentioned at the very beginning, and what are they for?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The answer is revealed at the end of Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Revelation twenty-one and twenty-two there is a building, a city, called the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This city is composed of gold, pearl and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The precious substances mentioned in Genesis are the materials for the building portrayed in Revelation!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the beginning of Genesis we see the materials, and at the end of Revelation we see the New Jerusalem, composed of these materials.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then we may ask, what does the portion of Scripture between Genesis and Revelation deal with?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we read carefully, we will see the line of God's building from Genesis to Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But we can also see some building work which is not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The whole Scripture is a record of building!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Immediately after the fall of man, mentioned in Genesis three, we read of the city of Enoch, built by the fallen sons of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later, another city named Babel was erected, along with a high tower.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then the city of Sodom was built.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in contrast to these cities, God mentions some men living in tents.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Noah lived in a tent opposite the city of Enoch.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And later, Abraham lived in a tent opposite the cities of Babel and Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Genesis also relates the story of Jacob, a man who had a wonderful dream one night.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When he awoke he set up the stone which he had used for a pillow and poured oil upon it, saying, "This is the House of God."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is God's building!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A stone will be the House of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Book of Exodus relates how Jacob's descendants, the people of Israel, were taken captive in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As slaves of Pharaoh they worked laboriously to build two cities for him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But instead of using building materials of gold, pearl, and precious stones, they used mud.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They used something of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Bricks were made from mud hardened by the heat obtained from burning straw.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Pharaoh's two cities were made of earthly things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God eventually delivered the Israelites out of Egypt and took them to Mount Sinai in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There He asked them to build Him a tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we could have looked into the tabernacle and observed the priest worshipping in the holiest place, we would have seen him clothed with a breastplate and two shoulder plates full of precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Surrounding the priest was a scene of gold!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There was not any hay, straw, or mud bricks in that building; just gold and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to remember also that the tabernacle was the very center of the people of Israel during their history of wandering in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When they entered the good land of Canaan, the essential work of the Israelites was the construction of a temple another building.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But, before they could erect this structure, they had to defeat and drive out all their enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They had to gain the ground, the site for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On that cleared ground they built the temple, which became the center of the history of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Years later, after the enemy defeated Israel and took the land, the temple was immediately destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The enemy destroyed their center.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But after seventy years of captivity there was a recovery, a rebuilding of the city and the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The main item of the recovery was building the building of the city and the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This brings to a close the history of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The first outstanding event of the New Testament was the incarnation of Christ in human form.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Gospel of John relates, in the American Standard Version, that the Lord Jesus "tabernacled among us" John 1:14, margin .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God Himself was incarnated as the tabernacle, the building!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord Jesus was the building portrayed in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The enemy, Satan, utilized the Jewish people to destroy this building by putting Jesus to death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But the Lord had already told the Jews: "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" John 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means the Lord raised up His destroyed body in resurrection and by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This includes His mystic Body, the Church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the Epistles we are told the Church is the House of God, the Temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>So the Church is the very building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then, praise the Lord, at the end of Scripture there is nothing but a building, a city, the completion of God's building work throughout the generations.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this holy city, the New Jerusalem, there are the names of the twelve tribes of the Old Testament, and the names of the twelve apostles of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These two groups represent all the redeemed people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This means the New Jerusalem is a composition of all the redeemed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But this is not all; in the New Jerusalem, God and man are completely mingled as one building.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That is, divinity is mingled with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God is the content and man is the vessel; God is the life and man is the expression of that life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the ultimate building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have now briefly covered the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do you see the line, the vision of God's building, throughout the Scripture?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Remember, at the beginning there were the materials, but at the end there is the finished building composed of these materials.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In between are the accounts of the building procedure, and, of course, many inserted stories.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Briefly, these interesting insertions are the numerous accounts of the serpent, Satan, who crept in soon after the materials were mentioned in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But after the serpent appeared, God immediately foretold that the Seed of woman, Christ, would bruise that serpent Gen 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The serpent brought in sin and death, but Christ brought in righteousness and life Rom 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Christ Himself destroyed the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Eventually the serpent is chased away, cast out by Christ into the bottomless pit and the lake of fire Rev 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>That is the end of the insertions.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But the building of God stands completed!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This sums up a brief sketch of the Scripture, which is the record of God's building.</S>
