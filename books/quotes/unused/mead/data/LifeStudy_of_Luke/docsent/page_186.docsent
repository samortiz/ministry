   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Regenerating Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order for the Lord Jesus to come into us as the life-giving Spirit, it was necessary for Him to go through a lengthy process.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the life-giving Spirit, the all-inclusive extract of Christ, there is not only the essence of what Christ is, but also the element of the process through which He has passed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord did not merely come to dwell among man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, experiencing a great many things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was born of a virgin and grew up in a normal, human way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eventually, He went to the cross to be pressed in order to release the Spirit as His extract.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today the regenerating Spirit is the extract of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As such an extract, this Spirit comprises the divine element with the divine attributes and the human element with all the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This Spirit includes the element of the Lord s wonderful life of expressing God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit also includes the element of the rescued, restored, recovered, improved, polished, sanctified, strengthened, empowered, and uplifted human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Have you ever realized this?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The all-inclusive life-giving Spirit contains the element of the Man-Savior s uplifted human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Moving of the Spirit within Us</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Believers as well as unbelievers have a natural concept concerning how the Lord Jesus saves us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, a Christian may say, Oh, what a problem I have with my temper!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I can t do anything about it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have no choice except to lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Lord, help me!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After calling to the Lord for help this one may expect the Lord to stretch forth His hand from the heavens and help him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some Christians actually do not believe that Christ lives in us; they believe that He is merely on the throne in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nevertheless, even they will pray for the Lord to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How do they think the Lord will help them?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Their understanding of the Lord s help may be not only natural but even superstitious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The New Testament reveals that the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ is the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to realize this when we are tempted to lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may say, Lord, help me, or you may simply say, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you consider your experience, you will realize that when you call on the Lord s name, something moves within you and even mingles with you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the life-giving Spirit moving in you and mingling with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Of course, there is nothing wrong with asking the Lord to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But this kind of prayer can distract us from the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we pray in this way, we may expect the Lord s help to come from the third heaven and may feel that we need to wait for His help to arrive.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But when we call on the Lord s name, realizing that He is the life-giving Spirit dwelling within us, we shall sense Him moving in us and mingling with us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We experience this because the One who moves in us and mingles with us is the life-giving Spirit as the extract of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Simply by calling on the Lord s name we can sense the mysterious, all-inclusive extract moving in us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Elements in the All-inclusive Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Spirit as the extract of Christ contains the element of the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As the Spirit moves within us, the element of the highest human virtues also moves in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord does not rescue us from our temper by doing something miraculously as the ascended One on the throne in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, He rescues us by moving in us and mingling Himself with us as the One who indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we turn to Him as the One in our spirit and call on His name, He will move in us with all His elements.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this way He saves us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What we are saying concerning the Lord s saving us by moving in us as the Spirit is not a superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Just as taking medicine is not superstitious, so experiencing the moving of the Spirit in us is not superstitious.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When a person takes medicine, that medicine will work in him to kill germs.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is not an outward killing, the attempt to kill the germs by doing something outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the contrary, this is an inward killing, a killing that results from taking a prescribed dose of medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In a similar way, the all-inclusive Spirit contains the element of the Lord s all-inclusive death, and by this element the spiritual germs in our being are terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The all-inclusive life-giving Spirit also has the element of germination.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Spirit contains this element because in the Spirit there is the element of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Resurrection overcomes every form of death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because death cannot hold the element of resurrection, death cannot hold the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hallelujah for the element of resurrection in the all-inclusive Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whether or not we understand the elements in the all-inclusive Spirit, it is nonetheless a fact that these elements have been born into us through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we were born of our parents, we were born with the human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In like manner, on the day we called on the name of the dear, all-inclusive One, the all-inclusive Spirit came into us, and we were born of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now He with all His elements dwells within us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Born of the Pneumatic Christ in Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The first step in the reproduction of the God-man is that we be reborn of the pneumatic Christ in our spirit with His divine life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I like the term pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Since the Spirit in John 3:6 is the extract of the all-inclusive Christ, He is actually the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this verse the Lord Jesus does not speak of being born of the Spirit of God or of the Holy Spirit; He speaks of being born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Spirit introduces us to the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What is the pneumatic Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The pneumatic Christ is Christ after resurrection being the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have been born of the pneumatic Christ in our spirit with His divine life and nature.</S>
