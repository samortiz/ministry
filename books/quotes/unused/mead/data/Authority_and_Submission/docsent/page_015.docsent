   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God was unable to establish His authority over the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, God did not call back His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God can call back His presence, but He will never call back His system of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Wherever God's authority is, God is given a position of prominence.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, God maintains His system of authority, and on the other hand, He establishes His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although Satan rebelled against God's authority, and although man daily violates His authority by rebelling against Him, God will not let this rebellion continue.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He will establish His own kingdom.</S>
