<H1 CLASS=MSG>LESSON TWENTY-FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE DEVIL</H1><P>The devil is full of sin, decadence, and unrighteousness (Isa. 14:12-14). He has kingship and power. He was created with beauty, wisdom, fullness, and power. He was the ruler of the first world. Desiring to be equal with God, he fell. He envied man who was created to take his place and damaged man by tempting him to try to be equal with God. He tempted man to conspire and to join his party to recover his title as king and his position and power.</P>	<ol class="upper-roman">	<li>His nature:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"Steal"; "snatches away" (John 10:10; Matt. 13:19)</li>		<li>"Craftiness" (2 Cor. 11:3)</li>		<li>"He was a murderer from the beginning" (John 8:44)</li>		</ol></li>	<li>He has ten names:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"The great dragon [typifying cruelty]" (Rev. 12:9)</li>		<li>"Serpent [typifying the liar]" (Rev. 12:9)</li>		<li>"The Devil [typifying the tempter]" (Rev. 12:9)</li>		<li>"Satan [typifying the enemy]" (Rev. 12:9)</li>		<li>"The ruler of the world" (John 14:30)</li>		<li>"The ruler of the authority of the air" (Eph. 2:2)</li>		<li>"The angel of the abyss" (Rev. 9:11)</li>		<li>"The authority of darkness" (Col. 1:13)</li>		<li>"A roaring lion" (1 Pet. 5:8)</li>		<li>"An angel of light" (2 Cor. 11:13-15)</li>		</ol></li>	<li>His works:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"Seeking someone to devour" (1 Pet. 5:8)</li>		<li>"Sowed tares"; "leaven" (Matt. 13:25-29, 33)</li>		<li>"Blinded the thoughts" (2 Cor. 4:4)</li>		<li>"Hindered" (1 Thes. 2:18)</li>		<li>"Accuses...day and night" (Rev. 12:10)</li>		<li>"Destruction of...flesh" (1 Cor. 5:5)</li>		<li>"Buffet" (2 Cor. 12:7)</li>		</ol></li>	<li>His subordinates:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>When the last days come, he will be reborn into man and become flesh and be called Antichrist (1 John 2:22).</li>		<li>Inducing men to worship him, being hypocritical in doing good, and uplifting personality (2 Thes. 2:1-12)</li>		<li>His nature (Matt. 25:41)</li>		<li>"Rulers...authorities...world-rulers of this darkness...spiritual forces of evil" (Eph. 6:12)</li>		</ol></li>	<li>His destiny:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"Cast down...to the earth" (Rev. 12:7-9)</li>		<li>"Has only a short time" (Rev. 12:12)</li>		<li>Bound by an angel (Rev. 20:1-3)</li>		<li>After Christ's reign for one thousand years, Satan will be temporarily released.
