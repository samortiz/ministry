<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE ANGEL OF THE PRESENCE OF JEHOVAH<br>FOR DEALING WITH THE NATIONS</H2><P>Christ is the Angel of the presence of Jehovah for dealing with the nations (Isa. 63:1-6, 9; 64:1; 65:17-25; 66:15, 22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. To Rend the Heavens and Come<br>to Save Israel from the Nations</H2><P>He will rend the heavens and come to save Israel from the nations (Isa. 63:9; 64:1). The heavens will be rent, and there will be a wide opening for the Angel of the presence of Jehovah to appear, to come to the earth. By that time He will no longer be a tender plant. He will be so great.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. To Come with Fire<br>to Judge the Nations with His Burning</H2><P>He will come with fire to judge the nations on the whole earth with His burning (Isa. 66:15-16a). Recently there was a great wildfire, a great burning, in Oakland, California, and many people lost their homes. But when Christ comes the second time, the whole earth will be a wildfire. He will come with fire to judge the nations with His burning.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Tread the Great Winepress,<br>to Destroy Antichrist and the Evil People<br>of the Nations at Armageddon</H2><P>He will also come to tread the great winepress, to destroy Antichrist and the evil people of the nations at Armageddon (Isa. 63:1-6; Rev. 16:12-16; 19:19-21). This treading is not the positive reaping of a harvest. It is the negative reaping of God's judgment upon the evil people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. To Bring In the Time of Restoration&#151;<br>the Millennial Kingdom<br>unto the New Heavens and New Earth</H2><P>Finally, when Christ returns, He will bring in the time of restoration&#151;the millennial kingdom unto the new heavens and new earth (Isa. 65:17-25; 66:22; Rev. 20:4-6). At Christ's coming back, He will burn the world and tread the great winepress, which includes Antichrist. By doing these two things, He will clear up the whole earth. Then He will bring in God's kingdom to this earth, and that will be the time of restoration. The returned, repentant Jews will enjoy that restoration, and the overcoming Christians will be in the heavenly part of the kingdom of the heavens. The Jews will remain on this earth to enjoy God's creation, which was damaged but will be restored by Christ's second coming. That restoration will usher in the new heaven and new earth. This is the best eschatology.</P>
