<h2 class="head2">Leaving Trophimus at Miletus</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Erastus remained in Corinth, and Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.&rdquo; Trophimus is one of the famous sick persons in the New Testament. Epaphroditus was one, and Trophimus was another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.&rdquo; Many times sick persons need to obey; they cannot say that they want to move around. If they are sick, they must stop for a little while. Paul said that he left Trophimus at Miletus. It was better for him to be left at Miletus and not be occupied with so many things.</p>
<p>Concerning Timothy, Paul said &ldquo;Be diligent to come before winter.&rdquo; Paul gave him a definite time limit. Do not decide for yourself when to come. Be diligent to come before winter.</p>
<p>Brothers, we should see that this way is very clear. A brother like Paul, who walked before God, should be obeyed by Mark, Timothy, and Trophimus. If so, spontaneously, we will see that there is fellowship in the church, and spontaneously we will also be able to understand what authority is.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Titus Being Left in Crete<br />
and Being Diligent to Go to Nicopolis</h2>
<p>Concerning Titus we do not need to say much. A few verses from the first and the last chapters of Titus are sufficient.</p>
<p>Titus 1:5 says, &ldquo;For this cause I left you in Crete, that you might set in order the things which I have begun that remain and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you.&rdquo; Are we clear? Titus was a young brother. In 2 Corinthians Paul indicated that he had entreated him to go to Corinth. They went to Crete together. Then Paul left Titus in Crete to complete the unfinished business. Paul told him how to set in order the things that were lacking, as he charged him. Here we can see authority and also fellowship.</p>
<p>Titus 3:12 says, &ldquo;When I send Artemas to you or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.&rdquo; Do you see? This is the way of the work. Paul said, &ldquo;I want to send one of two brothers to you, maybe Artemas or Tychicus. It has not been fully decided; in any case, one will come to you. When he gets there, you need to come to me quickly in Nicopolis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here we see how an elderly brother arranged many things and how a young brother listened to his word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Charging Timothy to Keep the Commandment</h2>
<p>Finally, we should say more concerning what Paul said to Timothy.</p>
<p>First Timothy 6:13-14 says, &ldquo;I charge you before God, who preserves all things in life, and Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate, to keep the commandment spotless.&rdquo; You see how weighty a matter this is&mdash;&ldquo;I charge you before God, who preserves all things in life, and Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate, to keep the commandment spotless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verse 20 says, &ldquo;O Timothy, guard the deposit.&rdquo; The commandment that I gave you, you need to guard.</p>
<p>Please remember that the young brothers need to learn what has been entrusted to the older brothers and learn to obey them. Then they will be able to walk the way ahead of them in a good way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Paul Also Needing Fellowship</h2>
<p>I hope that we can see how the work was carried out in the New Testament. The work in the New Testament is one that has arrangements, authority, and fellowship. I believe you still remember what I told you some days ago. Even though Timothy was a young brother, do you remember what was recorded in the book of Acts concerning what Paul did when Timothy came to him? &ldquo;When both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, solemnly testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ&rdquo; (18:5). I feel that in the Bible this verse is the best. Paul was one who knew the Lord and was used much by Him. Yet because Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, he was constrained by the word. With Paul, fellowship was also necessary. When Timothy and Silas came, it was a great encouragement to him. This is what you can see from Acts 18.</p>
<p>Acts 17:14 says, &ldquo;And immediately the brothers then sent Paul off, to go as far as the sea.&rdquo; Here Paul listened to the brothers&rsquo; word. &ldquo;And Silas and Timothy remained there.&rdquo; &ldquo;There&rdquo; refers to Berea, which is the name of a city in Macedonia. Macedonia is the name of a region, and Berea is the name of a city. Verse 15 says, &ldquo;And those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as quickly as possible, they went off.&rdquo; Paul commanded Silas and Timothy to come to him as quickly as possible. But after Paul went to Corinth, and after Silas and Timothy came to Corinth from Macedonia, Acts 18:5 says that Paul was constrained by the word. You see how good that situation was!</p>
<p>I hope that you brothers can see this principle in the work. Today we are like children learning to walk&mdash;step by step, slowly walking before God. I hope that all the children of God would know how to have the mutual coordination in the work; then we will be able to do the work in a good way.</p>
