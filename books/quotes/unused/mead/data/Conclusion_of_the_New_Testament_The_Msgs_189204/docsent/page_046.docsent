   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A. The Universal Aspect</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the universal aspect the church is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the end of Ephesians 1 Paul says that the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Universal Church</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only the Father knows the Son Matt 11:27 and can reveal the Son to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Son revealed by the Father is now building the universal church, not the church in a nation or the church in a city.</S>
