We appreciate and treasure Your being glorified. Hallelujah, our Christ is the glorified Christ! Lord, give us a heart to seek after You as the glorified One, and grant us the up-to-date utterance to release what You have shown us. Lord, in this matter we need You and we trust in You. Come in, Lord, to unveil to us more mysteries concerning Your being glorified. Amen.</P><P>The general subject of these messages is the issue of Christ being glorified by the Father with the divine glory. In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed to His Father concerning glorification, saying, "Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You" (v. 1). When we speak of glorifying a certain person, we mean that we praise or exalt that person. But this is not what God the Father did to Christ, and this is not what the Lord Jesus asked His Father to do. Rather, the Lord prayed that the Father would glorify the Son that the Father might be glorified in the Son's glorification. Christ's great prayer that God the Father would glorify Him was offered shortly before He was crucified. Immediately after He prayed that prayer, He was arrested and crucified so that He might be glorified.</P><P>The subject of the previous message was the concealed glory of Christ's divinity. In that message we saw that Christ as the second of the Triune God possessed the divine glory from eternity past and that His humanity, His flesh, through His incarnation became a shell to conceal the glory of His divinity. In this message we will consider the release of the glory of Christ's divinity. We all need to see that the glory of Christ's divinity, which was concealed in the shell of His flesh, has been released.</P>
