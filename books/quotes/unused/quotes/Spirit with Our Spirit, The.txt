The general subject of this series of messages is not 'The Spirit and Our Spirit' but 'The Spirit with Our Spirit'
In order to worship God, we have to realize that the One whom we are worshipping is Spirit in essence, in substance
Matthew 28:19 says that we need to go and baptize people 'into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
The name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit denotes the Divine Trinity and indicates that God is triune
The Father exists in the Son and the Spirit; the Son exists in the Father and the Spirit; and the Spirit exists in the Father and the Son
The Son's speaking is the Father's working, and the Spirit's moving is the Son's moving and the Father's moving
After this plan was made, the Son came to accomplish this plan, but He did this with the Father and by the Spirit
Even in Their economical works and manifestations, the three still remain essentially in Their coexistence and coinherence
God is in three persons the Father, the Son, and the Spirit and we men are tripartite, in three parts the spirit, the soul, and the body
You have a frame, you are a person, and this person in the frame has an organ, which is mostly for contacting God
The spirit of man was created by God, in a particular sense, to complete God's purpose in the creation of the heavens and the earth
Zechariah 12:1 says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him
When you lose your temper without limitation by the desire and lust of the flesh, of the body, you are like a beast
It is only after being regenerated to have God in us as our life and nature that we are in union with God organically
The difference between God's move, God's act, God's work, and religions is that religions do not have the Spirit
The first story is concerning God's creation of the heavens and the earth, with millions of items, and His creation of man
According to the Greek text, the title translated as the Holy Spirit may be in two forms: the Spirit the Holy or the Holy Spirit
According to my understanding, this means that in the New Testament age, the very God who is the Spirit is 'the Holy'
We are now in an age in which God Himself as the Spirit is 'the Holy' to make man not only separated unto Him but also one with Him
Athanasius, who was one of the church fathers, said concerning Christ: 'He was made man that we might be made God'
In other words the New Testament age is for bringing God and man together to constitute them together so that they coinhere to be one spirit
Luke 1:15 says concerning John the Baptist, 'He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb'
One was the conception of John the Baptist and the other was the conception of the Lord Jesus in God's incarnation to be a man in the flesh
We need to see that the conception of John the Baptist was strikingly different in essence from that of Jesus the Savior
Matthew 1:20 says concerning the begetting of Jesus in Mary, 'That which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit'
The Spirit as the dove came upon Jesus as the Lamb to carry out God's redemption and salvation for the accomplishing of God's economy
In the Old Testament, a number of people were anointed with oil, and then the Spirit came down to reach the anointed one
After the baptism of Jesus, we see Him standing in the water, the Spirit coming down upon Him, and the Father speaking from the heavens
In these Gospels we see that God, Jehovah, who is the very holiness, came down upon the man Jesus as the Spirit to be one with this man
When John said 'the Spirit was not yet,' he meant that the Spirit was not yet to flow out of the believers as rivers of living water
Before Christ was resurrected, the Spirit who would flow into the believers and flow out of them as rivers of living water was not yet
The Spirit flowing into and out of the believers as rivers of living water would not come into being until after Jesus' resurrection
The tree's story does not depend upon its outward frame, but it depends upon its intrinsic flow, its intrinsic current
Such transformation takes place by the renewing of the mind , and this is for the growth and the building up of the Body of Christ
It is not until the end of the first Gospel in the New Testament that we see the composition of the Divine Trinity
The composition of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit was not clearly and completely unveiled until after Christ's resurrection
He needed to pick up humanity through incarnation, and He needed to become the firstborn Son of God through resurrection
In the Spirit of God prior to the incarnation, there was no human living, no all-inclusive death, and no element of resurrection
In those thirtythree and a half years He passed through the processes of incarnation human living crucifixion resurrection and ascension
He went back into ascension as a God-man with the elements of humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection
In the previous message we saw that this consummated Spirit who is the consummation of the Triune God is five things to us
Watchman Nee taught us that in order to experience Christs death in Romans 6 we must enter into the experience of the Spirit in Romans 8
We know how the Son, who had from eternity been with the Father, entered upon a new stage of existence when He became flesh
It is in this capacity specially that He bears the name of Holy Spirit, for it is as the Indwelling One that God is Holy
To bring human nature itself again into the fellowship of the Divine life to make us partakers of the Divine nature
In virtue of His atonement, man now had a right and title to the fulness of the Divine Spirit, and to His indwelling, as never before
The Holy Spirit could come down as the Spirit of the God-man most really the Spirit of God, and yet as truly the spirit of man
He can now come down to witness of the perfect union of the Divine and the human, and in becoming our life, to make us partakers of it
The best type of the all-inclusive Spirit of Christ as the compound anointing Spirit is the compound ointment spoken of in Exodus 30
The compound anointing Spirit is compounded with God's Divine Trinity, typified by the three units of five hundred shekels of the spices
Christ's resurrection and its repelling power, typified by calamus and cassia , are also elements of the compound anointing Spirit
All the above elements compounded together create an ointment for the anointing of all the things and persons related to the worship of God
In the New Testament, we see the compound anointing Spirit operating as the Holy Spirit to seal the believers of Christ
When we live by the Spirit, we have the sense that something within us is saturating us, and that saturating is the continuous sealing
It is remarkable that we sinners can be transformed to such an extent that we are considered by God as His inheritance
The Spirit is the Spirit of the Son to cry 'Abba, Father' in the believers' heart and to lead the believers to walk as the sons of God
Galatians 4 says it is the Spirit within us who cries 'Abba, Father,' whereas Romans 8 says it is we who cry 'Abba, Father' in our spirit
He is sealing us, saturating us, transforming us, and causing us to walk as the sons of God to make us a new creation
We have seen that in the Old Testament the Spirit is revealed simply as the Spirit of God the Spirit of Jehovah and the Spirit of holiness
Of course, He was the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Spirit of holiness throughout the Old Testament
Resurrection was a birth to Christ , and in that birth Christ in His humanity was born to be the firstborn Son of God
Since the Triune God has gone through so many processes, how could the Spirit of God have remained the same, without any change?
From the time of Christ's resurrection, whatever has been constituted and wrought into Christ has been consummated in the Spirit
Today some in Christianity pay much attention to John 1:14, but they do not see that the last Adam, who was flesh, became something further
The third 'missing' among today's Christians is that they do not see that the life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God
At the completion of Christ's resurrection, He revealed this divine title to His disciples: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
It was not until the resurrection was completed, that this title the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit was clearly revealed in full
To study the definition of the Spirit, we have to get into and stress these five 'missings,' which are covered in these messages
The book of Revelation reveals the seven Spirits as the sevenfold intensified Spirit for the church's degradation in the dark age
Throughout the past nineteen centuries, God has been carrying out His economy; on the other hand, Satan has been carrying out his chaos
We published a book on this subject entitled The Satanic Chaos in the Old Creation and the Divine Economy for the New Creation
Eventually, the satanic chaos will be done away with in the lake of fire, and the divine economy will consummate in the New Jerusalem
When the Lord was on this earth for thirty-three and a half years, He did everything by the Spirit, but the Spirit was still just one
Eventually, the life-giving Spirit, the compound Spirit, has become the sevenfold Spirit as the seven eyes of the Lamb
The processed Triune God consummated as the Spirit is married to the redeemed regenerated transformed glorified tripartite man as His wife
The New Jerusalem as the conclusion of the Bible is the marriage life of the processed God married to the transformed man
The essential Spirit of God is the Spirit of life breathed into the believers as the divine essence of the divine life
The economical Spirit of God, the Spirit of power, was poured out upon the believers as the divine essence of the divine power
In resurrection Christ, who was the only begotten Son of God in His divinity, was born of God in His humanity to be the firstborn Son of God
If our understanding and apprehension of the Spirit are limited, we will not enjoy the Spirit as much as we should
Today the Spirit is the instrument which conveys all the elements of Christ's person and Christ's work into our being
Christ's divinity, His humanity, His death with its effectiveness, and His resurrection with its power remain in us
These are the strong verses in the New Testament which convey the revelation to us concerning both God the Spirit and our spirit
People say there is no God, because they are unaware that they have a particular organ within them with which to contact God
As we have seen, 1 Thessalonians 5:23 and Hebrews 4:12b are the most basic verses in the Bible concerning man's three parts
In Genesis 27 the Hebrew word for breath neshamah is the same word used for spirit in Proverbs 2027 which speaks of the spirit of man
If we do not care for our spirit, we can never enjoy God, we can never be spiritual, and we can never grow in the divine life
Day by day we are confronted with things and situations in which we must decide whether to follow our fallen body or our regenerated spirit
The newspapers always give reports of people who are involved in evil things such as robbery, stealing, fornication, divorce, and murder
God created our spirit; second, He regenerated our spirit; third, He strengthens our spirit; and fourth, He refills our spirit
God created man in a marvelous way so that man could contact God, contain God, and receive God as life to express God
Genesis not only tells us that God created man in His image and after His likeness but it also tells us how He created man
In the modern culture of today's world, people mostly care for the physical things and neglect the spiritual things
Most of them do not know their spirit, but some know one part of their spirit, that is, their human conscience
Zechariah 12:1 says clearly that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him
Our human spirit is important because it is in this spirit that Christ and the Spirit indwell us, taking our spirit as God's habitation
Both the embodiment and the realization of God indwell us, remaining within us to be our contents in our spirit
He created us with an organ to receive Him, to take Him in, and to contain Him so that He can come into us to be our contents
Corinthians 2 tells us that the spirit of man knows the things of man and that the spiritual man discerns all things
Our human spirit is the spiritual organ for us to know the things concerning man and eventually to know the things concerning God
He was in his spirit when he saw the vision of the great harlot, Babylon the Great, which is degraded Christianity
Without God being the Spirit and without us having a spirit to contact God to be one with God the whole universe is empty and we are nothing
Some who are governed merely by the law like to find loopholes in the law so that they can carry out things that are unrighteous and unjust
If you rise up in the morning without saying anything, you may pray in a routine way without really touching the Lord
It may be a problem between you and your spouse, between you and your children, or between you and your parents
If you do not exercise your spirit at that time, your entire soul with your mind, will, and emotion will become prevailing
The exercise besides that of the body, which is the exercise unto godliness, must be the exercise of the spirit
If you get into these verses, you will see that the fanning of our gift into flame is the fanning of our spirit into flame
Regardless of how much work Satan has done and is still doing, there is one thing within that he cannot touch our spirit
If something were burning within a house, and you wanted to fan that fire, you would open the window or the door
If you want to fan your spirit into flame, you need to open up your mouth, open up your heart, and open up your spirit
If you are down, you should call, 'O Lord Jesus' again and again from deep within with the exercise of your spirit
God has given us a spirit in the center of our being surrounded by the three parts of the soul the will, the emotion, and the mind
Our will should be strong, full of power; our emotion should be loving, full of love; and our mind should be sober, full of sobermindedness
Quite often such a message is more living, more powerful, and full of more impact and supply than other messages
It is easy for the husband and the wife to commit sins because when they are with each other, they do not set their mind on the spirit
It says that the word of God can divide our soul from our spirit and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart
If we exercise our spirit, there is a discernment that our thoughts are evil, because behind our thoughts there is an evil intention
Before a brother begins to talk to his wife about another brother, he has to consider, 'Is this of my spirit or of my soul'?
If we are going to walk according to our spirit, we must learn not to do things too fast or to say things too quickly
Even within us there is a battle between the spirit and the flesh and even the more between the spirit and the soul
Before we were born, before we were created, before Adam was created, and even before the universe was created, God foreknew us
He was like a person coming to a supermarket, looking around at all the items, and choosing the ones that he liked
1 Peter 12 says that Gods choosing us in the sanctification of the Spirit was unto obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ
We are ready to receive God's redemption, and the first step of God's redemption is for Him to sprinkle us with His blood
We received His Spirit's sanctification, and that resulted in our repentance and faith in God's Son, Jesus Christ
Our being made holy began when the Spirit as the woman came to seek us, to bring us back to God unto His holiness
The word of God is a lamp used by the Spirit to illuminate and expose the sinner's position and condition that he may repent
The Spirit is a woman coming to seek us by lighting the word and sweeping within us, in our inner being, until she gets us
The Spirit came to us to sanctify us unto God to separate us unto God first by seeking us carefully and second by convicting us prevailingly
On the whole earth, in the whole universe, righteousness is in Christ, and He is God's righteousness given to us as our righteousness
If Christ only died on the cross and still remained in the tomb, there would be no righteousness and we could never be made righteous
He rose up for us to have Him as our righteousness, for us to be justified by God with Him as our righteousness
While the Spirit is seeking us out, He convicts us concerning this sin, concerning this righteousness, and concerning this judgment
But the father said to his slaves, Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet
The son came back as a poor, pitiful prodigal, but the father gave him three things: a robe, a ring, and sandals
He had been eating the carob pods which the hogs were eating and he had walked quite a distance to his fathers house without eating anything
After we are justified by God with Christ, we receive Christ as our satisfaction, as our supply, as the fattened calf
In the previous message, we saw the Spirit's work in sanctifying the God-chosen people before they repent and believe
In reading 1 Peter 1:2 and 3, we can see not only the thought of Peter but also the thought of the inspiring Spirit
The main thought in these two verses is embodied in three crucial words: chosen, sanctification, and regenerated
Today this prototype has been duplicated in mass production because in resurrection He has become the Firstborn among many brothers
Most people think that if Adam had not fallen, he and we would not have needed to be regenerated, but this is absolutely wrong
The God-created man needed to be reborn of God, not just to have God's breath of life, but to have God's life itself
Christ was born to give us a second birth, that is, to make us God in His life and nature, but not in His Godhead
Sanctification, renewing, and transformation are all a continuation of regeneration to make us a new man with the divine and human natures
He worked to convict us , causing us to repent and stirring up our heart that we might have the desire to go to God
God chose us; then God the Spirit came to sanctify us; and sanctification is for sonizing, which begins with the Spirit regenerating us
According to John 1:12 and 13, those who receive Christ by believing into Him will be born of God to be God's children
His death and resurrection are the process, the means, through which we can be made dead, buried, and resurrected to have another life
We need a revelation to see that we were created by God, yet we became fallen, involved with sin and joined with Satan
Man cannot enter into the animal kingdom to fellowship with the animals and understand them, because man was not born with the animal life
Sanctification is not sinless perfection or purity, because the gold did not become more pure when it was sanctified by the temple
When the gold was in the market, it was common and worldly, but the same gold in the temple became holy, sanctified
The gold in the temple and the sacrifice on the altar are sanctified by changing their location from a common place to a holy place
We found out that sanctification is related to God's economy, and God's economy is altogether centered on the desire of God
When the Spirit convicted us concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment, we fully realized our position and our need
The word sonize was invented by us to describe the process of God's sanctifying work to make us His sons in a full way
Webster's dictionary is always coming up with new editions to contain the new words added because of the need of the culture
The church fathers came up with the terms Trinity and Triune God to describe the fact of the person of God revealed in the Bible
Verse 10 speaks of bringing many sons into glory, and verse 11 speaks of the Sanctifier and the ones being sanctified
He became like a poor beggar and his poor situation surely did not match his rich father and did not qualify him to enter his fathers house
The father's clothing his son with the best robe and putting a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet signify God's redeeming
The Spirit brought us back to God, but we were full of sins, so at that juncture, God applied Christ's redemption to us
We need to realize that God's work to make us a new creation starts at our regeneration and is still going on in sanctification
From the time of our regeneration, the Triune God has continued His renewing work within us by sanctifying us dispositionally
God regenerates us to make us a new creation, and this is the beginning of our dispositional sanctification by the Spirit
Our being made a new creation continues from regeneration throughout our entire Christian life by the Spirit's dispositional sanctification
Outward correction may cause us to change a little bit in our doings, in our actions, but inside we remain the same
The Spirit sanctifies us not just by correcting us but by supplying us with His constituents, with His riches, with His divine element
In 1 Thessalonians 5:23, Paul expressed the desire for our whole being to be sanctified, that is, to be brought into glory in full
The sanctification which we enjoy is not only a change of our position but also a constitution of our disposition to sonize our entire being
In this message we want to see that the divine sanctification is the holding line in the carrying out of the divine economy
We say that sanctification is the holding line because every step of God's economy in His work with us is to make us holy
Paul said in 1 Corinthians 3 that he laid Christ as the unique foundation and that now we must build upon this foundation
Some may argue by saying that the angels are holy and that in the Old Testament there are God's holy people with the holy city
One brother who has been in the church life for many years is more holy than a new one who has been recently regenerated
Our being made holy will be consummated at the redemption of our body, which is the transfiguration of our body
The sanctifying work of the Spirit first issues in our repentance and continues all the way to our glorification
We do not have and we cannot have God's Godhead, but we do have God's life and nature so that we may be God's expression
Eventually, our body, which is still full of weakness, sickness, lust, and sinfulness, will be transfigured, glorified in full
The redeeming sanctification, the positional sanctification, is by the blood of Christ to transfer us from Adam to Christ
The renewing sanctification continues our dispositional sanctification by renewing our soul from our mind through all the parts of our soul
Romans 12:2 says that we are to be transformed by the renewing of our mind, and the mind is the leading part of our soul
Corinthians 4:16 says that day by day our outer man, our old man, is being consumed, and our inner man, our new man, is being renewed
When the sanctifying Spirit sanctifies us, there is a shaping element to shape us into the image of the glorious Christ
The glorifying sanctification is the consummating sanctification, the completing sanctification to redeem our body by transfiguring it
At this point God's salvation and God's sanctification to carry out God's economy have reached the highest level
On the other hand, He is the woman, the Holy Spirit, to find the lost coin in a fine way by lighting a lamp and sweeping the house
The prodigal son in Luke 15 came to himself and repented because the seeking woman, typifying the Spirit, enlightened him and found him
Our repentance came from the finding of the Spirit, and the finding of the Spirit is the Spirit's sanctification
Our final experience of sanctification will be our glorification, the transfiguration and redemption of our vile body
Sanctification follows regeneration and continues through our whole life until we reach the redemption of our body
The sealing of the Spirit results in the redemption of our body, which is the full sonship we will enter into with our glorification
Following regeneration is sanctification, and sanctification implies renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification
God came in to save us through regeneration, and this regeneration washes away the old creation with sin, Satan, the world, and the flesh
Sanctifying is a kind of renewing, and this renewing is going on every day and every moment through our entire Christian life
In God's salvation everything is done once for all, but the application and continuation of what has been done are needed
When we leave the room where we have been working, the things there should not be in a collapse but should be headed up in Christ
Because we did not have modern conveniences where we were staying, we had to go to the kitchen to get some water for washing
Corinthians 41617 says Therefore we do not lose heart but though our outer man is decaying yet our inner man is being renewed day by day
For our momentary lightness of affliction works out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory'
If we suffer because of our roommate, this should consume our outward being so that our inner man can be renewed
As long as we have God's blessing, everything will turn out for our good, that is, for our transformation and eventual conformation
The fine work carried out by the transformation of the sanctifying Spirit in us eventually works out our glorification
The extent to which we experience the Lord's glory depends on how much consuming we have gone through, how much we have suffered
Colossians 310 says And have put on the new man which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him
The new man was created in our spirit and is being renewed in our mind unto full knowledge according to the image of Christ
We have been redeemed back to God and put into Christ to go through a process of death and resurrection all the time
We need the further work of the transforming, sanctifying Spirit to renew our entire soul, our mind, emotion, and will
When our soul is fully renewed, we will arrive at our maturity and be prepared for our glorification, the transfiguration of our body
In this transforming work, we pass through the death of Christ, which deals with and terminates all the matters of the old creation
The sanctifying Spirit transforms us by constituting the processed Triune God into us, the redeemed and regenerated humanity
According to Romans 12:2 transforming is by the renewing of our mind, including our emotion and will, that is, our entire soul
The resurrecting Spirit is the reality of Christ's resurrection, which is working within us all the time to bring in Christ
The new element is added into the God-created, redeemed, and regenerated part to increase that part with what God is
Transforming is a process bringing our old man through the death of Christ and carrying on our new man in the resurrection of Christ
In Philippians 3:10 Paul said that he desired to know the power of Christ's resurrection and to be conformed to the death of Christ
In this transformation, there are the metabolism, the mingling, the constitution, and the organism, which is the Body of Christ
Jesus was the complete God and the perfect man compounded together, so He was the compounding of divinity mingled with humanity
Today this consummated, compounded Spirit is the life-giving Spirit, and this compounded Spirit within us is the resurrection
Today the people in the whole world are pursuing worldly pleasure and entertainment, but we are here day by day pursuing Christ
We are the members of the corporate universal new man with Christ as the Head and with all the believers as His members
In this constituting work, the embodiment of the Triune God, Christ, is being added and wrought into our being every day in all things
