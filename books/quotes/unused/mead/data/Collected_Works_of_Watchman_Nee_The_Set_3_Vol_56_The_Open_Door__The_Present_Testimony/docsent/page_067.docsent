   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>One</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would like to bring out the matter of multiplying the five loaves Mark 6:35-44; 8:1-9 with respect to God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is not a matter of how many loaves we have in our hands, but whether or not God has blessed them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even if we had more than five loaves, this would not be enough to feed four or five thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even if we had ten times or even one hundred times more, we still would not have enough to feed four or five thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not a matter of how much we have.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sooner or later, we must be brought to the point of seeing that it is not a matter of what we can pull out of our storage shed, nor is it a matter of how great our gift is or how much power we have.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The day must come in which we say to the Lord, "Everything depends on Your blessing."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a basic matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How much blessing has the Lord really given us?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It does not really matter how many loaves there are.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord's blessing nourishes people and gives them life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One matter is troubling my heart: Do we truly treasure God's blessing?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a basic question concerning the work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Perhaps we do not even have five loaves today, but our need is greater than four thousand or five thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am afraid that we have less in our storehouse than the apostles, while our need is greater than the need at the time of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our own store, source, power, labor, and faithfulness will be manifest that they are useless to us one day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brothers, our future holds great disappointment for us because we will see that we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must notice something in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why does the Lord do two miracles are almost the same in nature and in action?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am afraid it is because this lesson is not easy to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why does He feed the five thousand and then feed the four thousand?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Two miracles of almost identical nature are repeated twice in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must learn this lesson, but it is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many people still do not look to God's blessing, but instead look at the few loaves in their own hands!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The loaves in our hands are so pitifully few, but we still base our plans on them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The more we plan in this way, however, the harder the work becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes it becomes impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am somewhat comforted by the words spoken by a brother one hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He said, "When the Lord wants to work a small miracle, He puts me in a difficult situation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When He wants to work a great miracle, He puts me in an impossible situation."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our situation is difficult, and it even seems impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many times it is really hard, and we are like the little boy with just a few loaves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can only hope for a miracle, and this miracle is the Lord Himself taking them up and blessing them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brothers and sisters, the miracles are produced by the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His blessing changes and multiplies the loaves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The miracles are based on the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When there is a miracle, five thousand or four thousand people are fed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without a miracle, even two hundred or five hundred denarii worth of bread are not enough to satisfy that many people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord was training the disciples, bringing them to the point of looking to Him for His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many times we do not have the capacity to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The outward environment is difficult, even impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If our eyes are fixed on the circumstances, we will not have any way to deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, the Lord repeatedly brings us through.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These times are the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we have blessing, everything goes well and nothing is difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Without the Lord's blessing, everything goes wrong and nothing is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord wants to bring us to a point where His blessing takes the first place, a point where we have never been.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the Lord brings us to such a point, He will have a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the Lord does not bring us to this point, we will have to say that even two hundred denarii worth of bread is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today the problem is that we cannot meet the need in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All of our money combined is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All of us combined is insufficient, but the Lord has a way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the Lord's work, the basic problem is the Lord's blessing; nothing else matters.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Brothers, if God brings us to the point of seeing that everything in God's work depends upon His blessing, it will bring about a basic change in our labor for God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We would not consider how many people, how much money, or how much bread we have.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We would say we do not have enough, but the blessing is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The blessing meets the need that we cannot meet.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although we cannot measure up to the size of the need, the blessing is greater than our lack.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we see this, the work will have a basic change.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In every matter we must look at the blessing more than we consider the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Methods, considerations, human wisdom, and clever words are all useless.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In God's work we should believe in and expect His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many times we are careless and damage the work, but this is not a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If the Lord gives us a small blessing, we can get through any problem.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We truly hope that we would not make mistakes or speak and act loosely in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we have the Lord's blessing, however, it seems that we cannot err even when we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Sometimes it seems that we have made a serious mistake, but with God's blessing the result is not really an error.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I once said to Brother Witness that if we had the Lord's blessing, the things we did right would be right and the things we did wrong would be right as well.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Nothing could damage the blessing.</S>
