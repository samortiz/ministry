   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KEEPING THE REALITY OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Yes, the young people need to go to the campuses for the Lord's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But this must not be a movement, and it must not in any way cause division among us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We look to the Lord that He would grant us the grace we need for this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We would abandon anything that would cause a division or even give the slightest impression of division.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We do not care for any work, for any movement, or even for any increase.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We care only for the unique oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although the number may be small, we are in the reality of this unity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if we lose the unity, we lose the reality of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the churches and with the saints we must care for two elements: the Spirit and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must ask, "Is this the Spirit?" and, "Is this for the Body, or does this cause division?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must be certain that what we are doing is in the Spirit and that it takes care of the unity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not want to become a movement that cares nothing for the Spirit; neither do we want to be a repetition of the division and confusion of the Christianity that does not care for the unique unity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We look to the Lord for His mercy and grace that we may always care for the Spirit and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Body is expressed in a practical way in the unique unity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We care for this unity, not merely in our locality, but in the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must avoid anything that would cause division among the saints or among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Again I say, we care only for the Lord's recovery, and the Lord's recovery is absolutely a matter in the Spirit and in the unique unity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>May the Lord grant us His mercy and grace that we may be kept in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Otherwise, we shall be a repetition of the pitiful history of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>May the Lord have mercy upon us that we would not become such a repetition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all need to pray earnestly for the Lord's recovery; we need to pray earnestly that we would be kept in the Spirit and in the unique oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be in the Spirit and in the unique oneness of the Body is to be kept in the Lord's recovery.</S>
