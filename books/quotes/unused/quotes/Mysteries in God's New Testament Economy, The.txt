Lord, thank You that You are with us daily until the end of the age, according to Your promise at the end of Matthew 28
During the first period of the Lord's recovery, that is, the first eight or ten years, we received help mostly from outsiders
In 1931 Brother Nee consented to the request of some brothers from the Closed Brethren for a visit to us in China
In 1937 he called an urgent coworkers meeting which was held first in Shanghai and then in Hangkow in which he released a series of messages
These messages became the content of the book The Normal Christian Church Life, with which we are all familiar
Some of you can remember that from 1949 to 1957 our number jumped from three or five hundred to forty or fifty thousand
These two books are my clarifying and concluding word to the saints in the Lord's recovery throughout the whole world
All my messages from the second half of 1986 never depart in thought and idea from these two points of being 'organic' and 'intrinsic'
Only that which issues forth from the divine life of the Triune God is organic and is of worth and of value before God
Today by looking at the manifested result, you can see for yourself whether that was something outward or something intrinsic
In places like Mexico, Central America, and South America, it is not the opening of city after city, but the opening of whole continents
Forget the things that are behind, and press forward to the things that are before, so that we can all go on together
In the four evenings, we will have four messages that cover specifically the mysteries in God's New Testament economy
Lord Jesus, grant us the rich anointing, and anoint us in every way so that we would truly have Your presence within
When we mention the new testament, many do not have too much feeling for it and do not pay much attention to it
In 1931 Brother Watchman Nee called together a special conference and talked specifically about the matter of the new testament
From that time until now, in our literature and messages we have not touched the matter of the new testament again
In Ephesians 3:9 Paul spoke of 'the dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things'
In spite of that, when we come together to fellowship and to talk about them, we will gradually be brought into understanding them
It was divine thought that became constituted as an expression, which in turn became the Word that can be comprehended by man
It is that which we have heard, which we have seen with our own eyes, which we beheld, and which we have touched with our own hands
From this virgin's womb, He was born with humanity to be the mysterious God-man, in whom both divinity and humanity are mingled
The baby Jesus that was in the manger was the mysterious God-man in whom both divinity and humanity are mingled as one
Once the son of a king realizes his own status, he will become more dignified and will be different from others in his speech and conduct
We should express the divine virtues in our humanity by God's mysterious attributes, such as love, light, holiness, righteousness, and power
What is expressed in our living should not merely be our virtuous acts but should be the divine virtues of God expressed in our humanity
Through the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in the flesh, God judged sin together with the flesh in which sin dwells
As the mysterious Firstborn of all creation in the old creation He terminated the entire old creation and reconciled all the creation to God
When this Christ was crucified on the cross the whole old creation was terminated so that all the creation of God could be reconciled to Him
As a mysterious grain of wheat, He released the divine life in Him through His death, thus making us many grains of wheat of life, like Him
Once we believe in Him, this life-giving Spirit enters into our spirit and joins us to His Spirit, so that we become one spirit with Him
Now that Christ has become the life-giving Spirit in resurrection and is living in us, God's salvation becomes subjective to us
The sixth point is that this mysterious Godman in His mysterious resurrection ascended to the height with all the ones whom He resurrected
After Christ resurrected, He brought all the ones that He had resurrected, that is, those who believe in Him, to the height
Now this mysterious God-man is not only the Lord of all but also the Christ of God, bearing the commission to fulfill God's eternal economy
Ninth, He became mysteriously the surety of the better covenant, that is the new covenant , to be a guarantee to man
Eleventh, He became mysteriously the Minister of the true tabernacle in the heavens, ministering heaven into us
Before the righteous God, He became our Advocate, pleading for us, that the interrupted fellowship between God and us may be recovered
Fourteenth, He became mysteriously the Son of Man as the High Priest walking in the midst of the golden lampstands, the churches
In the new heaven and new earth in eternity, the New Jerusalem is the eternal habitation of the Triune God with us the redeemed people
He was crucified, accomplishing the all-inclusive and mysterious death, resurrected, and ascended to the heavens
According to my observation, during the past few decades, we seem to have stopped advancing in the Lord's recovery
Concerning matters such as the mysterious revelations in God's New Testament economy, we still do not know that much
Through His death, He annulled all the commandments in ordinances and made peace, creating one new man as a result
Since you are the elders and the co-workers, you should take the lead to do this and should teach the saints to do the same
When we go back to the churches, we should help all of the saints to know the death of Christ in these seven statuses
In His resurrection He has become the life-giving Spirit, entering into all those who believe in Him to be their life
We should pursue after these things, speak about these things, and should teach the brothers and sisters these things
We should be those who become alive in Christ this way, and we should exercise moment by moment to live in our spirit
Prayer: Lord, for this meeting we look to You for the cleansing of Your blood so that we may enjoy Your presence and Your anointing
The first point is concerning the church being chosen and predestinated by God the Father before the foundation of the world
The third point is concerning it being sealed with God the Spirit and receiving the Spirit as the pledge at the time of its redemption
In the fifth point, we become the universal new man to be God's kingdom and God's house, as well as the habitation of God
The ninth point is that this great mystery will reach a final stage when it will ultimately be consummated in the New Jerusalem
Without this mystery, our life would just be the life of a human being; it would not be the life of a Christian
In our daily life, everything whether positive or negative, enjoyable or bitter, should be the expression of this mystery
The church was mysteriously chosen and predestinated in Christ by God the Father before the foundation of the world
Our redemption is according to the riches of God's abounding grace with which He graced the church in the Beloved
It is also according to the dispensation of the mysterious economy in God's will, which is according to His good pleasure
Our salvation is not just according to the riches of God's grace, but is prearranged according to the dispensation of God's economy
That is why Peter said that though we have not seen Him we love Him and while believing in Him we exult with unspeakable and glorified joy
As soon as we are saved, we are God's predestinated possession and have become those who have before hoped in Christ
At the time of our redemption, we were mysteriously sealed with the Holy Spirit, and we received the Holy Spirit as the pledge
At the time of redemption, this possession was sealed by the Holy Spirit for the purpose of it eventually being fully redeemed
The redeemed church not only is God's possession but also has obtained God as its possession, with the Holy Spirit as the pledge
In Him is included not only divinity and humanity, but also human living, the effectiveness of death, and the power of resurrection
The church mysteriously becomes the universal new man as God's kingdom and God's house, and is built up as the habitation of God
There is obviously the need in the churches in all the localities to have some administrative arrangements for the business affairs
The administrative arrangements for these business affairs also have to be under the ruling of the Holy Spirit and according to His leading
In this way, Christ will have the chance to occupy the different parts of our heart our mind, emotion, will, and conscience
For Christ to make home in our heart is for Him to be constituted in the hearts of the believers in the church and to spread within them
We will gradually experience the boundless dimensions of what Christ is His breadth, length, height, and depth
In this way, we have point number eight, which is the mysterious life union of Christ and His Body, the church
The virtues manifested by us Christians should be the manifestation of the glory and beauty in the divine attributes
Finally, we have point number nine, which is the mysterious ultimate consummation in God's economy, the New Jerusalem
In such a place, the Triune God is the life supply, and the tripartite man is the outward appearance for the expression of God
Outwardly, the redeemed nation of Israel, indicated by the names of the twelve tribes, is the gates of the city
Today, the church, which is joined and mingled mysteriously with the Triune God, is a miniature of this New Jerusalem
If we have such a profound and transcendent realization concerning the mystery of Christ, the church, our goal and hope will be uplifted
We can talk about these two items in doctrine, but it is difficult to find out what they involve in experience
Only through this will the church become all the fullness of God for the expression of His multifarious wisdom
Often our talk about the enjoyment of Christ, the living of Christ, and the expression of Christ are just vague words
When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He told the disciples, 'I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now
When anyone comes to the meeting, he or she will not share something vague only, but will be able to prophesy in a definite way
In this way we will have definite and real experiences of Christ and the Body of Christ will grow and be built up in a definite and real way
Although we do not love enough, and we do not know how to love, we still would say that we would love You forever
When we look at the world situation especially at the changes in eastern Europe we know that this is the turn of the great wheel of the age
We have to remember that we are in a bigger and greater wheel, which is the move of God's New Testament economy
It is the move of God's New Testament economy that has gathered us together to participate in the mystery of His New Testament economy
We divided up the city into districts according to the streets and passed out these tracts from house to house
We did this for four or five years, and our number increased from three or five hundred to forty or fifty thousand
The New Jerusalem, as the ultimate consummation of God's work, is the axis of God's move in the whole universe
The whole universe is full of God's move, and the ultimate achievement of this entire move is the New Jerusalem
The church today is the miniature of the New Jerusalem in the future, and the Lord's recovery on earth represents His church
According to the revelation of the Bible, we have to say conclusively and definitely that the Triune God is in the Body
Everything on earth, whether it is political, military, economic, or scientific, is all under the sovereign arrangement of the Lord
In the Lords recovery we have to overturn this so that every believer may become alive and may function for the organic Body to be expressed
We all know that the spiritual life which is in every saved person has its capacities that come with its nature
The true vine in John 15, as a portrait of Christ, is the organism of the Triune God by which He accomplishes His eternal economy
He is over all managing and caring for all and is through all penetrating and joining all and is even in us all dwelling and living in all
Although the Body of Christ has been cut off from the old creation, the 'skin' of the old creation has not been fully shed
In the Lord's word, there is not only the washing water, but also the nourishing element and the sanctifying power
As a step further, let us consider the growth of this divine organism and the organic building up of the organism by itself
The growth of this organism in the divine life equals the organic building up of the organism by itself in the divine life
The most difficult lesson to learn for us who are working for the Lord is to not have an organizational work but to have an organic work
We can only do our part to nourish others, to fellowship and pray with others, and to supply them with some words of life
In this way, we are not adding something to man, but are supplying others from within so that they can grow in life and be built up
In addition, we have to lead the saints to prophesy, to speak for God, for the organic building up of the church
We all have to be like the Apostle Paul, who labored and struggled in all wisdom to present every man full-grown in Christ to God
Everyone preaches the gospel to save sinners, esveryone nourishes the believers, everyone perfects the saints, and everyone prophesies
Lord, by Your victorious name and under Your victorious blood, we bind what You have bound in heaven, Your enemy
We cannot tell if there was such a branch of knowledge as physics among mankind two thousand years ago when Paul wrote the book of Romans
They are the law of evil in our flesh, the law of good in our mind, and the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit
Except for those who have a strong will, who walk by reason, and who temporarily overcome their lust, most are caught by it
Take, for example, the sprouts of four kinds of trees the apple tree, the pear tree, the peach tree, and the almond tree
The mysterious law of the Spirit of life in God's New Testament economy depends on the Spirit of life as the law
According to the revelation of the Bible, on the one hand, the Spirit of life denotes Christ, because Christ is life
The purpose of the Triune God dispensing Himself into our whole being in this way is not merely to be life but to be a law
The peach tree grows peaches because in the peach tree there is a nature, and this nature has an innate ability, which produces a capacity
As Christians, the whole key to our living and service in the Body of Christ depends on this capacity of the law of the Spirit of life
We must go along with this capacity of the law of the Spirit of life before we can have normal growth and fruit bearing
Since the law in the life of the Body of Christ is the Spirit of life, its living depends on this law as the Spirit of life
Point number seven says that the main gifts in the service of the Body of Christ depend on the Spirit of life which is this law
According to the revelation of the New Testament, the gifts of the Spirit can be divided into the gifts in life and the miraculous gifts
The miraculous gifts, especially speaking in tongues and the interpretation of tongues, do not require the growth in life
The principal parts of the service in the Body of Christ also depend on our following the law of the Spirit of life
Finally, point number eight talks about the cooperation needed by the law of the Spirit of life in God's economy
