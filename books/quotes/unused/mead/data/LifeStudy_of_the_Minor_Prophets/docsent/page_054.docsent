   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have emphasized the fact that all the minor prophets speak the same thing in different ways, from different angles, and in different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus, Micah also speaks the same thing as the other minor prophets, but he speaks it in his own particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the foregoing message we covered the introductory word and Jehovah s reproof on Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Micah 1 reveals that Jehovah is coming forth out of His temple to exercise His judgment upon sinful Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verses 3 and 4 portray the terrible judgment that is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jehovah comes forth from His place, / And He will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>/ And the mountains will be melted under Him, / And the valleys will be cleft, / Like wax before fire, / Like water poured down a slope.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because of this judgment, the prophet wailed and howled, and some of the people also wailed vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>9-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The next two chapters, part of Jehovah s reproof, are a description of the sinfulness of the house of Jacob and the house of Judah.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the Old Testament, during the yearly feasts the children of Israel were charged not to work Lev 23:7, 8, 35 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To work during those feasts would have been an insult to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The people were only to rest, eat, drink, and enjoy their life before God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Their eating and drinking were their worship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the New Testament, at the Lord s table on the first day of the week, we put aside our work, we rest in the Lord, and we eat and drink Christ to enjoy Him and to let Him enjoy our satisfaction.</S>
