   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>g. To Share with All the Saints in the Light the Triune God Embodied in Christ as Their Portion</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In their status as heirs of God, the believers share with all the saints in the light the Triune God embodied in Christ as their portion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Acts 26:18 speaks of the forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have not only the forgiveness of sins on the negative side but also an inheritance on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This divine inheritance is the Triune God with all He has, all He has done, and all He will do for His redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This Triune God is embodied in the all-inclusive Christ Col 2:9 , who is the portion allotted to the saints as their inheritance Col 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Holy Spirit is the pledge, the guarantee, of this divine inheritance, which we are sharing and enjoying today as a foretaste and will share and enjoy in full in the coming age and for eternity 1 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Believers are generally taught that the inheritance in Acts 26:18 is a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But this inheritance is actually Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This Christ is the portion of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Colossians 1:12 Paul says that the Father has qualified us "for a share of the portion of the saints in the light."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This portion is the "lot," the inheritance, of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The inheritance is a lot, and this lot is a portion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Old Testament the tribes of Israel each received an allotment, a portion, of the good land for an inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The good land is a type of the all-inclusive Christ given to us as our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Greek word rendered "portion" in Colossians 1:12 can also be rendered "lot," referring to an allotment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Paul was writing this verse, he no doubt had in mind the picture of the allotting of the good land to the children of Israel Josh 14:1 and used the word portion with the Old Testament record of the land as the background.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God gave the children of Israel the good land for their inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Colossians Christ is revealed as our portion, our lot.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Just as the land of Canaan was everything to the children of Israel, so Christ, the reality of the type of the good land, is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, is our inheritance, which we share with all the saints in the light. h.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To Be Glorified with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As heirs of God, the believers will also be glorified with Christ Rom 8:17b .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is now in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually we shall be brought into glory and be glorified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we are glorified, the body of our humiliation will be transfigured into a glorious body Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At that time we shall be completely and absolutely brought into God Himself as our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we shall appear with Christ in glory Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some of us may hold strictly an objective concept of glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to this concept, those who have been saved and regenerated will suddenly be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Supposedly, the glorification of the believers will take place instantaneously at the coming of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But although our glorification may appear to be a sudden occurrence, it will actually be the consummation of a process of gradual growth and development in life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through regeneration the life of glory has come into us, and now we have a seed of glory within us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The life that we have within us as a seed is the life of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is Christ in us, the hope of glory Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eventually, this seed will blossom, and thereby we shall be brought into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It will be like the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus Matt 17:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Lord was transfigured on the mountaintop, it was not that the shekinah glory suddenly came upon Him from the heavens; it was that the divine glory shone from within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Likewise, the glory into which we shall be brought is the out-shining of the very glory that is within us right now.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that Christ is not leading us into some objective glory but into the very glory that has been sown into us as a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, to be glorified means to have the glory that has been sown into us as a seed saturate our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we have been permeated and saturated with the element of glory, that glory will come out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is what it means for us, the heirs of God, to be glorified with Christ.</S>
