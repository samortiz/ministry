<h1 class="title">EATING AND DRINKING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 6:35, 48-58, 63; 7:37-39; 1 Cor. 10:3-4; Rev. 2:7; 21:6</h1>
<p>In John 6:35 the Lord said to His disciples, &ldquo;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst.&rdquo; Even though the Lord spoke only of the bread of life, He addressed the problem of thirst as well as the problem of hunger. This proves that the bread of life is related to the water of life. The bread of life deals with the problem of hunger, and the water of life deals with the problem of thirst. In verses 48 through 51 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world.&rdquo; The Lord focused first on bread, and then on eating. He who eats the bread of life shall not die, and the bread is the Lord&rsquo;s flesh, which was given for the world to have life.</p>
<p>Verses 52 through 58 say, &ldquo;The Jews then contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us His flesh to eat? Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves. He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day. For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink. He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him. As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me. This is the bread which came down out of heaven, not as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread shall live forever.&rdquo; The words <em>eats Me</em> in verse 57 are rendered as &ldquo;eats My flesh&rdquo; in the Chinese Union Version. However, the word <em>flesh</em> is not in the Greek text.</p>
<p>Verse 63 says, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; In chapter 7, verses 37 through 39 say, &ldquo;Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; Chapter 6 is concerning bread, and chapter 7 is concerning water. This means that chapter 6 is concerning eating, and chapter 7 is concerning drinking.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 10:3-4 says, &ldquo;All ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Revelation 2:7 says, &ldquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.&rdquo; In chapter 21, verse 6 says, &ldquo;I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely.&rdquo; Chapter 2 speaks of eating, and chapter 21 speaks of drinking. Even the end of the Bible is concerning eating and drinking.</p>
<p>We have looked at the tree and the river. Now we will consider eating and drinking. The Bible is different from every other book in the world. Classical writings in the world use profound and mysterious expressions or doctrines that are difficult to comprehend. The Bible is different. On the one hand, the Bible is profound, containing sentences such as, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word&rdquo; (John 1:1). On the other hand, the Bible is easy to understand, and it often presents the deep things of God with plain words. For this reason, when we give messages, we use very plain words to explain spiritual matters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S INTENTION BEING FOR MAN<br />
TO EAT AND DRINK HIM</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals a tree and a river as the means for man to enjoy God. We cannot partake of the tree or the river apart from eating and drinking. The fruit on the tree is food for us to eat, and the water of the river is a beverage for us to drink. According to the human concept, God is dignified and great; hence, we need to worship and fear Him. However, in Genesis God presented Himself to man, not as a dignified or great person but as a tree and a river. God&rsquo;s intention is to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life supply; therefore, man must eat and drink Him.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
