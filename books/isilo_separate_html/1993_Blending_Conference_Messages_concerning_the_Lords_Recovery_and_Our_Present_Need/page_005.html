THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE MAJOR ITEMS<br>IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>Among the major items in the Lord's recovery, some points are more crucial than others. In this message we have selected only six crucial points, as follows, as an illustration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The All-inclusive Christ</H2><P>The Christ revealed in both the Old Testament and the New Testament is all-inclusive and all-extensive. Ephesians 1:23 says that Christ is the One who fills all in all, and 3:18 says that His dimensions are immeasurable, the dimensions of the universe. Christ is not only all-inclusive; He is also all-extensive. He is the God-man through the divine incarnation to be the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9) and the centrality and the universality of the eternal economy of God. Throughout all the ages of the past nineteen centuries, He has been missed, misunderstood, wrongly taught, and subtly twisted and interpreted by the heresiarchs (the founders of heresies), who include Cerinthus (see note 221 in 1 John 2 and note 91 in 2 John), the Gnostics (see note 142, paragraph 2, in John 1), and the Docetists (see note 31 in 1 John 4) in the first century, the Nestorians in the fifth century, the demonic Catholicism in the past thirteen centuries, the so-called higher critics in the past two and a half centuries, and the present modernists. All these denied different aspects of Christ's person and work. The Cerinthians denied Christ's divinity, and the Docetists denied Christ's humanity. Others denied Christ's redemptive death and His resurrection. According to their heresies, Christ is nothing. Although Protestantism teaches Christ fundamentally, their teaching concerning Christ is inadequate, full of defects, not perfect, and not complete. Under all the devastating heresies and the incomplete fundamentalism, the truth concerning the all-inclusive Christ of God needs a drastic recovery in many aspects as listed in the outline of this chapter. All these items are exceedingly crucial for all the believers in Christ to partake of for their enjoyment and to be constituted with so that they may become His organic members to live and express Him in this age and for eternity.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
