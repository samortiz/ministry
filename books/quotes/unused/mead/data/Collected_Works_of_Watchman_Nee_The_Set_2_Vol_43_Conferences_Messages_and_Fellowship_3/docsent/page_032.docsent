   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OF GOD ARE WE IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 1:30 says, "Of Him you are in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In other words, you are in Christ because of God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am not capable at all and cannot lift anything heavy, but I can put this bottle in the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God can put me into Christ with as much ease as I put the bottle in the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is the almighty God who can do all things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In fact, it is a much easier task for Him to put me in Christ than for me to put the bottle in the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is of God that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, when Christ died, we died.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Two years ago I held a conference in Kaifeng.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many of the attendants were officials from the government.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I spoke about being in Christ, one of them asked me, "How can I be in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What does it mean that I died when Christ died?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What does it mean that I live because Christ lives?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I said, "We can be in Christ because of God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has put us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the experiences of Christ have now become ours.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All of God's work is in Christ, not in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the difference between Christianity and all the other religions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the other religions are concerned with works by man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only Christianity is not concerned with works done by man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everything about Christianity has to do with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we have a relationship with Christ, all of Christ's experiences and attainments will become ours.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not have a relationship with Christ, we will remain the same, and all that Christ has attained will have no impact on us."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do you know how a light bulb emits light?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the bulb is connected with wire to the electricity in the power plant, there is light.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The power of light is not from the light bulb but from the power plant.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever the bulb is joined to the source of electricity, it emits light.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you disconnect the bulb from the wire, nothing in the bulb will emit light.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Electricity is generated in the power plant, not in the bulb.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the way God works.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God does not work in man apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All that He does is through one person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Death is in Christ, and resurrection is also in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Everything is accomplished in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you have a living faith to contact Christ, all of His work will take effect in you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without a living faith, you will remain unchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It all has to do with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By faith you can have a relationship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All you have to do is believe in the things that God has accomplished in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you read the Bible, you will see that God has no intention of changing you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God has never said that He will change you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That is why you are exactly the same as you were before.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Suppose the light bulb says to itself, "I have been here for quite a while now, and light is still shining out from me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This must mean that there is light within me."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If it turns around and looks at itself, it will not find any light.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whenever it detaches itself from the source of electricity, it will cease to shine.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you are not in contact with Christ all the time, you will remain the same as before.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you do not contact the Lord, you may be like one who studies geography but who has never been to the places that have been studied.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This kind of studying does not count.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You may know the doctrine of crucifixion with Christ, but the real crucifixion is another matter altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Without the enlightening of the Spirit, the doctrine will be dead and ineffectual.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even though I gave the person in Kaifeng an answer, he still could not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then I asked him, "From whom do the Chinese descend?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He said, "We are the descendants of Hwang-ti."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I then asked him whether he remembered Hwang-ti's battle with Tzi-you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He said that he did.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then I asked, "What if Tzi-you had shot Hwang-ti instead of the other way around?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Would we still be here?"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He said, "If that had happened there would not have been any descendants of Hwang-ti."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I said, "The death of Hwang-ti was his own business, and our living is our own business.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How can you say that if Hwang-ti had died, we would not be here?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All the descendants of Hwang-ti were in Hwang-ti.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If Hwang-ti had died, all of his descendants would have died as well."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Likewise, God has put us in Christ and joined us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Since Christ died, we have died.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Since Christ lives, we also live.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We cannot say that Christ was crucified on the cross but we remained alive.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we are in Christ, all the experiences of Christ become ours.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Brothers and sisters, it does not help to understand the doctrine in your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I hope that God will grant you light and revelation to see that you are one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When Christ died, you died.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is not merely a matter of understanding the doctrine of crucifixion; it is a matter of comprehending the reality and seeing that you have become one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is a matter of seeing your position in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today God's children pay much attention to the doctrine without seeing the very things contained in the doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Let us not be content with hearing doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should confess that we are only beginners, and confess that we are still seeking the Spirit's enlightening concerning the inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Those who believe find, and those who reckon obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When God says we have it, it means we have it.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I hope that God will enlighten us to see that we are really in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>BELIEVE AND PRAISE</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Hudson Taylor was a very spiritual person in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Once he wrote to his sister about his constant failure and inability to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>One cannot say that he did not know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But the truth remained as truth only; he was not experientially related to it.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He continued to seek before God with the hope that he could somehow be joined to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Later, he wrote another letter to his sister saying that the scales had fallen from his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He saw how he had sought to be in Christ, how he had exhausted all of his efforts to get into Him, but that no sooner was he "in" than he found himself "out" again.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He could not find a way to be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But he thanked God now that he understood that he was in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It is no longer a matter of getting in but a matter of remaining there, a matter of not coming out again.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Lord said that He is the true vine and we are the branches John 15:1, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He is in us and we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We do not need to struggle to become branches, because a branch is a branch by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Suppose a person by the name of Tang Wen-tse prays earnestly on his knees, saying, "O God, please have mercy on me; give me the grace to be Tang Wen-tse."</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>God will say, "What?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Are you not Tang Wen-tse?"</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Suppose that a vase pleads to be a vase.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Is this not ridiculous?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>But this is what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>As long as we are branches, we do not have to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>What God says counts.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We do not need to pray; we only need to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Faith is believing that we are joined to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Thank God that He has put us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Brothers and sisters, you know that you are saved, and you have the assurance of it because you believe that the Lord has shed His blood to propitiate your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If you have trusted in Him, believed, and received Him, do you still need to plead for God to save you?</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Perhaps some still do, but we know that these are the ones who do not believe or understand God's Word .</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>God says that he who believes is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>When we believe we know that we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We can praise God spontaneously, saying, "I am saved!"</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Our union with Christ is exactly the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>There is no need for us to plead for God to join us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Those who belong to Christ are joined to Him already.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We just need to believe that we are joined; there is no need to ask to be joined.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>If we believe that we are joined to Christ, we spontaneously will believe that the old man is dead and know that there is no need for the old man to die again.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We only need to thank God.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>If we see that we are dead in Christ, we will see that sin no longer has any effect on us.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>When God says that we are dead, we are truly dead.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>We should never pray for God to put us to death, because God has accomplished everything already.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Instead, we should say, "I will no longer try to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>I will only believe in what God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>God says that I am dead, and I am dead."</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>May God open our eyes to see that all of His work has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>The blood has propitiated our sins, and the cross has crucified the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>All of the work of remedying Adam's fall has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>We only have to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>May God enlighten us to see that all is accomplished.</S>
