        <h2 class="head2">The Veil Being Rent That We May Enter<br />
into the Holy of Holies</h2>
<p>Verse 20 says, “Which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh.” In the Old Testament there was a veil that separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies (Exo. 26:33). According to John 1:14, the Lord Jesus as the Word became flesh. In the verses in Hebrews and John <em>flesh</em> refers to humanity. Hebrews 10:20 speaks of the veil of His flesh. This means that we are the veil. The Holy of Holies is our spirit, but there is a barrier, our fallen humanity, that separates us from our spirit. Our fallen humanity is the thickest veil, and it separates us from God. Hence, our flesh must be rent. This is portrayed by the veil in the temple being split from top to bottom when the Lord died on the cross (Matt. 27:51).</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:21 says, “Having a great Priest over the house of God.” This great Priest is in our spirit, the Holy of Holies. When we consider chapters 4 and 10, we can see that our spirit today is the Holy of Holies. Furthermore, our being is the veil that must be rent. There is rest in the Holy of Holies, in our spirit. The Lord is our High Priest bearing our case in the Holy of Holies. Furthermore, the throne of grace that supplies us and gives us rest is also in the Holy of Holies. However, in our experience it is easy for us to remain in the outer court or to enter into the Holy Place, but it is not easy to enter into the Holy of Holies. This is because there is a veil between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. This veil is our flesh.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Going within the Veil</h2>
<p>Verses 18 and 19 in chapter 6 say, “We who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us, which we have as an anchor of the soul, both secure and firm and which enters within the veil.” The phrase <em>fled for refuge</em> in the original language means to flee intensively. The word <em>fled</em> is also used in Acts 14:6, which speaks of Paul and Barnabas fleeing to the cities of Lystra and Derbe in Lycaonia. Paul and Barnabas fled because a hostile attempt was made by some in Iconium to treat them outrageously and to stone them (v. 5). When the apostles became aware of this, they fled to Lycaonia. Hebrews 6:19 speaks of the anchor of our soul. Our spirit does not need an anchor because our spirit does not drift; however, our soul needs an anchor because it is always drifting. Our soul is our person, and our person tends to drift. Hence, our soul needs an anchor. Verses 18 and 19 say that the hope set before us is a secure and firm anchor of our soul and that it enters within the veil. The Holy of Holies, which is in the third heaven, is also our spirit, which is within the veil.</p>
<p>Verse 20 says, “Where the Forerunner, Jesus, has entered for us, having become forever a High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek.” The Lord Jesus has entered within the veil. The Holy of Holies, the third heaven, and our spirit are related and connected. When the Lord Jesus ascended, He entered the Holy of Holies. He is now in the third heaven as well as in our spirit. Hence, the third heaven and our spirit are connected. They are also within the veil. The place “within the veil” refers to the third heaven and to our spirit. The anchor of our soul is connected to the third heaven and also to our spirit. If we do not enter into our spirit, we will be like a boat drifting on the sea without an anchor. We must connect the anchor of our soul to our spirit, the third heaven, and then we will be secure.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE THREE SECTIONS OF THE TEMPLE<br />
CORRESPONDING TO THE THREE PARTS OF MAN</h2>
<p>The three parts of man—the body, the soul, and the spirit—correspond to the three sections of the holy temple—the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. We are God’s temple (1 Cor. 3:16-17). There are three sections in the temple, and we have three parts. The three sections in the temple correspond to our three parts. Our body corresponds to the outer court, our soul corresponds to the Holy Place, and our spirit corresponds to the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>In order to contact God, we must pass through the outer court and enter into the Holy Place, and we must pass through the Holy Place and enter into the Holy of Holies in order to see God face to face. The altar of burnt offering and the laver are in the outer court. The table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar are in the Holy Place. Only the Ark, which typifies Christ, is in the Holy of Holies. The table of the bread of the Presence typifies Christ as our life, the golden lampstand typifies Christ as our light, and the golden incense altar typifies Christ as the sweet incense for our acceptance by God. Only the Ark in the Holy of Holies typifies Christ’s person. In the Holy of Holies we are in God’s presence, and there is only Christ.</p>
<p>We should ask ourselves whether our experience relates to the outer court, the Holy Place, or the Holy of Holies. Dealing with the flesh, bearing the cross, and receiving the dealing of the cross are experiences of the outer court, because the altar of burnt offering typifies the cross. The offering at the altar of burnt offering and the washing in the laver are for us to enter into the Holy Place and from there, the Holy of Holies. It is right to experience the cross in the outer court, but this experience is for entering into the Holy Place. Once we focus on the cross, however, we tend to remain there and are unwilling to leave; we are unwilling to enter into the Holy Place and then the Holy of Holies. Those who have experienced the cross must examine whether or not they have entered into the spirit. If we have not entered into our spirit, even though we have been experiencing the cross for several years, there is a problem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISRAELITES LEAVING EGYPT AND<br />
ENTERING INTO CANAAN TYPIFYING<br />
THE THREE STAGES OF GOD’S SALVATION</h2>
<p>The picture of the Israelites leaving Egypt and entering into Canaan signifies the three stages of God’s salvation, which also correspond to the three parts of the temple. The people of Israel left Egypt, passed through the wilderness, and entered into Canaan. Entering into Canaan was the last part of their journey. Egypt signifies the outer court, the wilderness signifies the Holy Place, and the good land of Canaan signifies the Holy of Holies. The manna that the Israelites ate in the wilderness represents the bread of the Presence in the Holy Place. In the Holy Place there was the bread of the Presence, and in the wilderness there was manna. The believers who concentrate on the dealing of the cross remain at the altar of burnt offering. This is equivalent to remaining in the outer court. Some believers concentrate on pursuing holiness. They may enjoy Christ as manna every day, but they are merely in the wilderness, that is, in their soul. These believers have not entered into the Holy of Holies, into the good land of Canaan.</p>
<p>The Israelites entered into Canaan only after crossing the Jordan River, where their flesh was buried. Crossing the Jordan is equivalent to passing through the veil of our flesh, that is, to burying the flesh, to having the flesh rent. Once we cross the Jordan, we enter into Canaan. In other words, once we pass through the rent veil of our flesh, we enter into our spirit. In Canaan the children of Israel had the fullest and topmost enjoyment of the land. This signifies our enjoyment of God’s salvation. Leaving Egypt was a part of God’s salvation, and passing through the wilderness was also a part of God’s salvation. However, God’s complete salvation could be experienced only after the Israelites entered Canaan.</p>
<p>We must be clear concerning what it means to wander in the wilderness. Wandering in the wilderness is to wander in our soul, that is, to wander in our mind, emotion, and will. Although we may enjoy Christ while we wander in our soul, we are still in our soul, not in Canaan. Hence, we have not obtained the fullest enjoyment of God’s salvation. We must be those who come forward and enter into Canaan, which signifies the Holy of Holies, that is, into our spirit.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
