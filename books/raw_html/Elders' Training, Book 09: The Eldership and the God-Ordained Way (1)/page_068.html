<P>Even the evangelists are for the perfecting of the saints. For many years my concept has been that the evangelists are only good for going out to preach the gospel, but Ephesians 4 tells us that Christ gave them to perfect the saints. After our four-year study which began in 1984 in Taipei, we see that in the proper procedure to build up the Body of Christ, the first step is to preach the gospel. For this we need the perfecting, the training. The Greek word for perfecting implies the thought of equipping and furnishing. When a person joins the army, they will teach him and equip him with a uniform, weapons, and ammunition. They will also furnish him with supplies. Perfecting is teaching, equipping, and furnishing. It is hard to find someone among us in the Lord's recovery who has really been perfected in the preaching of the gospel. If we were at war and were suddenly gathered to form an army, would we know how to fight? We might shoot ourselves instead of shooting the enemy. We would need to be perfected to fight. When we go out to preach the gospel, this is the real fighting against the devil and his demons.</P><P>A proper evangelist, in his perfecting of the saints, would know how to stir them up. After his speaking to the saints, their hearts would be burning for the gospel. Is there anyone in our locality burning for the preaching of the gospel? There may not be anyone. We may want to preach the gospel, but we may not have the burning spirit to do it. If a real evangelist were to stay with us for even a short period of time, we would be burning for the preaching of the gospel. This is part of his perfecting work.</P><P>There are many things that we have to do to perfect the saints in the preaching of the gospel. In the past whenever I trained the saints to preach the gospel, I first taught the truths of the gospel. I taught truths such as who Christ is, what redemption is, what justification is, and what it is to repent, believe, and be baptized. We prepared a manual with all of these gospel truths in them. Even in the coming days, when we perfect the saints in the preaching of the gospel, we may need to use that manual to see all the truths of the gospel. We need to see the difference between justification and reconciliation and the difference between forgiveness of sins and the washing away of sins. If we do not know these truths of the gospel, how can we preach the gospel adequately? I also taught the saints how to classify the different kinds of people to whom we are preaching the gospel.</P><P>Some of the saints who were trained in Taipei recently picked up new skills in their gospel preaching. When you knock on a person's door and they ask who it is, how you answer will many times determine whether or not they let you in. You may say, "We are here to bring you good news!" This answer may get you in the door, but then you may say the wrong thing to them, and they may ask you to leave. For the preaching of the gospel today, we need more perfecting. The burden of the gifted persons is to perfect the saints, and the perfected saints do the direct building work.</P><P>After being perfected, the saints, according to Ephesians 4:15, will grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things. Here is a problem. Are not the members of Christ in Christ already? Suppose a brother comes to you, an elder, and says: "First Corinthians 1:30 says that God has put us into Christ. Why then does Ephesians 4:15 say that we have to grow up into Him? Aren't these two verses contradictory?" If you give him a doctrinal answer concerning the twofoldness of the divine truth, you may lead him into the forest. The elders first need to be perfected so that they can perfect others. If you were perfected, you might answer the brother like this: "It is true that we are in Christ, brother, but what about our living? Although you are in Christ, you may still go to the movie theater. Is going to the movie theater the living of one who is in Christ? You are in Christ, but you are not living in Christ in a practical way. Therefore, you need to grow in life so that you can grow up into Christ practically."</P><P>If the saints do not get perfected, how can they grow and cause the Body to grow? In other words, how can they build the church? Ephesians 4:15 says that we need to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things, and verse 16 says that out from the Head, all the Body causes the growth of the Body. The entire Body is joined closely together and knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part. For the entire Body to cause the growth of the Body, all of us need to be perfected. We have to admit that we are short of being perfected. We may have been generally edified in the past by listening to messages, but how much of the truth has been constituted into us? How many of us can tell what sanctification and holiness are and what the difference is between them? This shows us how much perfection we need. For the perfecting work to take place after the gospel has been preached, there is the need of home meetings, small group meetings, and church meetings.</P>
