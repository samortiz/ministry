   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MELCHISEDEC AND ABRAHAM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we can turn to chapter seven of the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us first read verses 1 through 10: "For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all; first being interpreted king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace; being without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God, abides a priest perpetually.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And consider how great this one was, to whom the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the choice spoils.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And they of the sons of Levi, who received the priestly service, have a commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, though they have come forth from the loins of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But he whose genealogy is not counted from them has taken tithes from Abraham and has blessed him who has the promises.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And here men, who die, receive tithes; but there, one of whom it is testified that he lives.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And, so to speak, through Abraham, Levi also, he who receives tithes, has been made to pay tithes, for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this passage, the writer of the book told the Hebrews that the priesthood that they depended on came from the lineage of Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Christ that we believe in, however, did not come from the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, He is of the lineage of Melchisedec who also was a priest .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>MELCHISEDEC GREATER THAN LEVI</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Which one is greater, Levi or Melchisedec?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The answer is, of course, Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But why?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here the writer brought in Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Abraham offered up one tenth of what he acquired to Melchisedec as a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not only did Melchisedec accept it, but he blessed Abraham as well.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, beyond dispute, Melchisedec is greater than Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But what does that have to do with Levi?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The link is in the fact that Levi "was still in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although Levi was born after another hundred or so years, according to the principle of unity, Levi offered up one tenth to Melchisedec when he was inside Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On that same day, he was blessed by Melchisedec within Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For this reason Melchisedec is greater than Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our faith has a central concept: whatever a man does or however he acts affects his future generations.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If our ancestors have done such and such, so have we.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It does not matter whether or not we were born yet, because we did the same while we were in them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE BEGINNING OF THE FALL</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>AND THE SALVATION OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is where the fall of man began.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is also where man's salvation commences.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ recognizes the nature of unity of the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the first man sinned, all who came after him sinned as well.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, if another man can be established as a source of life and as the head of a new race, whoever succeeds him will be able to share all he is and all he has done in him.</S>
