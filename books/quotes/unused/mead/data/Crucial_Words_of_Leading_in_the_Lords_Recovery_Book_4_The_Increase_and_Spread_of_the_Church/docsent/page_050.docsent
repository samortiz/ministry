   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Pastor Yu s Visits</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Pastor Yu was truly saved, and even though he was not so clear about the truth, he was a very proper person.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When he came to visit me, he often would say nothing more than, I am here to see you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sometimes, he would gently convey an invitation to attend the Sunday morning service.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His words were not so direct, but I did not respond.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He would come again a week later with the same approach; he would not speak much, but he would have a smiling face.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even though I knew that he wanted me to go to the Sunday service, I would not go.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One day he came and just said, Mr. Lee, the New Year is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am afraid that I will not be able to come and see you for the next few weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After the New Year, I will come again to visit you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I truly believe that Pastor Yu was praying for me during this time, and no doubt, my sister was desperately praying for me because she knew my condition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At that time, I was not saved, I was not attracted to the Lord, and I did not agree with Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why my sister had such a burden for me and asked Pastor Yu to visit me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Work of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1925 I was nineteen years old and full of vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the second day of the Chinese New Year, which was a Lord s Day, I should have gone out to have a good time, like the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, something wonderful happened that day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I woke up that morning, I had no interest in pursuing pleasure; in fact, I had no motivation to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My mother earnestly hoped that I would attend the Sunday service, so that morning she prepared a delicious breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After I was finished, she casually asked, Today is the second day of the New Year; do you plan to go anywhere?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I replied, I was thinking about going to Pastor Yu s Sunday service.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>My mother, of course, readily agreed with me, so I put on my Chinese long gown and went to the service.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I had not been to a service for years, and the only reason I was willing to return was because of Pastor Yu s visits.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we go to visit the saints, it is often better not to speak than to speak, and if we have to speak, we should not speak too much.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All we need is a smiling countenance and a short visit of about half an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Holy Spirit can do the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After we visit, we should not go back too soon.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not unreasonable to wait for two weeks because another visit after a short period of time is like a doctor giving too much medicine to a sick patient.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We do not need to be quick or rushed; rather, we should trust in the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must believe that the Holy Spirit will work in this kind of visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That year, on the second day of the New Year, I attended the service at Pastor Yu s denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although the sermon was not outstanding and I did not really understand it, I felt that it would be good to go every week.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, I made a resolution: From now on I will not go and play.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I will work hard on my studies to receive a good education, and every Lord s Day I will go to this chapel to sit for an hour and a half.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From then on I went to Sunday service every week.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Three or four months later, Pastor Yu announced, Every season we have a baptism here.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whoever is willing may come next Saturday for an interview.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we feel that you are ready, we will baptize you the next morning.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Saturday came, I went.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Pastor Yu was very familiar with me, and he introduced me to everyone, saying, There is no problem with Mr. Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His sister is studying in the seminary, his mother is a church member, and their household has been zealous for several generations, so he can be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, I passed the interview.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Actually, I did not understand anything at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I knew a little about the Lord Jesus dying on the cross for me and that He loved me, but I did not know much beyond this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since they were all so happy, I received the baptism by sprinkling and was admitted to the denomination that Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I surely did not have much feeling, and I had never prayed once; I merely did what the denomination told me to do.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Receiving the Lord s Calling</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>and Consecrating Myself</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Two or three weeks after my baptism, an announcement was made about a young sister named Peace Wang, who was raised in China and was very powerful in preaching the gospel in Shanghai and Hangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All the local denominations jointly invited her to Chefoo, and although I did not care about the gospel, I was curious and wanted to hear this young sister preach.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When I went into the meeting, I heard her speak about Satan usurping man based on Exodus 1, which speaks of Pharaoh usurping the children of Israel and not letting them serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although she was only five or six years older than I, I was shocked by her speaking and singing in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I was born in Christianity, and I had heard many preachers, but her preaching was different from what I had heard in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There were about one thousand in the meeting, and as soon as the singing of the hymns began, many were subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I was no exception.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I was affected deeply.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At that time I had just made up my mind to concentrate on the pursuit of my studies in order to be successful in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I was anxious, restless, and intent on gaining the world.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The words in Sister Peace Wang s message spoke directly to my current situation, and I was truly captured.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I will never forget that day.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After the meeting was over, while I was on my way home, I stopped at a corner and looked up to heaven and said, O God, I believe in You, and I want You.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If someone would give me the whole world, I would not want it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I only want You.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I was determined to take my Bible and preach the gospel from village to village after I graduated from college.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I did not want to do anything but preach the gospel; this was my prayer to the Lord when I was called.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Little did I know that the Lord would bring me not only from village to village but also from continent to continent.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Surely this is His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Speaking about my salvation and calling by the Lord almost brings tears to my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I will always remember Pastor Yu and be grateful to him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Later the Lord raised up a church in my hometown, and I preached the truth there.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Around 1932 or 1933, Pastor Yu came to attend our meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He was so happy to see that a young man whom he had visited was preaching the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>His visits were truly effective.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As long as we visit people, this is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many times, our words are not appropriate, and because we do not know their inner condition, it is easy to hurt them and cause them to feel bad.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, if we go with a cheerful countenance, they will be comforted and touched.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They will feel that neither the Lord nor the church has forgotten them.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This will give the Holy Spirit a great opportunity to work in them.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>May we all grasp this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the matter of visiting, we must first have a burden to pray and then visit according to the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is good as long as we go.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Our going is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This will bring comfort and encouragement to the saints, and they will sense both love and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We should not expect quick results in visiting.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Looking for quick results often leads to the opposite effect and brings in much frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>There is no need to exert too much energy; we only need to go and visit with a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I surely learned a great lesson related to this from Pastor Yu s visits.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>TAKING THE LORD S HEART AS OUR HEART</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We must take the Lord s heart as our heart and treasure the lost sheep Luke 15:4-6 , loving the brothers and sisters who have not been to a meeting for a long time and paying the price to find them.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Although there is a price to pay in visiting people, requiring not only the expense of time and energy but even a considerable amount of thought, the price the Lord paid was much higher.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We must have a spirit to lay these dormant saints on our shoulders like lambs and bring them back to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We must take outward actions and bear an inward burden.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In this way, sooner or later they will be brought back to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>RELYING ON THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>As we seek out the saints, we must rely on the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I truly believe that my return to the meetings was altogether the work of the Holy Spirit; it was the Holy Spirit who brought me back.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The work of the Spirit is likened in Luke 15 to a woman who lights a lamp to seek a lost coin.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Holy Spirit is able to shine upon the saints with the Lord s word and is willing to search for them until they are found vv.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>8-9</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>LOVING PEOPLE WITH THE FATHER S LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We must love others with the Father s love.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We all know the story of the father who eagerly welcomed his prodigal son in chapter 15 of the Gospel of Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>When the son came to himself and thought about returning home, he considered the words of repentance that he would speak to his father v. 18 . On the day he returned home to his father, he said, I am no longer worthy to be called your son v. 21 , but the father said to his slaves, Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>And bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry, because this son of mine was dead and lives again vv.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>22-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This shows that the father had only love toward his son.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We must take the Lord s heart as our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>As our brothers and sisters return, our hearts must be filled with love for them, and we must minister Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The father spoke only of slaying the fattened calf in celebration of his son s return; he did not mention things from the past or touch his son s wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>He forgot the past.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Even if the dormant saints want to bring up their past, we must let them know that it is not necessary, because of the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We should only minister Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The robe in Luke 15 is Christ, and the fattened calf is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Thus, as our brothers and sisters return, we can minister what we have experienced and enjoyed of Christ according to the need.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>In this way, we will gradually recover them.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>I hope that we will receive this burden and actively stir up the small groups to seek out, visit, and restore the saints who have been absent from the meetings for a long time.</S>
