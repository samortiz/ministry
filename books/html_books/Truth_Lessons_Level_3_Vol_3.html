<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>According to the revelation in the New Testament, in the progressing stage, the stage of transformation, of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the first item is to experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing.</p>
<p>At the same time, we continuously experience God&rsquo;s redemption in forgiveness, cleansing, sanctification, justification, and reconciliation. This is not an occasional or even a frequently occurring application of the redemption of God but rather a constant and uninterrupted application. As we contact God moment by moment, His redemption is applied continuously.</p>
<p>First John 1:1-9 indicates that the experience and enjoyment of the Triune God and the continuous application of God&rsquo;s redemption are related to a cycle in our spiritual life. This cycle is formed of four crucial things&mdash;the eternal life, the fellowship of the eternal life, the divine light, and the blood of Jesus the Son of God. Eternal life issues in fellowship, the fellowship of the eternal life brings in the divine light, and the divine light increases the need for the blood of Jesus the Son of God that we may have more eternal life. The more eternal life we have, the more fellowship it brings to us. The more fellowship of the divine life we enjoy, the more divine light we receive. The more divine light we receive, the more we participate in the cleansing of the blood of Jesus. This cycle brings us onward in the growth of the divine life until we reach the maturity of life.</p>
<p>The eternal life that we have received leads us into the divine fellowship, and the divine fellowship leads us into the divine light. In the divine light we are exposed to see our defects, failures, and sins. We also sense our need for God&rsquo;s forgiveness and the cleansing of the blood of Jesus, and we confess to the Lord. God, in His faithfulness and righteousness, then forgives us of our sins and cleanses us from all unrighteousness. Through forgiveness and cleansing we are brought deeper into the divine life and the fellowship of the divine life, we see more of our failures, we have a more thorough confession of sins, and we have a deeper experience of forgiveness and cleansing. By this continuous and deepening cycle, we grow in the divine life daily, even moment by moment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. FORGIVEN</h2>
<p>The believers need to experience God&rsquo;s redemption in their being forgiven of their sins. God&rsquo;s forgiveness of our sins releases us from the offense of our sins. God&rsquo;s forgiveness is continuous. Moment by moment we need God&rsquo;s forgiveness. As long as we live on this earth of the old creation, we need God&rsquo;s redemption. Each time we contact Him, we should sense the need for His forgiveness.</p>
<p>Our sin (singular), the indwelling sin in our nature (Rom. 7:17), has been dealt with by Christ as our sin offering (Lev. 4; Isa. 53:10; Rom. 8:3; 2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 9:26). Our sins (plural), our trespasses, have also been dealt with by Christ as our trespass offering (Lev. 5; Isa. 53:11; 1 Cor. 15:3; 1 Pet. 2:24; Heb. 9:28). However, after regeneration we still need to take Christ as our sin offering for the sin in our nature, as indicated in 1 John 1:8; in addition, we need to take Christ as our trespass offering for the sins in our conduct as indicated in 1 John 1:9.</p>
<p>First John 1:8 says, &ldquo;If we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.&rdquo; To say that we do not have sin is to say that we do not have the indwelling sin within our nature. In his first Epistle John wanted to inoculate the believers against this false teaching. First John 1:7 through 2:2 deals with the believers&rsquo; sinning after regeneration. This sinning interrupts our fellowship with God. If we did not have sin in our nature after regeneration, how could we sin in our conduct? Even if we only sin occasionally, rather than habitually, this sinning is adequate proof that we still have sin working within us. The apostle&rsquo;s teaching condemns the teaching of perfectionism, which suggests that a state of freedom from sin is attainable or has been attained in this earthly life. It also annuls the erroneous teaching of the eradication of the sinful nature, which, contrary to the word in 3:9 and 5:18, says that regenerated persons cannot sin because their sinful nature has been totally eradicated. To say that we cannot sin because we have been regenerated is to deceive ourselves and to deny the actual fact of our own experience; this leads us astray. After our regeneration, sin still remains in our flesh, in our sinful nature.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that the old creation has been crucified with Christ on the cross. Experientially, however, the old creation, our old man, still remains with us and affects us greatly. We will be able to say that sin is no longer with us only when our body is transfigured, that is, when our body is redeemed. As long as we are living in this body of oldness, sin is with us. Even though we may not willingly sin or be conscious of our sin, we still are bound by sin and defiled by sin. Hence, we need to apply the cleansing blood of Jesus to our actual condition moment by moment.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Through the Confessing of Sins</h2>
<p>Through the confessing of sins, the believers experience God&rsquo;s redemption in being forgiven of their sins. First John 1:9 says, &ldquo;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&rdquo; The confessing of sins (plural) here denotes the confessing of our sins, our failures, after regeneration, not the confessing of our sins before regeneration. Even if we have been regenerated and are under the transformation of the Holy Spirit, we can still sin. Since we can still sin after we are saved, we need to confess our sins. In order to receive God&rsquo;s forgiveness, we need to confess our sins. Forgiveness for the restoration of fellowship with God is conditional; it depends on our confession.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. According to God&rsquo;s Faithfulness in His Word</h2>
<p>First John 1:9 tells us that God is faithful to forgive us our sins. God is faithful in His word. His word is the word of the truth of His gospel (Eph.1:13), which tells us that He will forgive us our sins because of Christ (Acts 10:43). If we confess our sins, He forgives us according to His faithfulness in His word. Otherwise, He would be unfaithful.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. According to God&rsquo;s Righteousness<br />
Based on the Cleansing Blood of Jesus His Son</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s forgiving us of our sins is not only according to His faithfulness but also according to His righteousness based on the cleansing blood of Jesus His Son (1 John 1:7). God is righteous with regard to the blood of Jesus His Son. The blood of Christ has satisfied the demand of God&rsquo;s righteousness, allowing Him to forgive us of our sins (Matt. 26:28). Therefore, if we confess our sins, God, based on the redemption through the blood of Jesus, forgives us because He must be righteous in the blood of Jesus; otherwise, He would be unrighteous.</p>
<p>Since the Lord Jesus has shed His blood for us, God, in His righteousness, His justice, must forgive us. He has no reason not to forgive us. God forgave His people&rsquo;s sin in the Old Testament through the offering of sacrifices. These sacrifices were types pointing to the coming Christ. In the New Testament God&rsquo;s forgiveness is based on Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross for our sins. Because the Lord shed His blood for us, God has the ground to forgive us according to His righteousness. If we confess our sins, God must forgive us in order to be righteous. This is His righteousness based on Christ&rsquo;s act in redemption. This act was accomplished on the cross and conveyed to us through God&rsquo;s word in the Bible. Because God is righteous, He must forgive us of our sins based on Christ&rsquo;s shed blood.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. CLEANSED</h2>
<p>The believers experience God&rsquo;s redemption not only in being forgiven of their sins but also in being washed, being cleansed. First John 1:9 tells us that God cleanses us from all unrighteousness; this means that He washes us from the stain of our unrighteousness. <em>Unrighteousness</em> and <em>sins</em> are synonyms. All unrighteousness is sin (5:17). Both refer to our wrongdoings. <em>Sins</em> indicates the offense of our wrongdoings against God and men; <em>unrighteousness</em> indicates the stain of our wrongdoings, which causes us not to be right with God or men. The offense needs God&rsquo;s forgiveness, and the stain requires His cleansing. Both God&rsquo;s forgiveness and God&rsquo;s cleansing are needed for the restoration of our fellowship with God so that we may enjoy Him with a conscience void of offense (1 Tim.1:5; Acts 24:16).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Through the Blood of Jesus God&rsquo;s Son</h2>
<p>First John 1:7 says, &ldquo;If we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.&rdquo; When we walk in the divine light, we are under its enlightenment, and it exposes, according to God&rsquo;s nature in us, all our sins, trespasses, failures, and defects, which contradict His pure light, perfect love, absolute holiness, and excelling righteousness. At such a time we sense the need of the cleansing by the redeeming blood of the Lord Jesus in our enlightened conscience, and it cleanses us in our conscience from all sins so that our fellowship with God and with one another may be maintained. The tense of the verb <em>cleanse</em> is present and denotes continuous action, indicating that the blood of Jesus the Son of God cleanses us all the time, continuously and constantly. Cleansing refers to the instant cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s blood in our conscience. Before God, the redeeming blood of the Lord has cleansed us once for all eternally (Heb. 9:12, 14), and the efficacy of that cleansing lasts forever before God, so that this cleansing need not be repeated. However, in our conscience we need the instant application of the constant cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s blood again and again whenever our conscience is enlightened by the divine light in our fellowship with God.</p>
<p>In 1 John 1:7 the phrase <em>every sin</em> denotes every single sin we commit after we are regenerated. Each sin we commit after our regeneration defiles our previously purged conscience and needs to be cleansed away by the blood of Jesus in our fellowship with God. The phrase <em>the blood of Jesus His Son</em> is very meaningful. The name <em>Jesus</em> denotes the Lord&rsquo;s humanity, which is needed for the shedding of the redeeming blood, and the title <em>His Son</em> denotes the Lord&rsquo;s divinity, which is needed for the eternal efficacy of the redeeming blood. Thus, <em>the blood of Jesus His Son</em> indicates that this blood is the proper blood of a genuine man shed for the redeeming of God&rsquo;s fallen creatures, with the divine surety as its eternal efficacy, an efficacy that is all prevailing in space and everlasting in time. The blood by which we are cleansed is the blood of a wonderful person&mdash;Jesus Christ&mdash;who has both humanity and divinity. His humanity qualifies Him to shed His blood for our redemption. His divinity guarantees the efficacy of the power of this redemptive blood. The efficacy of the cleansing blood of Jesus is eternally assured by His divinity.</p><h2 class="head2">B. In the Spirit</h2>
<p>The believers are not only cleansed by the blood of Jesus but also washed in the Spirit. First Corinthians 6:11 reveals that the believers are washed in the Spirit of our God. This washing is subjective, having been accomplished in the power and the realization of the Holy Spirit. To be washed in the Spirit is actually to experience the dispensing of the Spirit into us. The Spirit dispenses His element into us, and this dispensing of the Spirit is His washing. This washing is inward, subjective, and dispositional.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. SANCTIFIED</h2>
<p>The believers experience God&rsquo;s redemption continuously in the matter of sanctification. Romans 6:19 says, &ldquo;Present your members as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification.&rdquo; Sanctification involves not only a change in position, that is, a separation from a common, worldly position to a position for God, but also a transformation in disposition, that is, a transformation from the natural disposition to a spiritual one. Dispositional sanctification involves a long process, which begins with regeneration, passes through the entire Christian life, and reaches completion at the time of our maturity.</p>
<p>Romans 6:22 says, &ldquo;Having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end, eternal life.&rdquo; This verse speaks of dispositional sanctification in life. Sanctification brings in the riches of life, allowing us to enjoy the riches of God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. In the Holy Spirit as the Sanctifying Power</h2>
<p>The believers are sanctified in the Holy Spirit as the sanctifying power. First Corinthians 6:11 says that we are sanctified in the Spirit of our God. The Spirit works within the believers, sanctifying and separating us wholly for the will of God.</p>
<p>Second Thessalonians 2:13 says, &ldquo;God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit.&rdquo; God chose us unto salvation in sanctification, which is of the Spirit. <em>In sanctification</em> means that we are in the process of being sanctified. Day after day we are being sanctified in the Holy Spirit as the sanctifying power.</p>
<p>Romans 15:16 speaks of the believers &ldquo;having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This is subjective dispositional sanctification. The Holy Spirit works continuously within us to sanctify us for God&rsquo;s will, separating us unto God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. By Christ as the Sanctifying Life</h2>
<p>The believers are sanctified by Christ as the sanctifying life. First Corinthians 1:30 reveals that Christ has become sanctification to us from God. This indicates that the sanctifying life within us is Christ. He lives in us, sanctifying us continuously by His eternal life. By Christ being the sanctifying life, we are gradually being sanctified in our soul, that is, transformed in our mind, emotion, and will.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. In God&rsquo;s Word, the Truth, Which Conveys<br />
the Reality of the Holiness of God the Father</h2>
<p>In His prayer in John 17:17 to the Father, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.&rdquo; In verse 19 the Lord continued, &ldquo;For their sake I sanctify Myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.&rdquo; These verses indicate that the believers are being sanctified in God&rsquo;s word. This word is truth, which conveys the reality of the holiness of God the Father. The Father&rsquo;s word carries the reality of the Father with it. Hence, His word as the truth, as the reality, works in the believers to sanctify them, separating them from anything worldly. His word works not only positionally but also dispositionally, separating the believers from the world and its usurpation unto God and His purpose. This is to be sanctified in God&rsquo;s word. This kind of sanctification not only changes our position but also our disposition, that is, what we are inwardly.</p>
<p>This holiness does not directly denote God&rsquo;s nature but rather an attribute of God&rsquo;s nature. God&rsquo;s nature is holy, and this holy nature is conveyed in His word, because God&rsquo;s word transmits the holy nature of God the Father. When we have the word as God&rsquo;s reality, this word sanctifies us subjectively. This subjective sanctification is in the Spirit as the sanctifying power, by Christ as the sanctifying life, and in the word as the reality of the holiness of God the Father. The word carries with it God&rsquo;s holy nature and dispenses this nature into our whole being, sanctifying us subjectively.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Through the Discipline of the Father<br />
for the Believers to Partake of His Holiness</h2>
<p>Hebrews 12:10 says that God the Father disciplines us &ldquo;for what is profitable that we might partake of His holiness.&rdquo; This indicates that through the discipline of the Father the believers are sanctified so that we might partake of His holiness&mdash;an attribute of His holy nature. To partake of the holiness of the Father is to partake of an attribute of His holy nature. The Father&rsquo;s disciplining us so that we might partake of His holy nature is related to the work of transformation (2 Cor. 3:18); this refers to the result of the inward divine dispensing and the outward discipline in the environment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Through Their Pursuit of Holiness</h2>
<p>There are several portions in the New Testament concerning the pursuit of holiness. Hebrews 12:14 says, &ldquo;Pursue peace with all men and sanctification, without which no one will see the Lord.&rdquo; A proper Christian living should be balanced between peace and sanctification. With regard to God, holiness is the attribute of His holy nature; with us, holiness is our sanctification, our being separated unto God. The implication here is that while we are pursuing peace with all men, we must pay attention to the matter of sanctification before God. Our pursuing peace with all men must be balanced by our sanctification before God, our being separated unto God, without which no one will see the Lord and have fellowship with Him.</p>
<p>First Peter 1:15 says, &ldquo;According to the Holy One who called you, you yourselves also be holy in all your manner of life.&rdquo; The Holy One is the Triune God&mdash;the choosing Father, the redeeming Son, and the sanctifying Spirit (vv. 1-2). The Father has regenerated us, as His elect, imparting His holy nature into us (v. 3); the Son has redeemed us with His blood from our vain manner of life (vv. 18-19); and the Spirit sanctifies us according to the Father&rsquo;s holy nature, separating us from anything other than God, that we, by the holy nature of the Father, may be holy in all our manner of life, even as holy as God Himself (vv. 15-16). Through the sanctification of the Spirit we become holy in all manner of our life. This is based on regeneration which brings us the holy nature of God and issues in a holy life.</p>
<p>Second Peter 3:11 says, &ldquo;Since all these things are to be thus dissolved, what kind of persons ought you to be in holy manner of life and godliness...?&rdquo; Although all things, whether on the earth or in the heavens, have been reconciled to God through Christ by His blood, and even the heavenly things have been purified by the blood of Christ (Col. 1:20; Heb. 9:23), they will still need to be cleared up by being burned up in God&rsquo;s governmental dealing, that they may become new in nature and appearance in God&rsquo;s new universe (2 Pet. 3:13). Thus, what kind of persons ought we, the children of the holy God, to be in holy manner of life and godliness; that is, what kind of transformation ought we to experience in order to live a life in the manner of God&rsquo;s holy nature and godliness to express Him, that we may be qualified to match His holy government? It is wonderful that His divine power has granted to us everything we need to live a holy life according to godliness (1:3).</p>
<p>First Thessalonians 4:3-4 says that God&rsquo;s will is our sanctification; He wants each one of us to &ldquo;know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor.&rdquo; Sanctification refers to a holy condition before God; honor refers to a respectable standing before man. Verse 7 says, &ldquo;For God has not called us for uncleanness but in sanctification.&rdquo; Since God has called us in sanctification, we must remain continuously in sanctification.</p>
<p>Second Timothy 2:21 says, &ldquo;If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, useful to the master, prepared unto every good work.&rdquo; <em>Unto honor</em> is a matter of nature, <em>sanctified</em> is a matter of position, <em>useful</em> is a matter of practice, and <em>prepared</em> is a matter of training.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Through Their Perfecting Holiness</h2>
<p>Believers are also sanctified through their perfecting holiness. In 2 Corinthians 7:1 Paul says, &ldquo;Beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and of spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.&rdquo; Holiness is separation unto God from all things other than Him. To perfect holiness is to make this separation full and perfect, to have our entire being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;fully and perfectly separated, sanctified unto God (1 Thes. 5:23).</p>
<p>Holy means not only sanctified, separated unto God, but also different, distinct, from everything that is common. Only God is different, distinct, from all things. Hence, He is holy. According to Ephesians 1:4, He chose us that we should be holy. The way He makes us holy is by imparting Himself, the Holy One, into our being, that our whole being may be permeated and saturated with His holy nature.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. To Be Wholly Sanctified<br />
in Spirit, Soul, and Body</h2>
<p>Finally, the sanctification of the believers is for them to be wholly sanctified in spirit, soul, and body. First Thessalonians 5:23 says, &ldquo;The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; <em>To sanctify</em> means &ldquo;to set apart, separate unto God, from things common or profane.&rdquo; <em>Wholly</em> means &ldquo;entirely, thoroughly, to the consummation.&rdquo; God sanctifies us wholly so that no part of our being, either our spirit or soul or body, will be left common or profane. God sanctifies us, first, by taking possession of our spirit through regeneration (John 3:5-6); second, by spreading Himself as the life-giving Spirit from our spirit into our soul to saturate and transform our soul (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18); and third, by enlivening our mortal body through our soul (Rom. 8:11, 13) and transfiguring our body by His life power (Phil. 3:21). Consummately, we will be as holy as God and as holy as the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>After the believers are regenerated, they still need to experience God&rsquo;s redemption continuously in being forgiven, cleansed, and sanctified. These experiences are related to the cycle of our spiritual life. This cycle is formed with the eternal life, the fellowship of the eternal life, the divine light, and the blood of Jesus the Son of God and brings us onward in the growth of the divine life until we reach the maturity in life.</p>
<p>As long as we live on this earth of the old creation, every instant we need God&rsquo;s forgiveness. Not only so, after our regeneration we can still commit sin, thus interrupting our fellowship with God. Hence, we still need to take Christ as our sin offering for the sin in our nature and also take Christ as our trespass offering for the sins in our conduct. By confessing our sins, we can restore our fellowship with God and experience God&rsquo;s redemption in being forgiven of our sins. This is because God must forgive us according to His faithfulness in His word and His righteousness in the blood of His Son Jesus.</p>
<p>The sins that we commit after being regenerated also stain our already purged conscience. Because of our sins, we need God&rsquo;s forgiveness, and the stain from sins needs God&rsquo;s cleansing in order for us to enjoy Him with a conscience void of offense. This cleansing is through the blood of Jesus His Son, the blood of a wonderful person, who has both humanity and divinity, qualifying Him to shed His blood for our redemption and guaranteeing the efficacious power of this redeeming blood. We are also cleansed in the Spirit, the Spirit that is dispensed into us, cleansing us inwardly, subjectively, and dispositionally.</p>
<p>Then we need to be sanctified to enjoy the riches of God; we are subjectively sanctified in the Holy Spirit as the sanctifying power, by Christ as the sanctifying life, and in God&rsquo;s word of truth, which conveys the reality of the holiness of God the Father. This sanctification is also through the discipline of the Father for us to partake of His holiness, through our pursuit of holiness, through our perfecting holiness, and being wholly sanctified in spirit, soul, and body, thus making us holy. Ultimately, we will be as holy as God is holy and as holy as the New Jerusalem.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In the progressing stage in God&rsquo;s full salvation, the believers experience God&rsquo;s redemption in being forgiven of their sins, in being cleansed, and in being sanctified. The believers also experience God&rsquo;s redemption in being justified and in being reconciled, in the second step, to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. JUSTIFIED</h2>
<p>In the continuous experience of God&rsquo;s redemption, the believers are sanctified and then justified. In our Christian life we need to be justified daily by our righteous God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. In the Spirit</h2>
<p>The believers are justified in the Spirit. First Corinthians 6:11 says, &ldquo;These things were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.&rdquo; Washing, sanctifying, and justifying are inward and in life. The Spirit works within, justifying the believers in life. First, we are washed from the sinful things; second, we are sanctified, separated unto God; and third, we are justified, accepted, by God</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being Found in Christ</h2>
<p>If we want to continuously experience God&rsquo;s redemption in justification, we must be found in Christ. In Philippians 3:9 Paul aspired to be found in Him, not having his &ldquo;own righteousness which is out of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is out of God and based on faith.&rdquo; This indicates that Paul aspired to have his whole being immersed in and saturated with Christ that all who observed him might find him fully in Christ. We also should aspire to be found in Christ. Being found in Christ means that we are observed, seen, and discovered by others to be in Christ.</p>
<p>This is our real experience of Christ. We need to live in Christ, to remain in Christ, to dwell in Christ, to speak in Christ, to act in Christ, to move in Christ, and to have our being in Christ. In this way we will be found in Christ, whether by angels or saints. This is not a once-for-all matter but a daily matter, even a moment-by-moment matter. Daily and moment by moment we need to be found in Christ by those who are observing us.</p>
<p>The righteousness that is out of God and based on faith is God Himself in Christ being lived out of us to be our righteousness through our faith in Christ. This righteousness is the expression of God, who lives in us. This righteousness rests upon the basis or condition of faith. Faith is the basis, the condition, upon which we receive and possess the righteousness that is out of God, the highest righteousness, which is Christ. Therefore, there is a requirement or a condition for us to be found in Christ; that is, we should not have the righteousness which is out of law but the righteousness which is out of God and based on faith. This is the righteousness of God that we obtain through believing in Christ. We need to be found in Christ, having the righteousness of God through faith in Christ.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Christ Lived Out of the Believers<br />
to Be Their Righteousness</h2>
<p>The righteousness of the believers who are found in Christ is Christ Himself, who is lived out of them to be their righteousness. Christ is the righteousness by which we have been justified by God (1 Cor. 1:30). The more we gain Christ and live in Him, the more this Christ, who is our righteousness, is expressed before God and men. In this way we will be found by others in the righteousness which is Christ Himself lived out of us.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Christ Living the Righteous Life<br />
in the Believers</h2>
<p>When Christ lives Himself out from us, He lives the righteous life in us. Titus 2:12 says that &ldquo;we should live soberly and righteously and godly in the present age.&rdquo; This indicates that we need to live a righteous life through Christ. This is to live Christ as our righteousness and to be found in Him that we may be justified by God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Out of Works<br />
That Issue from the Divine Life<br />
through the Believers Living the Divine Life</h2>
<p>In the continuous experience of God&rsquo;s redemption, the believers are also justified out of works that issue from the divine life through their living the divine life. James 2:24 says, &ldquo;A man is justified by works and not by faith only.&rdquo; To be justified by faith is for the receiving of the divine life (Rom. 5:18); to be justified by works is through living the divine life. Since the living is the issue of life, to be justified by works is the issue of being justified by faith. Abraham&rsquo;s offering of Isaac and Rahab&rsquo;s receiving of the messengers and sending them out are works that issued from their living faith (Gen. 22:9; Josh. 2:1, 21; 6:23). A living tree surely brings forth fruit. Being justified by works is not inconsistent with being justified by faith. The latter is the cause, bringing forth the former; the former is the effect, the outcome and proof, of the latter.</p>
<p>When we live the divine life, this living will produce works. Then in our living, we will be justified out of works, not only out of faith. To be justified out of faith is mainly objective, whereas to be justified out of works is subjective because the works are the issue of our living the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Becoming the Righteousness of God<br />
by Being Constituted with Christ<br />
as the Righteousness of God</h2>
<p>The believers become the righteousness of God in Christ (2 Cor. 5:21b). This means that we are righteous not only in our acts and deeds but even righteous in our being. God&rsquo;s desire is not simply to gain a group of people who are righteous; rather, He wants to gain a group of people who, before God, the devil, the angels, and demons, are the righteousness of God. Being righteous before God is one thing, but being the righteousness of God is another. By being constituted with Christ, the righteousness of God (Rom. 5:19b), we become the righteousness of God in Him.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 5:21 says, &ldquo;Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.&rdquo; Christ did not know sin in an experiential way by contact or personal experience. Nevertheless, Christ died on the cross not only for our sins but was also made sin, because God made Him sin on our behalf. We are not only sinful; we are sin, a constitution of sin and the embodiment of sin. Therefore, when Christ became our Substitute, dying for us, God considered Him not only as One who bore our sins but even as sin. In resurrection, Christ entered into us to be our life, and this life living in us constitutes us to be God&rsquo;s righteousness. When Christ took our place, He was made sin for us; now He is constituting us, making us God&rsquo;s righteousness in Him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Him&rdquo; means being in union with Christ, not only positionally but also organically in resurrection. We were enemies of God by becoming sin, which came from Satan, who rebelled against God (Col. 1:21). Christ was made sin for us on the cross by becoming one with us through being incarnated in the flesh. Through His death on the cross He was condemned in the flesh as sin for us by God that we might be one with Him in His resurrection to be God&rsquo;s righteousness. Thus, in the organic union with Christ, we become the righteousness of God. We become not only righteous but even the righteousness of God; we become not only righteous persons, but also the righteousness of God itself.</p><h2 class="head1">V. RECONCILED, IN THE SECOND STEP, TO GOD</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 5:19-20 indicates that there are two steps in the believers&rsquo; reconciliation to God. The first step is to reconcile sinners to God from sin (v. 19). For this purpose, Christ died for our sins that we might be forgiven by God (1 Cor. 15:3). This is the objective aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death. In this aspect, He bore our sins on the cross, dying for our sins. The second step is to reconcile believers living in the natural life to God from the flesh (2 Cor. 5:20). For this purpose, Christ died for us&mdash;the persons&mdash;that we might live to Him in the resurrection life (vv. 14-15). This is the subjective aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death. In this aspect He was made sin for us to be judged and done away with by God that we might become the righteousness of God in Him (v. 21). By these two aspects of His death, He has fully reconciled God&rsquo;s chosen people to God.</p>
<p>These two steps of reconciliation are clearly portrayed by the two veils of the tabernacle in the Old Testament. The first veil is called &ldquo;the screen&rdquo; (Exo. 26:36-37). A sinner who was brought to God through the reconciliation of the propitiating blood entered into the Holy Place by passing through this screen. This typifies the first step of reconciliation. The second veil still separated the sinner from God in the Holy of Holies (vv. 31-35; Heb. 9:3). This veil needed to be rent so that the sinner might be brought to God in the Holy of Holies. This is the second step of reconciliation. In the progressing stage in God&rsquo;s full salvation, the believers need this second step of reconciliation to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Believers Living in the Natural Life<br />
Being Freed from the Flesh<br />
to Be Reconciled to God</h2>
<p>Many genuine Christians, who have been saved and reconciled to God in the first step, still live according to the flesh (2 Cor. 5:16a); that is, they still live in the flesh, in their soul, in their natural life. The veil of the flesh, the natural man, still separates them from God. Therefore, they need the second step of reconciliation. In this step, the flesh, as the separating veil, is crucified, allowing them to enter into the Holy of Holies. This is the full reconciliation which frees the believers not only from sin but also from the flesh, the natural man, and the natural being so that they may be brought back to God to be one with Him.</p>
<p>The second step of reconciliation is deeper than the first step because this does not take place in the outer court, outside the tabernacle, but in the Holy Place, inside the tabernacle. This kind of reconciliation is not once for all; rather, it is continuous. No matter how long we have been a seeking Christian, we are still separated from God, not yet completely one with God, not fully in harmony with Him, because of the natural life, the old man, and the self. Therefore, we need the second step of reconciliation; we need to condemn our natural being, apply the subjective death of Christ to our situation, and crucify our natural life so that the veil which separates us from the inward presence of God might be rent in order that we may live in the presence of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Through Christ&rsquo;s Dying<br />
for the Believers and<br />
Being Made Sin on Their Behalf</h2>
<p>The second step of reconciling the believers to God is not through Christ&rsquo;s death for the believers&rsquo; sins; rather, it is through Christ&rsquo;s dying for the believers themselves. The New Testament reveals that Christ died for our sins and also for us. Christ&rsquo;s dying for our sins is objective, but Christ&rsquo;s dying for us is subjective. In 2 Corinthians 5:14-15 Paul did not say that Christ died for our sins. Rather, he said that Christ died for us; that is, He died for what we are: &ldquo;The love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised.&rdquo; Christ, in dying for the believers, was made sin for us (v. 21a). When Christ died for our sins, He bore our sins; in addition, when Christ died for us, He was made sin for us.</p><h2 class="head2">C. God Entreating the Believers<br />
through the Apostles<br />
as Ambassadors of Christ</h2>
<p>The believers&rsquo; second step of reconciliation to God is by God entreating them through the apostles as ambassadors of Christ. In 2 Corinthians 5:20 Paul says, &ldquo;On behalf of Christ then we are ambassadors, as God entreats you through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God.&rdquo; Here Paul was speaking to the Corinthians who were still living in their natural life. They were believers, saved ones, and Paul called them saints (1 Cor.1:2). They were saints, yet they lived in their natural life. Their natural life was the veil that separated them from the presence of God; this veil needed to be rent. Therefore, as an ambassador of God Paul entreated them to be reconciled to God. Paul, an ambassador sent by God, a fellow worker of God, entreated God&rsquo;s people, who were still in their natural being, to be reconciled to God, to enter into His inner presence, the Holy of Holies. Through the apostles as ambassadors of Christ, God entreats the believers to be fully reconciled to Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Becoming the Righteousness<br />
of God in Christ</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the second step of reconciliation to God is to make the believers the righteousness of God in Christ (2 Cor. 5:21b). We, who are brought back to God in the Holy of Holies, experience and enjoy Him in His triune dispensing to such an extent that we become the righteousness of God in Christ. This means that we are reconciled to God in the second step and become the righteousness of God in our organic union with Christ.</p>
<p>When we were saved, we passed through the process of forgiveness, cleansing, sanctification, justification, and reconciliation. Now in our living as Christians, this process needs to be repeated continuously until the redemption of our body. Every day we need to be forgiven, cleansed, sanctified, justified, and reconciled to God.</p>
<p>The believers&rsquo; continuous experience of God&rsquo;s redemption can be illustrated by the Israelites&rsquo; offering of the sin offering and the trespass offering. Whenever they offered the burnt offering to satisfy God, they also had to offer the sin offering and the trespass offering. These offerings were offered in the morning and in the evening and also at the feasts. As believers in Christ, we need to offer Christ daily as our sin offering and trespass offering. We need Christ to be these offerings because we are defiled by the natural life, the old man, the flesh, the lust of the flesh, and worldliness. Therefore, because of our sins, offenses, and our sinful nature, we need Christ as our sin offering and trespass offering. Throughout our entire Christian life, we need God&rsquo;s forgiveness, cleansing, sanctification, justification, and reconciliation. While we are enjoying the triune dispensing of the processed Triune God, we need to continuously experience the redemption of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>In the believers&rsquo; continuous experience of God&rsquo;s redemption, there is the need to be justified after being sanctified. In our daily life we need to be justified by the righteous God. First, we are accepted by God, being justified in the Spirit; then we must be found in Christ, that is, observed, seen, and discovered that we are in Christ. This is our subjective experience of Christ that Christ may be lived out of us to become our righteousness and that Christ may live the righteous life in us for us to be justified by God.</p>
<p>The believers are justified not only out of faith but also out of works as the issue of the divine life by living out the divine life. Justification by faith is by receiving the divine life; justification by works is through living the divine life that produces works of righteousness. The believers also become the righteousness of God in Christ by being constituted with Christ as the righteousness of God. When Christ took our place, He was made sin for us; now He is constituting us that we may be made the righteousness of God in Him. In this way, in our organic union with Christ we are not only righteous, but we become the righteousness of God itself.</p>
<p>After justification, the believers also need the second step of reconciliation to God. The first step of reconciliation is to be freed from sin to be reconciled to God. This is accomplished in the objective aspect of the death of Christ. The second step of reconciliation is for the believers living in their natural life to be freed from the flesh to be reconciled to God; this is accomplished by the subjective aspect of the death of Christ. This is not through Christ&rsquo;s dying for the sins of the believers, but rather through Christ&rsquo;s dying for the believers themselves and through God&rsquo;s entreating the believers through the apostles as ambassadors of Christ that they may become the righteousness of God in their organic union with Christ.</p>
<p>Because of our sins, offenses, and sinful nature, we need to continuously experience God&rsquo;s forgiveness, cleansing, sanctification, justification, and reconciliation throughout our entire life. This is what we need to experience continuously as we enjoy the triune dispensing of the processed Triune God.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>According to the revelation in the New Testament, in the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, which is the stage of transformation, the first matter is for the believers to be in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity to experience and enjoy the processed Triune God. At the same time, the believers experience God&rsquo;s redemption continuously in forgiveness, cleansing, sanctification, justification, and reconciliation. For the divine conformation, the believers enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation. In this lesson we want to begin to consider the dispensing in the divine transformation for the divine conformation.</p>
<p>Enjoying the Father in the Father&rsquo;s love, enjoying the Son in the Son&rsquo;s grace, and enjoying the Spirit in the Spirit&rsquo;s fellowship is the dispensing of God (2 Cor. 13:14). This enjoyment of the processed Triune God is for transformation, which issues in conformation. Transformation is a matter of essence, whereas conformation is a matter of shape. Christ has a shape, an image, and we need to be conformed to His shape.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. BY BEING TRANSFORMED</h2>
<p>Transformation is not outward correction or adjustment; rather, it involves the element of Christ&rsquo;s divine life being added into our entire being so that Christ&rsquo;s image may be expressed outwardly. Second Corinthians 3:18 says, &ldquo;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; This is Christ increasing in our entire being, replacing what we are so that He increases, and our natural life decreases. The old element of our natural being is discharged while the resurrected and glorified Christ as the life-giving Spirit is increasingly added into us to replace the natural element. This process is organic and metabolic. It is organic because it is related to life; it is metabolic because it is related to the process of discharging an old element and adding a new element. Metabolism involves three matters: first, supplying a new element; second, replacing an old element with the new element; and third, discharging or removing the old element so that something new may be produced.</p>
<p>This kind of transformation, this kind of metabolism, is from the Lord Spirit. The Lord Spirit is the transforming Spirit, producing a metabolism in us so that our whole being, including our life, nature, element, essence, shape, and outward expression, is totally transformed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Freed from the Bondage of the Law<br />
through the Spirit of the Lord</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&rdquo; According to the context of 2 Corinthians 3, this freedom is from the bondage of the letter of the law in the Old Testament, that is, the written regulations in the Old Testament. In Paul&rsquo;s time, the Judaizers and those influenced by them were bound by the traditional regulations of the law. But this verse clearly shows that the believers in the New Testament, by the Spirit of the Lord, the pneumatic Christ, have been freed from the bondage of the law; that is, we are freed from its ordinances, ceremonial forms, religious teachings, and traditional doctrines. We are no longer bound by circumcision, dietary regulations, the Sabbath, and other Old Testament ordinances; we are wholly freed to let the Spirit of the Lord transform us. The Lord is the Spirit, and He is freedom to us. In Him there is no bondage, no Sabbath, no circumcision, and no dietary regulations. In Him there is complete freedom. He is our freedom. Whenever our heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away, and the Lord who is the Spirit frees us from the bondage of the letter of the law.</p><h2 class="head2">B. With Unveiled Face</h2>
<p>For us to be transformed, we need to be like a mirror, beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord. Therefore, our faces must not have the covering of any veil so that we can see clearly and reflect accurately. If a mirror is proper in every respect and rightly placed, it is able to behold and reflect an object, but if the mirror is covered with a veil, it loses its function. A veil causes a mirror to be unable to behold or to reflect. In like manner, if we are covered with a veil, we will be unable to behold and reflect the glory of the Lord.</p>
<p>From experience we know there are different types of veils upon the believers. They may be religious concepts, natural concepts and opinions, or racial and national characteristics; these veils are related to the natural constitution in man. In order for the veils to be taken away, our heart must be turned to the Lord. Second Corinthians 3:16 and 18 say that whenever our heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away, and then with an unveiled face we behold and reflect the glory of the Lord. <em>Unveiled face</em> is in contrast to the veiled heart in verses 14 and 15. This indicates that when our heart is turned to the Lord, the veil is taken away (v. 16). Furthermore, the Lord being the Spirit frees us from the bondage and covering of the law (v. 17) so that there is no insulation between us and the Lord, and we can behold and reflect the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. By Beholding and Reflecting<br />
the Glory of the Lord</h2>
<p>By beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord, we are gradually transformed. <em>Beholding and reflecting like a mirror</em> in 2 Corinthians 3:18 is only one word in the Greek. A mirror beholds and reflects what it beholds. These are the two functions of a mirror. Beholding is to see the Lord by ourselves; reflecting is for others to see Him through us.</p>
<p>The glory in 2 Corinthians 3:18 refers to the glory of the new covenant, the glory of the resurrected and ascended Lord, the glory of the resurrected Christ Himself. Christ as both God and man passed through incarnation, human living on the earth, and crucifixion, entered into resurrection, accomplished full redemption, and in resurrection became a life-giving Spirit to dwell in us. When we behold and reflect Him, what He is and what He has accomplished, obtained, and attained become the new elements to supply us inwardly to replace and discharge the old elements in our natural life and to become our reality that we may be one with Him and transformed into His image.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Into the Image of Christ</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:18 indicates that the goal of transformation is to be &ldquo;transformed into the same image&rdquo; of the resurrected and glorified Christ. To be transformed to have the same image as Christ means that we are gradually being conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ, to be made the same as He (Rom. 8:29).</p>
<p>When we behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, the Lord infuses and dispenses into us the elements of what He is and what He has done. Through His life power and by His life essence, we are gradually transformed metabolically to have His life shape, and through the renewing of our mind, we are gradually transfigured into His image.</p>
<p>Every kind of life is constituted with a life essence, life power, and life shape. As the seed of a carnation grows by its life essence and through its life power, it takes on a characteristic shape. The divine life is the same. This life has an essence, power, and shape. The shape of the divine life is the image of Christ. Therefore, when we grow by the essence of Christ&rsquo;s life and through the power of His life, we are gradually transformed into Christ&rsquo;s image, that is, into the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">E. From Glory to Glory</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we are gradually transformed into His same image &ldquo;from glory to glory.&rdquo; This means that we are being transformed from one degree of glory to another degree of glory. This indicates an ongoing process in life in resurrection. Transformation is not a once-for-all matter; rather, it is a gradual process, from one degree of glory to another degree of glory.</p>
<p>This glory is actually the Christ in glory. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was God incarnated. God was concealed in the physical body of the Lord Jesus. Inwardly, there was God, but outwardly there was the flesh, and this flesh had no glory. Before going to the cross, the Lord Jesus prayed, &ldquo;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You&rdquo; (John 17:1). In this prayer the Lord was praying that the Father would let Him enter into glory through death and resurrection. After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus said to the two disciples on the way to Emmaus, &ldquo;Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into His glory?&rdquo; (Luke 24:26). Therefore, for Christ to enter into His glory is to be in resurrection. The resurrection of Christ was His glorification.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Christ in glory is the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, the glory in 2 Corinthians 3:18 is in reality the life-giving Spirit. Through a process of gradual transformation, the more we live and walk in the life-giving Spirit, the more glory is added into our whole being, and the more we are transformed into His same image from glory to glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Even as from the Lord Spirit</h2>
<p>Finally, 2 Corinthians 3:18 says that transformation is &ldquo;from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; The word <em>from</em> denotes that the transformation proceeds from the Spirit rather than just being caused by Him. <em>The Lord Spirit</em> is a compound title like &ldquo;the Father God&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Lord Christ.&rdquo; This expression strongly proves and confirms that the Lord Christ is the Spirit and the Spirit is the Lord Christ. This Lord Spirit is the transforming Spirit carrying out a metabolic function in us, dispensing the divine life, nature, element, and essence into us and transforming us in our life, nature, essence, element, shape, expression, and in every aspect of our entire being. For this transformation, we need to live by the Spirit, walk by the Spirit, and walk according to the mingled spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25; Rom. 8:4b) so that Christ&rsquo;s divine life can correct us, transforming us into the image of Christ in glory. The Spirit with our spirit issues not only in a metabolic function within us but also in the divine life of Christ correcting our being and regulating our actions. This kind of regulating leads to inward transformation. Therefore, within us there is not only a metabolic function but also correction and regulation by the life of Christ. This results in our transformation, and we are being transformed into His same image from one degree of glory to another degree of glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The believers, in their continuous experience of God&rsquo;s redemption, need to experience and enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. The believers experience and enjoy the processed Triune God for their transformation which issues in our divine conformation to the image of Christ. This is through transformation by the Lord Spirit. Transformation is not outward correction or adjustment; rather, it is an inward metabolic change through the Lord Spirit, that is, the transforming Spirit, carrying out a metabolic function in us by adding the element of Christ&rsquo;s divine life into our entire being so that our being may be transformed and outwardly express the image of Christ.</p>
<p>To be transformed, we must remove the veil of our natural inward constitution by turning our heart to the Lord. Whenever we turn our heart to the Lord, the veil is taken away; then the Lord who is the Spirit frees us from the bondage of the letter of the law. With unveiled face, we also need to behold and reflect like a mirror the glory of the resurrected and ascended Lord. In this way, He may supply Himself with all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained as the new elements into us to replace and discharge the elements of our old natural life, and He may become our reality, making us one with Him and gradually transforming us by the renewing of our minds into the same image of the resurrected and ascended Christ.</p>
<p>Our being transformed into the same image as Christ is not a once-for-all matter; rather, it is continuous and gradual, involving transformation from one degree of glory into a higher degree of glory. This glory is the resurrected Christ who is now the life-giving Spirit. By living and walking in this Spirit, we receive the addition of glory into our entire being, transforming us more and more into the same image of Christ. Therefore, this transformation is from the Lord Spirit. For this transformation, we must live by the Spirit, walk by the Spirit, and walk according to the mingled spirit so that the divine life of Christ can regulate us, transforming us into Christ&rsquo;s image in glory.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will consider three matters related to transformation and then continue with the matter of being conformed to the image of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. By the Renewing of the Mind</h2>
<p>Human beings have three parts&mdash;spirit, soul, and body; therefore, God uses three steps to deal with us in His salvation: regeneration of our spirit, transformation of our soul, and transfiguration of our body. The Lord begins His salvation from the center by regenerating us in our spirit (John 3:6). When we receive Christ, the Spirit of the Lord enters into our spirit, dispensing Christ as life into our spirit to regenerate us. Through this divine operation, not only is our deadened spirit enlivened, but God&rsquo;s life with its divine nature is put into our spirit. As a result, a change in life begins from the center of our being. The Lord desires that this change in life would continue to spread into our soul so that our mind, emotion, and will would be transformed. Our spirit is regenerated, but our mind, emotion, and will still need to be transformed. Even though we have Christ as life in our spirit, we still need Christ in our soul. He needs to spread continually from our spirit to our soul until every part of our soul is transformed into His image. When this occurs, we will think as He thinks, love as He loves, and choose as He chooses. We will have the Lord&rsquo;s image in our practical living because our soul will be completely permeated by His divine element. Therefore, we need the renewing and the transformation of the soul.</p>
<p>Romans 12:2 says, &ldquo;Do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&rdquo; To be fashioned according to this age means to follow the modern fashion in our outward expression; to be transformed is to have an organic element wrought into our whole being to produce a metabolic change. We need to be transformed by the renewing of our mind.</p>
<p>The mind in Romans 12 is different from the mind in Romans 7 and 8. In Romans 7 the mind is individualistic, acting independently. In Romans 8 the mind is dependent, set on the spirit. However, the mind needs to be renewed in addition to being dependent. We need a renewed mind. This is not merely a matter of receiving outward teaching but a matter of the addition of Christ&rsquo;s element. When the Lord Jesus spreads from our spirit into our mind, our mind is renewed and our soul undergoes a metabolic change. In this way we experience the transformation of the soul.</p>
<p>We may be regenerated in our spirit and yet be old in our mind, emotion, and will. If our mind remains old, our soul will not be transformed, and we will remain unchanged in our mind, emotion, and will just like unbelievers. However, when our mind is renewed, our soul will be transformed.</p>
<p>When our mind is subject to the spirit, we are subject to Christ because Christ is in our spirit. This gives Him opportunity to spread from our spirit to our mind and also to permeate, fill, and renew our mind with Himself. Our soul is thus transformed by the renewing of the mind. Once the mind is renewed, the emotion and the will are subsequently renewed because the mind regulates the emotion and influences the will. When the mind is open to the Lord, the emotion and the will surely follow. If our mind is permeated and occupied by the Lord, the Lord will take over our emotion and occupy our will. This is the reason Romans 12:2 speaks of the transformation of the soul by the renewing of the mind.</p><h2 class="head2">H. In the Spirit of the Mind</h2>
<p>The believers are transformed gradually in the spirit of the mind (Eph. 4:23). Between Paul&rsquo;s word regarding putting off the old man and putting on the new man (vv. 22, 24), he inserts the thought of being renewed in the spirit of our mind. The putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man are accomplished facts; therefore, Ephesians 4:23 speaks of being renewed in the spirit of our mind. To be renewed is for our transformation to the image of Christ (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18). The spirit in Ephesians 4:23 is the believer&rsquo;s regenerated spirit mingled with the indwelling Spirit of God. This mingled spirit spreads into our mind, becoming the spirit of our mind. In this spirit we are renewed for our transformation. In this way our natural mind is conquered, subdued, and put under the spirit. This implies a process of metabolic transformation in which the mingled spirit enters our mind, takes over our mind, and becomes the spirit of our mind. When we are renewed in the spirit of our mind, we experience and realize the accomplished facts of the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man.</p>
<p>Being renewed in the spirit of our mind does not involve outward adjustment, correction, or improvement; rather, it is the result of a new element, the divine element, being wrought into us. For something to be renewed means that an old element has been replaced by a new element. Our spirit is indwelt by the living Christ as the renewing element to become a renewed spirit. When this spirit spreads into our mind, we are renewed in the spirit of our mind. The more we turn to the spirit of our mind and conduct ourselves in the spirit of our mind, the more our mind will be renewed. The old element is then replaced with a new element. The old element of Adam is discharged, and the new element of Christ is added, replacing the old. In this way, transformation takes place continuously in our mind and then in our emotion and will.</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. To Become Precious Materials&mdash;<br />
Gold, Silver, Precious Stones&mdash;<br />
for the Building Up of the Church</h2>
<p>The issue of the believers&rsquo; being transformed by the renewing of the mind is their becoming precious materials&mdash;gold, silver, and precious stones&mdash;for the building up of the church (1 Cor. 3:9-10, 12). In 1 Corinthians 3:12 Paul speaks of building &ldquo;upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones.&rdquo; Gold, silver, and precious stones signify the various experiences of Christ in the virtues and attributes of the Triune God. Gold signifies the divine nature of the Father with all its attributes, silver signifies the redeeming and life-secreting Christ with all the virtues and attributes of His person and work, and precious stones signify the transforming work of the Spirit with all its attributes. All these precious materials are products of our participation in and enjoyment of Christ in our spirit through the Holy Spirit. Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God. In terms of the Triune God, God the Father in His divine nature is gold, God the Son in His redeeming and life-secreting life is silver, and God the Spirit in His transforming work is precious stone.</p>
<p>Gold as a precious element signifies the nature of something that is unchanging and incorruptible. Gold remains the same from beginning to end. Therefore, in the Bible gold signifies the nature of God the Father. The divine nature, like gold, never changes.</p>
<p>Exodus 30 shows that silver was used to redeem the lives of God&rsquo;s people (vv. 11-16). Therefore, silver signifies the redemption accomplished by the second of the Trinity&mdash;Christ the Son. According to the New Testament, the redemption of Christ terminated us. When Christ died on the cross to redeem us, He terminated us. Whatever Christ terminates, He redeems and brings back to God. Therefore, being brought back to God comes after termination. Moreover, whatever Christ terminates and redeems, He replaces with Himself. Redemption, therefore, involves termination, being brought back to God, and being replaced by what Christ is.</p>
<p>Precious stones are transformed solid materials; they are transformed from other materials such as clay or carbon after passing through high temperature and pressure. Therefore, precious stones signify the transforming work of the Spirit. According to 2 Corinthians 3:18 we are being transformed by the Lord Spirit; this clearly indicates that transformation is the work of the Spirit.</p>
<p>In spiritual experience, precious stones are the totality of gold and silver. When we have the nature of God and the redemptive and life-secreting work of Christ, the result is the transformation of the Spirit. It is through the divine nature and the cross of Christ that the Spirit transforms us. To experience the transforming work of the Spirit is to experience a metabolic change through the divine life within us.</p>
<p>Through the process of transformation, we are constituted with the Triune God; that is, we are constituted with the nature of the Father, the redemption of the Son, and the transformation of the Spirit. When we take Him into us by eating Him and drinking Him, the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is transfused into us to become our element and essence. This causes a metabolic process to take place in us with the new element being added and the old element being discharged. This is transformation.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul tells us metaphorically that plants can become minerals by growth. This chapter points out that the church is God&rsquo;s cultivated land and that planting, watering, and growing will produce plants (vv. 6, 9); however, the proper materials for the building up of the church are gold, silver, and precious stones, all of which are minerals. Hence, the thought of transformation is implied. We need not only to grow in life but also to be transformed in life. As plants, we first grow in God&rsquo;s cultivated land and then are transformed into God&rsquo;s precious building materials for God&rsquo;s building.</p><h2 class="head1">II. BY BEING CONFORMED</h2>
<p>Transformation produces conformation (Rom. 8:29). Conformation is the completion of transformation. Transformation is inward, a matter of essence. Conformation is outward, a matter of shape. While transformation involves a change in shape, conformation further involves molding this shape into a specific image, the image of Christ. Our being transformed means that there is some change in shape. Our being conformed means that our shape has been changed into the image of Christ.</p>
<p>Sanctification, transformation, and conformation cannot be separated. The Lord is sanctifying us and transforming us so that we may be conformed to the image of Christ, the firstborn Son of God, and so that we may be the same as He is in life, nature, and image as His expression, but not have any part in His Godhead.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. To the Image<br />
of God&rsquo;s Firstborn Son</h2>
<p>The believers also are gradually being conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. Romans 8:29 tells us, &ldquo;Those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers.&rdquo; Therefore, we are conformed not merely to the image of the Son of God but to the image of the firstborn Son of God.</p>
<p>There are two aspects to the divine sonship of Christ: the aspect of being the only begotten Son and that of being the firstborn Son. As the only begotten Son, Christ is unique, but as the firstborn Son of God, Christ is the first One among many brothers. Romans 8:29 indicates that we are being conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. From eternity He was the only begotten Son of God (John 1:18; 3:16). After incarnation, through resurrection He was begotten by God in His humanity to be God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. This is the second birth of Christ. When Christ was born of Mary, He was born to be a man; His humanity had nothing to do with the sonship of God; He was the Son of Man, not the Son of God. Hence, the human part of the Lord Jesus needed to be begotten into the divine sonship through resurrection. Psalm 2:7 prophesies concerning this matter: &ldquo;You are My Son; / Today I have begotten You.&rdquo; Acts 13:33, quoting Psalm 2:7, indicates that Christ was begotten as the Son of God on the day of resurrection. In terms of His divinity, He did not need to be begotten to be the Son of God, but in terms of His humanity, He needed to be begotten through resurrection. On the day of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, His crucified humanity was enlivened by the Spirit of His divinity and uplifted into the sonship of the only begotten Son of God. This is to be born through resurrection. Thus, in resurrection Christ was born as God&rsquo;s firstborn Son.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s being the Firstborn implies that He has many brothers and that He is the Firstborn among the brothers. The birth through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection consisted not only of an individual birth but also of a corporate birth; this corporate entity includes God&rsquo;s firstborn Son and the believers as His many brothers. This means that in one birth, one delivery, God&rsquo;s many sons were born. All of God&rsquo;s chosen people were born together with Christ in His resurrection. When Christ was resurrected, we were regenerated (1 Pet. 1:3). We were all born through this one universal delivery. In the resurrection of Christ, innumerable sons of God were born as the many brothers of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son.</p>
<p>Romans 1:3-4 says, &ldquo;Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo; In this portion of the Bible, Christ, the Son of God, is the prototype; in Romans 8:29 the many brothers are the mass production of this prototype. In 1:4 the Son was designated, but in 8:29 the many sons are conformed. The designation of the Son is related to the prototype; the conformation of the many sons is the working out of a mass reproduction. God has the Firstborn as the prototype, and now He wants a mass production to obtain many sons who have the image of the Firstborn. Ultimately, the believers are conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son, Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">B. According to God&rsquo;s Predestination</h2>
<p>Romans 8:29 tells us that God predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son. We are persons who have been called and justified (v. 30); our destiny has already been determined by God. Before the creation of the world God predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son. This means that to be conformed to the image of Christ is our destiny and also our goal. Our destiny is not to go to heaven but to be conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son.</p>
<p>We have already been predestinated to be conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son so that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers. God&rsquo;s purpose is to produce many brothers of His firstborn Son for His expression. When Christ was the only begotten Son, He was unique, but God desired to have many sons who would be the many brothers of His Son. In this way the only begotten Son of God becomes the Firstborn among many brothers. He is the firstborn Son. According to God&rsquo;s predestination, we are the many sons being conformed to the image of the Firstborn. God&rsquo;s purpose is that we would express Him in a corporate way. Therefore, for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s purpose, He predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. To Become the Many Brothers<br />
of God&rsquo;s Firstborn Son<br />
through the Process of Maturing</h2>
<p>Those who are being conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son are the believers who are passing through the process of maturing to become the many brothers of the Firstborn. We are now in the process of maturing, that is, in the process of transformation and conformation. When this process is accomplished, we will reach maturity. Therefore, maturity is the full completion of the process of transformation for conformation.</p>
<p>Presently we are in the process of being conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. This conformation is reached through transformation. The more we are transformed, the more we are conformed. The metabolic process of transformation produces conformation.</p>
<p>Through the processes of transformation and conformation we are becoming more and more like Christ, our elder Brother. He has the divine nature and the human nature; as His many brothers, we have the human nature and the divine nature. Just as Hebrews 2:11 says, &ldquo;Both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers.&rdquo; He who sanctifies is Christ as the firstborn Son of God, and those who are being sanctified are the believers in Christ as the many sons of God. To say that He and we are &ldquo;all of One&rdquo; refers to the Father as the source. Both the firstborn Son and His many sons are born of the same Father in resurrection. Therefore, the firstborn Son and the many sons have one source, one life, one nature, and one essence. Because both He, the firstborn Son, and we, the many sons, are the same in the divine life and nature, He is not ashamed to call us brothers. As His many brothers, we are now in the process of reaching maturity.</p>
<p>This process of maturing includes the believers&rsquo; experience of the divine life. Conformation actually reveals the molding of life. When the divine life grows in us and transforms us, it conforms us to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. We do not have to endeavor to conform ourselves into the image of Christ; this kind of self-effort is useless. We only need to let the divine life grow in us, sanctify us, transform us, and mold us in order to experience more fully the divine life with its essence, power, law, and shape. In this way through the all-inclusive function of the divine life, we are gradually conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The conformation of the believers into the image of Christ is through the renewing of the mind. When we are regenerated, the Spirit of the Lord enters into our spirit, dispensing Christ into our spirit as life. The Lord desires that this change in life would continue to spread into our soul, transforming our mind, emotion, and will. The transformation of the soul is by the renewing of the mind; if our mind is renewed, our soul will be transformed. Therefore, the believers need to be gradually transformed in the spirit of the mind. Being renewed in the spirit of the mind is the result of the divine element being wrought into us, discharging the old element of Adam and adding the new element of Christ, thus issuing in a continuous transformation in our mind and subsequently in our emotion and our will.</p>
<p>Through transformation by the renewing of the mind, we become precious materials&mdash;gold, silver, and precious stones. Gold signifies the nature of God the Father, which is unchanging like gold; silver signifies the redemption accomplished by Christ which includes termination, being brought back to God, and being replaced by what Christ is; precious stones signify the work of the Spirit, transforming us metabolically through the divine life and the cross of Christ to make us grow in life for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>Transformation produces conformation; conformation is the consummation of transformation. Transformation is a matter of inward essence. Conformation is a matter of outward shape, causing us to be the same in life, nature, and image as the firstborn Son, Christ, to express Him but not to have any part in His Godhead. Conformation is to be conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. In resurrection Christ was begotten to be God&rsquo;s firstborn Son, and we were also regenerated to be the many sons of God, that is, the many brothers of Christ. As the firstborn Son of God, Christ is the prototype; as the many sons, the believers are molded into the image of Christ, God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. This conformation is according to God&rsquo;s predestination so that He may have a corporate expression.</p>
<p>We are now in the process of transformation, conformation, and maturing to be the many brothers of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. Through the process of transformation and conformation, we become more and more like Christ, our elder Brother, having both the human nature and the divine nature. This process of maturing involves our experience of the divine life and the transformation through the divine life which conforms us to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. Therefore, we need to let the divine life grow in us to sanctify, transform, and conform us until we are gradually conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Now we want to see how the believers, by being conformed to the death of Christ, experience and enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. BEING CONFORMED TO CHRIST&rsquo;S DEATH</h2>
<p>Philippians 3:10 speaks of being conformed to the death of Christ, indicating that we must take Christ&rsquo;s death as the mold for our living. The mold of Christ&rsquo;s death refers to Christ&rsquo;s putting His human life to death continuously so that He might live by His divine life. Today Christ&rsquo;s death is a mold, and we are being conformed to the shape of this mold. When our human living is conformed to the shape of this mold, we are dead to our human life yet live God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Unless we are conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death, we cannot be conformed to the image of Christ. Christ&rsquo;s death is the mold in which we are being conformed to His image, the image of the firstborn Son of God. As we experience the process of transformation and conformation, we are being conformed to the death of Christ.</p>
<p>The death of Christ was present in Him throughout His whole life. As He was living, He was also dying. Every day He was being molded by the cross, even when He was a child living in the home of a carpenter in Nazareth. He was continuously being crossed out by His mother, by His brothers, and by His disciples. When He told His disciples that He would suffer and be crucified, they had no ears to hear. Day after day Christ died to the old creation so that He might live in the new creation.</p>
<p>Being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death should be our daily experience as believers. The more our natural life is put to death, the more the divine life in us will be released. Then in our experience we will be conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Bearing the Cross</h2>
<p>In Matthew 16:24 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.&rdquo; The cross is not merely a suffering; it is primarily a killing. It kills and terminates the criminal. Christ bore the cross and then was crucified. As He was bearing the cross, He was under a killing rather than a suffering. The believers in Christ are crucified with Him and then bear the cross. Bearing the cross means to remain in the killing of the death of Christ for the terminating of our self, natural life, and old man.</p>
<p>Many Christians have a mistaken concept of the cross, thinking that the cross is related to suffering. Associating the cross merely to suffering, however, is wrong. In Matthew 16:24 the cross does not denote suffering but killing. The ultimate purpose of the cross is not to make us suffer; it is to terminate us, to kill us. The Lord&rsquo;s word does not include the concept of suffering but rather of killing.</p>
<p>To bear the cross means to remain on the cross. All who have experienced the cross agree that one who bears the cross cannot be separated from the cross. A person who bears the cross is one with the cross; he cannot be separated from the cross.</p>
<p>For us to bear the cross, we must realize that we have already been crucified. We have been crucified together with Christ on the cross; our own life, the natural life, the old man, and our entire being have been killed. Now we must remain under the killing. This is the meaning of bearing the cross.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Identified with the Crucified Christ</h2>
<p>Bearing the cross means to be identified with the crucified Christ. Christ passed through death by being crucified; we must be one with Him. This involves our being identified with the crucified Christ, not with the glorified Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Remaining in the Death of Christ</h2>
<p>The meaning of bearing the cross is that we bear about in our body the death of Christ, allowing the death of Christ to work continuously on us for the putting to death of our self. To bear the cross is also to remain in the death of Christ. The death of Christ is our destiny and our goal. If we want to be transformed and conformed to the image of Christ the Firstborn, we need to remain in His death, taking His death as our dwelling place. Hence, the meaning of bearing the cross is to join ourselves to the crucified Christ and remain with Him in His death. If we do not remain in Christ&rsquo;s death, we are forsaking His cross; if we remain in His death, we are bearing the cross. This is to be conformed to the death of Christ.</p>
<p>We need to have a clear vision: to bear the cross is not to suffer but rather to keep ourselves under the termination of death. The cross of Christ is a terminating death; as those who bear the cross, we keep ourselves under Christ&rsquo;s termination. By the Lord&rsquo;s grace we should remain in the place of termination our whole life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Old Man Having Been Crucified</h2>
<p>Not only do we bear the cross, identifying ourselves with the crucified Christ and remaining in His death, we also need to realize that our old man has been crucified. Romans 6:6 says, &ldquo;Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves.&rdquo; Having been baptized into Christ, we are now in Christ. As we are in Him, whatever He has passed through has become our history. He has been crucified, and His crucifixion is our crucifixion. This is a glorious fact. We need to see this vision&mdash;we are in Him, and we were crucified together with Him. God has accomplished the glorious fact of putting us into Christ; our old man has been crucified with Him.</p>
<p>The knowing in Romans 6:6 is actually the seeing of a fact in a spiritual vision. Such a vision is basic to our knowing. After we see a certain thing, we can never say that we do not know it. Thus, if we have a clear vision concerning the fact that our old man has been crucified with Christ, we know this in reality. We should not be content with a mere doctrinal understanding; we need to clearly see in our spirit the divine fact that our old man has been crucified with Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Body of Sin Being Annulled<br />
and No Longer Serving Sin as Slaves</h2>
<p>Because our old man has been crucified, our body of sin has been annulled. Knowing that our old man has been crucified with Christ, the body that had been utilized by the old man as the instrument of sinning has nothing to do; it is unemployed, jobless.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being Justified from Sin</h2>
<p>Romans 6:7 continues, &ldquo;For he who has died is justified from sin.&rdquo; To be justified from sin is to be cleared, released, and freed from sin. When we are justified from sin, we no longer owe sin any debt or have any obligation toward sin.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Crucifying the Flesh<br />
with Its Passions and Lusts</h2>
<p>Galatians 5:24 says, &ldquo;They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts.&rdquo; &ldquo;They who are of Christ Jesus&rdquo; are those who have believed into Christ and have been baptized into Christ; therefore, they belong to Christ. As saved ones, we are now of Christ.</p>
<p>According to Paul&rsquo;s word, those who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh. The crucifixion of the old man in Romans 6:6 is not accomplished by us. But these verses say that we have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts. The old man is our being; the flesh is the expression of our being in our practical living. The crucifixion of our old man is a fact accomplished by Christ on the cross, but the crucifying of our flesh with its passions and lusts is our practical experience of this fact. Through Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion we have been crucified with Christ. This enables us to crucify our flesh with its passions and lusts. In other words, our having been crucified with Christ enables us to crucify our flesh. Our crucifying the flesh is based upon the fact that our old man has been crucified with Christ.</p>
<p>We need to have a clear understanding concerning the old man and the flesh. We do not need to deal with the old man, because the old man has been crucified with Christ. However, day by day we need to crucify our flesh. The problems in our daily life do not come from the old man; rather, they come from the flesh with its passions and lusts. Therefore, based upon the fact that our old man has been dealt with by the death of Christ, we need to practically crucify our flesh.</p>
<p>It is very important to see the difference between Romans 6:6 and Galatians 5:24. We cannot crucify the old man, but we can crucify the flesh. The crucifixion of the old man has been accomplished by Christ, but the crucifixion of the flesh must be executed by us. In speaking about the crucifixion of the flesh, Galatians 5 uses the perfect tense. It does not say that we are crucifying the flesh or that we shall crucify it but that we have crucified it. There are two aspects to crucifixion. The first aspect involves the crucifixion of the old man when Christ was crucified. The second aspect involves our crucifixion of our flesh. Based upon the fact that Christ has crucified our old man, we have crucified the flesh. The second aspect&mdash;our crucifying the flesh&mdash;is the application of the first aspect&mdash;Christ&rsquo;s crucifying of the old man. In our experience we need to apply the crucifixion of Christ to our flesh. The use of the perfect tense to describe this indicates that the crucifixion of our flesh should be the normal experience of the believers. All believers should apply Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion to their flesh. If we have never crucified our flesh, then our experience is abnormal. If our experience is normal, we who belong to Christ should have crucified the flesh.</p><h2 class="head3">1. By the Spirit</h2>
<p>It is by the Spirit that we put to death the flesh (Gal. 5:16). The cross of Christ gives us the standing or the basis to deal with the flesh. We not only have a base objectively, but we also have the Spirit subjectively to enable us to execute the cross of Christ upon our flesh. If we apply the cross to our flesh by the indwelling Spirit, our flesh will be nailed to the cross. This is to crucify our flesh. When the flesh is on the cross, only the Spirit remains, and we experience the Spirit as everything to us. In this way, we walk by the Spirit and are led by the Spirit. The more we experience the Spirit, the more we are transformed and conformed to the image of Christ, God&rsquo;s firstborn Son.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Practically Experiencing the Death of Christ</h2>
<p>To crucify the flesh by the Spirit is to experience the death of Christ practically and not to live habitually according to the flesh. If we would be conformed to the death of Christ and thus conformed to His image, we should not live according to our habits. We always need to be alert related to our habits because we are accustomed to living by the flesh. We need to reject and forsake our habits and live according to the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Putting to Death the Practices of the Body</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. By the Spirit</h2>
<p>Romans 8:13 says, &ldquo;If you live according to the flesh, you must die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.&rdquo; If we live according to the flesh, we will die spiritually. However, if by the Spirit we put to death the practices of the body (that is, to restrain or crucify them), we will live in spirit.</p>
<p>Romans 8:13 corresponds to Romans 8:6. To live according to the flesh is mainly to set the mind on the flesh; to put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit requires setting the mind on the spirit and walking according to the spirit. When we set our mind on the spirit, our flesh is put to death. Hence, by setting the mind on the spirit, we put to death the practices of the body.</p>
<p>We have the genuine experience of the crucifixion with Christ in our putting to death the practices of the body by the Spirit. This does not happen once for all; it is a daily exercise. Every practice of the body must be put to death by turning our mind to the spirit and setting it on the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Not Living Habitually according to the Flesh</h2>
<p>To put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit means that we do not live habitually according to the flesh. This requires the exercise of our will to cooperate with God. We need to determine resolutely to stand on the Lord&rsquo;s side and be conformed to His death by forsaking all the habits in our natural life so that we no longer live habitually according to the flesh. This is to put to death the practices of the body.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Denying the Self</h2>
<p>Matthew 16:24-25 speaks of denying the self. The self is the soul-life with its emphasis on man&rsquo;s thoughts and opinions. The self, soul-life, and opinion are three aspects of one thing. The essence of the self is the soul-life; the expression of the self is the opinion. The soul-life is lived out through the self, and the self is expressed through the mind. What the mind thinks or considers is an opinion, idea, or concept. The mind&rsquo;s opinion, idea, or concept is the expression of the self, the embodiment of the soul-life. Since opinion is the expression of the self, we need to deny ourselves by applying the cross to our opinion.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Experiencing the Death of Christ</h2>
<p>We deny the self by subjectively experiencing the death of Christ. There are three steps to the experience of the cross of Christ: first, the accomplishment by Christ of the objective fact that our old man has been crucified; second, our acknowledgment, acceptance, and application of this fact; and third, our continual subjective experience of this fact.</p>
<p>In the dealing with the self, there is an objective fact that our old man, which includes the self, has been crucified with Christ. We subjectively experience this fact by the Spirit, allowing the Spirit to execute the death of the cross on our opinion and to put it to death. This is the subjective experience of dealing with the self.</p>
<p>In order to deny the self, we need to see the divine revelation that our old man has been crucified with Christ. Then we need to see that our natural opinion is the expression of the old man. Once we know that our old man has been crucified and understand that our opinion is the expression of the old man, we can apply the death of Christ by the Spirit to our opinion. This is the denying of the self spoken of by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 16:24.</p>
<p>The real experience of denying the self takes place in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. We may understand that the old man has been crucified and also know that our opinion is the expression of the self, but if we are not living in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, we have only empty doctrine which cannot render us any real spiritual experience. When we live in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, our seeing will be real, and our experience will be real. Therefore, if we desire to continually live in the experience of denying the self, we need to live in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit and let the Holy Spirit apply the crucifixion of Christ to our expression of the self. This is the reality of denying the self through the subjective experience of the death of Christ by the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Not Living in the &ldquo;I&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The believers deny the self by not living in their &ldquo;I.&rdquo; The old man in Romans 6:6 refers to our created and fallen being; the &ldquo;I&rdquo; in Galatians 2:20 is what the old man calls itself. The old man is the &ldquo;I&rdquo;; the &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the old man. Galatians 2:20 says that this &ldquo;I&rdquo; has been crucified with Christ; Romans 6:6 shows that the &ldquo;I,&rdquo; who has been crucified, is the old man. When we see that our old man has been crucified with Christ, we are able to deny the self by not living in the &ldquo;I.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Losing the Soul-life</h2>
<p>The believers are conformed to the death of Christ by losing their soul-life. In Matthew 16:25 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.&rdquo; To save the soul-life is to allow the soul to have its enjoyment in the present life and not to suffer; to lose the soul-life is to cause the soul to lose its enjoyment and thereby to suffer. In following the Lord, we should not save our soul-life, that is, let the soul have its enjoyment. If we save our soul-life in this age, we will lose it in the coming age, that is, lose the enjoyment of the soul and thereby suffer. But if we lose our soul-life for Christ&rsquo;s sake, in the enjoyment of the coming age of the kingdom we shall gain the soul-life, that is, gain the enjoyment of the soul and moreover share the joy of the Lord in ruling over the earth (25:21, 23).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Reality of Denying the Self<br />
and Taking Up the Cross</h2>
<p>Losing the soul is the reality of denying the self and taking up the cross. The soul-life is expressed bodily in the self. To deny our self is to lose our soul-life. To take up the cross is to put to death the self, to put to death the soul-life. To identify ourselves with Christ in His death is to take up the cross; therefore, to take up the cross is also to lose our soul-life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Experiencing the Death of Christ</h2>
<p>To lose the soul-life is to experience the death of Christ. We have been crucified with Christ, terminated with Him. Therefore, after being organically united with Him through faith, we should remain on the cross, keeping our old man under the termination of the cross (Rom. 6:3; Col. 2:20). This is to participate in the crucifixion of Christ. When we remain in His crucifixion, subjectively experiencing the death of Christ, we lose our soul-life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Not Living in the Natural Life</h2>
<p>To lose the soul is to no longer live in our natural life. The soul is very much related to the natural life. The natural life is dealt with through the loss of the soul. Everything of the natural life and its habits must be forsaken. When our natural life is put to death, we lose our soul.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Hating Father, Mother, Wife,<br />
Children, Brothers, Sisters, and the Soul-life&mdash;<br />
Not Loving These above the Lord</h2>
<p>For the believers to lose their soul is for them to hate their father, mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters, and even their own self, that is, not to love these above the Lord. In Matthew 10:37 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me.&rdquo; Our love for the Lord must be absolute; we should love nothing above Him. He is the One most worthy of our love, and we must be worthy of Him. In Luke 14:26 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and moreover, even his own soul-life, he cannot be My disciple.&rdquo; According to the Lord&rsquo;s word here, we should hate those whom we love, not those whom we do not love. We should especially hate ourselves, even our soul-life. When we love ourselves, mainly we love our soul rather than our spirit or body. The Lord clearly says that if we do not hate our soul-life, we cannot be His disciple. The real proof of our seeking the Lord is whether we hate our own soul-life.</p><h2 class="head3">5. Saving the Soul</h2>
<p>To lose our soul in this age is to save our soul in the coming age. When the Lord Jesus returns, He will exercise judgment upon all His believers to determine whether or not they will receive dispensational punishment. To save the soul is to be saved from dispensational punishment in the coming age and to participate in the joy of the Lord; to lose the soul is to undergo dispensational punishment in the coming age.</p>
<p>First Peter 1:9 says, &ldquo;Receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls.&rdquo; This salvation is the full salvation in three stages: the initial stage, the progressing stage, and the completing stage. Our spirit was saved through regeneration (John 3:5-6). Our body must wait for the Lord&rsquo;s return in order to be saved and redeemed through transfiguration (Phil. 3:21; Rom. 8:23). Whether we save or gain our soul at the Lord&rsquo;s appearing depends on how we deal with our soul in following the Lord after being saved and regenerated. If we are willing to deny our soul, that is, our soul-life with all its pleasures in this age, we will gain the soul in the enjoyment of the Lord in the coming age (Matt. 10:37-39; 16:24-27; Luke 17:30-33; John 12:25).</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Having Died with Christ<br />
from the Elements of the World</h2>
<p>We, who are gradually being conformed to the death of Christ, have been crucified with Christ from the elements of the world, the worldly ordinances which are according to the teachings of men. Every religion has its ordinances, regulations, rules, and laws. These are the religious ordinances taught by men. In Christ we have died to all these matters.</p>
<p>In Colossians 2:20-22 the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances; do not handle, nor taste, nor touch (regarding things which are all to perish when used) according to the commandments and teachings of men?&rdquo; The elements of the world include Jewish observances, heathen ordinances, and philosophy; they also include gnosticism, asceticism, and mysticism. The elements of the world are the elementary principles of worldly society, the rudimentary principles invented by mankind and practiced in society. With Christ we have died to these elements of the world. When Christ was crucified, we were crucified as well. In His crucifixion we were released from the elementary principles of the world.</p>
<p>For us to be conformed to the death of Christ, we need to bear the cross, accept the fact that the old man has been crucified, crucify the flesh with its passions and lusts, put to death the practices of the body, deny the self, lose the soul, and also experience dying with Christ to be freed from the elements of the world. Here are six negative things that must be dealt with: the old man, the body of sin, the flesh with its passions and lusts, the practices of the body, the self, and the soul (the natural life). None of these can remain in the mold of Christ&rsquo;s death, because the death of Christ cuts off, kills, and annuls them. Therefore, in the mold of Christ&rsquo;s death no trace of these six things can be found. In actuality, to be conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death is to deal with these six negative things. The more these things are dealt with, the more we are conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death and the more we are conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. God&rsquo;s Firstborn has the human nature, but He does not have the old man, the body of sin, the flesh with its passions and lusts, the practices of the body, the self, or the soul (natural life). To be conformed to the image of Christ, we must be dealt with by the cross to be conformed to the death of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The believers, by being conformed to the death of Christ, experience and enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation. To be conformed to the death of Christ denotes that the believers need to take Christ&rsquo;s death as a mold for their living. The mold of Christ&rsquo;s death refers to His putting to death His human life continuously so that He might live by the life of God. Unless the believers are conformed to the death of Christ, they cannot be conformed to the image of Christ. Therefore, when the believers experience the process of transformation and conformation, they are being conformed to the death of Christ. The death of Christ was present in Him throughout His entire life; therefore, the believers also must daily experience being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Our conformation to Christ&rsquo;s death is by taking up the cross and staying under the killing of the cross so as to be identified with the crucified Christ and to remain in the death of Christ. We must also realize that our old man has been crucified with Christ, that the body of sin has been annulled, and that we no longer serve sin as slaves. On the basis of the old man having been crucified, we need to apply the cross of Christ to our flesh by the Spirit, crucifying our flesh with its passions and lusts, thus practically experiencing the death of Christ and being led by the Spirit, walking by the Spirit, to be transformed and conformed to the image of Christ, God&rsquo;s firstborn Son.</p>
<p>To be conformed to the death of Christ, we need to put to death by the Spirit the practices of the body, that is, to turn our mind to the spirit and set our mind on the spirit, putting to death all kinds of practices of the body and not living habitually according to the flesh. We also need to deny the self, that is, our soul-life, our human thoughts and opinions, and through the application of the cross, we need to experience the death of Christ and not live in our &ldquo;I&rdquo; but live only in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit to be conformed to the death of Christ.</p>
<p>We are also conformed to the death of Christ through losing our soul. This is the reality of denying the self and bearing the cross, causing us to experience the death of Christ and not live in our natural life so that our love would be absolute for the Lord. Ultimately, this is to save our soul, that is, to gain the salvation of our soul, the gaining of our soul in the enjoyment of the Lord in the coming age. Finally, being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death is to die with Christ from the elements of the world, that is, to be freed from the worldly ordinances according to the teachings of men. Being conformed to the death of Christ deals with all these items.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>We have seen how the believers experience and enjoy the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by being transformed, by being conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son, and by being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death. In this lesson we will look at other aspects of the enjoyment of the divine dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. BY ENTERING THE HOLY OF HOLIES</h2>
<p>When the believers are conformed to the death of Christ, they are freed from many negative matters, including the old man, the flesh with its passions and its lusts, the practices of the body, the self, and the soul-life. The more the believers are freed from these things, the more they can go forward positively, passing through the outer veil and the inner veil to enter into the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:19 says, &ldquo;Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus.&rdquo; The Holy of Holies today is in heaven, where the Lord Jesus is (9:12, 24). Although we are still on earth, we can enter into the Holy of Holies. The secret is our spirit, which is referred to in Hebrews 4:12. The very Christ who is in heaven is also in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). As the heavenly ladder (Gen. 28:12; John 1:51), He joins our spirit to heaven and brings heaven into our spirit. Hence, when we turn to our spirit, we enter into the Holy of Holies where we meet with God who is on the throne of grace.</p>
<p>After showing us the heavenly Christ who is within the veil, the book of Hebrews encourages us to enter within the veil (10:22; 6:19), where we can look away unto Him (12:2), consider Him (v. 3; 3:1), and enjoy direct contact with Him. Since He is within the veil, we need to enter within the veil so that we may see Him and consider Him to receive His infusion. When we turn to our spirit and exercise our spirit, we enter within the veil. There we participate in Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry and are saturated and permeated with the divine riches to make us the corporate reproduction of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son for His expression.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. In the Blood of Jesus</h2>
<p>Hebrews 10:19 says us that we have boldness to enter into the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus. It is a tremendous thing to enter the Holy of Holies because the very God is sitting there on the throne of grace. In order to enter into such a place, we must have boldness, which we have by Christ&rsquo;s death and His blood. In the blood of Jesus we have boldness to enter into the Holy of Holies at any time, unlike the high priest in the Old Testament, who could enter only once a year.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Through a New and Living Way<br />
Initiated through the Rent Veil</h2>
<p>Hebrews 10:20 indicates that we enter into the Holy of Holies through &ldquo;a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh.&rdquo; The way into the Holy of Holies has been initiated. According to the Greek, the word <em>new</em> in this verse means &ldquo;recently opened.&rdquo; Through Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross, the way has been &ldquo;recently opened&rdquo; for us. The veil here is the second veil of the tabernacle (9:3). This veil, typifying the flesh of Christ, signifies the old creation, including us. On the veil were cherubim (Exo. 26:31), which signify the creatures (Ezek. 10:15). When the veil was rent, the cherubim were also rent, signifying that when the flesh of Christ, typified by the veil, was crucified, all the creatures also were crucified. According to Matthew 27:51, when the Lord Jesus died, the veil was rent from top to bottom, meaning that it was not rent by anyone on earth but by God above the heavens. The old creation has been slain, and a new and living way to enter into the Holy of Holies has been initiated. Through the rent veil of the flesh and in the blood of Jesus, we can enter into the Holy of Holies to contact God for our enjoyment. Not only so, the rent veil also implies that our old man was crucified with Christ (Rom. 6:6), giving us an open way to contact and enjoy God in our spirit as our life and life supply.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament age, only the high priest could enter into the Holy of Holies. He brought in the blood of the sin offering once a year and sprinkled it on the propitiation cover. That was the old way. Hebrews 10 indicates that in the New Testament age there is a new way into the Holy of Holies. This new way is not only for the high priest but for all believers; it is not by the blood of bulls and goats but through the blood of Jesus; it is not through a veil that has not been rent but through a veil that has been rent. Today we can go through the rent veil, enter the Holy of Holies, and come directly before the throne of grace.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Coming Forward to the Throne of Grace<br />
within the Veil to Receive Mercy and Find Grace from the Ascended Christ in the Heavens</h2>
<p>When we enter into the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus through a new and living way, we come forward to the throne of grace within the veil to receive mercy and find grace from the ascended Christ who is in the heavens (4:14, 16; 6:19-20). Hebrews 4:16 says, &ldquo;Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help.&rdquo; The throne of grace is undoubtedly the throne of God that is in heaven (Rev. 4:2). The throne of God is a throne of authority to the whole universe on which God sits to control and rule over the universe (Dan. 7:9; Rev. 5:1). It is the throne of God&rsquo;s administration, but to us, the believers, it is the throne of grace, signified by the propitiation cover or mercy seat over the Ark of the Testimony in the Holy of Holies sprinkled with the blood of Christ (Rom. 3:25; Exo. 25:17, 21; Heb. 9:3, 5, 12; Lev. 16:15). It is here that God meets and communes with His people (Exo. 25:21-22).</p>
<p>Our spirit today is the dwelling place of God (Eph. 2:22); it is the gate of heaven where Christ as the ladder joins us on earth to heaven and brings heaven to us on earth. Whenever we turn to the spirit, we enter into the gate of heaven and touch the throne of grace in heaven through Christ the heavenly ladder. It takes no time to enter into the Holy of Holies because there is no distance between it and our spirit. In the Holy of Holies, we can touch the throne of grace, which is Christ as the propitiation place; this propitiation place covers the demands of the Ten Commandments and satisfies the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory. To the believers this propitiation place is the throne of God and of the Lamb (Rev. 22:1).</p>
<p>When we come forward to the throne of grace, we receive mercy and find grace for timely help. Both God&rsquo;s mercy and God&rsquo;s grace are the expression of His love. When we are in a pitiful condition, His mercy reaches us and brings us into a situation where God is able to favor us with His grace. Luke 15:20-24 tells us that when the father saw the prodigal son returning, he had compassion on him; this mercy expressed the father&rsquo;s love. Then the father clothed him with the best robe and fed him with the fattened calf; this grace manifested the father&rsquo;s love. God&rsquo;s mercy reaches farther and bridges the gap between us and God&rsquo;s grace. Quite often, due to our pitiful condition, we need to receive mercy and then find grace.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s mercy and grace are always available to us. However, we need to receive mercy and find grace by exercising our spirit to come forward to the throne of grace and to touch our High Priest, who sympathizes with us in all our weaknesses. We need to come forward and open up our whole being to receive mercy and find grace for timely help. The help that comes from this grace is always timely, fitting our situation and need. According to the book of Hebrews, the real Christian life is one of coming forward to the throne of grace continually to receive mercy and find grace for timely help.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. BY FOLLOWING JESUS</h2>
<p>For the divine conformation, the believers enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation not only by entering the Holy of Holies but also by following Jesus.</p>
<p>In John 21:19, after the Lord Jesus told Peter how he would die to glorify God, He said to him, &ldquo;Follow Me.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus wanted Peter to follow Him as the indwelling One. The One we are to follow is inside of us. Verse 18 also points out that we must not follow the Lord according to our own ideas but according to His leading. Our following Him, even unto death, glorifies God. Furthermore, we must follow Him without paying attention to others. After the Lord told Peter to follow Him, Peter referred to John and said to Jesus, &ldquo;Lord, and what about this man?&rdquo; (v. 21). To this, the Lord replied, &ldquo;If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me&rdquo; (v. 22). The Lord was telling Peter that what would happen to John was none of his concern; he must follow the Lord and not pay attention to others.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Going outside the Camp</h2>
<p>Hebrews 13:13 indicates that the believers are to go outside the camp to follow Jesus: &ldquo;Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.&rdquo; In the book of Hebrews and in typology, the camp signifies the organization of religion, which is human and earthly. To go outside the camp means to go outside the human organization of religion. While the camp signifies human organization, the city signifies the earthly realm (v. 14). In the book of Hebrews, both the gate (v. 12) and the camp signify the Jewish religion with its earthly and human aspects. Judaism is both earthly and human. Every religion is both a human organization and an earthly realm that keeps people away from God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Any religion that rejects the Lord&mdash;Judaism, Catholicism, or Protestantism&mdash;is a camp, a human organization, given up by the Lord.</p>
<p>The book of Hebrews instructs and charges us to come forward to the Holy of Holies and to enter within the veil. A new and living way into the Holy of Holies has been initiated. Hence, this book ushers us into the Holy of Holies and then directs us to go outside the camp. Everyone who has gone outside the camp has experienced what is within the veil. No one goes outside the camp and then enters within the veil. Only the Lord Jesus went outside the camp and then entered within the veil. It is exactly the opposite with us; we enter into the Holy of Holies, where we are strengthened and encouraged, and then we go outside the camp, leaving the religious organizations. The more we enter within the veil, the more we go outside the camp.</p>
<p><em>Enter within the veil</em> and <em>go outside the camp</em> are important and very meaningful phrases in the book of Hebrews. On the one hand, we enjoy Christ within the veil; on the other hand, we follow Jesus outside the camp. The goal and ultimate consummation of this book is that we would all enter within the veil and go outside the camp.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Bearing His Reproach</h2>
<p>Hebrews 13:13 indicates that we are to go forth unto Jesus outside the camp, bearing His reproach. To enter within the veil is to enter the Holy of Holies where the Lord is enthroned in glory; to go outside the camp is to come out of religion where the Lord was cast out in rejection. This signifies that we must be in our spirit and must go outside of religion. The more we are in our spirit, enjoying the heavenly Christ, the more we will be outside the camp of religion, following the suffering Jesus. Being in our spirit and enjoying the glorified Christ enable us to go outside the camp of religion to follow the rejected Jesus. The more we are in our spirit contacting this heavenly Christ in glory, the more we will go outside the camp of religion to be with the lowly Jesus in His suffering. To contact Christ in the heavens, enjoying His glorification, energizes us to take the narrow pathway of the cross on the earth and to bear the reproach of Jesus.</p>
<p>The book of Hebrews gives us a clear vision of the heavenly Christ and the heavenly Holy of Holies, and it shows how to walk the pathway of the cross on the earth, that is, to go forth unto Jesus outside the camp, outside religion, bearing His reproach. To go forth unto Jesus outside the camp, bearing His reproach, is to take the pathway of the cross.</p>
<p>When we enter within the veil by getting into our spirit, we taste the sweetness of the heavenly Christ that we may be enabled to go outside the camp, forsaking the earth and the earthly love. As we stay within the veil, we also have our spirit filled with the glory of the heavenly Christ so that our heart may be freed from the possession of the earth&rsquo;s enjoyment outside the camp. Furthermore, within the veil we behold the glorified Christ so that we may be attracted to follow the suffering Jesus outside the camp. Beholding His countenance in heaven enables us to trace His footsteps on earth. As we enter within the veil, we are infused with the resurrection power that we may be empowered to walk the pathway of the cross outside the camp (Phil. 3:10). We also participate in the ministry of the heavenly Christ so that we may be equipped to minister Him to the hungry and thirsty spirit of those outside the camp. Here we enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s best and are enriched to meet the need of people outside the camp.</p>
<p>The Holy of Holies, the pathway of the cross, signified by going forth unto Jesus outside the camp while bearing His reproach, and the kingdom are three crucial matters set forth in the book of Hebrews. The Holy of Holies enables us to take the pathway of the cross, and the pathway of the cross ushers us into the kingdom in its manifestation.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Following in His Steps</h2>
<p>When the believers go forth outside the camp to follow Jesus, bearing His reproach, they are following in His steps (1 Pet. 2:21). We enter the Holy of Holies to receive grace, and by this grace we go outside the camp to follow Jesus, to bear His reproach, and to follow in His steps.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:21 says, &ldquo;To this you were called, because Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model so that you may follow in His steps.&rdquo; The common usage of the word <em>model</em> cannot fully convey its meaning in the original Greek. The literal translation of this word is a &ldquo;writing copy, an underwriting&rdquo; (used by students to trace letters and thereby learn to draw them). In ancient times teachers would write letters on writing materials, and those letters became a master copy. Another piece of writing material was put upon the master copy. Then children would practice writing by tracing the letters from the master copy onto their copy. The Greek word <em>model</em> is the word that denotes a master copy for people to use in the teaching of writing. The Lord Jesus has set His suffering life before us as an underwriting copy for us to copy by tracing and following in His steps.</p>
<p>Our following in the steps of the Lord Jesus is not by endeavoring to imitate Him outwardly; rather, it is by experiencing the all-inclusive Spirit with the riches of the divine life to become His reproduction. The result of this process is that Christ is reproduced in us. As His reproduction, we can follow in His steps.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. BY TAKING THE LORD&rsquo;S YOKE<br />
AND LEARNING FROM HIM</h2>
<p>The believers enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity by taking the Lord&rsquo;s yoke and learning from Him. In Matthew 11:29 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.&rdquo; To take the Lord&rsquo;s yoke is to take the will of God. It is not to be regulated and controlled by any obligation of the law or religion or to be enslaved by any work; rather, it is to be restricted by the will of the Father. The Lord Jesus lived such a life, caring for nothing but the will of His Father (John 4:34; 5:19, 30; 6:38). He submitted Himself fully to the Father&rsquo;s will (Matt. 26:39, 42). Hence, the Lord wants His believers to learn from Him.</p>
<p>In Matthew 11:30 the Lord Jesus continued, &ldquo;For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s yoke is the Father&rsquo;s will, and His burden is the work of carrying out the Father&rsquo;s will. Such a yoke is easy, not bitter, and such a burden is light, not heavy. The Greek word for <em>easy</em> means &ldquo;fit for use&rdquo;; hence, good, kind, mild, gentle, easy, and pleasant are in contrast to hard, harsh, sharp, and bitter.</p>
<p>The will of God is our yoke. Because we have taken His yoke, we are not free to do as we please. How good and pleasant it is to take the Lord&rsquo;s yoke and to learn from Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. In the Meekness and Lowliness of His Heart</h2>
<p>In Matthew 11:29 the Lord tells us to learn from Him. He is meek and lowly in heart. To be meek means to not resist any opposition. To be lowly means to not have any self-esteem. The Lord Jesus submitted Himself to the will of His Father, not wanting to do anything for Himself or expecting to gain something for Himself. Regardless of the situation He had rest in His heart; He was fully satisfied with the Father&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>To be meek is to not struggle or resist but to submit. To be lowly is to not have high thoughts. Lowliness is deeper than humility. We may be humble, but we may still have high thoughts concerning ourselves or our work. Hence we need to be lowly. We should not consider ourselves as anything or that we are higher than others; on the contrary, we should remain in a lowly state. This is to take the Lord&rsquo;s yoke, not in an outward form but in the heart, in the meekness and lowliness of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Finding Rest in the Soul</h2>
<p>If we take the Lord&rsquo;s yoke and learn of Him, we will find rest in our souls. In Matthew 11:28 the Lord sounded out a call: &ldquo;Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest.&rdquo; The toil mentioned here refers not only to the toil of striving to keep the commandment of the law and religious regulations but also to the toil of struggling to be successful in any work. Whoever toils is always heavily burdened. Rest refers not only to being set free from the toil and burden under the law, religion, or any work or responsibility but also refers to perfect peace and full satisfaction.</p>
<p>When we take the Lord&rsquo;s yoke and learn from Him, we will find rest for our soul. This is an inward rest; it is not something outward in nature. The Lord Jesus always submitted to the Father&rsquo;s will, taking God&rsquo;s will as His portion without resistance. Hence, He was always at rest. We must learn from Him and take this view. If we do, we will have rest in our soul. If we struggle for a high position, we will not find rest, but if we are meek and content to remain in a lowly state, nothing can disturb us, and we will enjoy Christ&rsquo;s rest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>When the believers are conformed to the death of Christ, they are released, freed from many negative matters, to enter into the Holy of Holies, their spirit, to see God and consider Him, thus to receive His infusion, saturation, and filling so that they may become the corporate reproduction of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son for His expression. This is made possible in the blood of Jesus and through a new and living way initiated by the rending of the veil, which signifies the flesh of Christ. The rent veil also implies that the old man of the believers was crucified with Christ, giving them a way to enter into the spirit to contact and enjoy God as their life and life supply.</p>
<p>The believers, entering into the Holy of Holies, come forward to the throne of grace within the veil to receive mercy and grace from the ascended Christ who is in the heavens. Today the believers&rsquo; spirit is the Holy of Holies, the dwelling place of God; it is the gate of heaven with Christ as the heavenly ladder joining the believers to heaven and bringing heaven to them. By exercising our spirit, we can enter into the Holy of Holies to touch the throne of grace, which is Christ as the propitiation place and the great High Priest who sympathizes with us in our weaknesses, so that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help. This should be our daily living.</p>
<p>The believers also enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by following Jesus, following Him in His steps. In following Jesus we must not pay attention to others but must go outside the camp, that is, go outside of the human organization of religion. To go outside the camp, we must first enter within the veil to be strengthened and encouraged. By entering the spirit, within the veil, we taste the sweetness of the heavenly Christ, we are filled with the glory of the heavenly Christ in our spirit, and we are released in our heart. This enables us to go forth outside the camp unto Jesus, being freed from the possession of the earth&rsquo;s enjoyment, bearing His reproach, and taking the pathway of the cross on earth. We do not need to endeavor to imitate Christ outwardly; rather, by experiencing the all-inclusive Spirit and the riches of the divine life, we become His reproduction, enabling us to follow in His steps. The Holy of Holies enables us to take the pathway of the cross, and the pathway of the cross leads us into the kingdom in its manifestation.</p>
<p>The believers also enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity by taking the Lord&rsquo;s yoke and learning from Him. To take the Lord&rsquo;s yoke is to take the will of God and to be restricted by it. This requires us to be in the meekness and the lowliness of the Lord&rsquo;s heart. In this way we find rest in our souls. When we are content to remain in a lowly state and not disturbed by any matter or thing, we enjoy Christ&rsquo;s rest.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will consider more aspects of the believers&rsquo; experience and enjoyment of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. BY LIVING TO CHRIST</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 5:14-15 says, &ldquo;The love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised.&rdquo; Here Paul does not speak of living for the Lord, by the Lord, or with the Lord; instead, he speaks of living to the Lord. To live to Christ is to take Him as the aim of our living. In everything we do&mdash;at home, at work, or in the church life&mdash;Christ should be our unique aim.</p>
<p>Galatians 2:19 says, &ldquo;I through law have died to law that I might live to God.&rdquo; To live to law means that we are under the law, led by the law, ruled by the law, and obligated to follow the law. To live to God or to the Lord means that we are under the leading and constraint of the Lord to fulfill His demand and to satisfy and accomplish His desire.</p>
<p>The entire text of 2 Corinthians 4 and 5 shows that to live to the Lord means to live the kind of life that the Lord Jesus lived. In chapter 4 we see that the apostle experienced the putting to death of Jesus. When we experience the putting to death of Jesus, we can live the kind of life Jesus lived. Therefore, to live to the Lord is to live a crucified life. Such a living always puts the outer man to death. The Lord Jesus lived this kind of life, and those who live such a life today are living to the Lord. If we would live to the Lord, we must deny our outer man, that is, our flesh. When we live to Christ, we do not live by our outer man, by our flesh; rather, we live by the inner man, by our regenerated spirit. The Lord does not want us to be so active for Him; rather, He wants us to experience the putting to death of Jesus so that our natural man and our active being may be terminated.</p>
<p>We must understand the difference between living for Christ and living to Christ. <em>To Christ</em> implies that we are the Lord&rsquo;s possession, that we already belong to Him. <em>For Christ</em> implies that we are still our own and are according to our pleasure and convenience. We may be active and aggressive for the Lord in a natural way, doing things for the Lord by our natural aggressiveness. This offends the Lord, and it distracts us from enjoying Him. Since we belong to the Lord, the Lord desires that we be to Him. It is not enough to say that we are for Him; saying that we are for Him indicates that we still have things under our control and that we could leave Him. However, if we are to the Lord, we cannot leave Him and are even one with Him.</p>
<p>Living to the Lord is based upon the fact that we are the Lord&rsquo;s (Rom. 14:8). We live to Him because we belong to Him. We must realize that the Lord bought us with the great price of His precious blood (1 Cor. 6:19-20; 1 Pet. 1:18-19). Now He is our Lord and Master, and we belong to Him. All that we have, all that we do, and all that we are is unto Him; everything is wholly unto Him. We should not say that we are doing certain things for Him, because we already belong to Him. Since every believer has been bought by the Lord with a great price, he should have one living to the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">A. No Longer Living to Self</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 5:15 Paul says, &ldquo;He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised.&rdquo; Worldly people always live to themselves, but the love of Christ constrains us to live to Him and not to ourselves. To live to ourselves means that we are under our own restraint, leading, and control, mindful only of our own aim and goal. This is not only to live for ourselves but also to live to ourselves, taking ourselves as the aim for our living. The apostles, however, had the ambition to live to the Lord, to be well pleasing to Him; they were absolutely under the Lord, under His leading, restraint, and control. Everything they did was for the accomplishment of the Lord&rsquo;s purpose and desire. Since they were this kind of people, they did not live to themselves but to the Lord.</p>
<p>Paul did not live to himself; he lived to Christ, his Master. The Jewish rabbis lived to the law, doing everything with the law as the goal. Paul was very different from the rabbis; his only goal was to be well pleasing to his Master. Paul did not seek to be well pleasing to the Lord by working but by living every aspect of his daily life to Him. Similarly, we should not seek to please ourselves but rather to please the Lord by living to Him. Whatever we do should be to Him. Since we are to the Lord, our time and money are also to Him. Nothing should be to ourselves, because none of us live to ourselves but to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Constrained by the Love of Christ<br />
Who Died for Us</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 5:14 says that because &ldquo;the love of Christ constrains us,&rdquo; we live to Christ and not to ourselves. The love of Christ has already been manifested through His dying on the cross on our behalf. The Greek word for <em>constrain</em> means &ldquo;to press on from all sides, to hold to one end, to forcefully limit, to confine to one object within certain bounds, to shut up to one line and purpose (as in a narrow, walled road).&rdquo; In such a way the apostles were constrained by the love of Christ to live to Him. Today we are also constrained by the love of Christ; this love limits us, confining us to the narrow way that leads to the unique aim&mdash;Christ Himself.</p>
<p>Although we love the Lord Jesus, we are not always willing to take His way. Without being walled in by Him, we would escape from Him. Therefore, the love of Christ constrains us; it presses us from every side and holds us to one aim, leaving us with no other way to take. Actually, this is not our choice. If the choice was truly ours, we would be somewhere else today rather than in this way. Thank the Lord for the love of Christ that constrains us; we are constrained by the love of Christ to live to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. In Christ&rsquo;s Resurrection&mdash;<br />
the Issue of His Death</h2>
<p>In ourselves, by our natural life, we cannot live to the Lord. Only through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, that is, only through the issue of His death, are we able to live to Him. Christ died for all so that we would no longer live to ourselves but to Him. Hence, the death of Christ causes us to live to Him and not to ourselves through His resurrection.</p>
<p>When we are constrained and limited by the love of Christ, we remain in His death. Christ&rsquo;s death always brings in resurrection and makes His resurrection life our portion. Therefore, to be constrained by the love of Christ means to remain in His death, which brings in the enjoyment of His resurrection. In the resurrection of Christ, that is, in the issue of His death, we live to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Proving That We Are the Lord&rsquo;s<br />
and That Christ Is Our Lord,<br />
Who Died to Purchase Us to Himself</h2>
<p>The believers&rsquo; living to Christ proves that we are the Lord&rsquo;s and that Christ is our Lord, who died to purchase us to Himself. Our living to the Lord is a declaration that we belong to Him and that our aim is to live to Him; it is also a testimony that Christ is our Lord and that He died to purchase us to Himself (Rev. 5:9). Since we are the Lord&rsquo;s, we no longer live to our own enjoyment, career, or future; we only care for Christ, who is our Lord, for He paid the highest price to purchase us with His precious blood. Since we belong to Him, we take Him as the only aim in our life, and we live to Him.</p><h2 class="head1">VIII. BY WALKING<br />
ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT<br />
AND WALKING BY THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The believers also enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by walking according to the spirit and walking by the Spirit (Rom. 8:4; Gal. 5:16, 25). If we live to Christ, we will walk according to the spirit and by the Spirit. Romans 8:4 says, &ldquo;The righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit.&rdquo; Here <em>walk</em> denotes living, action, and behavior, indicating that we should do everything in spirit. This is to walk according to the spirit in our daily life.</p>
<p>Galatians 5:16 also says, &ldquo;Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.&rdquo; The word <em>walk</em> here includes everything that we do and say; hence, it covers our entire daily life. In this verse Paul charges us to have our daily life&mdash;to live, walk, and have our being&mdash;by the Spirit. According to the context, the Spirit in verse 16 must be the Holy Spirit who dwells in and mingles with our regenerated spirit. Thus, the Christian walk must be totally by the Spirit, meaning that our walk must be regulated by the Holy Spirit within our spirit.</p>
<p>In Galatians 5:25 Paul speaks again of walking by the Spirit: &ldquo;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.&rdquo; To live by the Spirit is to have our life dependent upon the Spirit and regulated by the Spirit; to walk by the Spirit is to let the Holy Spirit regulate our walk from our spirit. Since we live by the Spirit, our daily walk should also be by the Spirit.</p>
<p>In verses 16 and 25 of Galatians 5, Paul uses two different Greek words for <em>walk</em>. This indicates that in the New Testament there are two kinds of walk by the Spirit. The Greek word for <em>walk</em> in verse 16 means &ldquo;to tread all around, to walk at large; hence, to deport oneself, move, and act in ordinary daily life, implying a common, habitual daily walk.&rdquo; The Greek word for <em>walk</em> in verse 25 means &ldquo;to march in military rank, to keep in step, and derivatively, to walk in an orderly, regulated manner.&rdquo; This kind of walk is more regulated than the former. In the first walk we walk at large, but in the second walk we must walk as in the military&mdash;orderly and in step. Both kinds of walk should be by the Spirit. Every believer in Christ should have these two kinds of walk by the Spirit.</p>
<p>In the first walk by the Spirit, we take the Spirit as the essence of our life; in the second walk by the Spirit, we take the Spirit as the path for our way so that we may accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose and reach the aim of our living on earth. The first walk is for the second walk. When we take the Spirit as the essence of our life, we are able to take the Spirit as the path for our way. If we have these two walks by the Spirit, we will reach God&rsquo;s aim, and His purpose will be accomplished.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. According to the Mingled Spirit&mdash;<br />
the Believers&rsquo; Spirit Mingled with the Spirit of Life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ</h2>
<p>To walk according to and by the Spirit is to walk according to the mingled spirit&mdash;our spirit mingled with the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:2, 9, 16). The Spirit of life is the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ. This threefold Spirit has been mingled with our spirit to become a mingled spirit.</p>
<p>Translators of the Bible realize the difficulty in determining whether <em>spirit</em> in Romans 8:4 and in other verses in this chapter refers to the Holy Spirit or to our human spirit. In some portions, such as verses 9 and 16, the Holy Spirit and the spirit of man are clearly differentiated. The spirit in verse 4 denotes our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God. Actually these two spirits have become one, as seen in 1 Corinthians 6:17: &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; We have a wonderful mingled spirit, a spirit that has been regenerated by the divine Spirit and is indwelt by the divine Spirit. The New Testament charges us to live, move, and walk according to this mingled spirit. The more we are willing to take the cross, remain in the Lord&rsquo;s death, and be constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love, the more we will be strengthened by the resurrection life to walk according to the mingled spirit. This is the highest kind of walk.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Setting the Mind on the Mingled Spirit</h2>
<p>Romans 8:6 says, &ldquo;The mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&rdquo; <em>Spirit</em> in this verse refers to the mingled spirit, that is, our regenerated spirit mingled with the divine Spirit. We should set our mind constantly on this mingled spirit. If our mind is set on the flesh, our mind is death. But if we turn our mind to the mingled spirit and set it on the spirit, our mind is life and peace. Our spirit becomes life through regeneration (v. 10); then our mind becomes life by being set on the spirit.</p>
<p>To set our mind on the mingled spirit is a great protection to us. This enables us to walk according to the spirit in our daily life and also preserves us in the divine dispensing. By setting our mind on the mingled spirit, we enjoy the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Freed from the Law of Sin and of Death</h2>
<p>When the believers set their mind on the mingled spirit and walk according to this spirit, they are freed from the law of sin and of death. Romans 8:2 says, &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.&rdquo; The law in this verse denotes an automatic and spontaneous principle, an unchanging rule. Every kind of life, including the satanic life and the divine life, has a law which is the innate ability of that life. This ability comes with birth; it is natural, automatic, constant, and instant. God&rsquo;s life is the highest life with the highest characteristics and abilities. These topmost characteristics and abilities constitute the law of the life of God, making it the highest law.</p>
<p>In Romans 8:2 Paul does not speak simply of the law of life but of the law of the Spirit of life. The law of the Spirit of life is nothing less than the processed Triune God becoming the life-giving Spirit dwelling in us. The Triune God, after being processed, was dispensed into us to become the law of the Spirit of life; this law frees us from the law of sin and of death, the law of the satanic life. Because the highest law, that is, the law of the Spirit of life, operates in us, we do not need to endeavor to overcome the law of sin and of death; we only need to let the law of the Spirit of life work in us.</p>
<p>When we remain in the death of Christ, the resurrection life which issues from death becomes the empowering element for us to walk according to the mingled spirit and to set our mind on the spirit. Spontaneously we are freed from the evil law of Satan&rsquo;s life, that is, the law of sin and of death. Then in our experience the evil law is defeated, and in Christ we enjoy another law, the highest law, that is, the law of the Spirit of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Fulfilling the Righteous Requirement of the Law</h2>
<p>Romans 8:4 indicates that when we walk according to the spirit, the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in us. If we walk according to the mingled spirit, the righteous requirement of the law will spontaneously be fulfilled. We do not need to endeavor to obey the law, because the law of the Spirit of life automatically fulfills the demands of the law.</p>
<p>When we walk according to the spirit, we will spontaneously keep the law. Our heart&rsquo;s desire is to live to Christ and to walk according to the spirit, but the end result is that the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in us. Actually, the standard of this kind of living far surpasses the Ten Commandments; such a living is the standard of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens revealed in chapters 5 through 7 of the Gospel of Matthew. Therefore, when we walk according to the spirit, we have a moral standard that far surpasses the demands of the Mosaic law.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Not Satisfying the Lust of the Flesh<br />
but Bringing Forth the Fruit of the Spirit</h2>
<p>When the believers walk according to the spirit, they do not satisfy the lust of the flesh; rather, they bring forth the fruit of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22-23). When we live to Christ and walk according to the spirit, we do not have an interest in the flesh and are unwilling to satisfy the lust of our flesh. On the contrary, we bring forth the fruit of the Spirit as the issue of walking by the spirit.</p>
<p>The issue of walking by the Spirit is the fruit of the Spirit. We do not need to endeavor to love others or to maintain peace or joy. We only need to live by the Spirit and walk by the Spirit, and then the Spirit will automatically bring forth the fruit of many virtues. These virtues are different expressions of the unique fruit of life produced by walking by the Spirit. These virtues, far superior to our human moral virtues, are divine yet human and are manifested in our human living through the divine resurrection power.</p><h2 class="head1">IX. BY SOWING UNTO THE SPIRIT<br />
IN THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; LIVING</h2>
<p>We are sowing unto the Spirit when we walk according to the Spirit, setting our mind on the spirit. We also are freed from the law of sin and of death, spontaneously fulfilling the requirement of the law and bringing forth fruit of the Spirit. &ldquo;He who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life&rdquo; (6:8). When the believers sow unto the Spirit, they reap of the Spirit in their living.</p>
<p>In Galatians 6:8 the Greek word translated &ldquo;unto&rdquo; has the meaning &ldquo;with a view to,&rdquo; implying that a certain matter is our aim. To sow unto our flesh is to have our own flesh as the aim. To sow unto the Spirit is to sow for the accomplishment of the Spirit&rsquo;s aim, that is, to have the Spirit as our aim. Hence, the Spirit should not only be our life and walk but also the aim of our living. Whatever we do must be done with a view toward this aim. We should have the Spirit as our unique and eternal aim. In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, God, as the Spirit, has given Himself to us; now we should sow unto the Spirit, taking the Spirit as our aim.</p>
<p>Sowing is the sum total of our Christian life. Whatever we do or say is a sowing, either unto the flesh or unto the Spirit. Therefore, it is very important to realize that the Christian life is a life of sowing unto the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Not Sowing unto the Flesh<br />
to Reap Corruption of the Flesh</h2>
<p>All our sowing reaps either corruption of the flesh or eternal life of the Spirit; hence, Paul warns us to take care of our sowing. He says, &ldquo;He who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh&rdquo; (v. 8). To sow unto our flesh is to sow with the desire and purpose of our flesh in view, to fulfill the coveting of the flesh with the result of corruption. Sowing unto the flesh always produces a harvest of corruption.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Sowing unto the Spirit<br />
to Reap Eternal Life of the Spirit</h2>
<p>In the second half of verse 8 Paul continues, &ldquo;He who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life.&rdquo; To sow unto the Spirit is to sow with the desire and aim of the Spirit in view, to accomplish what the Spirit desires with the result of eternal life. Eternal life belongs to the Spirit and is the Spirit Himself. If we sow unto the Spirit, we will reap eternal life of the Spirit. To sow unto the Spirit always produces a harvest of eternal life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">X. BY WALKING BY FAITH,<br />
NOT BY APPEARANCE (SIGHT)</h2>
<p>The believers also enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity by walking by faith, not by appearance, or sight (2 Cor. 5:7). Appearance denotes that which is seen. The believers regulate their living by faith, not by sight, as testified in Hebrews 11. Second Corinthians 4:18 also says, &ldquo;We do not regard the things which are seen but the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.&rdquo; Fallen mankind lives by the things which are seen, but those who enjoy the divine dispensing walk by faith.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The believers enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation by living to the Lord. To live to the Lord implies that the believers are the Lord&rsquo;s possession; based on this fact, they need to live the kind of life He lived, a crucified life. Such a life always puts our outer man to death, terminating our natural man and active being. Hence, to live to the Lord is to no longer live to the self; on the contrary, having been constrained by the love of Christ, who died for us, we live to Him in His resurrection. This proves that we are the Lord&rsquo;s, that Christ is our Lord, who died to purchase us to Himself.</p>
<p>If we live to the Lord, spontaneously we will walk according to and by the Spirit; that is, our daily walk and living will be according to the Spirit. This means that our walk must be a living regulated by the Holy Spirit in our spirit; that is, the Holy Spirit within our spirit regulates our actions. There are two kinds of walk by the Spirit. The first takes the Spirit as the essence of our living, implying our habitual daily actions. The second takes the Spirit as the path of our way so that we may accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose, thus reaching the aim of our life on earth; this walk is more regulated than the first.</p>
<p>To walk according to the Spirit is to walk according to the mingled spirit, the believers&rsquo; spirit mingled with the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, that is, our spirit regenerated and indwelt by the divine Spirit. This requires us to set our mind constantly on the mingled spirit and to walk according to the mingled spirit; this kind of walk is the highest kind of walk. Thus, we are freed from the law of sin and of death and enjoy the highest law of the Spirit of life in Christ. Spontaneously, we will fulfill the righteous requirement of the law, having a moral standard that far surpasses the demands of the Mosaic law. As the issue of walking by the Spirit, the believers also do not satisfy the lust of the flesh but bring forth the fruit of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we also sow unto the Spirit, taking the Spirit as our aim and reaping of the Spirit in our living. We do not sow unto the flesh to reap corruption of the flesh; rather, we reap eternal life of the Spirit. Fallen mankind lives by sight, but the believers, as those enjoying the divine dispensing, live by faith.</p>

<h2 class="head1>TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will see that the believers experience and enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by living in the organism of the Divine Trinity and participating in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XI. BY LIVING IN THE ORGANISM<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY AND PARTICIPATING IN<br />
THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word in John 14 through 16 is deep and mysterious because the Lord wanted to bring the disciples into the depths of the unfathomable divine mysteries. These mysteries include the Father&rsquo;s house with its many abodes, the vine tree, and the newborn child.</p>
<p>John 14 through 16 reveal that the believers in Christ live in the organism of the Divine Trinity and participate in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. The Divine Trinity is an organism constituted with Christ and all His members. Christ is organic, and so are His members. Christ and all His members have been brought into a divine constitution to become an organic entity, the living organism of the Divine Trinity. The believers live in this organism and participate in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity for their transformation with the result of being conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being Convicted by the Spirit of Reality</h2>
<p>By living in the organism of the Divine Trinity, the believers are convicted by the Spirit of reality (16:8-11). The Spirit of reality is commonly called the Spirit of truth (v. 13). In the writings of John, truth does not denote doctrine; rather, it denotes the divine reality. Hence, the Spirit of truth, that is, the Spirit of the divine reality, has convicted the believers concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Concerning Sin in Adam, Because<br />
They Do Not Believe into the Son of Man</h2>
<p>John 16:8-11 says, &ldquo;When He comes, He will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me; and concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you no longer behold Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.&rdquo; First, the Spirit convicts people concerning sin. Sin came through Adam (Rom. 5:12); in Adam we were born in sin. The only way to be freed from sin is to believe into Christ, the Son of God. If we believe into Him, He becomes our righteousness, and we are justified in Him (3:24; 4:25). If we do not repent of the sin in Adam and do not believe into Christ, the Son of God, we shall remain in sin and suffer judgment with Satan for eternity.</p>
<p>The unique sin, which can cause a person to perish, is to not believe into the Son. Therefore, the sin referred to in John 16:9 is the unwillingness to be transferred from Adam into Christ. There is no need for a person to commit sin in order to perish; simply refusing to believe into the Lord Jesus is the qualification for perishing. The unique way to escape from our sinful situation is to believe into the Lord; the unique sin that qualifies us to perish is to not believe in Him. According to the New Testament, God&rsquo;s judgment of unbelievers is not according to the Ten Commandments but according to the unique commandment to repent and believe into the Son of God. Today God has only one commandment for the world&mdash;believe into His Son. The Spirit of the divine reality comes to convict us concerning the sin of unbelief. Whoever does not believe into the Son remains a sinner in Adam until the time of judgment.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Concerning Righteousness in Christ,<br />
Because the Son Goes to the Father<br />
in Resurrection and Ascension</h2>
<p>In John 16:10 the Lord Jesus said that the Spirit will convict the world concerning righteousness: &ldquo;Because I am going to the Father and you no longer behold Me.&rdquo; Righteousness is the resurrected Christ (1 Cor. 1:30). Christ the Son in resurrection went to the Father in the heavens. This is a strong sign that Christ has accomplished God&rsquo;s redemption and that His redemption has been accepted by God the Father. If we believe into Christ, we receive God&rsquo;s righteousness in Christ, and this righteousness is Christ Himself. Through this righteousness we are justified by God. God&rsquo;s Son, having fulfilled the righteous requirements of the Father and having been accepted by Him, was given to the believers to be our righteousness; in Him we are justified before God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Concerning Judgment in Satan,<br />
Because the Ruler of This World<br />
Has Been Judged</h2>
<p>Finally, the Spirit of reality convicts the world concerning judgment, &ldquo;because the ruler of this world has been judged&rdquo; (John 16:11). Through the death of Christ on the cross, Satan, the ruler of this world, has been judged (12:31-33; 3:14). Therefore, the judgment in 16:11 is related to Satan, the devil, the author of sin, the origin of death, the father of sinners, and the ruler of the world. The lake of fire is prepared for God&rsquo;s judgment upon Satan; the lake of fire is not intended for human beings, but those who refuse to be transferred from Adam into Christ will share in the judgment upon Satan. This means that all those who do not believe into the Son will be with Satan, sharing his judgment. God loves the world (3:16), and He has no intention of casting man into the lake of fire; this judgment is for the devil. However, if a person refuses to believe in the Son and remains a companion to Satan, then God has no choice but to allow him to suffer Satan&rsquo;s judgment.</p>
<p>The three major items in John 16:8-11 are related to Adam, Christ, and Satan: sin is related to Adam, righteousness to Christ, and judgment to Satan. We were born in Adam, but we believed into Christ and have received Him as our righteousness. However, those who do not believe into Christ and remain followers of Satan will share in the judgment upon Satan. The Spirit came to convict us concerning sin, concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment. Those who have repented and believed into the Lord Jesus have escaped the judgment upon Satan. We have been transferred out of Adam into Christ to become the children of God and the members of Christ. We are Christ&rsquo;s members, living in the organism of the Divine Trinity and participating in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being Born as a Newborn Child</h2>
<p>The believers also live in the organism of the Divine Trinity and participate in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity by being born as a newborn child (vv. 19-22). In His resurrection Christ gave birth to a corporate child&mdash;the corporate new man&mdash;with Himself as the firstborn Son of God and His many brothers as the many sons of God. In verses 20 and 21 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy. A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow because her hour has come; but when she brings forth the little child, she no longer remembers the affliction because of the joy that a man has been born into the world.&rdquo; Here the Lord indicated that the disciples were like a woman travailing in birth and that He was the child to be brought forth in resurrection (Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5; Rom. 1:4).</p>
<p>Actually, the child in John 16:21 is a corporate man, comprising Christ and all His believers. The birth accomplished by Christ was not merely an individual birth but also a corporate birth, which includes the firstborn Son of God and the many sons of God. Through this one birth, many sons were born. All God&rsquo;s chosen people were born together with Christ in His resurrection. This resurrection was the birth of a corporate child.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Through Christ&rsquo;s Going and Coming&mdash;<br />
Death and Resurrection</h2>
<p>The believers were born as a newborn child through Christ&rsquo;s going and coming, that is, through His death and resurrection. According to the Gospel of John, the Lord&rsquo;s going was His all-inclusive death to put away sin, to terminate the old creation, to judge the world, to destroy Satan, to abolish the law of the commandments in ordinances, to release the divine life, and to prepare a place for the believers to enter into God.</p>
<p>Many readers of the Gospel of John consider that the Lord&rsquo;s word about His coming again after going away in John 14 is about His second coming; rather, the Lord was speaking of His resurrection, an event that would take place in a few days. The Lord&rsquo;s coming was His resurrection for our germination so that He might have a new creation to produce the church, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. Therefore, in John 14 the coming of the Son signifies His coming as the Spirit in His resurrection. His going was His death, and His coming was His resurrection; death was the preparatory step to resurrection. The Lord Jesus died that He might enter into resurrection. His going was His coming; He comes by going.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, &ldquo;I am coming to you&rdquo; (v. 18). Then He continued, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&rdquo; (v. 20). That day was the day of resurrection (20:19-22). On the day of resurrection the Lord returned to the disciples and breathed Himself as the Spirit of the divine reality into them. Hence, through Christ&rsquo;s going and coming, that is, through His death and resurrection, a newborn child was born.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. As the Aggregate of All the Children<br />
(Sons) of God, Born Together with Christ<br />
in His Resurrection</h2>
<p>The newborn child is the aggregate of all God&rsquo;s children, or sons (1:12), who were born with Him in His resurrection to be His many brothers (Acts 13:33; 1 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 8:29). This newborn child is constituted with Christ as the firstborn Son of God and all His brothers. Therefore, all the believers are parts and members of this newborn child.</p>
<p>According to 1 Peter 1:3, God regenerated us through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. When Christ was resurrected, we also were regenerated to be God&rsquo;s children. The newborn child is the aggregate of all God&rsquo;s children who have been regenerated through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection is a universal birth&mdash;not the birth of a single child but the birth of a corporate child comprised of Christ as the Head and the many brothers as the Body. This is the birth of the corporate new child that includes Christ and the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Becoming the New Man&mdash;the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>The newborn child born with Christ in His resurrection is the new man&mdash;the Body of Christ (Eph. 2:15; Col. 3:10-11). The birth of the newborn child is the birth of the new man in reality. The old man was created by God in Genesis 1 and 2, but the new man was born through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. We were born in the old man, but we were regenerated in the new man; this new man includes Christ as the Head and all the believers as the Body. The Head is God&rsquo;s Firstborn; the Body is constituted with the many sons of God, the many brothers of the Lord. This new man, this child, was born through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Abiding in the Son<br />
(the Vine as the Organism of the Divine Trinity)<br />
with the Father to Be the Father&rsquo;s Expression</h2>
<p>The believers, through abiding in the Son (the vine as the organism of the Divine Trinity) with the Father to be the expression of the Father (John 15:1-8; 14:9-10), live in the organism of the Divine Trinity and participate in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman&rdquo; (15:1). He also told the disciples, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches&rdquo; (v. 5). Christ, the true vine, is the universal organism of the Divine Trinity. The Son is the vine, the Father is the husbandman, and the Spirit is the One who testifies. Hence, this vine is the organism of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>Christ and the believers, the vine with its branches, constitute the organism of the Divine Trinity in the divine dispensing. Therefore, the vine in John 15 is a universal vine that includes Christ and the believers as the branches. In this vine, this organism, the Triune God lives, expresses Himself, and dispenses Himself into the believers as the branches.</p>
<p>Christ as the vine is God&rsquo;s economy, the center of God&rsquo;s universal enterprise. The Bible depicts the universe as a vineyard with a vine, which is Christ, as the center of the universe. All that God the Father is and all that He has are for this center, the vine tree, and He is expressed and manifested bodily through this center. God as life needs an organism through which He may grow and be expressed. God longs to grow in this organism and to express Himself through this organism. This organism is the vine with its branches, that is, Christ with the believers, to be the organism of the Divine Trinity. This vine tree is corporate and universal.</p>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me. I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing&rdquo; (vv. 4-5). The branches of the vine need to abide in the vine; only when the branches abide in the vine can the vine be everything to the branches. Our life and enjoyment depend upon our abiding in the vine; our destiny as branches is to remain in the vine. Apart from the Lord Jesus, the true vine, we the branches can do nothing. Therefore, we must abide in Him and let Him abide in us. In this way Christ can be everything to us for our experience and enjoyment.</p>
<p>When we abide in Christ the Son, who is the Father&rsquo;s expression, we abide in the Son with the Father. This is a mystery. We are Christ&rsquo;s members not only abiding in Him but also abiding in Him with the Father. When we abide in the Son, we abide in the Son with the Father. This means that when we abide in the Son, we abide in the Father also.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Bearing Fruit</h2>
<p>Our abiding in the Son is for bearing fruit. Fruit-bearing takes place through the branches abiding in the vine and allowing the vine to abide in the branches. Fruit-bearing is the overflow of the riches of the life of the vine, that is, the overflow of our inner life. When we continually enjoy Christ as our everything, we have the riches of life. From these riches there will be a stream of water reaching men, permeating their living, and bearing fruit. This is the fruit-bearing through the overflow of the riches of the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. For the Father to Be Glorified</h2>
<p>Fruit-bearing is for the Father to be glorified. In John 15:8 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit.&rdquo; In fruit-bearing, the Father&rsquo;s life is expressed; hence, in fruit-bearing, the Father is glorified. The vine tree with its branches is the organism for the Father to be glorified. With the vine, the Father is glorified through the expression of the riches of the divine life in fruit-bearing.</p>
<p>The fruit produced by the branches of the vine is the expression of the vine. If the branches do not bear fruit, there will not be the expression of the inner life element of the vine. The fruit produced by the branches is the expression of the inner life of the vine. This attests of the Father&rsquo;s being glorified through our fruit-bearing.</p>
<p>In verse 8 <em>glory</em> indicates the expression of the Father&rsquo;s desire, content, inner life, and inner riches. When the vine bears clusters of grapes, the riches of the divine life are expressed. This expression is the glorification of the Father because the Father is the divine life.</p>
<p>The Father is the source and the substance of the vine tree. Without the fruit produced by the branches, the essence, substance, and life of the vine would be hidden and limited. But when the branches bear much fruit, the riches of the inner life of the vine are expressed in the fruit. This expression is the release of the divine substance from the vine. This is the glorification of the Father because this is the expression of the riches of the Father&rsquo;s life. When we bear much fruit by abiding in the vine, the result is that the Father is glorified.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Through living in the organism of the Divine Trinity, the believers participate in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. This organism is constituted with Christ and all His members. This is for our transformation, which results in being conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. Since the believers are persons living in the organism of the Divine Trinity, the Spirit of reality has convicted us concerning sin, concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment. Sin is related to Adam, because sin came through Adam. In Adam, everyone in the world is born in sin; hence, to not believe in the Son is the unique sin that causes people to perish. Righteousness is related to Christ, because the Son went to the Father in resurrection and ascension; this is proof that Christ has accomplished God&rsquo;s redemption, that this redemption has been accepted by God the Father in fulfilling His righteous requirement, and that the believers can be justified by God through this righteousness. Judgment is related to Satan, because the ruler of this world has been judged; all those who refuse to be transferred from Adam into Christ will suffer with Satan in his judgment. But the believers who believe into Christ are transferred from Adam into Christ to become children of God and members of Christ, living in the organism of the Divine Trinity and participating in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>In addition, the believers were born as the newborn child through Christ&rsquo;s going and coming&mdash;His death and resurrection. The Lord&rsquo;s going was His all-inclusive death, which prepared a place for the believers to enter into God; the Lord&rsquo;s coming was His resurrection for the germination of the believers to produce the church. In His resurrection Christ gave birth to the corporate new man, who is comprised of Himself as the firstborn Son of God and of His many brothers as the many sons of God. This newborn child is the aggregate of all of God&rsquo;s children (sons), born together with Christ in His resurrection, including Christ as the Head and the many brothers as the Body. Therefore, this newborn child is the new man, the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Christ the true vine is the universal organism of the Divine Trinity, which includes Christ and the believers as the branches with the Father as the husbandman and the Spirit as the One who testifies. This vine tree is the center of the universal vineyard; all that the Father is and all that He has are expressed and manifested through this center. The believers are the branches. Through abiding in Christ the Son (the vine as the organism of the Divine Trinity), we experience and enjoy Him, and by abiding in the Son with the Father, we become the Father&rsquo;s expression. Our abiding is for fruit-bearing, which is the overflow of the riches of the life of the vine, and the Father is glorified in the matter of fruit-bearing through the expression of the divine life, because the Father is the divine life.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In the previous lesson we saw that the believers are persons who live in the organism of the Divine Trinity, who have been convicted by the Spirit of reality, who were born as a newborn child, and who abide in the Son with the Father to bear fruit to glorify the Father. Now we want to see that the believers are indwelt by the Spirit and have a share in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Indwelt by the Spirit</h2>
<p>In John 14:17 the Lord Jesus spoke of &ldquo;the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.&rdquo; This verse speaks of the indwelling of the Spirit. This is the first mention of the indwelling of the Spirit, a matter that is fully developed in the Epistles (1 Cor. 6:19; Rom. 8:9, 11). The central and main thought in the Epistles is that Christ is now the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit to be our life and everything for the building up of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 15:45).</p>
<p>In John 20:22 the Lord Jesus breathed into His disciples and said to them, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This is the believers&rsquo; receiving of the Spirit promised in John 14:17. The Lord&rsquo;s breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples is the fulfillment of His promise that the Spirit of reality would abide in them.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. With the Son and the Father</h2>
<p>When the Spirit indwells us, He comes with the Son and the Father (v. 23; 15:26). This means that when the Spirit comes, the Son and the Father also come. When the Spirit abides in us, the Son and the Father come with the Spirit to abide in us. John 14:17 clearly indicates that the Spirit of reality abides in us. In verse 23 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&rdquo; When we compare verse 17 with verse 23, we can see that the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;abides in us. Romans 8:9-11 also clearly indicates that the Spirit with the Son and the Father dwell in us. When we exercise our spirit and call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit moves in our spirit. We sense that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us because the Father and the Son with the Spirit dwell in us.</p>
<p>Another portion of the Scriptures which indicates that the Spirit with the Son and the Father dwell in us is John 15:26: &ldquo;When the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality, who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me.&rdquo; Here the word translated &ldquo;with&rdquo; has the meaning of &ldquo;from with&rdquo; in Greek. The Spirit of reality, who is sent by the Son from the Father, comes not only from the Father but also with the Father. The Spirit comes from the Father and also with the Father. The Father is the source. When the Spirit comes from the source, it does not mean that He leaves the source, but rather He comes with the source. When the Spirit comes, the Father also comes.</p>
<p>The Comforter, the Holy Spirit, was sent by the Father in the Son&rsquo;s name to be the reality of His name. This name is the Son Himself; the Spirit is the Son&rsquo;s person, His being. When we call on the name of the Son, we receive the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:3). The Son came in the name of the Father (John 5:43), because the Son and the Father are one (10:30). The Spirit was sent in the Son&rsquo;s name because the Spirit and the Son are also one (2 Cor. 3:17). The Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;eventually reaches us as the Spirit.</p>
<p>God the Father sent the Spirit, and the Spirit came in the name of the Son. Ultimately, it is the Triune God who comes. When the Spirit comes to us, the Father also comes, and the Son is here as well, because the Spirit comes with the Father in the name of the Son. The Father sent the Spirit to come from Himself and also to come with Himself; the Spirit&rsquo;s coming in the name of the Son is also the coming of the Son. His coming is the Son&rsquo;s coming, and the Son comes from the Father and with the Father. Hence, when one comes, all three come. When the Spirit comes, the Triune God comes. The Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;cannot be separated, because the three are one. This is a divine fact. Although there is distinction among the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the three are one; They cannot be separated, divided, or severed. Hence, when the Spirit dwells in us, He dwells in us with the Son and the Father.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Being the Reality of the Son</h2>
<p>The Spirit is the reality of the Son abiding in us (John 14:18-20). The Spirit is the reality of Christ to make Christ real in those who believe into Him as their life and life supply. Colossians 2:9 says that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily. Hence, Christ as the embodiment of God is fully realized in the Spirit of reality.</p>
<p>The Spirit is called the Spirit of reality because whatever the Father is and whatever the Son is are realized in the Spirit. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, the reality had not yet entered into man. The reality was present because Christ Himself is the reality (John 14:6). However, the reality was only among the disciples, not in them. Therefore, the Lord went away through death to change in form, that is, to change from the form of the flesh to the form of the Spirit. After this change, the reality of Christ became the reality of the Spirit, and the Spirit became the Spirit of reality. Now the Spirit is the reality of the Son dwelling in us. Whatever the Son is, has, attained, and obtained have been wrought into us through the Spirit. Hence, the Spirit is the realization of the Son; that is, the Spirit is the reality of all that the Son is and has.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Becoming Another Comforter&mdash;the Advocate</h2>
<p>The Spirit dwells in the believers as another Comforter&mdash;the Advocate. In John 14:16 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever.&rdquo; The Greek word for <em>Comforter</em> is <em>parakletos,</em> meaning &ldquo;an advocate, one who is alongside to take care of our cause, our affairs.&rdquo; This word is composed of two parts: one part is the preposition <em>with,</em> and the other part is <em>to summon.</em> In ancient times an advocate was a helper, an advocate, a lawyer, an intercessor, one who took care of someone&rsquo;s need and served him. An advocate, a comforter, signifies that the Spirit is the One summoned to be alongside us to help us. Hence, an advocate is a helper. The Spirit as the Advocate is always available to help us. Not only so, an advocate is an attorney, a lawyer, and also one who consoles. Therefore, he is a consoler, a comforter, and an advocate. The indwelling Spirit is our Helper, Advocate, and Comforter; He takes care of our needs in our daily life.</p>
<p>John 14:16 speaks of the Spirit as &ldquo;another Comforter.&rdquo; This indicates that the Son was the first Comforter. The Son was a Comforter, but He asked the Father to give the believers another Comforter. John 14:16-20 reveals that the Comforter to be given would be the reality of the Comforter who was petitioning the Father. This other Comforter is the Spirit of reality. Verse 17 says, &ldquo;The Spirit of reality...He abides with you and shall be in you.&rdquo; The first Comforter was only with the disciples; He was not in them. However, the other Comforter, that is, the Spirit of reality, was not only with the disciples but also in them. Today the Spirit is the other Comforter abiding in us.</p>
<p>In verse 26 the Lord Jesus continued, &ldquo;The Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things and remind you of all the things which I have said to you.&rdquo; The Comforter, the Holy Spirit, is sent by the Father in the Son&rsquo;s name. So the Holy Spirit comes in the Son&rsquo;s name to be the reality of His name. This name is the Son Himself, and the Spirit is the person, the being, of the Son. Therefore, when we call on the Son&rsquo;s name, we receive the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:3), who is the Advocate, the other Comforter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Participating in the Dispensing<br />
of the Divine Trinity</h2>
<p>John 16:13-15 says, &ldquo;When He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming. He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you. All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you.&rdquo; This portion of the Scriptures reveals that the believers have a share in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. All that the Father has, He gives to the Son; and all that the Son has, the Spirit receives and declares to the believers. As the Father gives all that He has to the Son, the Son becomes His embodiment. Now all that the Son has is delivered to the Spirit; hence, the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son. By this we see that the Son is the embodiment of the Father and that the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son. This indicates that when we have the Spirit, we have the Son, and when we have the Son, we have the Father. We have all three: the Father is the source, the Son is the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son.</p><h2 class="head3">1. All That the Father Has<br />
Being Given to the Son</h2>
<p>In verse 15 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;All that the Father has is Mine.&rdquo; The Son is the embodiment of the Father. Therefore, all that the Father is and has are embodied in Him (Col. 2:9). All that the Father is, the fullness of the Godhead, dwells in Christ. Hence, the fullness of the Father is the Son&rsquo;s fullness, and the life and nature of the Father are the Son&rsquo;s life and nature.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. All That the Son Is, Has, and Has Done<br />
Having Been Received by the Spirit</h2>
<p>In John 16:14 the Lord Jesus spoke of the Spirit of reality: &ldquo;He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you.&rdquo; The Lord repeated these words in the last part of verse 15. All that the Father is and has are the Son&rsquo;s; all that the Son is and has obtained have been received by the Spirit. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ, and the Spirit has received this fullness from Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Spirit Declaring to the Believers<br />
What Has Been Received from the Son,<br />
Testifying of Him and Glorifying Him</h2>
<p>The Spirit of reality declares to us what He has received from the Son (vv. 14-15; 14:26) and guides us into all the reality (16:13). Not only so, the Spirit of reality also testifies of Christ (14:26) and glorifies Him (16:14). All that the Son is and has is revealed to the believers as the reality by the Spirit. This is to glorify the Son and the Father. The Spirit reveals the Son with all the fullness of the Father and thus glorifies Him. This is to say that the Spirit&rsquo;s revealing of the Son to us glorifies the Son.</p>
<p>The Spirit declares the Son with the Father to the believers. He makes all that Christ is and has real to us. Stanza 3 of <em>Hymns,</em> #501 speaks of this matter: &ldquo;All things of the Father are Thine; / All Thou art in Spirit is mine; / The Spirit makes Thee real to me, / That Thou experienced might be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verses 14 to 15 of chapter 16 reveal the dispensing of the Divine Trinity&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;into the believers. The Father is the source, the origin, with many riches. All that the Father has became the Son&rsquo;s; today the Son not only possesses what the Father has, but He also possesses all the riches gained through His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. All these riches contained in the Son have been received by the Spirit, and the Spirit declares them to us. This declaration is the transmission of what the processed Triune God is and has into our whole being. The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is transfigured to become the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Divine Trinity reaching us. Hence, all the riches of the Triune God reach us in the Spirit.</p>
<p>All that the Triune God is and has, He declares, conveys, and transfuses into us. When we are organically united with the Spirit, we are organically one with the processed Triune God. In this way whatever He is and has becomes our portion. This means that whatever the processed Triune God is and has will become our element, essence, and being, making the processed Triune God the essence of our whole being.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Father Being Glorified<br />
in the Glorification of the Son</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus prayed in verse 1 of chapter 17: &ldquo;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&rdquo; The subject of the Lord&rsquo;s prayer in this chapter is the Father&rsquo;s being glorified in the Son&rsquo;s glorification. The Son is God becoming flesh, and His flesh was a tabernacle in which God could dwell on earth (1:14). His divine glory was concealed in His humanity, just as God&rsquo;s shekinah glory was concealed within the tabernacle. On the Mount of Transfiguration His divine glory was temporarily manifested to His disciples from within His flesh (Matt. 17:1-4). Afterward, this divine glory was again concealed in His flesh. Before the prayer recorded in John 17, He predicted that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in Him (12:23; 13:31-32). He passed through death so that the shell of His humanity could be broken and His divine element, including His divine life and divine glory, could be released. He resurrected so that He might uplift His humanity into the divine element and so that His divine element might be expressed with the result that His entire being, His divinity and His humanity, would be glorified. The Father would thus be glorified in Him. Hence, His prayer was for this.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s prayer concerning glorification is fulfilled in three stages. First, this prayer was fulfilled in His resurrection, because His divine element, including His divine life and His divine glory, was released from within His humanity into His many believers (12:23-24), bringing His whole being, including His humanity, into glory (Luke 24:26), and because the Father&rsquo;s divine element was expressed in His resurrection and glorification. In the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, God answered and fulfilled His prayer (Acts 3:13-15). Second, this prayer has been fulfilled in the church, in that as His resurrection life is expressed through His many members, He is glorified in them, and the Father is manifested in Him through the church (Eph. 3:21; 1 Tim. 3:15-16). Third, this prayer will be fulfilled ultimately in the New Jerusalem, in which He will be fully expressed in glory, and God will be glorified in Him through the holy city for eternity (Rev. 21:11, 23-24).</p>
<p>The subject of the divine glorification, that is, the Father&rsquo;s being glorified in the glorification of the Son, is a lengthy subject in the Gospel of John. It starts in the middle of chapter 12 and ends with chapter 17. In 12:23 the Lord Jesus declared, &ldquo;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.&rdquo; This is the first time glorification is mentioned. Later the Lord prayed for this in chapter 17. Verse 24 of chapter 12 indicates that the glorification of the Son of Man is the release of His divine element, His divine life, and His divine glory from the shell of His humanity in resurrection, producing many believers, just as a grain falls into the ground and dies to release the life element, producing much fruit, the many grains. Hence, in verse 24 the Lord said, &ldquo;Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&rdquo; From this we see that the Lord&rsquo;s glorification is His death and resurrection for the producing of many grains. The producing of many grains is His glorification. These grains are the believers as constituents of the house, the vine, and the new man.</p>
<p>In the beginning of John 12:28 the Lord prayed, &ldquo;Father, glorify Your name&rdquo;; then we are told that a voice came out of heaven, saying, &ldquo;I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.&rdquo; To glorify the Father&rsquo;s name is to cause the divine element of the Father to be expressed. The Father&rsquo;s divine element, which is the eternal life and the divine glory, was in the incarnated Son. The shell of the Son&rsquo;s incarnation had to be broken through death that the Father&rsquo;s divine element might be released and expressed in His resurrection. This is similar to the life element of a grain of wheat being released by the breaking of its shell and being expressed by its blossoms. This is the glorification of God the Father in the Son.</p>
<p>After the Lord Jesus spoke of His glorification, He continued with the Father&rsquo;s house, the vine, and the new man. These three are the issue of the Father&rsquo;s being glorified in the Son&rsquo;s glorification. The glorification of the Son of Man is His dying to produce many grains in resurrection for the constitution of the vine. The grains constituting the vine equals the building of the Father&rsquo;s house. Not only so, the building of the Father&rsquo;s house equals the cultivation of the vine and also the birth of the new man. These items&mdash;the house, the vine, and the new man&mdash;are all related to glorification.</p>
<p>The Father is glorified in His house and in fruit-bearing. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit&rdquo; (15:8). In the matter of fruit-bearing, the Father&rsquo;s life, the divine life, is expressed. Hence, He is glorified in fruit-bearing. Fruit-bearing is a matter of increase, multiplication, and reproduction. This increase is the glorification of the Father. Hence, the organism of the vine with its branches is for the Son&rsquo;s glorification that the Father may be glorified in Him. Moreover, the birth of the corporate child through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is another aspect of His being glorified.</p>
<p>The section from verse 23 of chapter 12 to the end of chapter 17 contains the real significance of the divine dispensing. The divine dispensing is for our transformation and in reality is in this transformation. In the divine transformation, we enjoy the divine dispensing for our conformation to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. Ultimately, we, the many sons, will be the same as He is, having both humanity and divinity. When we have a share in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the Son is glorified in us, and the Father is glorified in the Son&rsquo;s glorification.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>For their divine conformation the believers are indwelt by the Spirit. The Lord promised this to the disciples in John 14:17 and fulfilled it in 20:22 on the evening of His resurrection. This is fully developed in the New Testament Epistles, which reveal that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit dwelling in the spirit of the believers to be their life and everything for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The Spirit&rsquo;s abiding in the believers is with the Son and the Father because He was sent from the Father in the name of the Son to be the reality of the Son&rsquo;s name. The Son came in the Father&rsquo;s name and is one with the Father; the Spirit is sent in the Son&rsquo;s name and is also one with the Father. Ultimately, the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;as the Spirit reaches the believers. The Spirit is also the reality of the Son abiding in the believers. The Spirit is called the Spirit of reality because whatever the Father is in the Son and whatever the Son is are realized in the Spirit. The Spirit abides in the believers as another Comforter&mdash;the Advocate, the One summoned to our side to help; thus, He is a Consoler, a Comforter, and an Advocate to take care of the needs of the believers in their daily life.</p>
<p>The Spirit who dwells in the believers is the transfiguration of the Son so that the believers may participate in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. Whatever the Father has, has been given to the Son; whatever the Son is, has, and has done has been received by the Spirit, and what He has received from the Son, the Spirit declares and reveals to the believers as the reality to testify of the Lord and glorify Him. In this way, all that the Triune God is and has are declared, conveyed, and transmitted into the believers to be the essence of their whole being.</p>
<p>The subject of the divine glorification, that is, the Father&rsquo;s being glorified in the Son&rsquo;s glorification starts in the middle of chapter 12 of the Gospel of John and concludes at the end of chapter 17. The Lord&rsquo;s glorification is that He died and resurrected to produce many grains; these grains are the believers, who constitute the Father&rsquo;s house, the universal true vine, and the newborn child. The Lord prayed for this glorification, and this prayer is fulfilled in three stages: first, in His resurrection His whole being, including His humanity, was brought into glory; second, in the church His resurrection life is expressed through His many members; and third, in the New Jerusalem, the ultimate consummation, God will be fully expressed in glory, and God will be glorified in Him through the holy city for eternity.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In the previous lessons we saw that in the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the believers&rsquo; experience and enjoyment of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation is by being transformed, by being conformed to the image of Christ, by being conformed to the death of Christ, by entering the Holy of Holies, by following Jesus, by living to Christ, by walking according to the Spirit and by the Spirit, by sowing unto the Spirit, by walking by faith, and by living in the organism of the Divine Trinity and participating in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>The believers also experience and enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by being filled in spirit by the processed Triune God and letting the word of Christ dwell in them richly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XII. BY BEING FILLED IN SPIRIT<br />
BY THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD AND<br />
LETTING THE WORD OF CHRIST DWELL IN US RICHLY</h2>
<p>We enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity by being filled in our spirit by the processed Triune God and letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly. Ephesians 5:18 says, &ldquo;Be filled in spirit,&rdquo; and Colossians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.&rdquo; These two parallel portions of Scripture admonish us to be filled in our spirit by the Triune God and to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly. When we are filled in our spirit by the processed Triune God and let the word of Christ dwell in us richly, we enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation.</p>
<p>Being filled in spirit is to be filled in our regenerated spirit, the human spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God. In Ephesians 5:18, according to the original Greek language, Paul does not say that we should be filled by the Spirit; he says that we should be filled in our spirit, that is, our regenerated spirit. Our spirit should not be empty; it should be filled with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God (3:19). If our spirit is filled with the riches of Christ, we will have no problems in our Christian life.</p>
<p>All the items in Ephesians 5:18&mdash;6:9 are related to being filled in spirit. All virtues are the issue of being filled in spirit by the processed Triune God. When we are filled in our spirit by the Spirit, wives are subject to their husbands, husbands love their wives, parents care for their children, slaves obey their masters, and masters treat their slaves in a proper way. The living out of these human virtues is the issue of being filled in spirit.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>be filled</em> in Ephesians 5:18 is in the active-passive voice. <em>Be</em> is active, and <em>filled</em> is passive. Therefore, <em>be filled</em> is active-passive. In God&rsquo;s economy, active-passive is a great matter.</p>
<p>The words of Peter in Acts 2:40 help us understand how <em>be filled</em> in Ephesians 5:18 is an active-passive matter. Peter exhorted the people, saying, &ldquo;Be saved from this crooked generation.&rdquo; <em>Be</em> is active, and <em>saved</em> is passive; hence, <em>be saved</em> is in the &ldquo;active-passive voice.&rdquo; Salvation is carried out by God, but man needs to be active to receive what God has done. At the time of Pentecost everything concerning God&rsquo;s full salvation was prepared, and the Holy Spirit was poured out as the application and full blessing of God&rsquo;s salvation, ready for man to receive. Now God is waiting for man, and man needs to take the initiative. Although we cannot save ourselves, we must be willing to be saved by God. God is willing and prepared to save us; we need to take the initiative to receive God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>The exhortation of Paul to &ldquo;be filled in spirit&rdquo; is in the same principle. Just as God has done everything necessary for us to be saved, He has done everything necessary for us to be filled in our regenerated spirit. Hence, just as we need to take action to be saved, we also need to take action to be filled in spirit. The Holy Spirit has been given to us and now dwells in our spirit with all the riches of Christ as God&rsquo;s fullness, prepared to fill us in our spirit. We need to cooperate with Him by taking action to be filled.</p>
<p>Many have the experience of not being wholly filled by the Spirit; they are filled only partially. This is due to the fact that they have many reservations. Instead of giving the Holy Spirit the ground to gain every part of their entire being, they are filled with many things and matters other than the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>We need to empty ourselves completely and give all the room in our spirit, mind, emotion, and will to the indwelling Spirit. The Spirit, as the consummation of the processed Triune God, indwells us, longing to fill our entire being. If we desire to have our spirit filled by the Spirit, we need to eliminate everything that occupies our spirit and allow the indwelling Spirit, as the consummation of the Triune God, to fully occupy us. If we are filled by the Spirit in our spirit, we will have a proper Christian life, church life, personal life, and family life.</p>
<p>We not only need to be filled in spirit by the processed Triune God; we also need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly. In Colossians 3:16 Paul says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.&rdquo; The word of Christ is the word spoken by Christ. In His New Testament economy, God speaks in the Son, and the Son speaks not only in the Gospels but also through His members, the apostles and prophets, in Acts through Revelation. All these books may be considered as His word.</p>
<p>The word of Christ includes the entire New Testament. We need to be filled with this word. This means that we should allow the word of Christ to dwell in us, to inhabit us, to make home in us. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;dwell&rdquo; in Colossians 3:16 means to be in a house, to inhabit. The word of the Lord must have adequate room within us so that it may operate and minister the riches of Christ into our inner being. Furthermore, the word of Christ must dwell in us richly. The riches of Christ are in His word (Eph. 3:8). Such a word must inhabit us. We should not simply receive it and confine it to a small area of our being. On the contrary, it should be given a free course to operate within us. In this way the word will inhabit and make home in us.</p>
<p>The word <em>dwell</em> in Colossians 3:16 indicates that the word of Christ actually is a person&mdash;Christ Himself. Since the word can dwell in us, make home in us, it must be a living person. Therefore, to let the word of Christ dwell in us indicates that we allow a living person&mdash;Christ Himself&mdash;to dwell in us.</p>
<p>Day by day when we come before the written Word, we should feel that this living and personified word of Christ is waiting for us and longing to dwell in us richly. Whenever we come before the written Word, we should have the assurance deep within that we are contacting the Lord Himself as the living Word. Therefore, when we receive the word of Christ, that is, Christ Himself, we should give the word the full freedom to make home in us. We should pray, &ldquo;Lord, I offer my whole being to You and to Your word. I give You access to every part of my inner being. Lord, make my inner being a home for Yourself and Your word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ephesians 5:18 charges us to be filled in spirit by the Triune God; Colossians 3:16 tells us to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly. Colossians is focused on Christ as our Head and life. The way for Christ to exercise His headship and minister His riches into us is through His word. Hence, the emphasis in Colossians is on the word of Christ. Ephesians is concerned with the church as the Body of Christ. The way for us to live a normal church life is to be filled in our spirit unto all the fullness of God. Hence, the Spirit is emphasized. In Ephesians both the Spirit and our spirit are emphasized again and again; the word is even considered to be the Spirit (6:17). However, in Colossians the Spirit is mentioned only once (1:8), and the human spirit is mentioned only once (2:5). In Ephesians the word is for washing away our natural life and fighting against the enemy (5:26; 6:17); in Colossians the word is for revealing Christ in His preeminence, centrality, and universality (1:25-27). This word, like the Spirit, is prepared to dwell in us, to occupy us, and to fill us, but we need to let the word dwell in us richly.</p>
<p>According to Ephesians 5:18-20 and Colossians 3:16-17 and the revelation in the New Testament, the word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the word. In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; In this chapter the Lord Jesus indicated that He would become the Spirit in order to give life. Then He said that the words which He speaks are spirit and life. This shows that His spoken words are the embodiment of the Spirit of life. He is now the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, and the Spirit is embodied in His words. When we receive His words by exercising our spirit, we receive the Spirit, who is life.</p>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,&rdquo; and in John 20:22 the Lord Jesus breathed into the disciples and said, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; At the beginning of the Gospel of John, the Lord was the Word; at the end of the Gospel, He breathed out the Spirit. This indicates that the Word and the Spirit are one. A further proof of this matter is seen in Ephesians 6:17, which says, &ldquo;Receive...the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.&rdquo; This verse indicates that the Spirit is the word of God, both of which are Christ (2 Cor. 3:17; Rev. 19:13).</p>
<p>Our Christian experience also proves that the word of God and the Spirit are one. It is wrong to think that we can take the Spirit without taking the word of God or that we can take the word of God without taking the Spirit. Without taking the word of God, we cannot have the Spirit. In our experience, we receive the Spirit mainly through the Word. When we contact the Word in a living way, it becomes the Spirit to us. Christ is both the Spirit and the Word. He cannot be the Spirit without being the Word, nor the Word without being the Spirit. Since He is both the Word and the Spirit, we need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly, and we also need to be filled in spirit by the Spirit.</p>
<p>Another portion of the Scriptures which proves that the Spirit and the word of God are one is 2 Timothy 3:16: &ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed.&rdquo; This shows that the Scriptures, the Word of God, are the breath of God. Every word of the Holy Scripture is God&rsquo;s breath, and this breath is <em>pneuma,</em> that is, spirit. The breath of God is His <em>pneuma,</em> the Spirit. The Spirit is the breath of God, and the word of God is also the breath of God. Therefore, the two are one. On the one hand, the word of God is the Spirit; on the other hand, the Spirit of God is the Word. Since God&rsquo;s speaking is God&rsquo;s breathing out, it is also the Spirit. This indicates that the Scriptures are the embodiment of God as the Spirit. The Spirit is the very essence, the substance, of the Scriptures, just as phosphorus is the essential substance in matches. We must strike the Spirit of the Scriptures with our spirit to catch the divine fire.</p>
<p>Since Christ is the Spirit, and He is also the Word, we must not separate the Spirit from the Word. It is dangerous to have the Spirit without the Word, because we would be unregulated and unrestricted. But having the Word without the Spirit is to be lifeless, because apart from the Spirit, the Word is just dead letters. Actually, the essence, the substance, the constituent, of the Word is the Spirit. Hence, we need to be filled in spirit by the Spirit and let the word of Christ dwell in us richly.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s economy, the Spirit is the Triune God&rsquo;s ultimate and consummate reaching of man. The Spirit&rsquo;s coming to us is the Triune God&rsquo;s reaching us. God gives us the Word with the Spirit. On the one hand, we have the Spirit as the ultimate and consummate reaching of the Triune God; on the other hand, we have the Word as the embodiment of the Spirit. Just as our life and our physical body are one entity, forming a complete, living organism, the Spirit and the Word are one. A person must have a visible and tangible body as well as an invisible and intangible life. In like manner, a believer needs the Word as well as the Spirit. That which makes the human body living and active is the invisible life within; that which makes the Word living and effectual is the Spirit. This indicates that the Spirit and the Word are one. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy depends on the Word and the Spirit. We need the Word as the body and the Spirit as life.</p>
<p>Since the Word and the Spirit are one, we should let the Word of Christ dwell in us richly, and we should also be filled in our spirit by the Spirit. We should avoid two extremes: one extreme is that of the fundamentalists, who care for the Word but often neglect the Spirit, and the other extreme is that of the Pentecostals, who care for the Spirit but often neglect the Word. We should not be in either of these two extremes; we should be balanced, caring for the Spirit and for the Word. We have the Spirit in us, and we have the Word, the Scriptures, in our hand.</p>
<p>To enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for our divine conformation, we need to be filled in our spirit by the processed Triune God, who is now the all-inclusive Spirit, and we also need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly, making home in our heart.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>For the divine conformation we, the believers, need to be filled in spirit by the Spirit and let the word of Christ dwell in us richly. To be filled in spirit is to be filled in our regenerated spirit, our human spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God. Our spirit should not be empty; it should be filled with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God. In this way we will have a normal Christian life, church life, personal life, and family life, and we will live out all the virtues of humanity with wives being subject to their husbands, husbands loving their wives, parents caring for their children, slaves obeying their masters, and masters treating their slaves in a proper way.</p>
<p><em>Be filled</em> is in the active-passive voice. God has done all the necessary things, and the Holy Spirit has been given to us, the believers, and is now abiding in our spirit with all the riches of Christ as the fullness of God, ready to fill us in our spirit. Now we need to take action to cooperate with God so that we may be filled with the Spirit. We need to completely empty ourselves and give all the room to the indwelling Spirit in our spirit, mind, emotion, and will, thus allowing the indwelling Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God to fully occupy us.</p>
<p>We should let the word of Christ dwell in us richly. The riches of Christ are in His word. The word of Christ is the word spoken by Christ; it includes the entire New Testament. To be filled with the word of Christ means to let the word of Christ dwell in us, that is, to let it richly make home in us, having adequate room to operate in us, so that it may minister the riches of Christ into our inner being, making our inner man the home of Christ and of His rich word.</p>
<p>According to the revelation of the New Testament, the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Word. In resurrection the Lord is the life-giving Spirit, and the Spirit is embodied in the Word. When we exercise our spirit to receive the word of the Lord, we receive the Spirit who is life. The Spirit is the consummated Triune God reaching man; God always gives the believers the Spirit with the Word. Hence, in the experience of the believers, the Word of God and the Spirit are one and both are Christ Himself. Because Christ is both the Word and the Spirit, we need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly, and we also need to be filled in our spirit by the Spirit.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In the previous lesson we saw that by being filled in spirit by the processed Triune God and letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly (Eph. 5:18; Col. 3:16), we experience and enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation. In this lesson we will look at two aspects of the living produced by this kind of filling and indwelling.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Living a Life That Matches the New Man<br />
in Grace and Reality</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The New Man Being Corporate<br />
and Having Christ as the Constituent</h2>
<p>When we are filled in spirit by the Spirit and let the word of Christ dwell in us richly, we live a life that matches the new man in grace and reality (Eph. 4:21, 24, 29). In 4:24 Paul says that we have &ldquo;put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.&rdquo; The new man is of Christ. It is His Body, created in Him on the cross (2:15-16). It is not individual but corporate (Col. 3:10-11), created of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles, and composed of all the believers of different races. In this corporate new man there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all. This indicates that in the new man, Christ is all the people, and Christ is also in all the people. This also indicates that Christ is the constituent of the corporate new man.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Living, as Jesus Did on Earth, a Life<br />
Full of Grace and Reality</h2>
<p>The corporate new man should live a life, as Jesus did on earth, that is, a life of reality that expresses God and causes God to be realized as the reality by man (Eph. 4:21).</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:17-32 describes the believers&rsquo; daily living with reality and grace as the basic elements. In this portion of the Scriptures Paul indicates that our living should be like the living of Jesus, a living full of grace and reality (John 1:14, 17). Grace is God given to us for our enjoyment; reality is God revealed to us as our reality. When we live reality and speak reality (Eph. 4:21, 24), we express God as our reality, and others receive God from us as grace to be their enjoyment (v. 29).</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Grace Being the Enjoyment of the Triune God<br />
in All That He Is to Us</h2>
<p>Grace is the enjoyment of the Triune God in all that He is to us. When He is life to us, that is grace. When He is power to us, that also is grace. Grace is Christ being subjective to us as our enjoyment. Daily, even hourly, we need the enjoyment of Christ as our life, our power, and everything to us. The Triune God has come to us so that we may gain Him, experience Him, and enjoy Him. When we experience Him as our enjoyment, He becomes grace to us.</p>
<p>In Paul&rsquo;s exhortation in 4:17-32, reality is clearly mentioned, but grace is somewhat hidden, being implied in the details related to our daily living. If we are short of grace, we cannot meet the standard in relation to these details. The principles for our learning Christ (v. 20) are related to reality, whereas the details are related to grace. If we would be conformed to the image of Christ, that is, if we would learn Christ, we need both the principles and the details. If we have reality, we have the principles; if we have grace, we will meet the standard in all the details.</p>
<p>If we are filled with grace, then in place of bitterness, wrath, anger, and clamor, we will have kindness, patience, mercy, forgiveness, and love. These qualities do not come from self-effort but from Christ as our enjoyment. When we enjoy Christ, we have no appetite for bitterness, wrath, anger, or clamor. Instead, we desire to have kindness, patience, endurance, gentleness, mercy, love, and other virtues and qualities. What a difference it makes in our daily living when we are happy and satisfied through the enjoyment of God in Christ as grace!</p>
<p>Verse 29 says, &ldquo;Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for building up, according to the need, that it may give grace to those who hear.&rdquo; This shows that the word out of our mouth should give grace to those who hear and convey grace to others. The word that builds up others always ministers grace to the hearer. Our word should communicate God in Christ as enjoyment, imparting Christ to others as their life supply.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Reality Being the Revealed God</h2>
<p>According to the New Testament, reality is God revealed. Because grace and reality came through Jesus Christ (John 1:17), they must be something of God Himself. Jesus is God coming to us. When He comes, everything related to His being also comes. God comes to us for our enjoyment. This is grace. God also comes to reveal Himself to us. This is reality. In other words, when God is enjoyed by us, He is grace, but when He is revealed to us, He is reality. Reality is God revealed to us.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:21 says, &ldquo;If indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus.&rdquo; The phrase <em>the reality is in Jesus</em> refers to the actual condition of the life of Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels. In the ungodly walk of the Gentiles, the fallen people, there is vanity (v. 17), but in the godly life of Jesus there is truth&mdash;reality. Jesus lived a life in which He did everything in God, with God, and for God. God was in His living, and He was one with God. This is the meaning of <em>the reality is in Jesus</em>. We, the believers, who are regenerated with Christ as our life and are taught in Him, should learn from Him as the reality is in Jesus.</p>
<p>The life of Jesus according to reality is the pattern for the believers&rsquo; life. In this pattern we have learned Christ as the reality is in Jesus. This means that we have learned Christ according to the reality shown in the Gospels, that is, according to the life of the Lord Jesus. This life is the shining of light. The shining of light is reality, and reality is the expression of God. Therefore, in the life of Jesus there is reality. The essence of the life of Jesus is reality. When the Lord Jesus lived on the earth, He always walked in reality, in the shining of the divine light, and in the expression of God.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:17-24 depicts the principle of our renewed daily living for the learning of Christ. This principle is the reality, the living of the Lord Jesus when He was on earth. The Lord&rsquo;s living was one of always putting off His human life and putting on the Father&rsquo;s divine life. This is the life of Jesus, and this life is the reality that is the principle of a life of learning Christ. According to this principle, we put off the old man and put on the new man. Now by being filled in our regenerated spirit by the processed Triune God and letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly, we live a life that matches the new man in grace and reality.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Living a Life That Matches<br />
the Wife of Christ in Love and Light</h2>
<p>Another result of being filled in spirit by the processed Triune God and letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly is that we live a life that matches the wife of Christ in love and light (5:22-25). As grace and reality (truth) are the basic elements in Ephesians 4:17-32, so love and light are the basic elements in 5:1-33. Grace is the expression of love, and love is the source of grace. Truth is the revelation of light, and light is the origin of reality. God is love and light (1 John 4:8; 1:5). When God is expressed and revealed in the Lord Jesus, His love becomes grace, and His light becomes truth. After we have received God as grace and realized Him as truth in the Lord Jesus, we come to Him and enjoy His love and light. Love and light are deeper than grace and truth. Hence, Paul takes grace and truth as the basic elements of the living that matches the new man and then takes love and light as the elements of the living that matches the wife of Christ. This implies that we should grow deeper in our daily life to progress from the outward elements to the inward.</p>
<p>Love is the inner substance of God, whereas light is the expressed element of God. It is possible to sense the love of God inwardly, and it is possible to see the light of God shining out. Our walk in love should be constituted of the loving substance and the shining element of God. Love and light should be the inner source of our walk, which are deeper than grace and truth.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5:2 says, &ldquo;Walk in love, even as Christ also loved us and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor.&rdquo; Here Paul sets forth Christ as an example for our living. In 4:32 God in Christ is our pattern since God&rsquo;s grace and reality (truth) expressed in the life of Jesus are taken as the basic elements. But in chapter 5 Christ Himself is our example since the love expressed by Christ to us (vv. 2, 25) and the light shined by Christ upon us (v. 14) are taken as the basic elements.</p>
<p>In verse 8 Paul says, &ldquo;You were once darkness but are now light in the Lord; walk as children of light.&rdquo; We were once not only dark but darkness itself. We are now not only the children of light but light itself (Matt. 5:14). As light is God, so darkness is Satan. We were darkness because we were one with Satan. Now we are light because we are one with God in the Lord. Because we are now light in the Lord, we should walk as children of light. We should not simply be according to reality and by grace, but in love and under light. Walking in love and in light is deeper and more tender than living according to reality and by grace.</p>
<p>After charging us to walk as children of light, Paul speaks of the fruit of the light: &ldquo;The fruit of the light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth&rdquo; (Eph. 5:9). Goodness is the nature of the fruit of the light, righteousness is the way or the procedure to produce the fruit of the light, and the truth is the reality, the real expression of the fruit of the light. This expression is God Himself. The fruit of the light must be good in nature, righteous in procedure, and real in expression so that God may be expressed as the reality of our daily walk.</p>
<p>In speaking of the fruit of the light, Paul mentions three things&mdash;goodness, righteousness, and truth&mdash;because these three are related to the Triune God. Goodness refers to the nature of the fruit of light. The Lord Jesus indicated that the only One who is good is God Himself (Matt. 19:17). Hence, goodness denotes God the Father. God the Father as goodness is the nature of the fruit of the light.</p>
<p>Righteousness is the procedure by which the fruit of the light is produced. In the Godhead, the Son, Christ, is our righteousness. He came to earth to produce certain things according to God&rsquo;s procedure, which is always righteous. Righteousness is God&rsquo;s way, God&rsquo;s procedure. Christ came to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose according to His righteous procedure (Rom. 5:17-18, 21). Therefore, the second aspect of the fruit of the light refers to God the Son.</p>
<p>Truth is the expression of the fruit of the light. This fruit must be real; that is, it must be the expression of God, the shining of the hidden light. No doubt, this truth refers to God the Spirit, because He is the Spirit of reality (John 14:17), the third in the Godhead. Therefore, the Father as goodness, the Son as righteousness, and the Spirit of reality as truth are all related to the fruit of the light. If we walk as children of light, we will bear the fruit described in Ephesians 5:9. This fruit must be in goodness, in righteousness, and in truth, and it proves that we are walking as children of light.</p>
<p>We first receive God as grace and realize God as reality in Christ. Then we enjoy God as love and light. Love and light are the inward elements, whereas grace and reality are the outward elements. Love is the inner substance of God that can be sensed, and light is the expressed element of God that can be seen. Both love and light must be the inner source of the believers&rsquo; daily walk.</p>
<p>We need to remember that the church life according to God&rsquo;s desire must be in love and in light, both of which are the very elements of God Himself. In the inner substance of God we have love and light. The goal of Ephesians is to bring us into God&rsquo;s inner substance to know Him as love and light. Here we can live in intimate fellowship as we enjoy His shining light and sweet love by being filled in spirit by the Spirit and letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>By being filled in spirit by the Spirit and letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly, we live a life that matches the new man in grace and reality. This new man is corporate; it is the Body of Christ, having Christ as its constituent, and it was created by Him on the cross in Himself. The corporate new man should live, as Jesus did on earth, a life full of grace and reality, a life that expresses God Himself and causes God to be realized as the reality by people so that they may receive God as grace to be their enjoyment.</p>
<p>Grace is the enjoyment of the Triune God in all that He is to the believers. Grace is Christ being subjective to the believers, becoming their enjoyment. When we experience the Triune God who has come to us as our enjoyment, He becomes grace to us. This grace is related to the details of learning Christ, and it enables us to meet the standard in the details of our daily living, to be happy and satisfied through the enjoyment of God as grace and to supply grace by the word out of our mouth to those who hear.</p>
<p>Reality is God revealed. In the ungodly walk of the Gentiles, the fallen people, there is vanity, but in the godly life of Jesus there is reality, because in His living He did everything in God, with God, and for God, and He was one with God. This life of reality, which is the shining of light and the expression of God, is a pattern to the believers to learn Christ and to have the principle of a renewed daily life.</p>
<p>By being filled in spirit by the Spirit and letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly, we also live a life that matches the wife of Christ in love and light. Love is the source of grace and the inward substance of God that can be sensed. Light is the origin of reality and the expressed element of God that can be seen. Love and light should be the inner source of the believers&rsquo; daily walk; this is the church life according to God&rsquo;s desire. In the Lord Jesus, as believers, we receive God as grace and realize God as truth. Then we come to God to enjoy His love and light, taking Christ as the example for our living and walking in love and light as children of light.</p>
<p>The fruit of the light is in goodness, righteousness, and truth; it is proof that we are walking as children of light. These three items are related to the Triune God. Goodness denotes God the Father. God the Father as goodness is the nature of the fruit of the light. Righteousness denotes Christ the Son. Christ the Son as the righteousness of the believers came to earth to produce certain things according to God&rsquo;s righteous procedure for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s purpose. Truth denotes God the Spirit because He is the Spirit of reality.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>The believers, by being filled in spirit by the processed Triune God and letting the word of Christ dwell in them richly (Eph. 5:18; Col. 3:16), experience and enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation. When we are filled in our spirit by the Spirit and let the word of Christ make home in us, we spontaneously live a life that matches the new man in grace and truth and the wife of Christ in love and light. When we are filled in our spirit by the Spirit and saturated with the word of Christ, we will also speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ to live a proper human life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Speaking to One Another<br />
in Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs,<br />
Singing and Psalming with Our Heart to the Lord,<br />
Giving Thanks at All Times for All Things<br />
in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ<br />
to Our God and Father</h2>
<p>When we are filled in spirit by the processed Triune God and let the word of Christ dwell in us richly, we will speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with our heart to the Lord, giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father. After charging us to be filled in spirit (Eph. 5:18), Paul continues, saying, &ldquo;Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord&rdquo; (v. 19). Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are not only for singing and psalming but also for speaking to one another. Such speaking, singing, and psalming are not only the outflow of being filled in spirit but also the way to be filled in spirit. Psalms are long poems, hymns are shorter poems, and spiritual songs are poems that are still shorter. All are needed in order for us to be filled with the Lord and to overflow with Him in our Christian life.</p>
<p>Singing may be short. Psalming is always long. Sometimes by only singing we cannot express what is within us to praise the Lord; we need psalming to pour out our praise to the Lord adequately.</p>
<p>Verse 20 says, &ldquo;Giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father.&rdquo; We should give thanks to God the Father not only in good times but at all times, and not only for good things but for all things. Even in bad times we should give thanks to God our Father for all things. Furthermore, we should give thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. The reality of the name of the Lord is His person. To be in the Lord&rsquo;s name is to be in His person, in Himself. This implies that we should be one with the Lord in giving thanks to God.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.&rdquo; Here, the infilling of spiritual life that outflows in praising and singing is related to the word, but in Ephesians 5:18-20 the infilling of spiritual life is related to the Spirit. This indicates that the word is the Spirit (John 6:63). A normal Christian life should be one that is filled with the word so that the Spirit may bubble over with praise and lauding melodies from within the believers.</p>
<p>According to Colossians 3:16, when the word of Christ dwells in us richly, we will teach and admonish one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in our hearts to God. Teaching, admonishing, and singing are related to the verb <em>dwell.</em> This indicates that the way to let the Lord&rsquo;s word dwell in us richly is by teaching, admonishing, and singing. We should teach and admonish not only in words but also in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.</p>
<p>Verse 16 also indicates that when we are filled with the word of Christ, we should be filled with joy. If we receive the Lord&rsquo;s word yet have no joy, something must be wrong. When we receive the word of Christ, we actually receive the Spirit. Receiving the Spirit should stir us up and cause us to be joyful and to sing.</p>
<p>Verse 17 says, &ldquo;Whatever you do in word or in deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.&rdquo; This is the result of letting the word of Christ dwell in us. To do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus is related to letting the word of Christ saturate and fill us. The word of Christ is actually the embodiment of Christ. Hence, when the word as the embodiment of Christ is mingled with our inner being, we are one with Christ, and spontaneously we are able to act in the name of the Lord. Because the Lord has saturated us and filled us, and because He has mingled Himself with us, making us one with Him, we can do all things in His name. Doing things in the Lord&rsquo;s name is to do things in Him. The name denotes the person. The Lord&rsquo;s person is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). Therefore, to do things in the Lord&rsquo;s name is to act in the Spirit.</p>
<p>When we come to the word of the Lord, many of us use only our mind to search the Scriptures. We do not sufficiently exercise our emotion to love the word of the Lord, nor do we strongly exercise our will to receive the word of the Lord. But if we exercise our whole being to take in the Lord&rsquo;s word, ultimately we will be filled, occupied, and saturated by the living word. Since the word is the embodiment of the Spirit and since the Spirit is the reality of Christ, we are automatically filled with Christ when we are filled with the word. Then whatever we do or say will be in the name of Christ. This is to live Christ. When we are saturated with the word of Christ through the Spirit, we automatically live Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Being Subject to One Another<br />
in the Fear of Christ<br />
to Live a Proper Human Life</h2>
<p>By being filled in our spirit by the Spirit and letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly, we are also subject to one another in the fear of Christ to live a proper human life. Ephesians 5:21 says, &ldquo;Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ.&rdquo; Being subject to one another is an overflow of being filled in spirit. Our subjection should be to one another, not only the younger to the older but also the older to the younger (1 Pet. 5:5).</p>
<p>We should be subject to one another in the fear of Christ. According to the context of the following verses in Ephesians 5, being in the fear of Christ is to fear offending Christ as the Head. This is related to His headship (v. 23) and involves being subject to one another. Christ is the Head of the Body. If we mistreat any member of the Body, we offend the Head of the Body. We need to keep the relationship with the members of the Body in the fear of the Head.</p>
<p>A life of subjection is a life of being filled in spirit and of speaking, singing, psalming, and giving thanks. When we speak, sing, praise, and give thanks in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we are willing to submit ourselves to one another. We will submit to Christ as the Head and also to the Body. But this submitting comes from speaking, singing, psalming, and giving of thanks, which in turn come from infilling. When we are filled in our spirit, we sing, psalm, speak, and give thanks; we also submit spontaneously. If we are not filled, there will be no speaking, singing, psalming, or thanking of God; consequently, there will be no submission. Proper members are submissive by speaking, singing, psalming, and giving thanks to God from their inner being, living in the way of being filled in spirit with all the riches of Christ unto the fullness of God.</p>
<p>We are subject to one another in the fear of Christ to live a proper human life. God desires that Christ be expressed through our human life. This is seen in Colossians 3:18&mdash;4:1, a sister passage to Ephesians 5:22&mdash;6:9, regarding the believers&rsquo; life in ethical relationships. Ephesians emphasizes the need of spirit-filled ethical relationships for the expression of the Body in the normal church life. Colossians emphasizes that we should hold Christ as our Head and take Him as our life by having His rich word dwelling in us so that the highest ethical relationships, issuing not from our natural life but from Christ as our life, may be realized for His expression.</p>
<p>If we live in union with Christ by letting His word saturate us, Christ will be expressed through our humanity. Hence, our living as believers in union with Christ should result in the expression of Christ in our human life. If we realize this, we will praise the Lord for our human living. In relationships between wife and husband, between children and parents, and between slave and master, we need to express Christ by being filled in spirit by the Spirit and letting the word of Christ saturate us.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Wives Being Subject to<br />
Their Own Husbands as to the Lord</h2>
<p>The relationship between wives and husbands is connected to the matter of being filled in spirit and letting the word of Christ saturate us. It is an aspect of the daily living of those who are filled in spirit unto all the fullness of God. Therefore, when we speak about the relationship between wives and husbands, we should not neglect the infilling. We can have a proper married life only by being filled in our spirit.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 5:22 Paul says, &ldquo;Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord.&rdquo; Concerning this matter, Colossians 3:18 says, &ldquo;Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.&rdquo; Wives need to be subject to their own husbands, no matter what kind of husbands they are. Furthermore, wives should be subject to their own husbands &ldquo;as to the Lord.&rdquo; Wives need to realize that in the eyes of the Lord the husband represents the Lord. A wife must submit to her own husband because in the married life he is as the Lord. Since Christ is the Head of the church and the Savior of the Body, the wife should be subject to her husband as to the Lord.</p>
<p>Wives must also take their husbands as the head. Ephesians 5:23 says, &ldquo;A husband is head of the wife as also Christ is Head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the Body.&rdquo; The husband as the head of the wife signifies Christ as the Head of the church. Christ&rsquo;s being the Head is a matter of authority, whereas His being the Savior is a matter of love. We must be subject to Him as our Head, and we must love Him as our Savior. It should be the same in the relationship between wives and husbands.</p>
<p>In verse 24 Paul says, &ldquo;As the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be subject to their husbands in everything.&rdquo; The thought here is that even though husbands are not the savior of their wives in the way that Christ is the Savior of the church, wives still need to be subject to their husbands as the church is to Christ. Wives being subject to the husband is the result of being filled in spirit by the Spirit and saturated by the word of Christ.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Husbands Loving Their Wives<br />
as Christ Loved the Church</h2>
<p>Both Ephesians 5:25 and Colossians 3:19 say that husbands should love their wives. The opposite of subjection is ruling. However, Paul does not exhort husbands to rule over their wives but to love them. In married life, the wife&rsquo;s obligation is to be subject and the husband&rsquo;s obligation is to love. A wife&rsquo;s subjection plus a husband&rsquo;s love constitutes a proper married life and typifies the normal church life in which the church is subject to Christ and Christ loves the church.</p>
<p>By being filled in spirit and saturated by the word of Christ, husbands will love their wives &ldquo;even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her&rdquo; (Eph. 5:25). A husband&rsquo;s love for his wife must be like Christ&rsquo;s love for the church. This means that a husband should give himself up for his wife. To give oneself up is to sacrifice one&rsquo;s life. Husbands should love their wives at such a cost to themselves. They must be willing to pay a great price, even to die for their wives.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5:28 says, &ldquo;In the same way the husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his own wife loves himself.&rdquo; In this verse Paul twice speaks of husbands loving their own wives. This indicates that a husband is to love his wife without comparing her to others. Not only so, husbands should love their own wives as their own bodies. A husband should regard his wife as part of his body and care for her as his own body.</p>
<p>Verse 29 says, &ldquo;No one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church.&rdquo; We show love for our body by nourishing and cherishing it. To nourish is to feed. Spiritually speaking, husbands should nourish their wives. Just as we eat for the sake of our body, a husband needs to nourish his wife, to take care of her need, just as he takes care of the need of his own body. This is the meaning of <em>nourishes</em> in verse 29.</p>
<p>Husbands should also love their wives as their own bodies by cherishing their wives. To cherish is to nurture with tender love and foster with tender care. To cherish something is to care for it deeply and tenderly. It is to soften it through tender warmth. This is the way Christ cares for the church, His Body. This should also be the way for husbands to love their wives. Here we see the depth of love that a husband must have for his wife.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Children Obeying Their Parents in the Lord<br />
and Honoring Them</h2>
<p>Ephesians 6:1 says, &ldquo;Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.&rdquo; Colossians 3:20 says, &ldquo;Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing in the Lord.&rdquo; The children of the believers are not common. They are different from the children of people in the world. Therefore, the children in the families of believers are exhorted to obey their parents in the Lord.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>in the Lord</em> indicates obedience to the parents by being one with the Lord. It also indicates that this should be done not by self-effort but by the Lord, and not according to the natural concept but according to the Lord&rsquo;s word. The children of believers should realize that they are to obey their parents by being one with the Lord. Moreover, they obey their parents not by their own strength but by the Lord Himself. Their obedience is according to the Lord&rsquo;s word, according to the Scriptures.</p>
<p>Ephesians 6:2-3 says, &ldquo;&lsquo;Honor your father and mother,&rsquo; which is the first commandment with a promise, &lsquo;that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth.&rsquo;&rdquo; This is not only the first commandment with a promise but also the first commandment concerning man&rsquo;s relationship with man (Exo. 20:12). The promise in verse 3 is that it may be well with the children and that they may live long on the earth. The first part of the promise is related to prosperity in material blessing; it also refers to living in a peaceful situation. The second part is related to longevity. According to this commandment, prosperity and longevity are God&rsquo;s blessings in this life to those who honor their parents.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Fathers Not Provoking Their Children<br />
to Anger, but Nurturing Them<br />
in the Discipline and Admonition<br />
of the Lord</h2>
<p>Ephesians 6:4 says, &ldquo;Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.&rdquo; Colossians 3:21 says, &ldquo;Fathers, do not vex your children, that they may not be disheartened.&rdquo; Provoking children to anger damages them by stirring up their flesh. It is always destructive for parents to be angry with their children. Not provoking children&rsquo;s anger requires the fathers&rsquo; anger to be dealt with by remaining on the cross. In this way fathers are able to render suitable discipline to their children. The only way we can keep from losing our temper is to stay on the cross. In dealing with our children&rsquo;s wrongdoings or misbehavior, we first must go to the cross and stay there. Otherwise, we will lose our temper, and this loss of temper will provoke our children&rsquo;s anger.</p>
<p>Instead of provoking the children to anger, fathers should nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord. To nurture children means to bring them up, to raise them, by nourishing them. Raising children requires that the parents give them needed instruction related to human life, family life, and social life. The word <em>admonition</em> includes instruction. Paul was probably referring to the Old Testament requirement that parents instruct their children with the word of God (Deut. 6:7). This means that we are to teach our children with the Bible. Along with instruction, we must sometimes discipline them, chastise them. It is crucial that parents learn to nurture the children in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Slaves Being Obedient<br />
to Their Masters as to Christ, and<br />
as Slaves of Christ Doing the Will of God</h2>
<p>Ephesians 6:5 says, &ldquo;Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ.&rdquo; In the apostle&rsquo;s time, slaves were purchased by their masters, and their masters had the right over their lives. Some slaves and some masters became brothers in the church. As brothers in the church, they were equal and without distinction, but in their homes, those who were slaves still had to obey the brothers who were their masters according to flesh.</p>
<p>Paul exhorts the slaves to obey with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart, as to Christ. Fear is the inward motive for service, and trembling is the outward attitude. Singleness means to be pure in motive, having a single purpose. Slaves are to be single in this way; they should not have a double purpose; that is, they should not serve their masters with the intention of receiving some gain for themselves.</p>
<p>Slaves are to be in obedience to their masters as to Christ. This means that slaves are to regard their masters as if they were the Lord. The relationship between slaves and masters is a type of our relationship with Christ, our Master. We should obey Him as a slave in singleness of heart.</p>
<p>Verses 6 and 7 say, &ldquo;Not with eye-service as men-pleasers but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul; with good will serving as slaves, as serving the Lord and not men.&rdquo; If a brother in slavery stands in his position and obeys his master, he is a slave of Christ in the eyes of the Lord, he is doing the will of God, and his service is to the Lord, not to men. Such a slave does the will of God from the soul. From the soul equals from the heart, from the inner being. This means to serve not only with the physical body but with the heart. Slaves should serve &ldquo;as to the Lord and not to men&rdquo; (Col. 3:23). This indicates that Paul&rsquo;s intention was to direct slaves to the Lord. His desire was that they would learn to serve their masters as to the Lord.</p>
<p>The admonition Paul gives to slaves in Colossians 3:22-23 is very similar to Ephesians 6:5-7. In Colossians 3:24 he says, &ldquo;Knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as recompense. You serve the Lord Christ.&rdquo; There is an inheritance for the believers (Rom. 8:17; Acts 26:18; 1 Pet. 1:4). The inheritance as recompense indicates that the Lord uses the inheritance which He will give His believers as an incentive so that they may be faithful in their service to Him. The unfaithful ones will surely miss this reward (Matt. 24:45-51; 25:20-29).</p><h2 class="head3">6. Masters Doing the Same Things<br />
toward the Slaves, Giving Up Threatening</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 6:9 Paul says, &ldquo;Masters, do the same things toward them, giving up your threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in the heavens, and there is no respect of persons with Him.&rdquo; In Colossians 4:1 he says, &ldquo;Masters, grant to your slaves that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.&rdquo; The masters who have the right over the lives of their purchased slaves should give up threatening because the Lord in the heavens is the real Master of both. In the flesh some may be slaves and others may be masters, but in the eyes of the Lord there is no difference between slaves and masters. According to Colossians 3:11, there is no slave or free man in the new man. In the church we are all brothers. However, in the flesh there is still a distinction between slaves and masters.</p>
<p>In his exhortations to wives, husbands, children, fathers, slaves, and masters, Paul makes one key point: For the sake of the church life, we need to have a proper human living in this present age. This is an extremely important lesson for us to learn. We live such a human life, not by self-effort but by being filled in our regenerated spirit by the processed Triune God and by letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly, filling and saturating our inner being.</p>
<p>When we are filled by the processed Triune God and let the word of Christ, which is the embodiment of the Triune God, dwell in us richly, we will be filled, saturated, and permeated with the Triune God. Spontaneously, we will speak, teach, and admonish one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father. Spontaneously, we will be subject to one another in the fear of Christ and live a proper human life with wives being subject to their own husbands, husbands loving their own wives, children obeying their parents, fathers nurturing their children, slaves obeying their masters, and masters treating their slaves justly. This is the result of being filled in spirit by the Spirit and letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly.</p>
<p>The important point is that when we are filled in spirit by the Spirit and saturated with the word of Christ, we enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation. By this kind of dispensing in the divine transformation, we are conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son, Christ, to be the corporate expression of God in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>When the believers are filled in spirit by the Spirit and saturated with the word of Christ, the result is speaking to one another and teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs so that we are filled by the Lord and overflow Him. When we are filled with the word of Christ, we will be filled with joy so that we will sing and psalm to the Lord. Furthermore, when the word as the embodiment of Christ dwells in us and is mingled with our inner being, spontaneously we will do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that is, act in the Spirit, giving thanks at all times to our God and Father.</p>
<p>Finally, by being filled in spirit by the Spirit and by letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly, we will be subject to one another in the fear of Christ to live a proper human life. This is to keep a relationship between the members of the Body in the fear of the Head. This life of subjection comes from speaking, singing, psalming, and giving thanks, which in turn come from the infilling. God desires that Christ be expressed through the believers&rsquo; human life. For this, we need to have spirit-filled ethical relationships which come from Christ as our life, not from our natural life.</p>
<p>The result of the believers&rsquo; living in union with Christ is the expression of Christ in our human life. In the proper married life, wives are subject to their own husbands as to the Lord, and husbands love their wives as Christ loved the church and as they love their own bodies, caring for the needs of their wives by nourishing and cherishing them. In a normal family life, children obey and honor their parents in the Lord by being one with the Lord, not by self-effort but by the Lord, and not according to the natural concept but according to the word of the Lord. Instead of provoking their children to anger, fathers leave their anger on the cross and nurture their children in the discipline and admonition of the Lord. In the relationship between slaves and masters, slaves obey their masters as obeying the Lord, as slaves of Christ doing the will of God, and masters do the same toward their slaves, giving up threatening.</p>
<p>When we are filled in spirit by the Spirit and saturated with the word of Christ, we will spontaneously live a proper human life. Then we will enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation so that we are conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son, Christ, to be the corporate expression of God in Christ.</p>
