   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SAVED?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Issue No. 17 Scripture Reading: Heb 10:19-22</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Scriptures that we have just read, the portion after the phrase "let us" tells us what we should do, while the portion before it tells us what the Lord has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since we have obtained so much, we need to draw nigh unto God with a true heart and in full assurance of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here is something that deserves our special attention.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is a great difference between the New Testament and the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the New Testament one starts from a position to which he has already attained and proceeds step by step onward, whereas in the Old Testament one starts by advancing step by step until he attains to a certain position.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In other words, in the Old Testament men did not have any position at all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was like students taking an entrance examination for a school; there was no assurance that they had been accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those in the Old Testament had no assurance before God at all; everyone was under the test.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is why they had to try their best to worship God and please Him, hoping that one day they would receive a position before God and have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The reverse is true in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Blessed is the man who knows that the New Testament is the reverse of the Old Testament!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The New Testament is entirely different from the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Old Testament requires that man try his best to draw near to God and win a position.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The New Testament begins by giving men a position.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, that position never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every New Testament believer has received his position in Christ; he has received eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After this he draws nigh to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Old Testament one has to try his best to draw nigh to God before he can secure a position for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the New Testament a position has been secured, and one comes to God with a true heart in full assurance of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brothers and sisters, today I wish to point out one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should stand in the position that God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A while ago many people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Please remember that the first work a newly saved person has to do is to clearly recognize the position in which he is standing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I can tell you today that God's Word has made it plain that everyone who is in the Lord has obtained a position.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that he is a child of God and can draw nigh to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the work we have at present is based on the fact that we have obtained a position.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We do not work hard before we become saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All those who have this kind of concept do not know God and do not know His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I would like to tell you a few stories.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once I was preaching the gospel at one place for about six to seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I asked the audience at the end, "Do you believe in Jesus?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many people answered boldly, "Yes, I do."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I asked further, "If you have believed, what have you received?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many of them could not answer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Later on I said, "Whosoever knows that he is saved, please raise up his hand."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There were about six hundred people in the congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But only three hands were raised.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The three persons were not actually from that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They were saved through my preaching elsewhere, and I had brought them there with me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There were six hundred people who believed in the Lord, but there were not even three who were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This was indeed strange.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 1924 I preached in Changchow for more than ten days and asked the same question.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I asked if they had believed in Jesus as their Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>More than a thousand hands were raised.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But when I asked again, "Now that you have believed, do you know that you have eternal life, that you will not perish, and that once you believe, you are saved forever?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It was most amazing!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Just a minute before, a thousand hands were raised.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But now not a single hand was raised from the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only my translator on the platform raised his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I told them, "The Lord says that he who believes has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You have believed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Why do you not know that you have eternal life?"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Another time, at a meeting with more than a thousand people, I asked if they believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Over a thousand hands were raised simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When I asked again if they were saved, there were only twelve to thirteen hands.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Why was there such a big difference in the number of hands?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There were over a thousand believers, but only slightly more than ten thought they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Does this mean that Christ is not dependable?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Suppose a doctor posted a sign saying, "All patients will be cured."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you ask him, "How many patients do you have?" he may say, "Over a thousand."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you ask him again, "How many have been cured?" and he says, "Eleven or twelve out of a thousand were cured," you will surely say that this doctor is not dependable.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many consulted him, but few were cured.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If more than a thousand believed in the Lord Jesus but only eleven to twelve are saved, this means that He is not dependable.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Another time I was holding meetings in a certain county around Swatow.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I found that even many elders, pastors, deacons, and those who were supposed to be teaching others were themselves ignorant of this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They preached salvation to others, yet they themselves did not understand or know their own position.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They did not know that once a person believes, he has eternal life and will not perish.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They did not have any assurance about this matter.</S>
