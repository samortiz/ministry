   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO HOW GOD DEALS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH THE BELIEVERS' SINS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>DISCIPLINE IN THE KINGDOM 1 SUFFERING GOD'S DISCIPLINE IN THE COMING AGE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible tells us that the Lord disciplines us because He loves us Heb 12:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When man loves, he overlooks.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when God loves, He disciplines.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When man loves, he is loose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But when God loves, He is serious.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If God had not loved us, He would not have sent His Son to die for our sins on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Similarly, if God does not love us, He would not discipline us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's disciplining love is the same as His saving love, which caused Him to send His Son to die for us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was His love that caused His Son to die on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is also His love that disciplines us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every Christian knows that there is no contradiction between God's discipline and God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the contrary, God's discipline manifests God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although we have seen that a man cannot perish again after he is saved, we can never say that such a one will never suffer God's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now the question is whether God's discipline is confined to this age or whether it will be found in the coming age as well.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a question that many people have never considered.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We will take a look at this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible shows us that God's discipline is not restricted to this age only.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is also found in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many people have confined God's discipline to this age.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But you cannot find the basis for such a teaching in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In terms of the experience of Christians, there is surely the possibility for discipline in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many have not been disciplined in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although they are God's children, they have not lived a consecrated life in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They do whatever they want and do many things in disobedience throughout their lives and until their death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although some have been zealous for the Lord and have worked and have even experienced many miracles and works of power outwardly, these things are all done according to their own will and contrary to God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some even have obvious sins and specific transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But we do not see much discipline in these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the contrary, they live peacefully and depart from this world in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, in addition to losing the reward, these people will be disciplined in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They will experience specific discipline from God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, experientially speaking, if a Christian lives on earth today without checking his lust and instead loves the world and walks in his own ways, he will be disciplined in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have ample evidence of this from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE PURPOSE OF DISCIPLINE</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>BEING FOR THE CLEANSING</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the Word of God, discipline is for cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man is defiled; therefore, he needs to be cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the Bible there is not only one kind of cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first cleansing is the cleansing of the blood, that is, the cleansing by the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Bible mentions the cleansing of the blood over three hundred times.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here we will mention only two verses.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hebrews 9:22 says, "And almost all things are purified by blood according to the law, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This verse speaks of the purification by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hebrews 1:3 says, "Who, being the effulgence of His glory and the impress of His substance and upholding and bearing all things by the word of His power, having made purification of sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here we can translate "having made cleansing of sins."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the Bible we see the cleansing of our sins by the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After He cleansed our sins, He ascended to the heights and sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the first kind of cleansing in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, although many people have received the cleansing of the blood of the Lord Jesus, they still have many filthy thoughts while living on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They are still very much defiled by the world and have many fleshly sins.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because there are these many other things, God uses other means to cleanse us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the way of cleansing by discipline and chastisement which we will now talk about.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In John 15:2 the Lord says, "Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The pruning here is a cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God cuts away the unnecessary, unimportant, and hindering elements that the branches may bear more fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is God's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, the purpose of God's discipline is not for destroying us but for perfecting us, so that we may become more worthy of God's glory, of God's holiness, and of the righteousness that is set before us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, there are two lines and two cleansings in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>One is the cleansing by the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The other is the cleansing by God which comes through our environment, our family, our personal health, or our job.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we indulge in what we should not indulge in or refuse to cut off what we should cut off, God's disciplining hand will be upon us in our environment.</S>
