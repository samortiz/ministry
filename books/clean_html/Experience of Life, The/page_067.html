<h2 class=head2>B. The Bible</h2><p>The second means of knowing God’s will is the Bible. God’s creation is only a piece of God’s work; it is not sufficiently clear in revealing His will. The Bible as God’s Word tells us thoroughly and clearly what God desires to do in the universe and what His purpose is. Therefore, the Bible is the clearest revelation regarding God’s will. We should study the Bible and be familiar with the Bible in order to understand His will.<p>However, many people, by studying the Bible, cannot ascertain God’s will. At times, they may have some light regarding His will, but only in trivial matters. For example, they extract from the book of Ephesians the minor points: the one that stole should not steal again, the wife should obey her husband, the husband should love his wife, the children should obey their parents, and the parents should not provoke their children. But important matters such as God’s plan, the mystery of Christ, etc., are never discovered, because the person who reads the Bible in this way is so small and so much in himself. He studies the Word of God from his own pitiful view, and, as a result, he is like a man who views the sky from the bottom of a well—his view is limited to the scope of his narrow self.<p>Therefore, the study of both creation and the Bible are inseparable. If we wish to study the Bible, we should first study creation and allow the universe to enlarge us; then we may comprehend the magnificent things in the Bible. Actually, the Bible itself is closely linked with all things in the universe. In the beginning we read about God creating the heavens and the earth, and at the end about the new heaven and new earth. All of God’s works and will as revealed in the Bible are largely related to the universe. Therefore, the universe should first be studied that our heart may be enlarged; then the Bible should be studied that our view may be broadened. Thus, we will become one who has a clearer understanding of the will of God.<p>This category of study also includes spiritual literature, messages, spiritual fellowship, words of encouragement, testimonies of the saints, etc. These all originate from the Bible and serve as a means by which God reveals His will.<h2 class=head2>C. The Environment</h2><p>The third way we know God’s will is by our environment. When speaking of God’s creation, we emphasize the sun, moon, stars, all things in heaven and on earth, and the vastness of His creation. But when we speak of environment, we are referring to our immediate surroundings, including people, things, and circumstances which affect our lives. In order that we may understand and obey His will, God arranges and changes our environment. Therefore, we need to study both God’s will and His guidance in our environment.<p>When we first came to Taiwan, it appeared that it did not offer much for the Lord’s work. Later, the Lord opened our eyes: we saw that in times past it was difficult to preach the gospel to the many provinces on the mainland of China. However, the political situation has now changed, and people out of all the different provinces have been gathered in Taiwan before our very eyes. Was not this a golden opportunity for the gospel? If we helped these people to be saved, would they not spread the gospel to all China upon their return to their provinces? With this vision, we exerted ourselves wholeheartedly in the work of the gospel. As a result, the rapid increase of new believers included many from all the provinces. Originally, they had neither opportunity to hear the gospel nor the heart towards the gospel; now their environment forced them to come to Taiwan. Consequently, they were saved. This is a good example of how God accomplished His will through the change of environment. When we are alert to the environment about us, we can often touch God’s will and know His move for today.
