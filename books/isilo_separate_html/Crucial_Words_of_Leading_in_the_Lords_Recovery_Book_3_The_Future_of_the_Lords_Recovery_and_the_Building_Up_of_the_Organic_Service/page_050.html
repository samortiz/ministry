<h2 class="head2">Strengthening the Leading at the Basic Level</h2>
<p>Why do we pay so much attention to the situation in Taipei? First, it is rare for a church in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to have more than ten thousand saints. Second, even though the church in Taipei has not increased in numbers for more than twenty years, the church has been growing in life. Third, the level of education in the city is relatively high; hence, most of the saints have a higher education and are quite capable. Fourth, Taipei is a large city with a population of approximately two million. It is the most densely populated city in all Taiwan, and it has convenient transportation. These are all the prerequisites that make it beneficial for us to spread the gospel. We cannot ignore these resources. We have spent more than twenty years guarding our accomplishments without spreading. This has been a huge loss. Based on this loss we have analyzed our situation, and we hope that the church in Taipei can move forward.</p>
<p>Before I returned to Taiwan this time, I had a blueprint within me. The blueprint is the light I have received from the Lord, and even though I am not absolutely clear, I know the general pattern. My burden was not to hold conferences or put out a call for full-time serving ones. However, through these few meetings, more than one thousand two hundred saints have consecrated themselves to serve full time or part time for the Lord&rsquo;s work. Thus, the light within me has become even brighter, and I feel that the work in Taiwan should have a completely new beginning. Because my time is limited, I can hold only two meetings to present the light I have received from the Lord to the saints. This is the way we will take. I hope that the brothers and sisters will be happy, and I believe that the Lord will also be pleased.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Need for More Full-time Serving Ones</h2>
<p>We need more full-time serving ones. The church in Taipei has more than eleven thousand saints, but only four to five thousand attend the meetings regularly. These four to five thousand saints are a basic number; they will be successful at whatever they do. There are not many full-time serving ones among these five thousand brothers and sisters who meet regularly. Most of these saints are busy with their jobs and their families. They are only able to come to meetings and serve the Lord during their free time. We cannot accomplish many things if we use only our free time. We must have many full-time serving ones to push the Lord&rsquo;s work forward.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei as well as all the other churches in Taiwan have this need. The church in Taipei has five thousand saints who meet regularly and over eleven thousand saints on its name list. Motivating the five thousand saints to exercise their function and labor for the Lord is a great matter. We would need more than thirty or even fifty brothers to do this. Even one or two hundred full-time serving ones would not be enough to advance this work. We must ask the Lord to give us enough full-timers. When we brought up the matter of serving full time, we hoped that five hundred saints would rise up. According to our consideration, two hundred full-timers plus three hundred part-timers would be equivalent to five hundred serving ones. The church in Taipei does not yet have five hundred serving ones. We do not even have two hundred saints who are willing to serve full time, but the number who are willing to serve part time has exceeded our expectation. The work will not be effective if we can use only part-timers as compared to full-timers. Hence, there is still a lack in the number of full-timers. We hope that more saints will consecrate themselves to meet this need.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Establishing and Promoting the Small Groups</h2>
<p>Some saints may ask whether we will be able to make arrangements for so many full-timers. There are Christian groups that have been successful at this. There are several large Christian groups in America that are successful. We have found that forming small groups is an important principle. Imagine the scene when the Lord Jesus fed five thousand people. There were five thousand men, not including women and children, so there must have been more than ten thousand people. The people had not eaten for almost the entire day, and no one had anything to eat. When evening fell, the Lord Jesus took five loaves and two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed the food and distributed it to more than five thousand hungry people. If there had not been some arrangement, everything would have been in chaos. The people were on a mountain out in the wilderness, and there was a possibility that many would have been trampled in a rush for the food. Before distributing the food, the Lord Jesus in His wisdom told the disciples to have everyone sit down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties. The Lord told the people to sit down. If they had been standing, it would have been easy for them to move around, but since they were sitting, they remained in one place. After everyone was sitting in their place, the Lord Jesus gave them bread. It did not matter if they were impatient, because all they could do was sit and wait. Thus, the bread was distributed for everyone to eat in an orderly manner (Matt. 14:14-21; Mark 6:34-44; John 6:1-13).</p>
<p>In addition to groups, there are also houses. This is based on the record in Acts: the believers met and broke bread from house to house. Groups and houses are basic units. For example, according to China&rsquo;s present military arrangement, there are battalions, companies, and squads. The most basic of these is the squad. When the army goes to war, the squads must be strong. In order for the entire army to be strong, all the squads must be strong. In the same way, the church should have small group after small group as the basic unit. As long as the small groups are strong, the church will also be strong.</p>
<p>More than twenty years ago, we practiced the small groups. In the beginning we had only ten to twenty saints in a group. Later, as the number of saints increased, our groups became larger. One group even had more than one hundred saints, but the members did not want to split to form another group. According to the Bible, it is appropriate for the small groups to have about twelve members. The first small group was established by the Lord Jesus Himself. That group had twelve members&mdash;the twelve apostles. Therefore, we are going to practice the small groups according to the Bible, and we will have twelve or less saints in every group. The number in the groups can be less than twelve, but it should not be more than twelve. As soon as the number in a group reaches fourteen or fifteen, the group should split into two. If the number in a group remains less than twelve, the group will have to &ldquo;recruit soldiers.&rdquo; The group can either preach the gospel to gain new ones, or it can recover some dormant saints. In any event the saints must fill up the number in their group. This is the way to practice the increase through the small groups.</p>
<p>The four to five thousand saints meeting regularly in the church in Taipei have been divided into more than four hundred small groups. The groups were formed according to geography, not according to the spiritual level of the saints. For example, suppose there are three people in your household who are able to meet, and there is a household down the street with three saints who can meet, and there are saints across the street from you and on the street behind you who also can meet. When these saints come together, they have the number of saints needed for a small group. These few households are a small group. It may be that not far from them there is another group of households that can form another small group. In this way the church in Taipei has been grouped into more than four hundred small groups.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these small groups do not have a group leader or a responsible person or even a coordinator. In another sense, someone is taking the lead because everyone is a coordinator, everyone is a responsible one, and everyone is a group leader. Every one of the twelve saints in a small group is a group leader, and everyone can take the lead. This means that you lead me and I lead you; from your perspective, I am the leader, and from my perspective, you are the leader. Since we are all leaders, we must seek out each other if one is lost. If I fall into a pit, you must rescue me, and if you stumble, I must uphold you.</p>
<p>From our experience, we discovered that appointing group leaders has drawbacks; therefore, the groups will not have leaders. In the past, those who were appointed as leaders or as responsible ones felt as though they were a government official. Even though we did not speak of position or rank, they still manifested such a flavor. As a result, the other saints in the group felt that they did not need to bear any responsibility. They felt that it was the responsibility of the group leader to care for the ones who stumbled.</p>
<p>After thorough fellowship and consideration, we feel that we do not need group coordinators. As soon as responsibility is given to two coordinators, the other ten saints will not take care of anything. Hence, we decided not to have any responsible ones or leaders in the groups. Everyone is a group coordinator and everyone is a group leader; no one can escape responsibility, and no one can condemn anyone else. If someone stumbles, everyone must bear the responsibility to support that saint; no one should push aside the responsibility. We believe that everyone will approve of such a practice. Regardless of whether you are a small brother or a small sister, you are a group coordinator, and this is good. However, we must not forget that as coordinators, we must bear responsibility. When we see someone fall, we must lift him up. Everyone must take care of each other.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the small group meetings will not be held in a set location. The twelve members of the small group can decide where to hold the next meeting. For example, if the meeting is in a brother&rsquo;s home, everyone can fellowship concerning the location of the next meeting. The meetings can be held in any of the homes of the saints in the small group. If you do not have enough chairs in your home, you should not be troubled; it is all right for the saints to sit on the floor. The homes in Taiwan are all very elegant, even the floors are very clean, so it is not bad for saints to sit on the floor. The important thing is that there can be a place to meet. If every home takes turns to have the meeting, everyone will bear responsibility, and the small groups will be a success.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> </body></html>
