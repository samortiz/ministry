<h1 class="title">ENJOYING ALL THE SAINTS<br />
THROUGH BREAKING THE BREAD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 10:16-17; 12:24-25; 2 Cor. 4:7; 5:16; Phil. 2:3; Isa. 58:9b-12; Gal. 5:15</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE SIGNIFICANCE<br />
OF THE BREAD-BREAKING MEETING</h2>
<p>The significance of bread-breaking has two aspects. One aspect is that we remember the Lord and enjoy Him. The other aspect is that we fellowship with all the saints and enjoy them. The bread we break signifies the body of the Lord Jesus given up for us on the cross. The bread also signifies the Lord&rsquo;s mystical Body, the church, which He obtained through regenerating us with His resurrection life. Hence, when we see the bread, we remember that the Lord Jesus gave Himself up on the cross for us. When we receive the bread, we declare that we are receiving and enjoying the Lord. Our remembrance of the Lord concerns our relationship with the Lord. Not only so, every time we take the bread, we remember that the bread is made of many grains that were blended together. All those who are saved, who belong to the Lord, and who are members of His Body are in this bread. When we take the bread, we have fellowship with all those who belong to the Lord, and we declare that we enjoy all the saints. This aspect concerns our relationship with all the saints.</p>
<p>However, when we remember the Lord, we often remember only the first aspect of the table. We remember and contact the Lord, but we neglect the aspect of our fellowship with all the saints. No one can break the bread by himself. If the breaking of bread had only the aspect of remembering the Lord but not the aspect of fellowshipping with all the saints, a person could break bread and remember the Lord by himself. However, according to the Bible, God does not desire that we remember the Lord individually. As long as there are saints to break bread in remembrance of the Lord, we must break bread corporately. An individual does not have the qualification, ground, or standing to remember the Lord in this way. If we desire to remember the Lord, we must do so with all the saints, because remembering the Lord is not only for us to touch the Lord, but even more, it is for us to have mutual fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BREAD-BREAKING MEETING<br />
BEING A DECLARATION OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the bread-breaking meeting is a declaration of the Christian life. On the first day of every week, we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table to declare the way that we will live for the upcoming week. One week is one course of our journey, and the next week is another course. Each week is a course and has its beginning. The course of our journey begins on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, which is the first day of the week. The beginning of a week is the beginning of a course of our journey. In this universe we are all declaring that we are ones who have received the Lord as our life and that in the Lord&rsquo;s life we have become one Body. Having been redeemed by the precious blood and having received the life of God, we are not like those in the world who live by their own life, by their intelligence, or by their ability. As saved ones who have received the Lord as our life, we live by eating, drinking, and taking Him as our life.</p>
<p>The first day of every week is the beginning of a new course of our Christian journey. We come together to declare that we live by the Lord. At the same time, we also declare that as those who have the Lord&rsquo;s life and live by this life, we have become one Body. We have a life relationship not only with the Lord but also with all the saints. This can be compared to the various members in our physical body. The members have a relationship not only with the head but also with the other members of our body. In the Lord and in His life we are members one of another and have become one Body. We have received the Lord as our life, and we have a corporate living with all the other members.</p>
<p>The life we have received is Christ, and the corporate living we have is the church. Christ is our life within, and the church is our outward living. The life we have within is the Lord, and the church life that we live out is the mutual coordination of all the members. Week after week we live such a life by experiencing the life journey course by course. Hence, at the beginning of every week, which is the start of a new course of our journey, we come together to make a declaration. Through the fact of our breaking the bread, we declare that we have a life relationship with the Lord and that we also have a life relationship with all the brothers and sisters. Hence, whenever we take the bread, we declare that we receive the Lord as our life. We also declare that we are members one of another, having become one Body.</p>
