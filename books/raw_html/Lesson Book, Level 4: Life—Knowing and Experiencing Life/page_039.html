<h2 class=head2>D. The Result</h2><p>[Since the anointing is vital to God’s presence, we need to obey the teaching so we can experience more of the anointing. Then we can live at all times and in all places in the presence of God, living in the light of His face and touching His presence moment by moment. At this time we can enter into the reality of the hymn which says:<p class=hbody>We have passed the riven veil, Here the glories never fail; We are living in the presence 	    of the King!<p>When man passes through the veil of the flesh and lives in the presence of God, he enters into the Holy of Holies and lives in the spirit, having fellowship face to face with God. It is at this time that our spiritual experience reaches its peak.<p>In conclusion, the key to all our spiritual life is the anointing. We should continually touch the anointing and obey its teaching. When we live in the teaching of the anointing, we are walking according to the spirit, living in the fellowship of the Lord and in God’s presence. If once we lose the teaching of the anointing, the leading of the Holy Spirit is absent, our fellowship with the Lord ceases, and the light in God’s face is lost; consequently, we have no way to live in His presence. Therefore, the teaching of the anointing is truly the center of all spiritual experience and is also a very wonderful part of God’s salvation. May we pay more attention to it and experience it more!]<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>What is the meaning of the word “anointing’’?</li><li>Describe the process through which the Spirit was formed.</li><li>Name the ingredients of the ointment in Exodus 30 and tell what each represents.</li><li>What is the central purpose of God’s salvation?
