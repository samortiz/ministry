[1]  LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE ONE THE KING S ANTECEDENTS AND STATUS 1 A WORD OF INTRODUCTION
[2]  In the first section, the Old Testament, God spoke by the prophets, and in the second section, the New Testament, He spoke in the Son in the Person of the Son, Heb 1:1-2 .
[3]  Thus, the New Testament is just the Son s speaking to us, His ministering Himself as life and everything that we may become His Body, His expression, the church.
[4]  The book of Acts is the expansion of this wonderful Person.
[5]  It is the branching out of the all-inclusive Christ.
[6]  This Christ has expanded from one Person to thousands and thousands of persons.
[7]  He was once the individual Christ, but in Acts He has become a corporate Christ.
[8]  Christ, as Jesus Jehovah the Savior and Emmanuel God with us , is the King, the Baptizer, the light, the Teacher, the Healer, the Forgiver, the Bridegroom, the Shepherd, the Friend, the wisdom, the rest, the greater temple, the real David, the Lord of the Sabbath, the greater Jonah, the greater Solomon, the Sower, the seed, the Feeder, the bread, the crumbs under the table, the Christ, the Son of the living God, the rock for the church, the Builder of the church, the Founder of the kingdom, the present Moses, the present Elijah, the Head of the corner, the Lord, the resurrected One, the One with authority, and the One ever-present to His people in resurrection.
[9]  Among the four Gospels only two, Matthew and Luke, have genealogies.
[10]  Matthew tells us that Jesus is the proper descendant of the royal family, that He is the legal heir of the royal throne.
[11]  According to Jewish custom, a writer of a genealogy would never include a female name; he would include only the names of males.
[12]  The Gospels reveal that Christ came to inherit the kingdom, that He offered Himself unto death and He was resurrected, that He spoke the word of wisdom, that He brought blessing to all people, that He is building up God s house, and that He will come to receive the Bride.
[13]  Luke is a book of God s salvation, whereas Matthew is a book of the kingdom.
[14]  Hebrews 11:8 says that Abraham was called, and that he answered this call by faith.
[15]  As the called one of God, not only was Abraham justified by faith, but he also lived by faith.
[16]  Isaac and Ishmael were brothers by the same father, but by different mothers.
[17]  Verse 2 also says, Jacob begot Judah and his brothers.
[18]  Whatever is recorded in the Old Testament is related to Christ.
[19]  If we want to understand the genealogy of Christ, we must go back to the Old Testament and read it carefully.
[20]  If we do this, we shall realize that the Old Testament is a record of Christ.
[21]  From Tamar we go on to her son, Pharez v. 3 . Tamar conceived twins Gen 38:27-30 . At the time of delivery, one boy, Zarah, tried to come out first, but he did not succeed.
[22]  He put out his hand, and the midwife marked it with a scarlet thread, indicating that he would be the firstborn.
[23]  The mother s story tells us one side: that we should be anxious for the birthright, trying our best to obtain it; the son s story tells us the other side: that although we may strive to obtain the birthright, it is actually a matter of God s choice, not our efforts see Rom 9:11 .
[24]  We may say that Ruth was certainly a good woman, but she had a great shortage.
[25]  This reveals a most prevailing principle: no matter who we are or what our background is, as long as we have a heart which seeks after God and God s people, we are in a position to be accepted into the birthright of Christ.
[26]  But as long as you have a heart to seek after God and God s people and as long as you become involved with the proper person, such as Boaz, you will enter into the double portion of the enjoyment of Christ.
[27]  She was the wife of a Hittite, a heathen 2 Sam 11:3 .
[28]  We come now to the last part of the genealogy of Christ according to Matthew.
[29]  In the previous message I said that this part of the Word is not milk or meat, but bones.
[30]  Luke s record is the genealogy of David s son Nathan, who was Mary s forefather, whereas Matthew s record is the genealogy of David s son Solomon, who was Joseph s forefather.
[31]  Compare this record with 1 Chronicles 3:11 and 12, which say, Joram his son, Ahaziah his son, Joash his son, Amaziah his son, Azariah who is Ozias or Uzziah 2 Kings 15:1, 13 .
[32]  Ezra 5:1 and 2 say that Zerubbabel was one of the leaders who returned to Jerusalem from the captivity at Babylon.
[33]  He was also a leader in the rebuilding of God s temple Zech 4:7-10 .
[34]  At this point, the record of this genealogy does not say Joseph begot Jesus, as mentioned of all the foregoing persons; it says, Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus v. 16 . Jesus was born of Mary, not of Joseph, since it was prophesied that Christ would be the seed of a woman and born of a virgin Gen 3:15; Isa 7:14 . Christ could not have been born of Joseph, because Joseph was a man and a descendant of Jeconiah, of whose descendants none could inherit the throne of David Jer 22:28-30 . If Christ had been born of Joseph, he would have been excluded from the throne of David.
[35]  In this message we come to the birth of Christ.
[36]  According to Luke 1:26-38, the birth of Christ was carried out through Mary s surrender.
[37]  Here I would say a word to the young people.
[38]  If I had been she, I would have said, Lord, if You would ask me to do anything other than this, I would do it.
[39]  However, it is difficult to find a verse which says that God became man.
[40]  What the Bible says is this: The Word was God...and the Word became flesh John 1:1, 14 .
[41]  If I tell you that you are a man, you will be happy.
[42]  But if I say that you are flesh, you will not be happy because the word flesh is not a positive term.
[43]  The wonderful One who was born in this wonderful way is Jehovah.
[44]  And He is not only Jehovah He is Jehovah with something else.
[45]  Whether you hate Jesus or love Him, whether you are for Him or against Him, you realize that the name of Jesus is a special name.
[46]  We should not only say that we believe in the Lord Jesus, but also declare that we believe in the name of Jesus.
[47]  The name of Jesus is for us to call upon Rom 10:13; 1 Cor 1:2 .
[48]  I was a Christian for at least thirty-five years before I found the secret of calling on the name of Jesus.
[49]  Even for a believer of many years, the best way to touch the Lord Jesus, to enjoy the Lord Jesus, to share something of the Lord Jesus, is not to say very much, but to go to the Lord and call, Jesus!
[50]  The name of Jesus is also good for casting out demons Acts 16:18 .
[51]  To know the power of the name of Jesus, use it to cast out demons.
[52]  From our experience in China, where there were many cases of demon possession, we have learned that when we cast out demons, we must tell them that this Jesus is not the ordinary, common Jesus, but that He is the designated Jesus.
[53]  We must say, Demon, I come in the very name of Jesus, the Son of God, who was incarnated to be a man, who was born of a virgin in Bethlehem, who was raised in Nazareth, who died on the cross for my sins and for the sins of this person that is possessed, who was resurrected from the dead, and who has ascended to the heavens.
[54]  When the Apostles were persecuted, they rejoiced that they were worthy to suffer for the name of Jesus Acts 5:41 .
[55]  In the previous messages we have covered the genealogy of Christ and the birth of Christ.
[56]  God gave the magi a shining star to guide them 2:2 .
[57]  This star did not appear in the Holy Land.
[58]  After the magi saw the star again, the star led them to the place where Christ was vv.
[59]  After the wise men had found Christ, had worshipped Him, and had offered Him these precious treasures, they were warned by God to return another way v. 12 . This other way, not the original way, was the right way.
[60]  Whenever we find Christ and meet Him, we are always told not to return to the original way.
[61]  Finding Christ and meeting Him always turns us to another way.
[62]  We have the Bible, and Christ is coming, but how shall we find Him?
[63]  At this point I need to present a little history.
[64]  Although you know the story, you may still need more light.
[65]  This section of the Gospel of Matthew is in three parts: the King recommended 3:1-12 , the King anointed 3:13-17 , and the King tested 4:1-11 .
[66]  We have seen that the place of recommendation was neither in the holy city nor in the holy temple, but in the wilderness.
[67]  Verse 1 says that John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness, and verse 3 says, For this is he who was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, A voice of one crying in the wilderness.
[68]  This indicates that the introduction of God s New Testament economy by John was not accidental, but planned and foretold by God through Isaiah the prophet.
[69]  LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE NINE THE KING S ANOINTING 2
[70]  In both the Old Testament and the New Testament there are two basic ministries that constitute the kingdom of God: the priesthood and the kingship.
[71]  John s word to the Pharisees and Sadducees who came to him reveals our need to have our nature changed.
[72]  Verse 7 says, But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
[73]  Verse 11 says, I indeed baptize you in water unto repentance; but He Who is coming after me is mightier than I, Whose sandals I am not worthy to bear; He shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire.
[74]  In this verse John seemed to be saying, I have come to baptize you with water, to terminate you, to bury you.
[75]  The word of John spoken here to the Pharisees and Sadducees means that if the Pharisees and Sadducees would truly repent and believe in the Lord, the Lord would baptize them in the Holy Spirit that they might have eternal life; otherwise, the Lord will baptize them in fire, putting them into the lake of fire for eternal punishment.
[76]  The Lord s baptism in the Holy Spirit began the kingdom of the heavens, bringing His believers into the kingdom of the heavens, whereas His baptism in fire will terminate the kingdom of the heavens, putting the unbelievers into the lake of fire.
[77]  We have covered the recommender and the message of recommendation.
[78]  To prepare the way of the Lord and to make His paths straight is to change people s minds, to turn their minds toward the Lord and make their hearts right, to cause every part and avenue of their heart to be straightened by the Lord through repentance for the kingdom of the heavens Luke 1:16-17 .
[79]  In this message we come to the actual anointing of the King 3:13-17 .
[80]  As a man, the Lord Jesus came to be baptized by John the Baptist according to God s New Testament way.
[81]  If I told you that the church will not sanctify you, but rather terminate you, you would turn away from the church and say, I don t want to stay here.
[82]  Verse 16 says, And having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and coming upon Him.
[83]  Not only was Jesus anointed through baptism, but He was also anointed with the Holy Spirit.
[84]  The Lord s baptism to fulfill God s righteousness and to be put into death and resurrection brought Him three things: the open heaven, the descending of the Spirit of God, and the speaking of the Father.
[85]  Because the Lord Jesus was baptized, fulfilling God s righteousness, the heavens were opened to Him, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him, and the Father spoke concerning Him.
[86]  Before the Spirit of God descended and came upon Him, the Lord Jesus was born of the Spirit Luke 1:35 , which proved that He already had the Spirit of God within Him.
[87]  In this message we come to the testing of the newly appointed King 4:1-11 .
[88]  Verse 2 says the Lord fasted forty days and forty nights.
[89]  After these forty days and forty nights, He was physically hungry, and the tempter came to Him and said, If You are the Son of God, speak, that these stones may become loaves of bread v. 3 . To this proposal the Lord replied, Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God v. 4 . Many Christians think that because the Lord was fasting during this time He did not eat anything.
[90]  a. Tempted to Give Up the Standing of Man
[91]  Now we come to the main point of the first test.
[92]  At the time of Christ s baptism, the Father opened the heavens and declared, This is My beloved Son 3:17 , A voice from heaven declared that a little man from Nazareth was God the Father s beloved Son.
[93]  Immediately after this declaration was made, the Holy Spirit led this man into the wilderness to be tested to see whether He would care for His physical life or for His spiritual life.
[94]  Then, based upon the declaration of God the Father, the tempter came to tempt this man by saying, If You are the Son of God, speak, that these stones may become loaves of bread v. 3 . Satan seemed to be saying, We heard the declaration made forty days ago by God the Father that You are the beloved Son.
[95]  For Him to accomplish His ministry for the kingdom of the heavens, He had to defeat God s enemy, the Devil, Satan.
[96]  from the Wing of the Temple a. Tempted to Make a Show
[97]  In verse 6 the Devil said to Him, If You are the Son of God, cast Yourself down; for it is written, He shall give charge to His angels concerning You, and on their hands they shall bear You up, lest You strike Your foot against a stone.
[98]  Some may say, Since I am one following the Lord and I am in the Lord s presence as my Emmanuel, I must do something to show others that God is with me.
[99]  When the Devil tempted Jesus to cast Himself down from the wing of the temple, Jesus said to him, Again it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God v. 7 . Because the Lord Jesus defeated him the first time by quoting the Scriptures, the tempter imitated His way and in his second temptation tempted Him by also quoting the Scriptures, however in a subtle way.
[100]  For it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.
[101]  He is not only God s enemy outside God s kingdom, but also the adversary within God s kingdom, rebelling against God.
[102]  The Lord seemed to be saying to Satan, Satan, as a man, I, Jesus, worship God and serve Him only.
[103]  We come now to a very important section of the Gospel of Matthew, the section of the King s ministry 4:12 11:30 .
[104]  In this message we shall consider the beginning of the ministry 4:12-25 .
[105]  After the Lord was anointed, He was tested to prove that He was qualified, and then He began to minister.
[106]  The new King began His ministry in Galilee, even at the Sea of Galilee, not in the holy city or in the holy temple.
[107]  His forerunner ministered by the riverside, in the wilderness, but He began His ministry by the Sea of Galilee.
[108]  The newly appointed King began His kingly ministry for the kingdom of the heavens in such a despised place, far from the capital of the country, dignified Jerusalem, with its sacred temple, the center of the orthodox religion.
[109]  Verse 17 says, From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.
[110]  The new King continued the preaching of His forerunner, John the Baptist, that is, the preaching of repentance for the kingdom of the heavens as the preliminary to the gospel of the kingdom.
[111]  In this message we come to the decree of the kingdom s constitution recorded in chapters five, six, and seven.
[112]  The constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is composed of seven sections: the nature of the kingdom people 5:1-12 ; the influence of the kingdom people upon the world 5:13-16 ; the law of the kingdom people 5:17-48 ; the righteous deeds of the kingdom people 6:1-18 ; the dealing of the kingdom people with riches 6:19-34 ; the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others 7:1-12 ; and the ground of the kingdom people s living and work 7:13-29 .
[113]  Now we come to the first section of the constitution, the section concerning the nature of the kingdom people.
[114]  Probably not many Christians have seen that 5:1-12 reveals the nature of the kingdom people.
[115]  Thus, the first aspect of the kingdom of the heavens covered in this chapter is related to our human spirit.
[116]  Most Christians do not understand what the Lord Jesus was talking about when He spoke of being poor in spirit.
[117]  Although we should be very happy to hear that we are in the kingdom of the heavens today, in the very next verse the Lord Jesus told us to mourn.
[118]  Verse 4 says, Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
[119]  However, if we pray for a certain period of time, with a spirit filled with the King and the kingdom, we shall begin to mourn over the negative situation of today.
[120]  God s glory is insulted, Christ is rejected, the Holy Spirit is frustrated, the church is desolated, self is corrupted, and the whole world is evil.
[121]  If you have never experienced mourning in your spirit, then you cannot realize how sweet and comforting it is to see so many who care only for the Lord s kingdom.
[122]  In verse 6 the Lord said, Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
[123]  Verse 8 says, Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
[124]  To be righteous is to deal with ourselves, to be merciful is to deal with others, and to be pure in heart is to deal with God.
[125]  In order to have a good nation or kingdom, there must be good people.
[126]  Thus, in the constitution of the heavenly kingdom, the Lord Jesus firstly reveals the kind of people who live in the kingdom of the heavens.
[127]  However, when the Lord Jesus is able to set up His kingdom within us and when the full capacity of our whole being, even the depths of our being, our spirit, is available to Him, we shall realize that the earth is dark, corrupt, and filled with sin.
[128]  The New Testament tells us that we do not fight against flesh and blood, but against the Devil, against the enemy of God.
[129]  We must fight against the Devil, God s enemy, day and night.
[130]  According to the sequence of the blessings in Matthew 5, being pure in heart comes after the showing of mercy to others.
[131]  If you are not righteous with yourself and merciful to others, you will find it difficult to be pure in heart toward God.
[132]  In order to be pure in heart toward God, you must be strict in dealing with yourself and merciful in dealing with others.
[133]  The kingdom people are salt to the corrupted earth and light to the darkened world.
[134]  When we say that we are salt, it means that we exercise our influence over the earth created by God to keep it in its original condition.
[135]  The teaching and preaching concerning the kingdom of the heavens began with repentance 3:2; 4:17 .
[136]  To fulfill the law here means three things: that Christ has kept the law on the positive side; that through His substitutionary death on the cross Christ has fulfilled the requirement of the law on the negative side; and that Christ complements the old law by His new law in this section, as continually expressed by the word, But I say to you vv.
[137]  Firstly, it means that Christ came to keep the law on the positive side.
[138]  No one else has ever kept the ten commandments; the Lord Jesus kept them completely.
[139]  B. Keeping Even the Least of the Commandments of the Law Being the Condition
[140]  Verse 19 says, Whoever therefore shall annul one of the least of these commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whoever practices and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.
[141]  Whether we shall be great or small in the kingdom of the heavens depends upon whether or not we keep even the least of the commandments of the law.
[142]  In this verse Christ stressed the fact that if we do not keep all of the least of the commandments of the law, but annul them and teach others to annul them, we shall become the least in the kingdom of the heavens.
[143]  In other words, Christ seemed to be saying, If you would be great in the kingdom of the heavens, you must have the highest standard of morality.
[144]  Verse 21 says, You have heard that it was said to the ancients, You shall not murder, and whoever murders shall be liable to the judgment.
[145]  What you have heard in verses 21, 27, 33, 38, and 43 is the law of the old dispensation; whereas what I say to you in verses 22, 28, 32, 34, 39, and 44 is the new law of the kingdom, complementing the law of the old dispensation.
[146]  Verses 23 and 24 say, Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has anything against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go away; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
[147]  Sacrifice, as the sacrifice for sin, is for dealing with sin; whereas a gift is for fellowship with God.
[148]  The King, in decreeing the new law of the kingdom, referred here to the gift and the altar of the old dispensation because, during the transitory period of His ministry on earth, the ritual law of the old dispensation had not yet ceased.
[149]  In the four Gospels, before His death and resurrection, in things regarding circumstances, the Lord treated His disciples as Jews according to the old law; whereas in things concerning spirit and life, He considered them as believers who constitute the church according to the New Testament economy.
[150]  If, as you come to contact the Lord, you have the sense that a brother or sister has a complaint against you, you must stop your fellowship with the Lord and go to this one and be reconciled.
[151]  Verse 27 says, You have heard that it was said, You shall not commit adultery.
[152]  In this message I am burdened to give a further word on the law.
[153]  Thus, the law was the principle of God s dealing with His people in the Old Testament, but faith is the principle of His dealing with us in the New Testament.
[154]  The fact that God no longer deals with us, the believers, according to the principle of the law does not mean that the commandments of the old law have been abolished.
[155]  Week after week many are drugged by the teachings of Christianity.
[156]  The crucial point of the Lord s decree concerning the law is that we do not need to keep the law in order to be saved, but that we must have a standard of morality much higher than the standard of the old law after we have been saved by faith.
[157]  This matter of the judgment of the believers and of their being hurt by the fire is neither Calvinism nor Arminianism.
[158]  According to Calvinism, once we are saved, we are saved forever, and there can be no further problem.
[159]  In this message we come to 5:31-48, which covers four laws.
[160]  In verses 21 through 30 the Lord covered two laws that were complemented, the law regarding murder and the law regarding adultery.
[161]  What the King decreed in verses 21 through 30 as the new law of the kingdom complements the law of the old dispensation, whereas what the King proclaimed in verses 31 through 48 as the new law of the kingdom changes the law of the old dispensation.
[162]  Verse 33 says, Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients: You shall not perjure yourself, but you shall render to the Lord what you have sworn.
[163]  The new law of the kingdom forbids the kingdom people to swear in any manner, by the heaven, by the earth, by Jerusalem, or by their head, because the heaven, the earth, Jerusalem, and their head are not under their control, but under God s. We should not swear by either the heaven or the earth, for they are not ours.
[164]  In verse 39 the Lord says, But I say to you, Do not resist one who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.
[165]  In this verse the Lord said that when someone strikes our right cheek, we should turn to him the other also.
[166]  To turn the other cheek to the striker, to let the one who sues have the cloak, and to go with the compeller the second mile prove that the kingdom people have the power to suffer and to be meek instead of resisting and to walk not in the flesh, nor in the soul for their own interest, but in the spirit for the kingdom.
[167]  Verse 44 says, But I say to you, Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.
[168]  If the Lord arranged for you to have only good neighbors, you would behave like an angel and say, Lord, thank You for giving me such lovely neighbors.
[169]  For centuries, Christians have not had a clear understanding of the law.
[170]  On the other hand, in Matthew 5:17 the Lord Jesus said, Do not think that I came to abolish the law or the prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.
[171]  At the end of Matthew 5 the Lord Jesus said, You, therefore, shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect v. 48 . This word concludes this section of the constitution, a section which is exceedingly high.
[172]  After reading all these requirements, we all would say that we cannot possibly fulfill them.
[173]  Then we come to verse 48 which tells us that we must be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect.
[174]  This verse is an indicator that we have the Father s life and nature within us.
[175]  Because we are His children possessing His life and nature, there is no need for us to imitate Him or copy Him.
[176]  Therefore, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh, so that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit v. 4 . Because it was impossible, due to the weakness of our flesh, for the law to be fulfilled, God sent His Son to keep the law on the positive side, and to die for our weakness on the negative side.
[177]  With these verses before us, we can understand why the Lord concluded His word in Matthew 5 by saying, You, therefore, shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.
[178]  We are not only God s creatures; we are also His regenerated children, possessing His life and nature.
[179]  Thus, we are not God s creatures trying to copy and imitate Him; we are the Father s children living the Father s life.
[180]  It was by the coming of the Spirit of God into our spirit to regenerate us and to make our spirit the very habitation of God Himself Eph 2:22, Gk.
[181]  LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE THE DECREE
[182]  In this message we come to the fourth section of the King s decree on the mountain, 6:1-18, concerning the righteous deeds of the kingdom people.
[183]  But the kingdom people, who live in an emptied and humbled spirit and walk in a pure and single heart under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, are not allowed to do anything in the flesh for the praise of men, but must do all things in the spirit for the pleasing of their heavenly Father.
[184]  Hence, the new law of the kingdom, decreed by the King on the mountain, is given to them with the intention that they should keep it not by their fallen human life, but by the Father s eternal divine life, not to gain man s glory, but to receive the Father s reward.
[185]  Verse 2 says, When therefore you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may be glorified by men.
[186]  As we pray, we are not to repeat empty words.
[187]  Verse 7 says, And in praying do not repeat empty words as the nations do; for they suppose that they will be heard through their much speaking.
[188]  The Lord repeated His prayer in Gethsemane 26:44 , the Apostle Paul prayed the same prayer three times 2 Cor 12:8 , and the great multitude in heaven praised God with hallelujahs repeatedly Rev 19:1-6 .
[189]  Verse 8 says, Therefore do not be like them, for God your Father knows what things you have need of before you ask Him.
[190]  In Matthew 6 we are not told to pray in the Lord s name, but in John chapters fourteen through seventeen the Lord Jesus tells us repeatedly to pray in His name.
[191]  Verse 10 also says, Let Your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.
[192]  After the fall of man, Christ came to bring the heavenly rule to earth so that the earth might be recovered for God s right, that the will of God might be done on earth as in heaven.
[193]  The kingdom people must pray for this until the earth is fully recovered for God s will in the coming kingdom age.
[194]  When the Father s name is sanctified, the Son s kingdom has come, and the Spirit s will is done on earth as in heaven, that will be the time of the manifestation of the kingdom.
[195]  In this message we come to the fifth section of the King s decree, 6:19-34, which concerns the dealing of the kingdom people with riches.
[196]  Verse 31 says, Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed?
[197]  Apparently, in this section of the constitution, the Lord is speaking about the dealing of the kingdom people with material riches.
[198]  We come now to the sixth section of the new King s decree on the mountain, 7:1-12.
[199]  Apparently, the Lord s intention in 7:1-12 is to cover the principles according to which the kingdom people deal with others.
[200]  In verse 3 the Lord says, And why do you look at the splinter in your brother s eye, but do not consider the log in your own eye?
[201]  As the kingdom people, living in a humble spirit under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, we must consider the log in our own eye whenever we look at the splinter in our brother s eye.
[202]  Verses 7 through 11 present a difficulty because it seems that these verses should not be here.
[203]  For some years, I skipped over these verses, going from verse 6 to verse 12, because verse 12 matches verses 1 through 6.
[204]  Verse 12 says, All things therefore whatever you wish that men would do to you, so also you do to them; for this is the law and the prophets.
[205]  We must be deeply impressed with the fact that the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is based upon the divine life and nature of the kingdom people.
[206]  Verses 13 and 14 say, Enter in through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it.
[207]  In verse 13 the Lord said, For the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it.
[208]  By the Lord s mercy, I will never take the way of Christianity, because deep in me I have the conviction that it is a broad way leading to destruction.
[209]  Verse 21 says, Not every one who says to Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father Who is in the heavens.
[210]  This does not refer to the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today, but to the coming manifestation of the kingdom in the future.
[211]  Hence, Not everyone who says...Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but those who call on the Lord and do the will of the heavenly Father.
[212]  Since entering into the kingdom of the heavens also requires doing the will of the heavenly Father, it is clearly different from entering into the kingdom of God by being regenerated John 3:3, 5 .
[213]  The Lord never approved those who prophesied, cast out demons, and did many works of power in His name, but not according to the will of the heavenly Father v. 21 . The Lord did not deny that they did those things, but He considered those things as lawlessness because they were not done according to the will of the heavenly Father.
[214]  The Lord seemed to be saying, You prophesied in My name, you cast out demons in My name, and you did many works of power in My name, but I never allowed you to do them.
[215]  We see from the Lord s word here that certain works may be done in the Lord s name, and yet not be done according to the will of God.
[216]  Moreover, casting out demons in the Lord s name and doing works of power in the name of the Lord, but not according to the will of God, are also considered in the eyes of the heavenly King as lawlessness.
[217]  The rock here does not refer to Christ, but to His wise word, the word that reveals the will of His Father who is in the heavens.
[218]  The kingdom people s living and work must be founded on the word of the new King for the accomplishment of the will of the heavenly Father.
[219]  The first is Matthew 5:3, which says, Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.
[220]  If we would be in the reality of the kingdom today, we need to be poor in our spirit and to be persecuted for the sake of righteousness.
[221]  Verse 1 says, Now when He had come down from the mountain, great crowds followed Him.
[222]  The coming down of the King from the mountain signifies that the heavenly King has come down from the heavens to the earth.
[223]  B. Healing of the Centurion s Servant Boy 1.
[224]  A Centurion Approaching and Beseeching Him for the Healing of His Servant Boy
[225]  After the Lord had entered into Capernaum, A centurion approached Him, beseeching Him and saying, Lord, My servant boy is lying in the house paralyzed, terribly tormented vv.
[226]  When the Lord told the centurion that He would come and heal his servant, The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not fit that You should enter under my roof; but only speak a word, and my servant boy shall be healed.
[227]  Verses 14 and 15 say, And when Jesus had come into Peter s house, He saw his mother-in-law laid aside and in a fever; and He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose and ministered to Him.
[228]  Peter s mother-in-law represents the Jews at the end of this age who will be saved by receiving the kingly Savior.
[229]  At that time, during the great tribulation, in the eyes of God the Jews will be in a fever v. 14 , hot in things other than God.
[230]  Immediately after Peter s mother-in-law was healed, she arose and ministered to the Lord v. 15 . This signifies that at the Lord s coming back, the remnant of the Jews, after being saved, will arise and minister to Him in the millennium.
[231]  THE WAY TO FOLLOW THE KING A. The King Giving Orders to Depart
[232]  Verse 18 says, Now when Jesus saw great crowds around Him, He gave orders to depart to the other side.
[233]  In His ministry, as recorded in the four Gospels, the Lord always withdrew from the crowds.
[234]  LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX THE CONTINUATION OF THE KING S MINISTRY 2 III.
[235]  In 8:23 9:8 we see the authority of the King.
[236]  After the King spoke in a way to indicate that He had nothing, not even a home or a place to rest, and after not allowing His followers to perform the dead duties, the record of Matthew reveals the authority of this King.
[237]  The Lord and His disciples were in a boat, and a great tempest arose in the sea, so that the boat was covered by the waves v. 24 . When the disciples, fearing that they would perish, roused the Lord from sleep v. 25 , He said, Why are you fearful, you of little faith? v. 26 . Faith comes from the word of the Lord and depends upon that word Rom 10:17 . The Lord gave them the word in verse 18 to depart to the other side.
[238]  In 9:1-8 we see the King s authority to forgive sins.
[239]  After the Lord had come to His own city, Capernaum, where He now dwelt 4:13 , a paralytic was brought to Him.
[240]  Verse 2 says, And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Have courage, child, your sins are forgiven.
[241]  The men who had brought the paralytic to the Lord Jesus had uncovered the roof where the Lord was and had broken it up Mark 2:4 .
[242]  The scribes, assuming that they knew the Scriptures, thought that only God had authority to forgive sins, and that Jesus, who in their eyes was only a man, blasphemed God when He said, Your sins are forgiven.
[243]  In 9:9-17 we come to a very fine, sweet, and intimate portion of the Gospel of Matthew.
[244]  After the King decreed the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens and after He manifested His authority as the King in many situations, in 9:9-13 we see Him feasting with sinners.
[245]  This verse says, And as Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man called Matthew, sitting in the customs office, and says to him, Follow Me. And he rose and followed Him.
[246]  Verse 11 says, And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to His disciples, Why does your teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?
[247]  The Pharisees, the strictest religious sect of the Jews, were proud of their superior sanctity of life, devotion to God, and knowledge of the Scriptures.
[248]  While the Lord Jesus was enjoying the feast with all the tax collectors and sinners, the Pharisees criticized and condemned Him, and they asked the disciples why their teacher ate with such people.
[249]  V. FASTING WITHOUT THE BRIDEGROOM A. The Disciples of John and the Pharisees
[250]  As a book of doctrine, Matthew presents us another case in 9:14-17: the case of fasting without the Bridegroom.
[251]  Verse 14 says, Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?
[252]  Verses 10 through 13 record the Lord s dealing with the question of the Pharisees, who were in the old religion.
[253]  John the Baptist s ministry was to introduce men to Christ that Christ might become their Redeemer, their life, and their all.
[254]  The unshrunk cloth signifies Christ from His incarnation to His crucifixion as a piece of new cloth, untreated, unfinished; whereas the new garment in Luke 5:36 signifies Christ, after being treated in His crucifixion, as a new robe.
[255]  Christ was firstly the unshrunk cloth for making a new garment, and then through His death and resurrection He was made a new garment to cover us as our righteousness before God that we might be justified by God and acceptable to Him Luke 15:22; Gal 3:27; 1 Cor 1:30; Phil 3:9 .
[256]  Verse 17 says, Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out, and the wineskins are destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.
[257]  The Greek word translated new in this verse is neos, which means new in time, recent, young.
[258]  The new wine here signifies Christ as the new life, full of vigor, stirring people to excitement.
[259]  The Greek word for fresh is kainos, which means new in nature, quality, or form; unaccustomed, unused; hence, fresh.
[260]  The fresh wineskins signify the church life in the local churches as the container of the new wine, which is Christ Himself as the exciting life.
[261]  The kingdom people are built into the church 16:18 , and the church is expressed through the local churches in which they live 18:15-20 .
[262]  With the kingdom people, it is not a matter of fasting or of any other religious practice, but a matter of the church life with Christ as their content.
[263]  Christ came not to establish an earthly religion of rituals, but a heavenly kingdom of life, not with any dead religious practices, but with Himself, the living Person, as the Physician, the Bridegroom, the unshrunk cloth, and the new wine to His followers as their full enjoyment that they might be the fresh wineskin to contain Him and become the constituents of His kingdom.
[264]  If you do not see this ministry in such a way, if you cannot see the environment created by this ministry for the revelation of Christ, and if you cannot see all the items of what Christ is, you may read the Gospel of Matthew a hundred times without receiving anything from it.
[265]  In verses 23 through 26 we have the healing of the synagogue ruler s daughter.
[266]  The daughter here and Peter s mother-in-law in 8:14-15, both representing the Jews at the end of this age, were healed in a house by the Lord s coming and direct touch.
[267]  This indicates that at the end of this age all the remnant of the Jews will be saved in the house of Israel by the Lord s coming and His direct touch Rom 11:25-26; Zech 12:10 .
[268]  The two blind men were healed in the house by the Lord s direct touch v. 29 , as were both the daughter of the ruler v. 25 and Peter s mother-in-law 8:14-15 . The opening of the blind men s eyes signifies the recovery of inward sight to see God and spiritual things Acts 9:17-18; 26:18; Eph 1:18; Rev 3:18 .
[269]  The continuation of the King s ministry in chapter nine brought forth another situation that enabled Him to reveal Himself.
[270]  After the healing of the woman with the flow of blood, the raising of the young girl, and the healing of the two blind men and the dumb man, the Lord is revealed as the Shepherd and as the Lord of the harvest.
[271]  The King of the heavenly kingdom considered Himself not only the Shepherd of the sheep, but also the Lord of the harvest.
[272]  His kingdom is established with things of life that can grow and multiply.
[273]  In verses 2 through 4 the names of the twelve apostles are given.
[274]  In sending out the twelve apostles, the Lord arranged them in pairs: Simon Peter and Andrew, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean and Judas Iscariot.
[275]  LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE THIRTY THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE KING S MINISTRY 2
[276]  The Lord s word in Matthew 10 is a word spoken to the sent ones.
[277]  In 10:16 11:1 many things are brought to the surface.
[278]  By seeing these things, we shall be able to understand the situation in which we find ourselves today.
[279]  The heavenly King s prediction here concerning the persecution of His apostles by Judaism indicated that the kingdom He was establishing through His apostles preaching would be rejected by Judaism.
[280]  as a Testimony for the Heavenly King s Sake
[281]  Verse 18 says, And you shall be brought before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations.
[282]  Thus, the Lord indicated that God s kingdom would be opposed not only by the Jewish religious world but also by the Gentile secular world.
[283]  This reveals that both the religious world and the political world are the same in opposing the kingdom of the heavens, for both are under the usurping hand of God s enemy.
[284]  In verses 19 and 20 the Lord said, But when they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you shall speak; for it shall be given to you in that hour what you shall speak; for you are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is the One speaking in you.
[285]  In verses 26 and 27 the King told His sent ones not to fear the persecutors, but rather to speak in the light and to preach on the housetops.
[286]  In verse 28 He said, And do not fear those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but fear rather Him Who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.
[287]  This word implies that if the apostles sent by the Lord fail in the suffering of persecution, they will be disciplined by God.
[288]  In verses 32 and 33 the Lord said, Everyone therefore who shall confess Me before men, I also will confess him before My Father Who is in the heavens; but whoever shall deny Me before men, I also will deny him before My Father Who is in the heavens.
[289]  B. The Way to Follow the Heavenly King 1.
[290]  In verses 37 through 39 we have the way to follow the heavenly King.
[291]  In verse 37 the Lord said, He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me. Our love must be absolute for the Lord.
[292]  Verse 38 continues, And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. Christ was crucified by taking the Father s will 26:39, 42 . When He was baptized, He was counted as crucified, and from that time He bore His cross to do the will of God.
[293]  In Matthew 11 we see the result of the King s ministry.
[294]  In chapter ten the Lord told the apostles that they would be persecuted and hated, even by the so-called holy people in the Sanhedrin and in the synagogues.
[295]  John was rejected, the Lord Jesus was rejected, and according to His charge to the twelve apostles, their ministry also was to be rejected.
[296]  The questions John s disciples asked the Lord might have given the Lord s apostles a negative impression of John.
[297]  Thus, in verses 7 through 15 the Lord publicly appraised His forerunner.
[298]  Concealed within the Lord s reply to John was an indication of John s weakness.
[299]  John had declared, Behold the Lamb of God, and John and Andrew followed the Lord Jesus.
[300]  John was sent by God as a messenger before Christ to prepare the way for Him 11:10 that the people might be turned to God and receive the heavenly King and the heavenly kingdom.
[301]  In verse 11 the Lord says, Truly I say to you, Among those born of women, there has not arisen a greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is smaller in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.
[302]  Verse 12 says, And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence, and violent men seize it.
[303]  The word of Christ concerning His forerunner John the Baptist was deeply related to Himself and the heavenly kingdom.
[304]  ACKNOWLEDGING THE FATHER S WILL WITH PRAISE A. Answering the Father in His Fellowship
[305]  Verse 25 says, At that time Jesus answered and said, I praise You, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth.
[306]  In the Lord s address of praise, Father refers to the Father s relationship with Him, the Son; whereas the Lord of the heaven and of the earth refers to God s relationship with the universe.
[307]  The Lord praised the Father for having revealed these things to babes.
[308]  In 16:17, after Peter had received the revelation that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God, Jesus said to him, You are blessed, Simon Bar-jona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father Who is in the heavens.
[309]  If your parents and relatives would be one with you regarding the Lord s recovery, you would be excited and praise the Lord.
[310]  But you must praise the Lord as you are experiencing rejection, saying, I praise You, Father, because You are the Lord of the heavens and of the earth.
[311]  The Lord s recovery is not a common Christian work; it is the gathering of the Lord s remnant to recover God s kingdom in the church life.
[312]  In verse 28 the Lord sounded out a call: Come to Me, all who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest.
[313]  The Lord seemed to be saying, All you who labor and are burdened, come to Me and rest.
[314]  All you religious people and all you worldly people who are laboring and are burdened, come to Me and I will give you rest.
[315]  After the Lord had praised the Father, acknowledging the Father s way and declaring the divine economy, He called this kind of people to come to Him for rest.
[316]  In this message we come to the establishment of the King s rejection 12:1-50 .
[317]  Verse 2 says, But the Pharisees seeing it said to Him, Behold, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.
[318]  The Pharisees, the Sabbath Patrol, caught the Lord Jesus and His disciples.
[319]  According to verses 3 and 4, the Lord asked the Pharisees, Have you not read what David did when he was hungry and those who were with him; how he entered into the house of God, and they ate the showbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but for the priests only?
[320]  In verse 5 the Lord asked the Pharisees, Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?
[321]  The Lord brought to the attention of the Pharisees another case in the Scriptures to prove to them how little they really knew the Bible.
[322]  Following this, the Lord said, But if you had known what this is: I will have mercy and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless v. 7 . By this, the Lord pointed out that what the Pharisees did was not according to God s heart.
[323]  When the Pharisees inquired of the Lord whether it was lawful to heal on the Sabbath, He said to them, What man shall there be of you who shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the Sabbaths, will he not lay hold of it and lift it out?
[324]  Verse 14 says, And going out, the Pharisees took counsel against Him, how they might destroy Him.
[325]  In the eyes of the religious Pharisees, for the Lord to break the Sabbath was to destroy the covenant of God with the nation of Israel, that is, to destroy the relationship between God and Israel.
[326]  Verse 20, a further quotation from Isaiah, says, A bruised reed He shall not break, and smoking flax He shall not quench, until He brings forth judgment unto victory.
[327]  As the One anointed with the Spirit, Christ not only will make no noise in the streets, but He will not break a bruised reed or quench smoking flax.
[328]  We have seen that Matthew is a book concerned with the doctrine of the kingdom.
[329]  In his Gospel Matthew does not give us a record of history; he takes the facts of history and puts them together to reveal the doctrine of the kingdom.
[330]  Thus far, we have seen that Christ was born, was anointed, was tested, began His ministry, drew a crowd, decreed the heavenly constitution, and continued His ministry.
[331]  Although the crowds were amazed, the Pharisees were offended, unable to tolerate the fact that through an extraordinary miracle the Lord Jesus had gained all the crowds.
[332]  In verse 31 the Lord said to the Pharisees, Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven men, but the blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven.
[333]  Because they could not defeat the Lord Jesus by arguing, to save face they changed the subject from one thing to another; they asked the Lord for a sign.
[334]  In the Lord s conversation with the Pharisees, suddenly another sign appeared: the sign of Solomon.
[335]  Verse 42 says, The queen of the south shall be raised in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
[336]  This also is a type of Christ, who is building the church to be the temple of God and speaking the word of wisdom, and to Him the Gentile seekers turn.
[337]  Both of these types indicate that Christ, whether as the Prophet sent by God or the King anointed by God, would turn from Israel to the Gentiles, as prophesied in verses 18 and 21.
[338]  In order to understand this chapter, we must keep in mind that Matthew is concerned with the doctrine of the kingdom.
[339]  Whatever is recorded in the Gospel of Matthew is according to the kingdom and according to the history of the kingdom.
[340]  Chapter one covers Christ s genealogy and birth, and chapter two, the Gentile wise men seeking Christ and worshipping Him, the flight of Christ to Egypt and His return to Israel to be raised in Nazareth.
[341]  In chapter three we see the recommendation and the anointing; in chapter four, the temptation and the beginning of the King s ministry to gain the crowds; and in chapters five, six, and seven, the decree of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens.
[342]  Chapter eight includes the continuation of the King s ministry in healing the leper, the centurion s servant boy, and Peter s mother-in-law, and the Lord s authority exercised over the wind, the sea, and the demons.
[343]  In chapter ten we have the appointment and sending out of the twelve apostles, and in chapter eleven, John s attempt to stir up the King, the King s answer and His appraisal of John, His rebuke of the stubborn generation, and the calling of people to come to His rest.
[344]  Finally, chapter twelve covers the breaking of the Sabbath regulations to show that the Lord is the Head and that He cares for the members of His body, the battle for the kingdom, the climax of the King s rejection, the prophecy of the generation becoming worse, and the forsaking of the Jewish generation and the turning to the believers.
[345]  In addition to the section on the reality of the kingdom, chapters five through seven, and the section on the outward appearance of the kingdom, chapter thirteen, there is a third section equally crucial in understanding the kingdom of the heavens: the Lord s prophecy given on the Mount of Olives recorded in chapter twenty-four.
[346]  I. THE PRELIMINARY WORK OF THE KINGDOM A. The Heavenly King Going out of the House
[347]  Matthew 13:1 says, On that day Jesus, going out of the house, sat beside the sea.
[348]  The Mysteries of the Kingdom of the Heavens Hidden to the Crowds but Explained to the Disciples
[349]  Before we consider the parables in Matthew 13, I would like to impress you with some of the warnings found in this chapter.
[350]  Verses 10 and 11 say, And the disciples came and said to Him, Why are You speaking in parables to them?
[351]  And He answered and said to them, Because to you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it has not been given.
[352]  The King of the heavenly kingdom revealed the things of the kingdom in parables v. 34 in order to make them mysteries to the opposing and rejecting Jews, that they might not understand them.
[353]  When the disciples asked the Lord why He spoke of the kingdom in parables, the Lord seemed to say, In order to keep it from them and to let you know.
[354]  LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE THIRTY-SIX THE UNVEILING
[355]  We come in this message to the first mystery of the kingdom, covered in 13:3 through 8 and 18 through 23.
[356]  At the beginning of the first of the seven parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom, the Lord did not say, The kingdom of the heavens was likened unto, as He did in the other six parables vv.
[357]  In the first parable, the Lord was going out only to sow the seed for the kingdom.
[358]  Hence, the kingdom had not yet come, but had only drawn near in the Lord s preaching 4:17 .
[359]  It is the word of the kingdom with the King in it as life v. 19 . The seed is also the sons, the people, of the kingdom v. 38 . If we check with our experience, we shall realize that the seed sown by the Lord Jesus into our humanity is just Himself as life to make us the seed of the kingdom.
[360]  Verse 4 says, And as He sowed, some seeds indeed fell beside the way, and the birds came and devoured them.
[361]  This kind of wayside signifies the heart that is hardened by the worldly traffic and does not open to understand, to comprehend, the word of the kingdom v. 19 . The birds signify the evil one, Satan, who came and snatched away the word of the kingdom sown in the hardened heart.
[362]  If you compare the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens with the parable of the sower, you will see that this parable is based upon the concept of the constitution.
[363]  Verse 7 says, And others fell on the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them.
[364]  May we all be impressed that today in the Lord s recovery the Lord is doing the work of sowing Himself into people so that He may have the good earth to grow Himself into the kingdom.
[365]  In the last message we saw that the good earth is the people according to the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens.
[366]  The constitution is a complete description of the good earth, of one who is poor in spirit and pure in heart, who has no worldly traffic within him, whose being is not hardened, who has no hidden rocks of temper, lust, self, and flesh concealed within him.
[367]  Verse 25 says, But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares amidst the wheat and went away.
[368]  The men were the slaves v. 27 , referring to the Lord s slaves, mainly the apostles.
[369]  It was when the Lord s slaves were sleeping, not watching, that the Lord s enemy, the Devil, came and sowed false believers amidst the true ones.
[370]  In the Old Testament, the children of Israel in the kingdom of God were likened to grapes growing in the vineyard 21:33-34 , whereas in the New Testament, the kingdom people in the kingdom of the heavens are likened to wheat growing in the field.
[371]  Verse 30 says, Allow both to grow together until the harvest, and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather first the tares and bind them into bundles to burn them up, but the wheat bring together into My barn.
[372]  The harvest is the consummation of the age, and the reapers are angels v. 39 . At the consummation of this age, the Lord will send the angels firstly to gather all the tares, all stumbling blocks, and those who do lawlessness, bind them into bundles, and burn them with the fire of the lake of fire vv.
[373]  Then the wheat, the righteous, will be brought together into the King s barn, the kingdom of their Father, to shine forth as the sun vv.
[374]  In this message we shall continue to see the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.
[375]  As the parable of the tares reveals, the constituents of the kingdom are the sons of the kingdom, who have the divine life within them.
[376]  However, the tares, the sons of the Devil, have come in. Because of these false ones among the constituents, the kingdom in its outward appearance has become Christendom.
[377]  Formerly it was purely the kingdom of God, but now it has become Christendom with both real believers and false ones.
[378]  Verse 32 says that after the mustard seed has grown, It is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree.
[379]  The church, which is the embodiment of the kingdom, should be like an herb to produce food, but it became a tree, a lodging place for birds, having its nature and function changed.
[380]  This is against the law of God s creation, that every plant must be after its kind Gen 1:11-12.
[381]  OF THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF THE KINGDOM A. The Parable of Leaven
[382]  With the appearance of the kingdom, there are three items: the changed nature, the tares; the changed outward appearance, the fa ade, the big tree; and the inward rottenness and corruption, the leaven.
[383]  In the Bible the number seven is composed of six plus one, three plus four, or four plus three.
[384]  Verse 44 says, The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid, and in his joy goes and sells all, whatever he has, and buys that field.
[385]  The treasure hidden in the field must consist of gold or precious stones, the materials for the building of the church and the New Jerusalem 1 Cor 3:12; Rev 21:18-20 .
[386]  Because the church is the practical kingdom today, and the New Jerusalem will be the kingdom in manifestation in the coming age, therefore the treasure hidden in the field signifies the kingdom hidden in God s created world.
[387]  Verses 45 and 46 say, Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking fine pearls, and finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all, whatever he had, and bought it.
[388]  The merchant in verse 45 is also Christ, who was seeking the church for His kingdom.
[389]  It is correct to say that we are in both the church and the kingdom, but we must know in what sense we are the church and in what sense we are the kingdom.
[390]  Before we consider the parable of the net, I would like to say a further word regarding the treasure and the pearl.
[391]  Verse 47 says, Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a net cast into the sea and gathering of every kind.
[392]  The net here does not signify the gospel of grace, which is preached in the church age, but the eternal gospel, which will be preached to the Gentile world in the great tribulation Rev 14:6-7 .
[393]  At the end of this chapter the Lord spoke an additional parable.
[394]  Verse 52 says, And He said to them, Therefore, every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man that is a householder, who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.
[395]  After giving the seven parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom, the Lord likened the discipled scribe to a householder who has a treasure, a rich store, of things new and old, signifying not only the new and old knowledge of the Scriptures, but also the new and old experiences of life in the kingdom.
[396]  LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE FORTY-ONE THE TREASURE AND THE PEARL
[397]  Throughout the centuries, these two parables have not been properly and thoroughly understood, nor have they been correctly applied.
[398]  In other words, the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens encompass the main points of Christian history between the Lord s first coming and His second coming.
[399]  As I was considering this matter before the Lord, He showed me that in history besides the real believers, the false believers, Christendom, the apostate church, the heresies and heathen practices, and Christ as food, there have been the overcomers, who are more solid, genuine, precious, and valuable in the eyes of God than the wheat.
[400]  Many saints in the Lord s recovery can testify that they are not merely wheat, but something more solid, valuable, and precious.
[401]  Before certain brothers and sisters came to the Lord s recovery, they were wheat.
[402]  But after you are reduced, constricted, and transformed, you have the assurance that you are more precious to the Lord.
[403]  The parables of the pearl and the treasure match the verses which say, Enter in through the narrow gate...for the gate is narrow and the way is constricted which leads to life, and few are those who find it 7:13-14 .
[404]  The wide gate and broad way lead to destruction.
[405]  At this point we need to refer to 1 Corinthians 3, where Paul admonishes us to take heed how we build upon the foundation of Christ.
[406]  Toward the end of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord said, Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name do many works of power?
[407]  Because Matthew is a book on the kingdom of the heavens, Christ is here revealed as the heavenly King.
[408]  In the other Gospels He is revealed as a man Luke , as a slave Mark , and as the Son of God John .
[409]  The first thirteen chapters of Matthew cover many crucial items related to Christ.
[410]  If we put all these titles together the Physician, the Bridegroom, the Shepherd, the Lord of the harvest, the real David, the greater temple, the Lord of the Sabbath, the greater Jonah, and the greater Solomon we shall realize that Christ as the King of the heavens is so much to us.
[411]  The first thing we face on this pathway is rejection.
[412]  Because Christ is the rejected One, we must be rejected also.
[413]  Verse 58 says, And He did not do many works of power there because of their unbelief.
[414]  LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE FORTY-THREE THE PATHWAY TO GLORY 2
[415]  In this message we come to 14:14-21, the record of the Lord s miraculous feeding of the crowd in the wilderness.
[416]  Speaking of the loaves and fishes mentioned in verse 17, the Lord said in verse 18, Bring them to Me. Whatever we have of the Lord we need to bring to the Lord that it might become a great blessing to many others.
[417]  The Lord often uses what we offer to Him to provide for the need of others.
[418]  It is also in this way that He provides for the need of His followers today.
[419]  Although you may say that you do not have anything to offer to the Lord, you at least have yourself.
[420]  Praise the Lord that we all can give ourselves to Him!
[421]  John 6:9 tells us that the five loaves are barley loaves.
[422]  While the loaves are of the vegetable life, signifying the generating aspect of Christ s life, the fishes are of the animal life, signifying the redeeming aspect of Christ s life.
[423]  To satisfy our spiritual hunger, we need Christ s generating life as well as His redeeming life.
[424]  Twelve baskets full of fragments indicate not only that the resurrected Christ is unlimited and inexhaustible, but also that the Lord s provision for us is abundant, more than sufficient to meet all our need.
[425]  And in the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea v. 25 . According to the Roman guards, there were four night watches, each of three hours, from sunset to sunrise.
[426]  Thinking that the Lord was a phantom, the disciples cried out for fear v. 26 . But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Have courage; It is I; do not fear v. 27 . The heavenly King brought courage to the disciples by His presence.
[427]  Verse 32 says, And when they went up into the boat, the wind ceased.
[428]  This miracle not only testifies that the Lord is the Ruler of the heavens and the earth, but also that He cares for the hardships of His followers as they follow Him on the pathway to glory.
[429]  However, in being quick and bold to step out of the boat and walk on the sea, we must take care of four things: first, that we act upon the word of the Lord, not without hearing a word from Him; second, that our direction is toward the Lord Himself; third, that we get into the Lord s presence; and fourth, that we come back to the boat.
[430]  As we follow the Lord on the pathway to glory, we experience rejection, the lack of necessities, and the storm on the sea.
[431]  In this message we shall see how the Lord dealt with the accusations of the traditional religionists 15:1-20 .
[432]  Isaiah has well prophesied concerning you, saying, This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far away from Me. The heavenly ruling of the kingdom requires inward reality, not mere outward practice, in that it deals with the real condition of the heart, not the expression of the lips.
[433]  The tradition of the Pharisees was outward, but the Lord s concern was for something inward.
[434]  But we in the Lord s recovery have both the objective Christ and the subjective Christ.
[435]  John 7:29 says, I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me, and John 15:26 says, But when the Comforter comes, Whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality Who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me. The Greek preposition rendered from in these verses and in John 6:46 has the meaning of from with . The Son is sent not only from the Father, but also from with the Father.
[436]  Again I say, in the eyes of God it is not a matter of the outward appearance, but a matter of the inward reality, not a matter of what we say, but a matter of what we are.
[437]  As we have pointed out many times, the Gospel of Matthew is not a book of history, but a book of doctrine.
[438]  Matthew puts together certain historical facts for the purpose of revealing a doctrine.
[439]  If you compare the four Gospels, you will see that Matthew presents the facts of history in an order different from that found in Mark or John.
[440]  The arrangement of the facts in Matthew s record, however, is not according to history, but according to doctrine, because Matthew presents to us the doctrine concerning the kingdom.
[441]  FEEDING ON CHRIST BY FAITH A. Outside the Sphere of Religion
[442]  Verse 21 says, And Jesus went from there and departed into the districts of Tyre and Sidon.
[443]  The unbelief of the Galileans caused the Lord Jesus not to do many works of power among them 13:58 , and the rejection of Herod caused Him to depart to the desert 14:13 .
[444]  In 15:1 the religionists came down from Jerusalem to spy on the Lord Jesus and to find fault with Him.
[445]  At this point the Lord said, I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel v. 24 . If you read the Gospels carefully, you will see that the Lord Jesus never took a word from His disciples.
[446]  as a Heathen Dog under the Table of the Master
[447]  When the Lord Jesus referred to the Canaanite woman as a dog, she said, Yes, Lord; for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters table v. 27 . The Canaanite woman, not offended by the Lord s word, but rather admitting that she was a heathen dog, considered that at that time Christ, after being rejected by the children, the Jews, became crumbs under the table as a portion to the Gentiles.
[448]  The holy land of Israel was the table on which Christ, the heavenly bread, came as a portion to the children of Israel.
[449]  In 15:29-31 we have a record of healing for the glorification of God.
[450]  Due to the rejection of the Jewish religion, the Lord remained in Galilee of the nations as the healing light.
[451]  Because the Lord had compassion on the multitude in the wilderness, He would not send them away fasting v. 32 . Christ will not allow His followers to hunger and faint in the way while following Him.
[452]  When the disciples learned that the Lord intended to provide food for the people, they said to Him, Where in a desert are there so many loaves for us as to satisfy so great a crowd? v. 33 . Even in the barren desert the Lord was able to feed His followers and satisfy them, no matter how many there were.
[453]  If we offer all we have to the Lord, He will take it, break it, and give it back to us for distribution to others, to whom it will become the satisfying and overflowing blessing v. 37 . Whatever we offer to the Lord, however little it is, will be multiplied by His blessing hand to meet the need of a great multitude v. 38 .
[454]  The book of Matthew often joins things together which apparently have no connection.
[455]  We see this at the end of chapter fifteen and the beginning of chapter sixteen.
[456]  Why does 16:1 say that the Lord Jesus was tempted?
[457]  A. Temptation of the Pharisees and the Sadducees 1.
[458]  Matthew 16:1 says, And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and tempting Him asked Him to show them a sign out of heaven.
[459]  The Lord s word here implies that to that evil and adulterous, Jewish and religious generation, the Lord would do nothing but die and be resurrected as a sign, the greatest sign to them, that they might be saved if they would believe.
[460]  At this juncture the Lord brought in the matter of leaven, saying, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees v. 6 . As we have pointed out, this leaven is the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees v. 12 . The teaching of the Pharisees was hypocritical 23:13, 15, 23, 25, 27, 29 , and the teaching of the Sadducees was like today s modernism, denying the resurrection, angels, and spirits Acts 23:8 . Hence, the teachings of both the Pharisees and Sadducees were impure and evil, and were likened to leaven, which was forbidden to be seen with God s people Exo 13:7 .
[461]  In 16:13-20 we come to a section of the Gospel of Matthew concerned with the revelation of Christ and the church.
[462]  Before we consider the details of this section, we need to consider the connection between it and the foregoing section, verses 1-12.
[463]  The Lord brought His disciples purposely to such a place with a clear atmosphere that their thought might be released from the effects of the religious surroundings in the holy city and holy temple, and that He might reveal to them something new concerning Himself and the church, which is the pulse of His heavenly kingdom.
[464]  In verse 13 the Lord asked His disciples a question: Who do men say that the Son of Man is?
[465]  As a man, Christ was a mystery, not only to that generation, but also to people today.
[466]  After the Lord asked His disciples to say who they thought He was, Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God v. 16 . The Christ, as the anointed One of God, refers to the Lord s commission; whereas the Son of the living God, as the second of the Triune God, refers to His person.
[467]  His commission is to accomplish God s eternal purpose through His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and second advent, whereas His person embodies the Father and issues in the Spirit for a full expression of the Triune God.
[468]  The Greek word rendered Peter in verse 18 may also be rendered a stone, which is the material for God s building.
[469]  In verse 18 the Lord also said that the gates of Hades would not prevail against His church.
[470]  The gates of Hades refers to Satan s authority or power of darkness Col 1:13; Acts 26:18 , which cannot prevail against the genuine church built by Christ upon this revelation concerning Him as the rock, with stones such as Peter, a transformed human being.
[471]  This work of the Lord also indicates that Satan s power of darkness will attack the church; hence, there is spiritual warfare between Satan s power, which is his kingdom, and the church, which is God s kingdom.
[472]  On the pathway to glory we have rejection, the lack of necessities, the storm on the sea, and the accusation from religion, and then we learn how to eat Christ.
[473]  As the result of eating Christ, there is the healing for the glorification of God.
[474]  Following this, there is the corporate eating, the warning regarding leaven, and the clear revelation concerning Christ and the church.
[475]  Only when people have learned how to eat Christ and to beware of religious leaven and are under a clear sky, can the revelation of Christ and the church be given.
[476]  Many of us can testify that before we came to such a place, the revelation of Christ and the church did not come.
[477]  Verse 22 says, And Peter, taking Him to him, began to rebuke Him, saying, God be merciful to You, Lord; this shall by no means happen to You!
[478]  Peter s word reveals that the natural man is never willing to take the cross.
[479]  Peter s words God be merciful to You, Lord sound very nice, but they were actually a rebuke.
[480]  When we are setting our mind, not on the things of God, but on the things of men, we become Satan, a stumbling block to the Lord in the fulfillment of God s purpose.
[481]  but Losing the Soul-life for Christ s Sake
[482]  In verse 25 the Lord says, For whoever desires to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.
[483]  In following the Lord we should not save our soul-life, that is, we should not let the soul have its enjoyment.
[484]  But if we lose it for Christ s sake, we shall find it in the enjoyment of the kingdom in the coming age.
[485]  The Lord refers to the manifestation of the kingdom in verse 28: Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.
[486]  LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE FORTY-NINE THE MINIATURE OF THE MANIFESTATION
[487]  From 13:53 to 17:8 the record of the Gospel of Matthew portrays the way to follow the heavenly King, from His rejection to the entering in of the manifestation of the kingdom.
[488]  His followers not only shared His rejection by the Jews 13:53-58 , but were also persecuted and even martyred by Gentile politics 14:1-12 .
[489]  At that point, many sick ones were healed by touching Him 14:35-36 , but the hypocritical worshippers of God came to accuse Him because His followers transgressed their tradition 15:1-20 .
[490]  After all this, He brought His followers to the border of the holy land, close to Gentile country, that they might have a revelation of Him, of the church, and of the cross as the way for them to enter into the kingdom 16:13-28 .
[491]  Matthew 17:1 says, And after six days Jesus takes with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and brings them up into a high mountain apart.
[492]  Since the Lord s transfiguration transpired six days after the revelations concerning Christ and the church in chapter sixteen given at the very foot of Mount Hermon , the high mountain here must be Mount Hermon.
[493]  To receive the revelation concerning Christ and the church we must be far away from the religious environment; but to see the vision of the transfigured Christ we need to be on a high mountain, far above the earthly level.
[494]  Not many Christians realize that Christ s transfiguration was His coming in His kingdom.
[495]  When the disciples heard the voice out of the cloud, they fell on their face and feared exceedingly v. 6 . After the Lord Jesus came to them, touched them, and told them to arise and not to fear, they lifted up their eyes and saw no one except Jesus Himself alone v. 8 . Peter proposed to rank Moses and Elijah, that is, the law and the prophets, with Christ, but God took Moses and Elijah away, leaving no one except Jesus Himself alone.
[496]  The law and the prophets were shadows and prophecies, not the reality, which is Christ.
[497]  Now that Christ is here, the shadows and prophecies are no longer needed.
[498]  God took Moses and Elijah away because He would not tolerate seeing His children rank anyone on the same level as His Son Jesus Christ.
[499]  LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE FIFTY APPLICATION OF THE REVELATION
[500]  Immediately after the record of the Lord s transfiguration on the mountain, we have the record of the healing of a demon-possessed person 17:14-21 .
[501]  Although the three disciples, who represented the other disciples, had been in the miniature of the manifestation of the kingdom, there was still the need for three things: the dealing with the demon-possessed person, the revealing of the Lord s crucifixion and resurrection, and the paying of the half-shekel to the tax gatherers.
[502]  Unless we receive light from the Lord, it is difficult to see the connection between verses 1 through 23 and verses 24 through 27.
[503]  In chapter sixteen Peter received a clear revelation from the heavenly Father regarding Christ as the Son of the living God.
[504]  Verse 27 says, But that we may not stumble them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel; take that and give it to them for Me and you.
[505]  After convincing Peter that He did not need to pay the half-shekel, the Lord, as the New Testament Law-giver, today s Moses, gave the command to Peter to pay it for Him.
[506]  The Lord did this purposely to teach Peter that in God s New Testament economy, He is the unique One; neither Moses, Elijah, Peter, nor anyone else has the position to speak or to give a command.
[507]  Chapters eighteen, nineteen, and twenty are a distinct section of the Gospel of Matthew dealing with the relationships among the kingdom people.
[508]  In previous chapters we have seen the King s decree of the constitution of the kingdom, the King s ministry, and the revelation of the mystery of the kingdom.
[509]  We have also seen the pathway to glory and the practical matters that followed the Lord s transfiguration.
[510]  In the kingdom life, humility is required 18:1-4 .
[511]  If we are not humble, we shall either be offended by others or we shall offend others, that is, we shall either be stumbled by others or stumble others.
[512]  In order to deal with such an offending brother, we must exercise the kingdom authority.
[513]  Because the church today is weak, it does not realize its need to exercise this authority.
[514]  LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE FIFTY-TWO RELATIONSHIPS IN THE KINGDOM 2
[515]  It may seem that Matthew 18 is not a deep chapter and that the parable in verses 23 through 35 is shallow.
[516]  Actually, what is revealed in this chapter is very deep.
[517]  When most Christians read Matthew, they do not realize that this book deals not only with the doctrine of the kingdom, but with the practical kingdom life.
[518]  When I was young, I did not care to read Matthew 18 because I did not see that this chapter deals with the kingdom life.
[519]  The fact that this portion of the Word deals with the practical kingdom life is proved by verse 1: In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?
[520]  FORGIVING FOR BEING FORGIVEN A. Forgiving the Offending Brother
[521]  After listening to the Lord s word about the kingdom life, Peter asked Him a question: Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him?
[522]  According to the context of this parable, the settling of accounts here refers to the Lord s dealing with us in this age through such things as severe illness or certain extreme hardships which cause us to realize how much we owe the Lord and to beg Him to forgive us.
[523]  Verse 31 says, His fellow slaves, having seen what had taken place, were exceedingly grieved and came and explained to their lord all that had taken place.
[524]  If we do not forgive the brother who sins against us, it will grieve the other brothers, and they may bring this matter to the Lord.
[525]  If we do not forgive the brother who sins against us, we shall be disciplined by the Lord until we forgive him from the heart, that is, until we have paid everything we owe.
[526]  In God s governmental administration, His forgiveness is dispensational.
[527]  The period from the first coming of Christ to eternity is divided dispensationally into three ages: this age, the present one, from Christ s first to His second coming; the coming age, the millennium, the one thousand years for restoration and heavenly reigning, from Christ s second coming to the end of the old heaven and the old earth; and eternity, the eternal age of the new heaven and new earth.
[528]  If a believer, after being saved, commits any sin, but will not make a clearance through confession and the cleansing of the Lord s blood 1 John 1:7, 9 before he dies or the Lord comes back, this sin will not be forgiven in this age, but will remain to be judged at the judgment seat of Christ.
[529]  He will not be rewarded with the kingdom to participate in the glory and joy with Christ in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, but will be disciplined to make a clearance of this sin and be forgiven in the coming age.
[530]  If anyone offends the church and is not willing to repent or if he is offended and is not willing to forgive the one who has offended him, he will be out of the kingdom not only in this age but in the coming age.
[531]  In this message we come to 19:1-22, a portion in which Matthew places together certain incidents in Christ s life to show the requirements of the kingdom.
[532]  In 19:3-12 the Pharisees tempt the Lord by asking Him about divorce, and in 19:16-22 a rich man inquires of Him concerning eternal life.
[533]  But in Matthew they are not only recorded; they are put in the same portion of Matthew s Gospel.
[534]  The Lord s word in 19:4-6 not only recognizes God s creation of man, but also confirms God s ordination of marriage, that is, one man and one woman joined and yoked together as one flesh, inseparable by man.
[535]  Verse 10 says, The disciples say to Him, If the case of the man is thus with the wife, it is better not to marry.
[536]  Now the disciples realized that according to God s ordination, marriage is the strictest bond.
[537]  Verse 16 says, And behold, one came to Him and said, Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?
[538]  To have eternal life in John is to be saved with God s uncreated life that man may live by this life today and for eternity, whereas to have eternal life in Matthew is to participate in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens in this age and to share in its manifestation in the coming age.
[539]  When the young man told the Lord that he had observed all the commandments, the Lord said to him, If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven, and come, follow Me v. 21 . Even if the young man had observed the commandments of the old law as he had claimed, he was still not perfect, not up to the standard of the requirement of the complemented law; for he was not willing to sell what he had and lay up treasure in heaven, as the constitution of the kingdom required 6:19-21 . To follow the Lord is to love Him above all things 10:37-38 . This is the supreme requirement for entering into the kingdom of the heavens.
[540]  Loving material possessions above the Lord causes one to sorrow, but those who love Christ above all things are joyful in losing their possessions Heb 10:34 .
[541]  Verses 23 and 24 say, And Jesus said to His disciples, Truly I say to you, it is difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
[542]  And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
[543]  The kingdom of God is used in verse 24 instead of the kingdom of the heavens mentioned in verse 23, At this point, the kingdom of the heavens had not come, but the kingdom of God was present.
[544]  The Lord s word about it being easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God indicates the impossibility of entering into the kingdom of God by our natural life.
[545]  By our human life it is impossible to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but it is possible by the divine life, which is Christ Himself imparted into us that we may live the kingdom life.
[546]  B. To Inherit Eternal Life in the Coming Age
[547]  In verse 29, the Lord also speaks of inheriting eternal life.
[548]  To inherit eternal life is to be rewarded in the coming age Luke 18:29-30 with the enjoyment of the divine life in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.
[549]  In the manifestation of the kingdom, we shall participate in the enjoyment of eternal life in the millennial kingdom with the Lord Jesus.
[550]  This will be greater than the first aspect of the kingdom reward, which we receive in this age.
[551]  In verse 28 the Lord said, Truly I say to you that you who have followed Me, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of His glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
[552]  Matthew 20:1 and 2 say, For the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire workmen for his vineyard.
[553]  The morning here is 6:00 a.m., denoting the earliest part of the church age, when Christ came to call His disciples into the kingdom.
[554]  E. The Householder s Answer Showing Grace according to His Desire
[555]  Verse 13 says, But he answered and said to one of them, Friend, I am not wronging you, did you not agree with me for a denarius?
[556]  By one of them the Lord was no doubt referring to Peter.
[557]  Here the Lord seemed to be saying, Peter, we signed an agreement.
[558]  After the Lord spoke regarding the requirements of the kingdom and the kingdom reward, He was still concerned about the spiritual situation of His followers.
[559]  Therefore, after giving His disciples a definition of the kingdom reward, He spoke to them again about His coming crucifixion and resurrection.
[560]  Although we may not think that we need a further word or a further revelation, the Lord knows our need.
[561]  In verses 22 and 23 the Lord replied, You do not know what you are asking.
[562]  He said to them, My cup you shall indeed drink, but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father.
[563]  In answering the mother of James and John the Lord said, To sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father v. 23 . These words indicate that the Lord had a submissive spirit.
[564]  LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE FIFTY-SIX THE WARM WELCOME OF THE HEAVENLY KING,
[565]  In verses 2 and 3, the Lord told two of His disciples, Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her; loose them and lead them to Me. And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, The Lord has need of them, and immediately he will send them.
[566]  Verse 5 says that the King came mounted on a donkey and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.
[567]  This signifies the meek and lowly state in which the Lord was willing to present Himself.
[568]  The Lord did not tell His disciples to get a carriage or a wagon, but a donkey and a colt.
[569]  Verse 9 says, And the crowds who went before Him and those who followed cried out, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; Blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest!
[570]  In the warm welcome of the heavenly King, the people shouted out a quotation from Psalm 118: Blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord v. 26 . According to Psalm 118, only the One who came in the name of the Lord was qualified to be praised in such a way.
[571]  Those who welcomed the King indicated through their praise that He was the One sent by the Lord, thus the One who came in the name of the Lord.
[572]  When the heavenly King entered into Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, but the crowd still said, This is the prophet Jesus, who is from Nazareth of Galilee v. 11 . On the one hand, the crowds praised Him as the Son of David, the One who comes in the name of the Lord; on the other hand, some still recognized Him in a natural way as a prophet from a despised city.
[573]  Verse 17 says, And leaving them, He went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there.
[574]  In His last visit to Jerusalem, the Lord remained there only during the day for His ministry.
[575]  After the Lord Jesus comes into us and cleanses our spirit, we may sense that He leaves us, just as He left Jerusalem for Bethany after cleansing the temple.
[576]  The Lord may come into you, cleanse your spirit, which is the temple of God, and leave for another place.

[578]  The events in chapter twenty-one took place during the last week of the Lord s life on earth John 12:1 .
[579]  In this period of time He willingly presented Himself to the children of Israel for a thorough examination.
[580]  We have seen that the last time the Lord Jesus came to Jerusalem He came not to work, but to present Himself to those who were to slaughter Him.
[581]  In verse 24 we see the Lord s answer: I also will ask you one question, which if you tell Me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things: The baptism of John, whence was it?
[582]  After the Lord Jesus had dealt with the chief priests and elders in such a wise manner, He gave them a parable about a man who had two children vv.
[583]  When they said the first, the Lord said to them, Truly I say to you, that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God before you v. 31 .
[584]  Although you may have been in Christianity for years and may have heard that Christ was the Son of God, the Savior, the Redeemer, and perhaps even your life, you probably never heard that Christ is also God s building stone.
[585]  In this message we come to 22:1-14, the parable of the marriage feast.
[586]  In His answer to their question regarding His authority, He spoke three parables: the parable of the shifting of the birthright, the parable of the vineyard, and the parable of the marriage feast.
[587]  The parable of the vineyard indicates that the kingdom of God was about to be taken away from Israel and given to the church.
[588]  In the foregoing parable 21:33-46 , the Lord illustrated how the Jews would be punished, and how the kingdom of God would be taken from them and given to the kingdom people.
[589]  The fact that the troops here are described as the king s troops indicates that all the armies on earth are the Lord s. Thus, the army of the Roman Empire was actually God s army.
[590]  Verses 12 and 13 say, Friend, how did you come in here not having a marriage garment?
[591]  To be cast out into the outer darkness is not to perish; it is to be dealt with dispensationally for not having lived an overcoming life by Christ to qualify for participation in the enjoyment of the kingdom during the millennium.
[592]  After the Lord Jesus had been examined by the chief priests and the elders of the people concerning the source of His authority, the disciples of the Pharisees with the Herodians questioned Him about giving tribute to Caesar 22:15-22 .
[593]  Normally they sided with the Sadducees, but were opposed to the Pharisees; here they united with the Pharisees to ensnare the Lord Jesus.
[594]  When the Pharisees learned that the Lord had silenced the Sadducees, they held a council about what to do next.
[595]  Then one of them, a lawyer, tempted the Lord by asking Him a question about the great commandment in the law.
[596]  LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE SIXTY REBUKING THE JEWISH RELIGIONISTS
[597]  After the Lord had been examined and tested by the religious leaders, in His wisdom He muzzled them.
[598]  In this message we shall consider the Lord s rebuking of the Jewish religionists and His forsaking of Jerusalem with its temple.
[599]  For example, in verse 8 the Lord says, But you, do not be called Rabbi; for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers, This indicates that Christ is our only teacher and master.
[600]  Verse 16 says, Woe to you, blind guides, who say, Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor.
[601]  In verse 17 the Lord continues, Fools and blind, for which is greater, the gold or the temple which sanctifies the gold?
[602]  In verses 20 through 22 the Lord says that he who swears by the altar, swears by it and by all things upon it; that he who swears by the temple, swears by it and by Him who dwells in it; and that he who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.
[603]  After the Lord had been tested and examined and after He had rebuked the scribes and Pharisees, He forsook Jerusalem with its temple.
[604]  The knowledge most Christians have of Matthew 24 and 25 is vague and indefinite.
[605]  As we come to these chapters, we need to drop this kind of vague knowledge.
[606]  For the basic understanding of these chapters we are standing upon the shoulders of many great teachers who have gone before us.
[607]  According to church history, not until about one hundred fifty years ago were these chapters opened to the Lord s people.
[608]  If you collect the various writings regarding Christ s second coming, the great tribulation, the prophecy concerning the seventy weeks in Daniel, and the rapture, you will see that during the past one hundred fifty years the knowledge of Matthew 24 and 25 has progressed.
[609]  Verses 4 and 5 say, And Jesus answered and said to them, See that no one leads you astray.
[610]  For many shall come in My name, saying, I am the Christ, and they shall lead many astray.
[611]  The Lord s answer is of three sections: the first section 24:4-31 concerns the Jews who are the elect; the second 24:32 25:30 concerns the church; and the third 25:31-46 concerns the Gentiles, the nations.
[612]  Verse 9 says, Then they shall deliver you up to affliction and shall kill you, and you shall be hated by all the nations because of My name.
[613]  The emphasis of the gospel of grace is on forgiveness of sin, God s redemption, and eternal life; whereas the emphasis of the gospel of the kingdom is on the heavenly ruling of God and the authority of the Lord.
[614]  LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE SIXTY-TWO PROPHECY OF THE KINGDOM 2
[615]  We have seen that the Lord s answer to His disciples question is of three sections: the section concerning the Jews 24:4-31 , the section concerning the church 24:32 25:30 , and the section concerning the Gentiles 25:31-46 .
[616]  The section concerning Israel is divided into two parts: from Christ s ascension to the end of the age 24:1-14 and during the end of the age 24:15-31 .
[617]  Verse 23 says, Then if anyone says to you, Behold, here is the Christ, or, Here; do not believe it.
[618]  And as in the Scriptures both the Lord and those who trust in Him are likened to the eagle Exo 19:4; Deut 32:11; Isa 40:31 , and the swift destroying armies are also likened to flying eagles Deut 28:49; Hos 8:1, NASV , so the vultures here, of the same raptorial kind as the eagle, must refer to Christ and the overcomers, who will come as a swift-flying army to war against Antichrist and his armies and destroy them, thus executing God s judgment upon them at Armageddon.
[619]  In Christ s first coming, His authority was manifested in such things as casting out demons and healing diseases 7:29; 8:8-9; 9:8; 21:23-24 to vindicate Himself as the heavenly King; whereas in His second coming, His power will be exercised to execute God s judgment, to destroy Antichrist and his armies, and to bind Satan for the establishment of His kingdom on earth.
[620]  In this portion of the Word, everything spoken by the Lord is related to two matters: watchfulness and readiness, and faithfulness and prudence.
[621]  Verse 34 says, Truly I say to you, This generation shall by no means pass away until all these things take place.
[622]  This means that from the time the Lord Jesus delivered this prophecy until the full restoration of Israel, the moral situation of that generation will not be changed.
[623]  During the Lord s parousia, people will be the same; befuddled by the necessities of this life and not knowing that God s judgment signified by the flood will come upon them by the Lord s coming.
[624]  Then verse 43 says, But know this, that if the householder knew in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.
[625]  We have seen that the section of the prophecy of the kingdom concerning the church covers two aspects: the aspect of being watchful and ready and the aspect of being faithful and prudent.
[626]  Watchfulness and readiness are related to our Christian life.
[627]  We all need to be watchful and ready for the Lord s coming.
[628]  Matthew 25:1 says, Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
[629]  Believers, who are the kingdom people, are like chaste virgins, bearing the Lord s testimony the lamp in the dark age and going out of the world to meet the Lord.
[630]  Man is a vessel made for God Rom 9:21, 23-24 , and man s personality is in his soul.
[631]  Having oil in their lamps signifies that they have the Spirit of God dwelling in their spirit Rom 8:9, 16 , and taking oil in their vessels signifies that they have the fullness of the Spirit of God saturating their souls.
[632]  This word implies that even after resurrection the foolish believers will still need the fullness of the Spirit of God.
[633]  The foolish virgins represent the believers who have been regenerated by the Spirit of God dwelling in them, but who are not filled with the Spirit of God so that He may saturate their whole being.
[634]  Concerning the Christian life, the New Testament reveals that firstly we need to receive the Spirit of God into our spirit so that we may be regenerated.
[635]  Verse 14 says, For it is as a man who, going into another country, called his own slaves and delivered to them his possessions.
[636]  For life we need oil, the Spirit of God, even His fullness, that we may be enabled to live the virgin life for the Lord s testimony; for service, for work, we need the talent, the spiritual gift, that we may be equipped as a good slave for the accomplishment of the Lord s work.
[637]  Although the talents are not our ability, but the Lord s possession, they are delivered to us according to our ability.
[638]  Our ability is constituted by God s creation and our learning.
[639]  In this message we shall continue our consideration of the parable for faithfulness 25:14-30 .
[640]  A long time signifies the entire church age, and the coming signifies the Lord s coming to the air 1 Thes 4:16 in His parousia.
[641]  To settle accounts signifies the Lord s judgment at His judgment seat 2 Cor 5:10; Rom 14:10 in the air within His parousia , where the believers life, conduct, and work will be judged for reward or punishment 1 Cor 4:5; Matt 16:27; Rev 22:12; 1 Cor 3:13-15 .
[642]  The few things signify the Lord s work in this age, over signifies the ruling authority in the coming kingdom, and the many things signify the responsibilities in the coming kingdom.
[643]  Verse 24 says, And he also who received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.
[644]  The one-talented one, who did not gain any profit for the Lord, also came to the judgment seat of Christ in the air.
[645]  In this message we come to 25:31-46, the Lord s word concerning the judgment of the nations.
[646]  When the Lord s prophecy turned from the Jews to the church in 24:32, the word but was used to indicate this change.
[647]  Many Christian teachers have mixed up the Lord s word in the three sections of the prophecy of the kingdom, with some applying the verses concerning the Jews to the church.
[648]  Christ s Separating Them as a Shepherd Separates the Sheep from the Goats
[649]  This indicates that the Lord is the Shepherd not only of the believers John 10:11; Heb 13:20 and the Jews Psa 80:1; Jer 31:10 , but also of all the Gentiles Psa 100:1-3 .
[650]  In the millennium there will be three realms: the realm of the earth, where the blessing of God s creation, as mentioned in Genesis 1:28-30, will take place; the realm of the nation of Israel in Canaan, from the Nile to the Euphrates, in which the saved Jews will rule over the whole earth Isa 60:10-12; Zech 14:16-18 ; and the heavenly and spiritual realm 1 Cor 15:50-52 , where the overcoming believers will enjoy the kingdom reward 5:20; 7:21 .
[651]  The prophecy concerning the kingdom given by the Lord on the Mount of Olives concerns God s economy to bring in His kingdom.
[652]  The judgment according to the law for eternal perdition depends upon how one deals with God, the judgment according to the gospel for eternal salvation depends upon how the believer deals with Christ, and the judgment according to the eternal gospel for the sheep to inherit the millennial kingdom depends upon how they deal with the Lord s little brothers.
[653]  LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE SIXTY-EIGHT A TEST TO ALL PEOPLE
[654]  It is not an easy matter to understand the doctrinal point Matthew conveys in his Gospel.
[655]  However, Matthew is not a storybook, but a book on the doctrine of the kingdom of the heavens.
[656]  If we spend time in the Lord s presence to see the significance of these chapters in relation to the kingdom of the heavens, He will reveal it to us.
[657]  Although the religionists hated the Lord Jesus, His disciples loved Him vv.
[658]  Two of those who loved Him were Simon the leper and Mary, the woman who poured the oil upon His head.
[659]  Being grateful to the Lord and loving Him, he spread a feast v. 7 in his house for the Lord and His disciples in order to enjoy His presence.
[660]  In verse 11 the Lord said to the indignant disciples, For the poor you have with you always, but you do not always have Me. This indicates that we must love the Lord and grasp the opportunity to express our love to Him.
[661]  THE ESTABLISHING OF THE TABLE A. At the Feast of Passover
[662]  In verses 17 through 30 we see the keeping of the Passover and the establishing of the table.
[663]  Verse 17 says, Now on the first day of the Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?
[664]  The bread of the Lord s table is a symbol signifying the Lord s physical body broken for us on the cross to release His life that we may participate in it.
[665]  Verse 27 says, And taking the cup and giving thanks, He gave it to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you.
[666]  The bread is mentioned before the cup because God s eternal purpose is not to have redemption.
[667]  Nevertheless, we need to be reminded that as sinners we have the problem of sin and that the Lord Jesus shed His blood to cleanse us.
[668]  Concerning the Lord s table 1 Cor 10:21 , the bread signifies our participation in life, and the cup, our enjoyment of God s blessing.
[669]  By speaking this word, the Lord made it clear that from the time He established the table He would be physically away from the disciples and not drink the fruit of the vine with them until He drinks it new with them in the Father s kingdom.
[670]  LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE SIXTY-NINE PRESSED IN GETHSEMANE,
[671]  In this message we come to 26:31-75, a long section in the Gospel of Matthew that is also related to the kingdom.
[672]  The verses in this chapter regarding the Lord s table indicate that the Lord s death and resurrection have a great deal to do with the kingdom of the heavens.
[673]  In these verses, however, we cannot find the resurrection, although we do have a clear reference to the Lord s death in the breaking of the bread, which signifies the breaking of the Lord s body.
[674]  The Lord s word about the pouring out of His blood v. 28 is also an obvious reference to His death.
[675]  In the light of the contrast between Christ s victory and Peter s failure, let us now consider verses 31 through 75.
[676]  Verse 31 says, Then Jesus says to them, You will all be stumbled in Me this night, for it is written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.
[677]  The Lord was the Shepherd, and the disciples were the sheep who were to be scattered.
[678]  In His warning the Lord promised that He would be raised up and go to meet with them in resurrection in Galilee v. 32 . He also predicted that, on the night of His betrayal, Peter would deny Him three times v. 34 .
[679]  When He returned from praying the first time, He found the disciples sleeping v. 40 . The Lord Jesus had told them seriously that His soul was exceeding sorrowful, even unto death, and He had asked them to watch with Him v. 38 . But it seemed to them that nothing was going to happen and that everything was peaceful.
[680]  In verses 57 through 68 the Lord was judged by the Sanhedrin.
[681]  He was accused unjustly with false testimonies, but He did not say a word to vindicate Himself vv.
[682]  Then the high priest said to Him, I adjure you by the living God that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God v. 63 . This was the same question the Devil used in tempting the Lord 4:3, 6 . Verse 64 says, Jesus says to him, You said it! Moreover, I say to you, Henceforth you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.
[683]  The high priest asked the Lord if He was the Son of God, but He answered with the Son of Man.
[684]  The Lord is the Son of Man, not only on the earth before His crucifixion, but also in the heavens on the right hand of God after His resurrection Acts 7:56 , and even at His coming back on the clouds.
[685]  To accomplish God s purpose and to establish the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord had to be a man.
[686]  LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE SEVENTY JUDGED, CRUCIFIED, AND BURIED
[687]  In this message we come to chapter twenty-seven of Matthew.
[688]  Apparently, this chapter is not related to the kingdom of the heavens.
[689]  If we do not read this chapter in the light of the kingdom of the heavens, we shall not be able to understand it adequately.
[690]  In 5:10 the Lord said, Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens, and in 5:20 He said, For I say to you, that unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
[691]  In Jesus answering Pilate, Jesus admitted that He was the King of the Jews v. 11 . But to the accusation of the Jewish leaders He answered nothing.
[692]  Pilate, the Roman governor, had the position to judge Christ.
[693]  The kingdom of the heavens is based upon righteousness, but chapter twenty-seven reveals that the kingdom of the world is absolutely unrighteous.
[694]  CRUCIFIED BY MEN A. Mocked by the Roman Soldiers
[695]  Verses 27 through 32 show how the Lord Jesus was mocked by the heathen soldiers.
[696]  They stripped Him and put on Him a scarlet robe v. 28 . Verse 29 says, And having woven a crown of thorns, they placed it on His head, and a reed in His right hand; and they kneeled before Him and mocked Him saying, Hail, King of the Jews! Thorns are a symbol of the curse Gen 3:17-18 . The Lord Jesus became a curse for us on the cross Gal 3:13 . After spitting on the Lord, beating Him on His head, and mocking Him, they took the robe off Him, put His garments on Him, and led Him away to be crucified vv.
[697]  Although man was unrighteous, beginning in verse 45 God came in in a righteous way.
[698]  The sixth hour is our 12 noon, and the ninth is our 3 p.m. The Lord was crucified at the third hour, our 9 a.m. Mark 15:25 . He was suffering on the cross for six hours.
[699]  THE EFFECT OF HIS DEATH A. The Veil of the Temple
[700]  Verses 51 through 56 reveal the effect of Christ s crucifixion.
[701]  This signifies that the separation between God and man was abolished, because the flesh signified by the veil of sin taken by Christ Rom 8:3 had been crucified Heb 10:20 .
[702]  The Roman centurion and guards testified that Jesus was truly God s Son when they saw what happened at the death of Christ v. 54 . Many women, including Mary the Magdalene, Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus, the mother of the sons of Zebedee, and others, witnessed these happening.
[703]  LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE SEVENTY-ONE MAN S UNRIGHTEOUSNESS
[704]  In Matthew 27 we see a contrast between man s unrighteousness and God s righteousness.
[705]  Everything man did to the Lord Jesus set the stage for God s righteousness to come in. On man s side, everything was black, but on God s side, everything was white.
[706]  Secondly, the Christ who exposed man s unrighteousness to the uttermost also bore all the unrighteousness He had exposed.
[707]  He firstly exposed man s unrighteousness and then He bore it on the cross.
[708]  Love, on the contrary, is a matter of the emotion.
[709]  If I love you, I may choose to pay attention to you.
[710]  But if I do not love you, I may simply forget about you.
[711]  Many Christians like to quote John 3:16, the verse that says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.
[712]  LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE SEVENTY-TWO THE KING S VICTORY
[713]  Compared to chapters twenty-six and twenty-seven, chapter twenty-eight is short and simple.
[714]  This indicates that immediately after Christ s judicial death and immediately after the satisfaction of God s righteous requirements, Christ rested as the fulfillment of the prophecy of the Scriptures.
[715]  But after God had judged Christ in full, God s righteousness held Him responsible to release Christ from death and to raise Him up from among the dead.
[716]  Let us now consider some of the details of Christ s resurrection as presented in chapter twenty-eight of Matthew.
[717]  Verse 1 says, Now late on the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave.
[718]  This signifies that His resurrection brought a new start with a new age for the kingdom of the heavens.
[719]  Verse 16 says, But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus appointed them.
[720]  The constitution of the kingdom was decreed on a mountain, the heavenly King s transfiguration transpired on a high mountain, and the prophecy concerning this age was also given on a mountain.
[721]  Matthew s account of the resurrection is very different from John s. According to John s record, after His resurrection the Lord met with His disciples in a room where the doors had been shut John 20:19 . The disciples were frightened, being afraid of the Jews.
[722]  Verse 19 says, Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[723]  Because all authority had been given to Him, the heavenly King sent His disciples to go and disciple all the nations.
[724]  Then, based upon this, the disciples baptized the new converts Acts 2:38 , not only visibly into water, but also invisibly into the death of Christ Rom 6:3-4 , into Christ Himself Gal 3:27 , into the Triune God Matt 28:19 , and into the Body of Christ 1 Cor 12:13 .
[725]  Since the death of Christ is included in Christ, since Christ is the very embodiment of the Triune God, and since the Triune God is one with the Body of Christ, so to baptize new believers into the death of Christ, into Christ Himself, into the Triune God, and into the Body of Christ is to do just one thing: on the negative side to terminate their old life, and on the positive side to germinate them with a new life, the eternal life of the Triune God, for the Body of Christ.
[726]  In the opening chapter of Matthew, the Holy Spirit v. 18 , Christ the Son v. 18 , and God the Father v. 23 are upon the scene for the producing of the man Jesus v. 21 , who, as Jehovah the Savior and God with us, is the very embodiment of the Triune God.
[727]  In chapter twelve, the Son, in the person of man, cast out demons by the Spirit to bring in the kingdom of God the Father v. 28 . In chapter sixteen, the Son is revealed by the Father to the disciples for the building of the church, which is the life-pulse of the kingdom vv.
[728]  In chapter seventeen, the Son entered into transfiguration v. 2 and was confirmed by the Father s word of delight v. 5 for a miniature display of the manifestation of the kingdom 16:28 . Eventually, in the closing chapter, after Christ, as the last Adam, had passed through the process of crucifixion, entered into the realm of resurrection, and become the life-giving Spirit, He came back to His disciples, in the atmosphere and reality of His resurrection, to charge them to cause the heathen to become the kingdom people by baptizing them into the name, the Person, the reality, of the Trinity.
[729]  , and that to baptize them into the name of Christ is to baptize them into Christ the Person Gal 3:27; Rom 6:3 , for Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, and He, as the life-giving Spirit, is available any time and any place for people to be baptized into Him.
