<P>(4) There is no mention that the white garments worn by the elders are washed in the precious blood; however, in other passages where the white garments are mentioned, Revelation always says that they are cleansed by the blood of the Lamb (in 7:14, for example). The white garments here indicate that the elders do not have sin.</P><P>(5) The words that the elders speak are not words of redemption. Revelation 4:11 says that they speak of God's creation. Therefore, they know only God's creation and do not realize God's redemption. Although they sing a new song in 5:9-10, they do it because the Lord has redeemed "men." "Men" does not refer to the elders, but to those out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation.</P><P>(6) All the circumstances in chapter four represent the situation of the universe. Besides the throne and the seven Spirits, there are the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders. Nothing else is mentioned. This shows that those elders are the elders of the universe. Can we say that the church is composed of the most elderly ones in the universe?</P><P>(7) To bring prayers before God, as mentioned in 5:8, is not the work of the church. Although the Bible charges the church to pray for people, God has not charged her to bring before Him others' supplication for people. The church does not have such power. Many Bible expositors agree that the angel in Revelation 8:3-4 refers to the Lord. Whether or not it is the Lord, it is the angel who brings prayers before God. Hence, the bringing of prayers before God in 5:8 must be done by the angels.</P><P>(8) The twenty-four elders never refer to themselves as the church. "Them" in 5:10 is the elders' reference to the church. If the elders are speaking concerning themselves here, they should say, "us." It is apparent by the elders' word here that they distinguish themselves from the church. From this we can see that the twenty-four elders definitely are not the church. There are three kinds of people in Revelation 7:13-17: the elders, John, and those who wear white robes. If we say that the twenty-four elders refer to only one part of those in the church, it might still make sense for the elders to ask John, "These who are clothed in the white robes, who are they?" But how could it be possible that the whole church would ask this concerning a part of the church?</P><P>(9) In Revelation 7:13-17, John addresses one of the elders as "my lord." We can see that the elder must have a higher position than John. Otherwise, how could the elder allow John to address him as "lord"? Comparing this with Revelation 22:8-9 and 5:9-10, we see that the elders never say that they themselves are washed by the blood. Revelation 5:9 reads, "Purchased for God by Your blood men." It is "men" and not "us," as is translated in the King James Version. Furthermore, if the word "men" in 5:9 is changed to "us," how can the word "them" in 5:10 stand grammatically?</P><P>(10) The attitude of the twenty-four elders before God is most unusual. Unlike the church, they have never hungered, thirsted, or wept. They do not fear God and do not have the sense of sin or the experience of redemption. From this we know they are not the redeemed church.</P><P>Who then are these twenty-four elders? We conclude, first, that they are the kings and priests among the angels. They are the elders of the universe, governing the angels and the world and serving God. The evidence of this is as follows:</P><P>(1) They sit on thrones and wear golden crowns. Hence, they must be kings.</P><P>(2) They wear white robes which are the priestly garments (see Exo. 28; Lev. 6:10; 16:4). They have harps, songs, and golden bowls full of incense. All these prove that they are priests.</P><P>(3) The reason they are priests among the angels is that they are the elders of the universe. In chapters four and five, God is God, the Lord is the Lamb, the Holy Spirit is the seven Spirits of God, and the four living creatures represent the animals in creation. Man is on the earth, and the devil does not count. Hence, the twenty-four elders are the oldest among all the creatures.</P><P>(4) Besides the angels, no one is able to sit on thrones and wear golden crowns before the Lord does. Originally, God appointed angels to govern the universe. Later the archangel failed and became Satan; hence, we have the kingdom of Satan. The remaining angels who did not submit to Satan are still appointed by God to govern the universe. For example, there is Michael, who is the angel for the Israelites (Dan. 10:13). As the redeemed people, we also have our angels (Acts 12:15; Matt. 18:10; Heb. 1:14). Here the twenty-four elders are sitting, while in the following chapters the angels who blow seven trumpets are standing (Rev. 8:2). The twenty-four elders are now governing the universe. When they see God saving a group of people, they are not jealous; rather, they praise God for it. When the kingdom comes, they will resign from their position and will hand over the governing authority of the universe to men (Rev. 11:16-18; Heb. 2:5-8). This is why we do not see the elders doing any more work after Revelation 19:4.</P><P>(5) The number of the twenty-four elders is the number of the priests. In David's time, the priests were divided into twenty-four courses (1 Chron. 24:7-18). The responsibility of the priests is to bring the prayers of the saints before God. The harps are for singing, and the bowls of incense are for prayers.</P>
