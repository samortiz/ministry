<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Not Despising the Cause<br>of His Servant or Maid in His Fearing God</H2><P>Job did not despise the cause of his servant or maid when they contended with him (v. 13). This means that he took care of their need. Verses 14 and 15 indicate that in this matter also Job feared God: "What then will I do when God rises up?/And when He visits me, what will I answer Him? /Did not He who made me in the womb make him?/And was it not One who fashioned us in the womb?"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Taking Care of the Poor,<br>the Widow, the Orphan, and the Needy</H2><P>In verses 16 through 23 Job boasted about taking care of the poor, the widow, the orphan, and the needy because of the calamity from God and His majesty. Job did not withhold food or clothing from the poor, and he did not raise his hand against the orphan. Concerning this also Job feared God, saying, "Calamity from God is dreadful to me,/And because of His majesty I can do nothing" (v. 23). He was threatened by God's majesty, and he feared that if he did not do well, calamity would come upon him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Not Trusting in Gold and Rejoicing in Wealth</H2><P>Job went on to say that he did not trust in gold and rejoice in wealth, nor was he enticed to worship the shining sun and the splendid moon and thus to deny God in the heavens (vv. 24-28). He did not make gold his hope or call fine gold his confidence, and he did not rejoice because his wealth was great. This means that what Job treasured was not gold but God. In this matter Job was different from most people, who treasure wealth but deny God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Not Rejoicing at the Misfortune<br>of the One Who Hated Him</H2><P>Job said that he did not rejoice at the misfortune of the one who hated him, exult in his suffering, or curse his life (vv. 29-30).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Feeding Everyone<br>and Lodging All the Sojourners</H2><P>Job also boasted that he fed everyone who had a need and that he lodged all the sojourners (vv. 31-32).</P>
