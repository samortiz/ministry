<h1 class="title">THE RENEWING OF THE INNER MAN</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The Lord is the Spirit&mdash;2 Cor. 3:17.</li>
<li>The Lord as the Spirit is the treasure in us as earthen vessels&mdash;4:7.</li>
<li>Because we have the Lord as life in our spirit, our spirit becomes our inner man&mdash;Eph. 3:16.</li>
<li>Our inner man takes Christ as the person&mdash;Gal. 2:20.</li>
<li>Our outer man needs to decay so that our inner man may be renewed&mdash;2 Cor. 4:16.</li>
<li>We are being transformed into the image of the Lord, even as from the Lord Spirit, by the renewing of our inner man&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2.</li>
<li>To be transformed by the renewing of the mind requires the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit to be with us&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this message we will consider the renewing of the inner man. This subject is both profound and fine. In order to make progress in spiritual matters, we need to learn to go deeper into them and to touch them in a deep and detailed way. This will be our approach as we consider the renewing of the inner man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN HAVING A SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Our physical body is outward and superficial. However, within our body we have something that is most precious, something that neither scientists nor medical doctors are able to locate. This is our spirit (Job 32:8). The Bible clearly reveals that man has three parts. First Thessalonians 5:23 says, &ldquo;And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete.&rdquo; This verse distinguishes the spirit from the soul, putting the word <em>and</em> between the two words. This clearly shows us that the spirit and the soul are two different things.</p>
<p>The genuineness of our person is our spirit. Sometimes when we smile, our smile may not be genuine. Genuineness comes not only from the heart but also from the spirit. When we lose our temper, our spirit comes out. At that moment we are being genuine. If we become indignant or infuriated, our spirit really comes out. When we get angry to such an extent, we forget about our rationality, our face, and our relationship with others. As a result, our spirit is released. This kind of release of the spirit, however, is not normal but abnormal. Nevertheless, in such a situation our spirit does come out. The spirit of most people is not released easily. It is even more difficult for the spirit of a person who is very patient and refined to be released, for even when such a person is furious within, outwardly he can appear quite rational and cheerful. He knows how to control himself, but he is not genuine. His refined manner is a pretense.</p>
<p>We can illustrate the three parts of man with three concentric circles. The outer circle represents man&rsquo;s body, the middle circle, which is within the outer circle, represents man&rsquo;s soul, and the inner circle, which is within the middle circle, represents man&rsquo;s spirit. Man&rsquo;s soul is within his body, and man&rsquo;s spirit is within his soul. Everyone is familiar with the body, but the soul is a bit more complicated. Man&rsquo;s soul has three parts. The first part, which is the leading part, is the mind. The mind is the faculty by which we think. The mind can consider, memorize, comprehend, infer, and analyze. The emotion, which is the second part of the soul, is also quite strong. The emotion can love, desire, hate, and have joy or sorrow. The third part of the soul is the will. The will can make plans and decisions. Thus, the soul is composed of these three parts&mdash;the mind, the emotion, and the will.</p>
