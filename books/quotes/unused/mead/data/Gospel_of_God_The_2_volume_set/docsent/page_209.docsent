   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>But please remember a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Here it mentions the Master who bought them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word bought is used in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Does the word convey the sense that the bought ones are the saved ones?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If these bought ones are the saved ones, then we have to admit that a saved person can perish.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if this word has a different meaning, then one cannot say this any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is true that the Bible tells us that we are bought by the Lord with a price.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But we have to see the scope of what the Lord Jesus bought on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Did He buy the believers only, or did He buy the whole world?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From the Bible we can see that the Lord did not buy the believers only, but He bought the whole world as well.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Matthew 13:44 says, "The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid, and in his joy goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This shows us that the Lord Jesus sold whatever He had to buy the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But not only did He buy the treasure, He bought the field as well.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The treasure is a small part, but the field is a big part.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The treasure is in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to obtain the treasure, the Lord bought the whole field.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The purpose of buying the field was not for the field, but for the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Please remember that the purpose of the Lord's buying was for the small part, but He bought the big part.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His purpose is to get the treasure, but the scope of His buying was the field.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those in the kingdom of the heavens are the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But what the Lord bought was the field.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, we cannot say that everyone that is bought by the Lord is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The scope of buying is greater than the scope of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The work of buying and redemption on His cross is different from His work of substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord's substitution is only for all the believers, but He died for the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He made the scope wide enough.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But this does not mean that the whole world is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If Peter were to change a word here, if he were to say "denying the Master who saved them," then it would be very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But Peter has used a big enough word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He said "denying the Master who bought them."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, we can see that this group of people has not been saved at all.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This word bought is a very broad word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By this word alone, one cannot say that they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second, the word Master, despotes, here is not a common word either.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It should not be translated as lord, but should be translated as master.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not the Lord as in the Lord Jesus, but the Master as one who has temporal control of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It refers to an earthly master.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no life relationship here.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to a strict interpretation of the Bible, this is not a relationship between them and the Lord, but a relationship between them and their master.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, this group of people has not been saved at all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No one can say, Jesus is Lord, except in the Holy Spirit, for whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These ones are like Judas.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They have never confessed Jesus as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Third, Peter tells us that this group of people are the false teachers and the false believers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Peter also told us that there were false prophets among the people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He also said that there will be false teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These false prophets refer to the false prophets in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All the readers of the Bible know that no false prophet in the Old Testament was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can say boldly that this group of people have not been saved at all.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They followed their cleverness and their ideas, secretly bringing in destructive heresies, and even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, 2 Peter 2:1 does not refer to the perdition of the saved ones.</S>
