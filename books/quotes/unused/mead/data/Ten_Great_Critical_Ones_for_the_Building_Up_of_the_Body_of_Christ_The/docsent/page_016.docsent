   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we worship You for Your oracle, Your speaking in Your recovery for the past more than seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today You are still speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have the assurance that You are continuing to speak to us in order to enrich Your recovery and strengthen us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lord, be with us through the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Pour out Your Spirit as the reality of Yourself upon this meeting, and strengthen us and cover us with Your prevailing blood against the enemy's attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For everything mentioned in these outlines on the ten "ones," we have to go to the Life-study Messages for the details.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do not go there, we will not really know what these outlines are talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this message we want to see three more "ones."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These are the one life, the one salvation, and the one kind of living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Body of Christ, we enjoy one life as one element, one salvation as one way of saving, and one kind of living as one manifestation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>ONE LIFE ONE ELEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The element is the very substance of a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Wood has its element, and iron has its element.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Everything of a solid, physical substance has its element.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This divine life of Christ is the very element of God, especially in saving us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Life of the Triune God Embodied in Christ to Be the Believers' Life</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This life is the life of the Triune God embodied in Christ Eph 4:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is one life of Christ, but Christ is the embodiment of God, so this one life is God's life embodied.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Life is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No one can see our life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is untouchable.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But John in his first Epistle says this very eternal life is visible 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They heard it, saw it, beheld it, touched it, and handled it because this life became a man, and that man is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This life is eternal John 3:15 in nature, in time, and in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eternal means that there is no beginning and no ending.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This life is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John 1:4 says that in Him is life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is this life and its Author John 11:25; 14:6; Acts 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit of God is of this life Rom 8:2 , and this life, which is Christ, is the believers' life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Divine Element of the Triune God and Christ</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This life is the divine element of the Triune God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God gives His chosen people repentance unto this life and has appointed, ordained, them to receive this life Acts 11:18; 13:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I grew up as a Chinese person in an old, conservative, pagan country.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How could I believe in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This could only have taken place because of God's ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, God gave me the gift of repentance, and I accepted, received, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This was ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the believers were ordained by Him to receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God regenerates the believers with this life John 1:12; 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Also, Christ's righteous act is unto, or for, justification of this life Rom 5:18b .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This righteous act is His death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He died on the cross according to God's will for us to be justified by God that we may receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, the death of Christ and the justification of Christ are for one thing that we may have this life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ saves His believers subjectively in this life Rom 5:10b .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Most Christians know they were saved by Christ's death, but very few know that we are saved much more by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Romans 5:10 says that since we have been reconciled through His death, we shall be saved much more in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All of the Epistles are on the subject of the one life of Christ as the element of Christ's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Eventually in Romans 5, we reign in this life through Christ's bountiful grace and His bountiful gift of righteousness v. 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The believers walk in the newness of this life Rom 6:4 , the mind of the seeking believers set on the spirit is life and peace Rom 8:6b , and grace reigns through righteousness unto this life Rom 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Grace as a king reigns.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Not only grace reigns, but also we, the seeking ones, the overcomers, reign in this life by the abundant grace and gift of righteousness Rom 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The believers who forsake all for Christ will inherit this life in the kingdom age Matt 19:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In order to gain this inheritance, we have to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This inheritance is not for salvation but for a reward in the coming age Luke 18:29-30 in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, with an enjoyment of the divine life that is fuller than the enjoyment in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The overcomers will eat of the tree of this life in the kingdom age as a reward Rev 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is an item of the inheritance of this eternal life in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ as life is given to us today for our salvation as a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But in the kingdom age, Christ will be our portion of enjoyment as a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ to us today is a free gift.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All we need to do is to repent and believe to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then if we overcome, He will be not only a gift but also a reward to us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Otherwise, we will miss this inheritance in the thousand-year kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the Gospel of life, the Gospel of John, this life is received.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the Gospel of the kingdom, the Gospel of Matthew, this life will be an inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To inherit it, we have to pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The tree of this life with the water of this life in the river proceeding from the throne of God will be the unique supply to the entire New Jerusalem and will be partaken of by those who wash their robes Rev 22:1-2, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This will be after the thousand-year kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>By the discipline in the thousand years, all the believers who did not overcome will be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In other words, they will become mature to be the overcomers also Rev 21:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They will not be the early overcomers who will enter into the kingdom, but the later overcomers who will enjoy the New Jerusalem in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the New Jerusalem, the supply is the tree of life, which is Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Thus, Christ as life to us is of three ages.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the present age, Christ as life is a gift; in the coming age, He will be a reward; and in the new heaven and new earth, in the eternal age, He will be the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In the next age, for those who have become the overcomers, Christ will be a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then after the millennium all the defeated ones will also be made overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They will join the early overcomers to enjoy Christ as life, as the eternal, bountiful supply, in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
