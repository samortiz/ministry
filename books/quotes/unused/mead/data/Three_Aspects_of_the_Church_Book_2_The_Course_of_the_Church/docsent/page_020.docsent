   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Serving the Lord Requiring a Pure Heart</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some people have asked me to show them where the Bible says that we should leave the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My answer is based on 2 Timothy 2:20-21: ...some unto dishonor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these...</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the denominations there are many vessels unto dishonor and items of mixture; therefore, we must cleanse ourselves from them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should work with those who are pure in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To leave the denominations is to cleanse ourselves from vessels unto dishonor.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although some groups say that they have no particular ground, truth, fellowship, or practice, we can still see the wood, earth, and confusion among them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We see dishonorable things, such as covetousness, human effort, and impurity in service.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we realize that someone does not have a pure heart, we should pray, Lord, I cannot participate in what he is doing; I cannot be his co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is not pleased with those who make divisions over doctrinal issues, such as pre-tribulation versus post-tribulation rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The decision to separate from others must be made on the basis of nature and motive.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible clearly tells us to cleanse ourselves from vessels unto dishonor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should be accommodating in other matters, but the Bible does not require us to accommodate anything of dishonor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lowliness is different from dishonor.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God wants us to go along with the lowly Rom 12:16 but to cleanse ourselves from the dishonorable.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lowliness is a matter of situation and position; dishonor is a matter of nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A piece of gold beneath our feet is not dishonorable; it is just lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, if a clump of mud is beneath our feet, it is not simply a matter of lowliness, because mud is dishonorable by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If something is dishonorable, it is mud instead of gold; although we may elevate mud to a high and glorious position, it is still dishonorable.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should cleanse ourselves from what is dishonorable 2 Tim 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we leave the denominations merely for the sake of doctrine or practices, our action has little value in God s eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we leave the denominations on the basis of nature and motive, God will be pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I firmly believe that the overcomers will be raptured in separate groups.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, someone else might have the peace to believe that all the believers are raptured at once, either before or after the tribulation; I would not argue with him about this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If his nature is gold and silver, we can work together, but if he is earth and wood, we cannot work together, regardless of our doctrinal positions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The rapture is not a question of doctrine; it is a matter of loving the Lord s appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Perhaps a brother gives a message on the doctrine of the rapture while coveting something apart from the Lord; this means that his heart is not pure, which is something that I cannot accept.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we both love the Lord and turn our heart to Him, then we can labor together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we work with someone who desires something apart from God, we have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should work only with those whose nature is gold and silver and whose heart is pure.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A brother once exhorted me to be sociable and adaptable in order to be able to deal with all kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I would ask that brother how many companions he has who are of one heart with him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the spiritual realm there are no diplomats or politicians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No one can gain companions through diplomacy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In God s house there are only vessels unto honor and vessels unto dishonor; we cannot use politics to gain companions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more we live before God, receiving the breaking of the cross so that we desire God alone, the more we will be able to find pure-hearted companions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Companions that we gain using our methods, learning, position, and charisma will end up biting us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not decide to work with others by looking at their abilities or learning.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This will be harmful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have only one realm, that is, God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to learn to live in God and take Him as our goal.</S>
