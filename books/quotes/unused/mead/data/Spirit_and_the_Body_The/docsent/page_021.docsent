   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR EXPERIENCING THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we have an all-inclusive bird's-eye view of the Bible, we shall see that after Christ's ascension, our God, who is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, is today the all- inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Within this Spirit there is divinity, humanity, the effectiveness of Christ's death, the power of His resurrection, and the ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In other words, in this all-inclusive Spirit there is all that God is, all that man in a proper sense is, and all that the Lord Jesus has passed through, gained, and obtained.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All this is in the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our Savior today is not only the Redeemer, but also the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We thank the Lord that by means of the clear view of all the books in the Bible, we see such a wonderful Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE PICTURE OF THE COMPOUND OINTMENT</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This Spirit is mysterious and glorious, but very difficult to describe in words.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the reason the Bible affords us the picture of the compound ointment in Exodus chapter thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this chapter the olive oil represents the Spirit of God, and the four spices represent humanity, God's creature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia all have a special significance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Bible myrrh signifies the sweetness of Christ's precious death, and cinnamon signifies the sweetness of the effectiveness of that death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Calamus signifies the rising power, the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Cassia was used in ancient times to repel snakes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we put all these items together, we must admit that they no doubt portray the details of the compound all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this Spirit we have God and the proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this Spirit we have the effectiveness of the death of Christ and the power of the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whatever Christ is and whatever He has done, obtained, and attained are all included in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord has shown us the significance of the myrrh, the cinnamon, the calamus, and the cassia; the reason the two middle items are each half of a full quantity; and the fact that these four spices together make three complete units of five hundred shekels each.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The hin of olive oil was compounded with the four spices into one ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This signifies the mingling of the unique God with His creature, man, to form one compound unit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The tabernacle with all its furniture and vessels and all the priests were anointed with this compound ointment, not merely with olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today we are not under the anointing of the Spirit that includes only divinity; we are under the anointing of the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Apostle John used the term, the "anointing," in 1 John 2:27 for the Spirit's move, no doubt he thought of Exodus chapter thirty, the source of the word anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word "anointing" was not used firstly by John; rather, it had been used already in Exodus thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The anointing that abides in us is the compound Spirit as the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit.</S>
