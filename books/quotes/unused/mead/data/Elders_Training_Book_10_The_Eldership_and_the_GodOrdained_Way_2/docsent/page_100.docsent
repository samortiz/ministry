   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Body of Christ is not directly covered in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Of course, in the Gospel of John the church is revealed as the Father's house in chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord said that in His Father's house there are many abodes v. 2 . The many abodes are the many members of the Body of Christ Rom 12:5 , which is God's temple 1 Cor 3:16-17 . This is adequately proven by John 14:23, which says that the Lord and the Father will make an abode with the one who loves Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church is also revealed as the vine tree in chapter fifteen and as the newborn child in chapter sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the church as the Body of Christ is not directly mentioned in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without the Epistles, we cannot see that Christ desires to have a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>John 3 shows us that Christ is the Bridegroom and the church is the bride as the enlargement and increase of the Groom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Of course, the Epistles show that the bride, the increase of Christ as the Groom, is the Body of Christ, the enlargement of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is like Eve being the enlargement of Adam, the increase of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eve is a type of the church as Christ's counterpart to be His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even though the bride is mentioned in John 3, we could not thoroughly understand who the bride is without the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Body of Christ is clearly taught and unveiled in the apostles' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Acts 2:42 says that all the newly saved ones were together to continue their life in the apostles' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The apostles' teaching became the very sphere and element of the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ephesians 2:20 says that the church is being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The revelation the apostles and prophets received concerning Christ is considered the foundation upon which the church is built.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The building of the church upon Christ as her foundation is according to the apostles' and prophets' revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I hope that we all can see this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many recognize that Christ as the rock is the foundation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christians today are divided, not over Christ as their foundation but by different teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The denominations are not built upon Christ according to the apostles' teaching, but the building up of the local churches depends upon the apostles' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once we come together in the name of the Lord, taking Him as our foundation, what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To build up the church, the proper teaching is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Brother Nee brought the recovery to us according to the revelation he had received at his time, he actually brought in the teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all stood for the Lord according to his teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Of course, our standing and doing was according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, although the Bible is one, the interpretations are many.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christians have argued, for example, over the way to baptize people, and they have been divided because of this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is just one example of many divisions over different teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The basic need for the building up of the Body of Christ is the apostles' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should have no particular teaching other than the teaching of the apostles, which is the teaching concerning Christ's person and redemptive work and concerning God's economy in faith 2 John 9-11; 1 Tim 1:3-4; Jude 3; Titus 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we do not have the apostles' teaching, what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is like sailing without a compass.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without the apostles' teaching, we do not have the compass, and we do not know the direction to take.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thank the Lord that in His recovery, by His mercy, we do have the apostles' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the recovery He has given us this clear view.</S>
