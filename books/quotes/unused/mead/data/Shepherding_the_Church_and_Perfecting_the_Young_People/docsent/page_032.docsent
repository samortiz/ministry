   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LIVING WORK CARRIED OUT IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must do a living work, and we must live in the spirit and in life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This should not be merely a saying among us; it should be the way that we work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must live in the spirit and experience the life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No matter how busy we are, we must remember to live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our activities do not ensure that our work will issue in life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order for our service to issue in life, it must be in the spirit and in life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No matter how busy we are, we must not be disconnected from the spirit of life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must maintain the inner sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ever since I began serving the Lord, I have not had much idle time in the work; rather, the more I work, the more work there is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Especially since the work in the United States opened up, the need in the work has continued to increase.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even thirty serving ones may not be able to cover all the needs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more we work in the spirit, the more we are blessed by the Lord and the more work we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By the Lord s mercy, none of my messages, especially those given in the United States, are old; instead, every message is new.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is a brother among us who has been listening to messages since we began in China.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I went to the United States, he thought that I would present the messages we gave in China.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, in order to coordinate with me, he prepared many books concerning edification of new believers and basic practices of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, the messages that I released in the United States were entirely new, but they were not without a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The messages that I gave last year were concerning the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those messages were new.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the summer of 1969 several small local churches near Cleveland gathered together and held a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One day as I stood up to speak during that conference, the inspiration concerning the seven Spirits came to me, so I released messages on the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The saints who attended that conference, most of whom were Americans, felt that those messages on the seven Spirits were unprecedented, fresh, and living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From that time onward, I have released more messages concerning the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>SPIRITUAL WORK NOT BEING</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>AN OUTWARD METHOD</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Spiritual work is not a matter of methods.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fellowship in the churches has been to encourage the saints to read spiritual books.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, the emphasis in most of the fellowship has been on how to promote and how to organize study groups.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These methods are not useful, because the saints do not feel the need to read spiritual books.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I was saved, there was no church in my locality, and there was no one to help me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I did not know which spiritual books were better, and I did not know where to buy them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nevertheless, the Holy Spirit operated within me and caused me to search everywhere for spiritual books.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I found a spiritual book, I read it immediately even if I had to stay up the whole night.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I devoured and digested every book.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At that time no one encouraged me, but I had a strong desire for spiritual books.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, leading the saints to read spiritual books is not a matter of outward methods.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must produce a need, a desire, in the saints spirit for spiritual books.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>None of our books are difficult to read or understand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, even a newly saved junior high student can read and understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, the style of our publications was decided upon by Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our style of writing is not only easy to understand but also clear in meaning; it is able to touch people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we change the way we write our publications, we will lose the touching power.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The style we use causes people to feel that what they are reading is supplying them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This can be likened to a person eating food.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although he does not focus on the plate, the food is presented to him on a plate.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord gave us this style, we have used it for decades, and its influence is not superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, spiritual matters should not be classified as either deep or shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may consider the truths that a new believer can comprehend to be shallow, but the apostle Paul would understand these truths in a deep and profound way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, whether a spiritual book is shallow or deep does not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This applies to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is hard to say that one book of the Bible is deep and that another is shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The preciousness of Andrew Murray s The Spirit of Christ lies in its being very practical, not merely doctrinal.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This book is concerning the Lord Christ as the Spirit and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Brother Nee admired this book.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>More than thirty years ago, he told me that if someone could translate this book into Chinese, he would be willing to cover the cost for printing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In 1950 when we met in Hong Kong, he said this again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For this reason, when we began to put out The Ministry of the Word magazine in 1951, we translated this book.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some believers criticized our translation and said that it was difficult to read, even though the translation matched the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Any attempt to change the translation would involve changing the meaning of the content.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The vocabulary and the phrases used by the author are understandable, being neither too difficult nor too deep.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The sentence structure and the expressions are somewhat deep and mysterious because the content of the book relates to the things of the Spirit, which are fine and detailed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, the author could not rely on simple words alone to convey them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are the ones who will suffer loss if we think that this book is too difficult to read and therefore do not read it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to read this book at least three times.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The longer sentences can even be read five times.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must make an effort to read this book.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whether or not this book is deep depends on our spiritual hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Nothing is too deep for those who genuinely pursue life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must not use methods to promote reading our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must do a living work.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Similarly, the young people s work is not about a method but about a living work.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Those who desire to carry out a work at a school must first enliven a saint who is either a teacher or a student in the school.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Teachers can be a help to the young people s work, but they are not the basic components for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The young people s work must be done by the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They must preach the gospel in their schools.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The young brothers and sisters in a school are the basic components of the work in their school.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The co-workers must work until the young saints are enlivened so that they can do the gospel work in their schools.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The young saints need to be living, and they need to have a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The co-workers must enliven the young saints, not with methods but with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Only the Spirit can enliven the saints so that they become burning and burdened for other people.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When the young saints are burdened, the co-workers can perfect them in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If the saints are able to apply what they learn, they will be open to the co-worker and trust him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When the young people preach the gospel, they may encounter difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If the serving ones can give them suitable advice, the young people will trust the serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The serving ones must not be careless in giving advice.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The advice that the co-workers give enables the young people to do the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The more the young people work, the more interested and burdened they become.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Soon they will bear the burden for their school.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is not a method but a work to enliven a person so that he is living and burning.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The work we did in the past succeeded only if we promoted it.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If we did not promote it, the work would come to a standstill.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Such a work was based on a method.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>A work that is based on life is different.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Even if it is not promoted, it continues, because life is living and multiplies.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We must learn to do a living work.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>All the churches should learn this kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>THE URGENT NEED</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Exercising our spirit by calling on the Lord s name, singing prayerfully, and pray-reading were given to us by the Lord, and they make it easy for us to release our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Our urgent need is first to have healthy words to supply the church.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Second, we all need genuine growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>In particular, the elders should grow in life so that they may supply life to the saints so that the saints also can grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Third, the co-workers, elders, and serving ones must rise up in the matter of shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This is one thing that we really lack.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Because of our lack in shepherding, many have been baptized, but few have remained.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This lack cannot be remedied by my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>It is the responsibility of the co-workers, elders, and serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We must seek the Lord concerning how to make shepherding practical and prevailing among us.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>All the elders should promote shepherding, and even the co-workers should consider how to bring the saints who meet regularly into shepherding and visiting.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>In Taipei there are twenty-five hundred saints who meet regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>All these saints should visit and shepherd other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>They should be coordinated together as a corporate body to carry out the visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>They can pursue the Word and grow in life, and at the same time they can bear the responsibility of shepherding and feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>This is the way to recover many saints and supply new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Furthermore, if this is our practice, the new ones will have the same practice.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Healthy words, growth in life, and adequate shepherding are the urgent need in all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The churches have an adequate practice of meeting, releasing the spirit, and blending.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The present issue is how to enrich the content of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>In order for our church life to have content, we need three things: healthy words, growth in life, and shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>As we shepherd the saints, the number in the meetings will increase spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>As we pursue healthy words and the growth in life, the content of the meetings will become richer.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>From this time forward, the elders and serving ones in every local church must spend adequate time to be filled with healthy words.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Do not depend on the full-time co-workers, considering them to be the suppliers of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>This concept has to change.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>The elders and the responsible saints are also suppliers of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>First Corinthians 14:31 says that we can all prophesy one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>We must practice speaking healthy words.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>The books published by The Gospel Book Room, The Ministry of the Word magazine, and other publications that we have translated are up to date with this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>As long as we are willing to spend time to digest these books, we will produce milk and become nursing mothers to feed the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Then healthy words will not be lacking among us, and we will grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>We may also use books concerning crucial truths in the Bible, edification of new believers, and basic training.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>But we need to use them in a living way.</S>
