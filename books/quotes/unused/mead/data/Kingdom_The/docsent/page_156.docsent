   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Swearing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not to swear surpasses not swearing falsely Matt 5:33-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To swear falsely is to neglect to fulfill what you have promised and sworn to do.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It means not to keep your oath.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, the Old Testament said not to swear falsely Lev 19:12; Num 30:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means do not neglect to do what you have said.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You must do whatever you have sworn to do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the new law of life requires you not to swear at all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is no need to swear because there is no need to prove that you are right.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you are right, you are simply right.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You have no need to prove it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the answer is yes, simply say yes; if no, simply say no. There is no need to swear about it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To say more is of the evil one Matt 5:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not to swear at all is much higher than not swearing falsely.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not Resisting an Evil Person</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The law of life which says, "Do not resist one who is evil" Matt 5:39 , surpasses Moses' law of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to Moses' law if someone breaks out your tooth, you in turn may break out his tooth Exo 21:24; Lev 24:20; Deut 19:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the law of life says, "Do not resist" Matt 5:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If someone smites your right cheek, you should turn to him also the left cheek.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If someone forces you to walk with him one mile, you should go with him two miles joyfully.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If someone takes away your outer garment, you should give him your inner garment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is much higher than the Old Testament law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is the surpassing righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Loving Your Enemy</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Loving your enemy surely surpasses loving your neighbor.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The law of Moses required you to love your neighbor Lev 19:18 , but the law of life requires you to love your enemy Matt 5:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Again, this is much higher and far surpasses the law given by Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually this section of the Lord's discourse ends by telling us that as children of the Father we must be perfect as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can have perfection only by the Father's life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can have a surpassing righteousness only because we have a surpassing life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because we have a surpassing life with a surpassing law, we can have a surpassing righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The people of the kingdom are marvelous people!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Their character, their influence, and their righteousness are marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This should be the life of the local churches.</S>
