   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-EIGHT EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 64 Date:September 23, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER P. G.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In reminiscing over my spiritual journey, I find that I was following a brother for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Later I felt that I could no longer catch up with him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was too fast for me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I tried to catch up but failed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the end I could only stand still, and I finally sat down.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have been sitting for over ten years until today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I was saved, I did not have any strong feelings, yet I definitely believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At one time I was very seeking, getting up at three o'clock in the morning to read the Bible and to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1927 I left my denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once I was gravely sick, but later was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I also suffered from a plague.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the plague was rampant, I came across Psalm 91, and I was preserved from any harm.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have a son who became very sick when he was nine.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He actually died a few times but came back to life again.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT A Strong Will</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, our brother is a very calm and confident person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You know what you should do, and you are not easily confused.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those with a strong will are always confident about themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet for a Christian, a strong disposition is hard to break.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If it is hard to break a person, it means that it is hard for him to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He has to be driven to the point of despair before he can experience deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Quick and Active in Thoughts</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Second, you are quick and active in thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You have to hold your thoughts in check.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Being quick in the natural mind is useless when it comes to spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The natural thoughts must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Self-assurance and Self-satisfaction</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Third, you are quite satisfied with yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once a man trusts in himself, believes in himself, and justifies himself, he becomes loose, impolite, rough, and coarse towards others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This makes him an arrogant person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He will have friction with others, and his relationships will not be fine and tender.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These are outward signs.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Need for Spiritual Understanding</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Fourth, every time a Christian goes through an experience, there should be some spiritual result.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Spiritual lessons have nothing to do with the number of outward experiences or their duration in time; they have to do with the result that is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to have spiritual results, one has to have spiritual visions and spiritual understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The lack of results in our brother from God's dealing may be due to the lack of supply from the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Or it may be due to his self-satisfaction, which turns away God's blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A man can reap spiritual results and enhance his spiritual understanding without the ministry of the word; he can produce spiritual fruit in the midst of all his experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our brother needs a broken spirit before he can receive the ministry of the word from others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You have to wait in humility and drop your self-confidence before you can receive any spiritual good.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>While you are on the mountain, you have to see the spiritual pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Spiritual knowledge is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When something happens to you, you have to acknowledge the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is a kind of oldness and sense of seniority with you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You have to repent and become like a child.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You have to remove your self-satisfaction, self-complacency, and self-confidence before you can obtain mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not retain what you have heard here on the mountain as a doctrine in your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You have to receive it in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You have to have a new evaluation and a fresh view concerning yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You cannot go on like you have before.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is your way of deliverance.</S>
