<h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>Hence, there is no need for anyone to struggle to perform miracles. When God's power is manifested in us, there are miracles. Paul was bitten by a viper, and he shook it off into the fire (Acts 28:3-5). How did Paul perform that miracle? He did not tell the men of the island of Malta, "Come and see me perform a great miracle for you." He shook the snake into the fire without any fanfare. There was no promotion of any kind. Only those who do not know God promote miracles; those who know God do not promote miracles. (This does not mean that those who do not promote miracles know God. Some do not believe in God or miracles.) Those who know God do not promote miracles because miracles are spontaneous things for them. Brothers and sisters, when God answers your prayer and you feel that you have done something marvelous, it proves that your faith is very immature. If you really believe in the power of God, you will find Him answering your prayers and performing miracles without even being conscious of it. Under such circumstances, miracles are spontaneous. There is no need for any struggle, and they will not be extraordinary.</p><p>We must realize that miracles are not performed in a conscious way. If we feel that we are performing miracles, we have failed already. In other words, when we set our mind to perform miracles, they will be far from us. This is like setting our mind to do good; we discover that we cannot. When we live in the presence of God and believe in Him, there will be miracles spontaneously. The miracle of not being hurt by the viper was done without Paul's even noticing it. If others asked him to do the same thing again, he might not be able to repeat it. If someone asked us to repeat what Paul did, we could not do it either. We cannot imitate others, and we cannot reenact our own experience. We are touching a very important principle of the Christian experience. In our Christian experience, God's answer to our prayer and His miracles follow one basic principle&mdash;everything is spontaneous, and everything is done without our awareness. In the beginning, we may think that we had much strength and great faith. But as we go on and learn more, we will no longer feel the same way. To some degree, we will not even know how we believed. We simply commit things into God's hand, and things are done spontaneously.</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE</h2><p>In Paul we see many miracles and works of wonders. Yet Paul said of himself, "I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling" (1 Cor. 2:3). God is willing to work through man. But He is not willing to allow man to become conscious of what he can do. Only those who do not know God say that they can do this and that. Those who genuinely know God say that they do not know what they can do. A man whom God truly uses will not feel that he can do this or that. Whatever he has done is behind him. Thank God, His power is so great that He can do everything Himself. We do not have to do anything. The more we go on as a Christian, the simpler we become. Those who become complicated are wrong. The more we know God, the simpler we become. We are just what we are. Even our believing will not be as strenuous as before. Day by day as we live before the Lord, we will become simpler and simpler. We will say genuinely from our heart that everything is of God and not of us. Brothers and sisters, if we truly know God, we will know that all of His work in us is spontaneous.</p>
