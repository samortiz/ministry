   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 6 DAY 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 8:18-22</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>18 Now when Jesus saw a crowd around Him, He gave orders to 1 depart to the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>19 And a scribe came near and said to Him, Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>20 And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>21 And another of the disciples said to Him, Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>22 But Jesus said to him, Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verses 18 through 22 we see the way to follow the heavenly King.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The way is revealed through the cases of two who came to the King.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first, was a scribe, and the second, a disciple .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord seemed to be saying to the scribe, "Do you intend to follow Me?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You have underestimated the price.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You, a scribe, a learned one with a high rank in society, must realize that I am nothing and that I have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have even less than the birds and the foxes, for I have nowhere to lay My head."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I believe that the scribe was disappointed and that he did not follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The principle of following the Lord is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must consider the price.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In following this King, there is no material enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 21 says, "And another of the disciples said to Him, Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In saying this, this disciple, who was not a scribe, overly considered the cost of following the King of the heavenly kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This disciple, apparently warned by the first case, overestimated the cost.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He seemed to be saying to the Lord, "I will follow You, but I have a dead father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let me first go back to bury him, and then I will come back to follow You."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because this disciple overestimated the cost of following the King, He answered him in the way of encouraging him to follow Him, to drop his consideration of the cost, and to leave the burial of his father to others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord said, "Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How wonderful the Lord Jesus is!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He purposely disappointed the first and deliberately encouraged the second.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord was very wise in dealing with people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, He discouraged the person of high rank.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But to the disciple who had been warned by this case not to follow the Lord in a light or loose way, the Lord encouraged him to forget about all the preparations he was making, to leave the dead to bury the dead, and to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By these two cases we see that it is not easy to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How would you deal with these two if they came to you today?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Probably you would accept both of them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, the Lord differentiated between them, discouraging the one and encouraging the other.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In these two cases we see the way to follow the heavenly King.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First, as we follow Him, we should not expect to have any material enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Second, in order to follow Him, we must ignore the requirements of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord told the disciple to "let the dead bury their own dead."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first dead refers to those who are dead spiritually, as mentioned in Ephesians 2:1, 5; the second dead refers to the disciple's father, who was dead physically.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually, the spiritually dead will fulfill the duty of burying the physically dead.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are the living ones and we must go on to follow the King.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you do not expect any material enjoyment and if you will leave the dead duties to the dead, you can go on to follow Him.</S>

   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>18 1 In His ministry as recorded in the four Gospels, the Lord always withdrew from the crowds; He did not want the curious ones to be with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He did not care for crowds but cared only for those who sought Him sincerely.</S>
