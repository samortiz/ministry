   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TAKING CHRIST BY INHALING HIM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Deuteronomy surely manifests God and exposes us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This book manifests God as a God who is loving in His heart, righteous in His hand, and faithful in His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, this book manifests God as the One who blesses us through His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the God manifested in Deuteronomy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we read this book today, we need to realize that it concerns not only the people of Israel but also concerns us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This book exposes us, for it is a photograph of the kind of person we are.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more we are exposed, the more we will realize that we are a hopeless case, that we are nothing and can do nothing, and that it is impossible to fulfill the requirements of the holy, righteous, and faithful God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After we have been exposed in this way, what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Where can we go for help?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our help is in Christ as the word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Deuteronomy expressions such as law, commandments, statutes, ordinances, and judgments are synonyms of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Out of God's mouth have proceeded the law, the commandments, the statutes, the ordinances, and the judgments, and all of these are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is our law and our commandments; He is our statutes, our ordinances, and our judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should simply take Him, keep Him, and hold fast to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we do this, we will enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Where is the Christ whom we should take, keep, hold fast, and enjoy?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is in the Bible, for He is God's unique word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The law, the commandments, the statutes, the ordinances, the judgments all these are God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is proved by Psalm 119, which clearly indicates that these expressions are different terms for God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They have all been spoken by God and thus are things which have proceeded out of God's mouth Deut 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now we need to see that the words which proceed out of the mouth of God are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ is the totality, the aggregate, of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the reason that He is even called the Word John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the beginning was the Word, the Word was God, the Word was incarnated, and this incarnated Word is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's word has been written down in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do you know what the Bible is?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible is the embodiment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is every word, phrase, clause, and sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"All Scripture is God-breathed" 2 Tim 3:16a .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, we may say that the Bible is something exhaled by God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now we need to inhale what God has exhaled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we inhale the word of God and it enters into our being, this inhaled word becomes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we exhale what we have inhaled of the Bible by speaking it to others, it is the word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When others inhale this word, it becomes the Spirit to them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is by the Christ as the word which we inhale that we can fulfill God's requirements.</S>
