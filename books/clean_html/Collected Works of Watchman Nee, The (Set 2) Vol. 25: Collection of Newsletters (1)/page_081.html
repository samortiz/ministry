<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Two</H2><P>Peace to my fellow member of the Body of Christ,</P><P> Brother Chieh Mei:</P><P>(Parts omitted.) The meeting here is doing well. On the seventh of this month, six brothers and four sisters were baptized into the Lord's name together. Perhaps I can visit the brothers and sisters in Chu Chia Yueh Tze soon.</P><P>(Parts omitted.) We will discuss this later. I greet you. Peace in the Lord! Greet the brothers and sisters who meet in the Lord's name in Shanghai!</P><P>Your brother in the Lord,<br>Chiang Shun T'ien<br>July 18</P><P>The Meeting in Ch'ang-ch'un:<br>Responsible Brothers: T'ien P'ing Fang, Chiang Shun T'ien, Ou Ya Heng.<br>Mailing Address: c/o Nanking-Manchuria Railway, Ch'ang-ch'un Station, Chu Ting 5 Ting Mu, Ch'ien Yi Tung Store</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEWS FROM CHU CHIA CHENG TZE,<br>CH'ANG-CH'UN, MANCHURIA</H2><P>Peace to the co-worker in the Lord, Brother Hung Pin:</P><P>We received the news from Chefoo a few days ago that you had already arrived in Chefoo to visit the brothers there and to have meetings to testify for the Lord. We really thank and praise our Father and our Lord Christ because He has had mercy on us and cared for us in these last times. He has opened a door for us in every place to preach His messages and revive His children to return to His name. In addition to hastily sending Senior Brother T'ien P'ing Fang and my sister to Chefoo, we constantly remember the conference in Chefoo before the throne of grace. We ask the Lord to grace and bless His work and help you be filled with the power of the Holy Spirit to be a bright testimony for the Lord. We also ask the Lord to grace the unsaved sinners in Chefoo so that they would come to the Lord's cross and be enlightened. Amen.</P><P>Brother T'ien P'ing Fang can tell you of the news from our area. It has been raining every day for many days, and the water levels have risen very high everywhere. As a result, I have not been able to communicate with Ch'ang-ch'un for half a month. Brother Chiang Shun T'ien can usually come on Wednesday and the Lord's Day. Now there are three brothers who have been baptized into the Lord's name. When Brother Chiang comes, there are more brothers and sisters who want to be baptized. Since the Lord has opened a door for us, we believe that no man can shut it. Furthermore, there is a desperate need for the truth in Manchuria. Because the people here have been under the denominational system for a long time, they still are attracted by the activities in the denominations, even though they have obeyed the Lord and turned to Him. It is like the children of Israel longing for Egypt in the wilderness. Therefore, we beg the Lord to keep us and grace us by sending some brothers to help us. Since you have already come to Chefoo, it would only be another day and a night's journey to Ch'ang-ch'un. I beg the Lord's Spirit to lead you here. This is something we have earnestly hoped for for a long time. It would not delay you to come to Manchuria once. The Overcomer Conference in Hangchow is in the fall. May the Lord perfect us according to His will. Amen.</P><P>May the Lord bless your work in Chefoo and give you much power in the Holy Spirit and keep you healthy. I also hope that the brothers and sisters in Chefoo receive much grace from the Lord this time and are revived to become the Lord's overcomers. Amen. Please greet Brother Sun, Brother Chao, Brother Lin, and all the brothers and sisters in the Lord with peace!</P><P>Your little brother in the Lord,<br>An Ching T'ien<br>July 23</P><P>Mailing Address: Yu Min Hospital, Chu Chia Cheng Tze, Ch'ang-ch'un</P>
