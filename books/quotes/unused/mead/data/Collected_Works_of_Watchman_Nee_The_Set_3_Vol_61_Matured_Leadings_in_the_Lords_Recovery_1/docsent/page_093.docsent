   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Finding the Way</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second point about management is that we have to find the way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Consider again the example of the Lord feeding the multitude.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He did not charge the disciples to tell the crowd, "Just come and eat."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What would they do when the crowd came?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nor did He ask the multitude to come to Him one by one to get their bread.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If He had done this, the first one would have taken half a minute and the second would have taken a minute.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By the time the last one stood in line, four or five hours would have passed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord's way was to divide the crowd into groups of hundreds and fifties.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He gave the bread to the twelve disciples, who in turn passed it on to the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the meaning of finding the way to manage things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Making Assignments and Distributing the Work</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In managing affairs one has to find the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In dealing with people one has to make proper assignments.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to distribute the work to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not allow any one of them to be idle.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In distributing the bread, the Lord called all twelve disciples to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He gave bread to all twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this way all thirty or fifty groups were taken care of properly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The deacons have to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They have to know how to distribute the work in their hand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They have to know how to assign men to do different tasks.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If one does one thing and another does another, the work will be finished in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There will be no confusion in the church if we have trial runs, come up with the right way, and make the proper assignments in every situation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The elders have to help the brothers in all the districts do this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Never act rashly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rash action only brings bad results which do not glorify the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The deacons have to be careful and diligent in their service in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church is the house of God; it is not the laboratory of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we practice all these points, the church will reap the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we learn our lesson well in the preaching of the gospel, we will become very useful for the migration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even if we remain in our locality, we will become useful in managing affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I sincerely hope that a hundred people will migrate from Hong Kong to Chungking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Chungking is a strategic place for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The gospel must go out, and we must learn to do things the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must not only know how to do things ourselves, but we must help the brothers and sisters do the same, until their work is as good as God's.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all have to exercise and train ourselves this way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is not a matter of a day's zeal; we have to learn to do this patiently day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I hope that the brothers and sisters in Hong Kong will be ahead of those in other places.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to use every day to the fullest.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every day we have to learn something new and gain something new before God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our theology is different from others' theology.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They learn it in the seminary, outside the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our theology is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are learning to work "in Christ," while they are being perfected in doctrine and procedure only.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>ASSIGNMENT OF WORK FOR THE DEACONS Managing Finances</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The first time the deacons are spoken of is in Acts 6.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There we are told that there was a problem of supply, yet the apostles considered it unfitting for them to forsake the word of God to take care of food.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They selected seven men of good reputation, who were filled with the Holy Spirit and wisdom, to manage this matter vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These seven deacons took care of the distribution of food.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The brothers who worked as apostles then devoted themselves to prayer and the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Here we see that deacons are responsible for the business affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Management of food means management of finances.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It means distributing to each according to his need and making sure that no one is in want.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The first work of the deacons in the church is to manage the finances.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We ask two brothers to manage the finances, and another two brothers and sisters to do the bookkeeping.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Managing finances does not mean taking over the finances.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The deacons have to work in a proper way under the supervision of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In particular, special designated funds must not be used arbitrarily; the elders must be the ones who make the decisions.</S>
