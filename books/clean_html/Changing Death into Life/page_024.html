<h1 class="title">THE NEED OF THE HUNGRY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 6:22-35, 37, 47-54, 56-58, 63</h1>
<p>John 6:22-35 and 37 say, &ldquo;The next day the crowd which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there had been no other small boat there except one, and that Jesus had not gotten into the boat with His disciples, but that His disciples had gone away alone. But other small boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks. So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they themselves got into the small boats and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, Rabbi, when did You get here? Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek Me not because you have seen signs, but because you ate of the bread and were filled. Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for Him has the Father, even God, sealed. Then they said to Him, What shall we do that we may work the works of God? Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe into Him whom He has sent. They said then to Him, What sign then will You do that we may see and believe You? What work will You do? Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, &lsquo;He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.&rsquo; Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses has not given you the bread out of heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread out of heaven. For the bread of God is He who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world. They said therefore to Him, Lord, give us this bread always. Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst...All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John 6 continues, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, He who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world. The Jews then contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us His flesh to eat? Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves. He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day...He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him. As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me. This is the bread which came down out of heaven, not as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread shall live forever...It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (vv. 47-54, 56-68, 63).</p>
<p>The Gospel of John shows eight kinds of people whom the Lord Jesus contacted on the earth. In the previous chapters we saw the first three kinds: the moral, the immoral, and the impotent. Now we will consider the fourth kind&mdash;the hungry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HUNGRY</h2>
<p>Everyone in the world is hungry. Hunger is different from thirst. However, both hunger and thirst speak of man&rsquo;s inward need. The need of the hungry is that they are dissatisfied inwardly. This kind of person is the most common in humanity.</p>
<p>The eight kinds of people depicted in the Gospel of John do not merely represent eight separate kinds of people in humanity. These eight kinds of people represent eight conditions in every person. Every person has the condition of Nicodemus, the moral person spoken of in chapter 3, and the condition of the Samaritan woman, the immoral woman spoken of in chapter 4. Every person also has the condition of the impotent man in chapter 5, who had been sick for thirty-eight years, and the condition of the hungry described in chapter 6. We are moral because we want to do good, but we do not understand the spiritual things of God. We are immoral because we are always dissatisfied inwardly, and we sin to find satisfaction. We have been sick for many years because we know what we should do and are willing to do it, but we do not have the power. We are also the hungry because we are dissatisfied inwardly.</p>
<p>We have the intention to do good, but we lust after sins, and we continually desire to do good but do not have the power; we also seek after things because we are dissatisfied inwardly. Hence, every one of us has the conditions of these four kinds of people. We should not think that we are represented by only one kind of person. The conditions of the eight kinds of people depicted in the Gospel of John can be seen in each one of us.</p>
<p>John selected these eight kinds of people to show how the Lord Jesus meets the needs of every kind of person. No matter what kind of person we are and no matter what kind of needs we have, the Lord Jesus is able to meet our needs. This is the significance of the eight kinds of people recorded in the Gospel of John. Now we will consider how the Lord Jesus meets the need of the hungry.</p>
