   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first thing a worker of the Lord has to learn is to listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When a brother or a sister is speaking or when an unbeliever is speaking, we have to learn to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to learn to think the way he thinks, and feel the way he feels.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to know what he has not said and the condition of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we practice this, our listening ability will greatly improve.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Gradually, we will understand what others are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the end, others will need to only open their mouth, and we will know immediately what they are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must remember that our inner being must be like a spotless piece of blank paper before others can write on it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must be in perfect stillness, void of our own thoughts, our own subjective opinions, and our own feelings, before we can listen quietly to others and understand what they are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The most important thing related to a worker is not his measure of knowledge but the person of the worker himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our person is our very instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God is using us to measure others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If our person is wrong, God cannot use us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are not measuring others with something physical.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It would be so much easier if we had something physical with which we could measure others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A thermometer can measure a person's temperature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But in the Lord's work, the only "thermometer" is our person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to find out the condition of others ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It matters a great deal, therefore, as to the kind of person we are.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If our person is wrong, nothing will work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are the vessels of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a vessel does not function properly, God cannot use it to deal with others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Listening is a very crucial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we can listen to others, know their condition, and get into their thoughts and feelings, we will have a way to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose a man comes to you and pours out his grievances.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you have never been dealt with by the Lord, you will surely want to pass on many teachings to him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Typically, this is our habit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When others come to us, we open our mouth immediately and give them some teaching, before even trying to realize their sickness or understand their ailment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many people are too impatient to let others finish speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They cannot wait for others to finish speaking before they come up with their solutions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Others only have to say two or three words before they will offer their teachings and corrections.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a result, others do not receive any genuine help.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This does not mean that we should let people talk for three to five hours while we sit in silence and listen.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some people expect others to listen to them for three to five hours.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They want us to listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should stop these ones from their incessant talking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, generally speaking, we should give others enough time to speak, and we should give ourselves enough time to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If one has many years of experience in this matter and is clear within, if he can discern the condition of others as soon as they speak, and if he knows what should be done, he can stop this incessant speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Otherwise, he should spend an adequate amount of time to listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am not saying that he has to spend three to five hours to listen to others, but I am saying that he should allow ample time to understand their condition.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to realize the complexity of our work; we are dealing with living human beings, and we are tackling living problems.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are here to deal with a person's problem before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we are not able to identify others' problems, we will not be able to say much.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is impossible to make judgments before fully understanding what is involved in others' problems.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are dealing with living human beings, so we are dealing with living problems.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As we are dealing with a person's problem before God, we should be still and quiet to receive something from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Unless we can do this, we will encounter problems in rendering help to him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many people cannot render help to others because they do not know how to listen to them in the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to ask for grace from the Lord so that we can sit down and listen to others when they speak.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to listen quietly, intelligently, and attentively until we fully understand.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once we understand what they are saying, the job is done.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must learn to listen, and we must listen until we understand.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not an easy thing to speak, and it is no less difficult to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many preachers are accustomed to speaking, but they find it difficult to sit down and listen.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, we must learn this lesson well.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to be enlightened within.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to spend considerable time learning to listen and to touch others' feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we do not learn this lesson well, we will encounter problems in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to try our best to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When a person is speaking, can we hear what he is saying?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do we understand his words?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In order to understand others' words, it is not enough for us to be undisturbed outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord must deal with us in a fundamental way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our subjectivity, thoughts, and feelings must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We can skip many things, but we can never skip the basic dealings, without which no one can serve the Lord in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Without experiencing the basic dealings, we cannot even read the Bible properly.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There are certain qualifications to reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>One cannot just exercise his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It takes more than a smart mind to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Basic dealings are indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Without such dealings, a man can outwardly listen to every word that others are saying, but he will be in total darkness within; he will not understand anything.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>A brother may talk to him for a whole hour, yet he will not know what is being talked about.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>How can he be expected to render any help?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We are God's vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should know when a man is hot or cold, well or sick.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We are the measuring stick.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But when we are off, we give the wrong diagnosis.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>There is a prevalent misconception among Christian workers that the most essential thing is to be able to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Far from it!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Lord's work has to do with our spirit, not just with our words.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We have to identify the spiritual problems plaguing the brothers and sisters, and we have to know how to deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we are not clear within, we will not understand their inward condition.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>How can we render them any help at all?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>How do we know if a sinner is saved when we preach the gospel to him?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Do we judge only by the words of his mouth?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Are his words the only means of discerning his condition?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>No, we know his condition through our inner registration.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>How do we know if a person is of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Do we judge him merely by a few words, such as, "I believe in Jesus; I am saved"?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Do we baptize a person simply because he has memorized a formula?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>No, we make judgments based on our inner registration.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We are the measuring stick.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We test an unbeliever according to this measuring stick, and we also test a child of God according to this measuring stick.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>How do we know whether or not the spiritual condition of a child of God is healthy?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If we are walking in the light of the Lord, we will know.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Brothers and sisters, we must be dealt with by the Lord to the point that we become His measuring stick.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If we are off within, we will easily make a wrong judgment, and once we make a wrong judgment, we will spoil His work.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is the reason that we must walk in the light inwardly; we must have genuine light within us.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>What a tragedy it is that many brothers and sisters are not only dark within, but they are even incapable of sitting down and listening to others.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Brothers and sisters, we have to learn to be calm.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We have to learn to hear what others are actually saying.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We have to open ourselves and allow the affairs of others to enter into our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We must have a keen inner registration within ourselves before we can discern the real problems of others.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Only then can we render them the proper help.</S>
