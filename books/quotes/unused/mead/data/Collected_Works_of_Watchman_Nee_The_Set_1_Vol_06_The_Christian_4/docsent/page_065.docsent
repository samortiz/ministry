   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE EIGHT HOW TO BE WITHOUT WANT Issue Nos.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>13, 14</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these days we see many believers who are in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are all looking for help.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We also see many brothers and sisters who trust in God for their living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although they are never starved, they are often in danger of having an empty balance in their account.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In addition, there are brothers who desire to live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, the absence of proper means discourages them from living this kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Does the Word of God tell us of any way in which God's children can free themselves from want?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The answer is "yes."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The reason believers are in want is that many times they have too much in excess and forget to give to others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a result, no one gives to them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The greatest reason, though I dare not say the unique reason, for want among the believers is their refusal to give.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The principle taught in the Bible is, "Give, and it will be given to you" Luke 6:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not only to receive, but to first give and then receive.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we are in want, we hope to receive from man or God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But God's command is to "give."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not only give when we are rich or when we have a surplus, but at the very time when we need others to give to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The more we are in want, the more we should give.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more we hope to receive help from others, the more we should render help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we truly walk according to the promise of this verse, we will truly see God's promise fulfilled in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>During the past few years while I have been serving the Lord, He constantly reminded me of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Give" to others, and it will be given to me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is my principle of financial planning.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is my theory of economics.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I had the most need and could not make ends meet, I remembered the teaching in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I came before the Lord and asked what I should give to others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As soon as He gave the word, I obeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Soon I found Him meeting my needs through men's hands.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today, in retrospect, I can truly say that this verse can be fully trusted.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The strange thing is that the time I offered the most was actually the time when I was most in want.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yet God always returned to me tenfold and a hundredfold what I put out.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every time I put out something, I would reckon at the end of the month what God gave to me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The marvelous thing was that He always gave and gave to my abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I can testify that whenever I practiced Luke 6:38, God never once wronged me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some wonder how I could have so much money to give to others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They wonder if the Lord has special grace for me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They do not realize that the times when I gave the most away were actually the times when I was the most in want.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some may think that I am very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Actually I am poorer than most people; but the Lord's power is great.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although some think this way, this has not hindered God from supplying my need.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have a friend who also experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once she spent her last dollar for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In a few days, she needed a hundred dollars to pay the wages of her workers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She sat quietly before the Lord and began to praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She wrote a hymn in English being an English woman .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The message of the hymn is one verse in Psalm 23 which says that the Lord's cup of blessing runs over.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She believed that everything, including silver and gold, would run over for her.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But while she wrote this, she was actually penniless!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When her friend in England saw the hymn, she wrote back and said, "Thank the Lord that He has been so rich to you!"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It was true that she was not poor.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the time came to make her payments, the Lord prompted her former pastor in England to wire her a hundred dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The secret to receiving is giving.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more you will not give, the more you will not have.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many times, we consider that our source is becoming dry and that it will dry up sooner if we give to others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But God says, "Give, and it will be given to you."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You can exercise your faith.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But you will not receive if you do not give.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God's eyes are on the little that you have left.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You may say to God, "Father, all I have is this little."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God would say, "Do you still have that much?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Since you have so little, you have a goal to save the little that you have to sustain your living.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But God cannot give you anything because of the remainder that you still have.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He says, "Give, and it will be given to you."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The little handful of meal and oil that the Zarephath woman had was only enough for her to make a cake.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It was only enough to satisfy her hunger for an hour or two.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But she needed to give.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>She needed to give the cake first to Elijah the prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Afterwards, God sustained her and her child for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If God has not led you to do anything, nothing more can be said.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But if He has led you to give, you have to give.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, do not be afraid of God's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God's principle is for you to give first, and then it will be given to you.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Our principle is to ask God to give first, then when we have a surplus we will give to others.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Mr. M ller who supported the China Inland Mission was a person greatly used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He gave his life to the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He fully understood the principle of first giving and then being given to.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He seldom stored up food at home.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Once his wife told him that the food they had would only last until Sunday.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They had no money, and it was not right for believers to borrow money.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>What should they do?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He told his wife that there must be an overabundance of something in the house which was not distributed to others that had caused God to stop the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The couple began to search through the household items, the children's closets, and everything in the house to see if there were any excessive items.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They found none.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Everything seemed to be exactly what they needed.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Suddenly they remembered that someone had sent them a big case of butter a few days before which they had not touched at all and which was too much for them.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The couple then diligently cut the butter into a few hundred pieces and wrapped them up in white papers to be ready to give to others.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The next day was Sunday.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Mr M ller calmly sent all the butter to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He preached as usual, and after his message he asked the poor believers to stay behind and gave them each a packet of butter.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The people wondered how their pastor had such a fortune to buy so much butter to give to others!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>They did not realize that their pastor was suffering from a famine in his own house!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>One of the poor believers had a sick wife at home.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Every day there was only bread and water.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Many times the sick wife said, "How good it would be if we could have a little butter on our bread."</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When the husband came home from the church and showed the butter to the wife, they were very grateful.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The child of God then knelt in her bed and prayed in tears, "O Lord, please bless our pastor!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>He has supplied our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Now please supply his needs."</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>God heard her prayer, and the next day someone suddenly sent the pastor some money.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>"Give, and it will be given to you."</S>
