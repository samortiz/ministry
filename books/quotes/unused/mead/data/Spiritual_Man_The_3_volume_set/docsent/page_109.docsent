   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we have said before, the High Priest is working because we have accepted the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we want to talk about how, in practice, the Lord Jesus divides our soul and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Knowing the Need to Have</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>the Soul and Spirit Divided</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If there is no such knowledge, there will be no such demand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The believer must ask the Lord to show him the detestableness of a life of the spirit and soul mixed together and must know that in God there is a life that is both higher and deeper, completely of the spirit, and not affected by the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He should know that a spirit-soul mixed life is a life of loss.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Wanting to Be Divided</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The believer should not only know but also truly desire to have this mixed spirit-soul divided; there should be a desperate desire in the heart to have this dividing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is because all problems are now with the will of man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the believer is not willing and does not want the dividing of his spirit and soul, but rather prefers to enjoy what he himself sees as good, God will respect the character of man and will never force him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Surrendering Wholly</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a believer is willing to gain the experience of the dividing of spirit and soul, he should put himself wholly on the altar of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He should be completely willing in his heart to accept the effect of all the work of the cross, willing to follow the Lord's death until his spirit and soul have been divided experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before he has the experience of this dividing, he should continually put his will on the side of God, livingly and actively choosing the dividing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He should maintain the attitude that until the dividing work is done, he does not want the High Priest to stop working.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Standing on Romans 6:11</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Believers must be careful not to fall into sins and trespasses while seeking the experience of the dividing of spirit and soul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The basis of the dividing of the spirit and soul is that one has died to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, the believer should daily take the attitude of Romans 6:11, reckoning that he is truly dead to sin, and wholeheartedly keep this attitude in his will: "Do not let sin therefore reign in your mortal body" v. 12 . Only by this can he have the possibility of not letting the soul-life sin again through the mortal body.</S>
