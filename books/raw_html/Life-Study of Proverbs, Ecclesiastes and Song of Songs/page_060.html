<H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWO</H1>

<H1 CLASS=TITLE>DRAWN TO PURSUE CHRIST FOR SATISFACTION</H1>

<H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1>

<H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: S.S. 1:9&#151;2:7</H1>

<P>In 1:2-4a we see that the lover of Christ yearned for Christ, sought Him, and was attracted by His love and drawn by Him in His sweetness to run after Him. Christ is pleasant, sweet, and full of fragrance as ointment. Furthermore, His love is cheering, better than wine. All the lovers of Christ are attracted and constrained by His love (2 Cor. 5:14).</P>

<P>In Song of Songs 1:4b-8 the Beloved answered His lover's yearning and seeking and brought her into the inner chamber (her spirit) to have intimate fellowship. That fellowship led the lover of Christ to enter into the church life, signified by the flock (v. 8; John 10:16). After the lovers of Christ enter into the church life, they begin to be transformed by the Holy Spirit. Apart from the church life we cannot be transformed. The church life is a very important means used by the Holy Spirit to transform us. The Holy Spirit is transforming us with the saints in the church.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. TRANSFORMED BY THE REMAKING OF THE SPIRIT</H2>

<P>The lover of Christ is transformed by the remaking of the Spirit (S.S. 1:9-16a; 2:1-3a). The Spirit is the compound, all-inclusive, sevenfold intensified, life-giving, and indwelling Spirit, who is the consummation of the consummated Triune God. This Spirit is actually God Himself doing the work of transformation by remaking us. Transformation involves a metabolic process by which the Spirit remakes us. This metabolic transformation is now going on within us in the church life.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Lover of Christ Being Transformed<br>
from a Strong Natural Person into a Person Who Trusts in Him and Looks to Him with a Single Eye</H2>

<P>The lover of Christ is transformed from a strong natural person (a mare among Pharaoh's chariots&#151;1:9) into a person who lives a life not relying upon herself but trusting in Him (lily&#151;2:1-2; Matt. 6:28) and looking to Him with a single eye (eyes like doves&#151;S.S. 1:15b; Matt. 10:16). At the beginning, the lover of Christ is strong naturally, like a mare among Pharaoh's chariots, but gradually she is transformed into a lily, one who is no longer full of natural strength but is full of life. Such a transformed one now looks to the Lord with a single eye. Her one goal, her one object, is the One whom she loves.</P>
