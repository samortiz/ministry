<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ISSUE OF OUR ENJOYMENT<br>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</H2><P>The issue of our enjoyment of the Divine Trinity is the oneness. In the previous chapters, we have seen something of the excellent oneness among the Three of the Godhead. As we look at the Divine Trinity, we see the revelation of the excellent oneness of the Godhead. The Three always work together and act as one. Not One of the Three ever acts independently. When One is there, the Others are there also. The Three of the Godhead are one. We can see the oneness of the Godhead in the Lord's prayer in John 17. No one can explain, define, or expound this prayer to the uttermost. How profound this prayer is! This prayer reveals that the issue of our enjoyment of the Divine Trinity is that we are brought into the divine oneness, and we become the copy, the reproduction, of the oneness among the Three of the Trinity.</P><P>The oneness revealed in the Lord's prayer in John 17 is threefold. First, there is the oneness in the Father's name by the eternal life (vv. 6-13). Second, there is the oneness in the Triune God through sanctification by the holy word (vv. 14-21). Third, there is the oneness in the divine glory for the expression of the Triune God (vv. 22-24). The oneness by the glory, the expressed Divine Trinity, is the oneness among the Three of the Divine Trinity. The glory that has been given to us is the very Triune God expressed. By this expression we are one, and our oneness is a reproduction of the oneness of the Triune God. This is why the Lord prayed, "And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one" (v. 22). Then the Son prayed that we would be perfected into one by having the Divine Trinity in us&#151;by living with the Divine Trinity (v. 23). To be perfected into one is the unique result, the unique issue, of our enjoyment of the Triune God.</P><P>The most difficult thing among Christians is to keep the oneness. Even among us believers in the Lord's recovery, it is not so easy to keep the real oneness. How can we reproduce the divine oneness as the copy of the oneness among the Three of the Godhead? There is no other way except by enjoying the Triune God. We need to enjoy Him to the extent that the Three of the divine Godhead can be expressed. Then the oneness is among us. This reproduced oneness is the issue of our enjoyment of the Triune God. We enjoy the Triune God until He is expressed in us, and this expression is the very oneness which is a copy of the oneness among the Three of the Divine Trinity. The enjoyment of the Triune God will have a result, an issue. This will issue in the divine oneness which is the very reproduction of the divine oneness among the Three of the Divine Trinity.</P><P>Things that are outside the Trinity are the dividing and separating factors. In order to keep the oneness, we need to reject, renounce, and deny anything that we have that is outside of the Triune God. We should deny, renounce, and reject anything that is not the Triune God Himself. Anything other than the Triune God Himself can become a dividing factor. We are perfected into one by having the Divine Trinity in us. To have the Divine Trinity in us is to live with the Divine Trinity. The way to have the oneness, which is the Divine Trinity expressed, is to live with the Divine Trinity.</P>
