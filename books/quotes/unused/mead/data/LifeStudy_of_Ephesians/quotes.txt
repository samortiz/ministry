[1]  In this message we shall give an introductory word to the book of Ephesians.
[2]  In 2:19 we see that the church is the kingdom of God.
[3]  Thus, this verse reveals that the church is the kingdom of God and that we are the citizens of this kingdom possessing certain civil rights.
[4]  If we put together all these seven aspects of the church, we see a wonderful picture of the church as the Body to express Christ, as the new man taking Christ as the person, as the kingdom with rights and responsibilities, as the family with life and enjoyment, as God s dwelling place for God to live in, as the bride for Christ s satisfaction, and as the warrior for fighting the battle and defeating the enemy so that God can accomplish His eternal purpose.
[5]  After the revealing of the blessings to the church, the Apostle Paul prayed that the saints may have a spirit of wisdom and revelation to know the issue of all these blessings and the power to carry them out, so that the church may become the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all 1:15-23 .
[6]  Unlike Romans, which speaks from the sinners condition, Ephesians speaks from God s eternal purpose.
[7]  If we get into these four books, we shall see that Christ is here, that Christ leads us to the church, that the church life leads us to experience Christ daily, and that all this brings us to the Head.
[8]  Now we need to consider the writer of this book.
[9]  Ephesians 1:1 says, Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God.
[10]  The last part of 1:1 and 2 say, To the saints who are in Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus: grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[11]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE TWO THREE ASPECTS OF WELL-SPEAKING
[12]  In this message we shall consider three aspects of well-speaking concerning God.
[13]  God s well-speaking concerning us encompasses the entire New Testament.
[14]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE THREE CHOSEN TO BE HOLY
[15]  Ephesians 1:4 says, According as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish before Him, in love.
[16]  The word holy is not found in the book of Genesis.
[17]  In a sense, man in Genesis was still not brought into God.
[18]  It was in the book of Exodus, not in the book of Genesis, that God began to have a dwelling place on earth, and to bring man into the Holy of Holies.
[19]  Thus, we become holy by having God in us, we become more holy by being in God, and we become the holiest by being mingled, soaked, and saturated with God.
[20]  In order for us to be holy, we first need to be separated unto God positionally.
[21]  With respect to our family, neighbors, colleagues, and friends, we need to be separated.
[22]  Now we come to dispositional sanctification, which comes after justification Rom 6:19, 22 .
[23]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FOUR PREDESTINATED UNTO SONSHIP
[24]  A. By the Spirit of the Son of God
[25]  Now we need to consider three things concerning sonship, concerning being sons of God.
[26]  The first is that God has predestinated us unto sonship by putting the Spirit of His Son into us.
[27]  At the time we believed in the Lord Jesus and were regenerated, the Spirit of God came into us as the Spirit of the Son of God.
[28]  Actually, sonship is more specifically related to position than it is to life.
[29]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FIVE THE PRAISE OF THE GLORY OF GOD S GRACE
[30]  This may appear to be a very simple subject, but actually it is very difficult.
[31]  We may think that we are familiar with the words praise, glory, and grace, but if we are honest, we shall admit that we do not adequately know what they mean.
[32]  God s predestinating us to sonship is for the praise of His expression in His grace.
[33]  As the angels are praising God for our sonship, the demons may be shocked and say, Those sinners who were usurped by us have become the sons of God.
[34]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SIX REDEMPTION IN THE SON
[35]  In 1:3-14 there are three sections: verses 3 through 6, the Father s selection and predestination, speaking forth God s eternal purpose; verses 7 through 12, the Son s redemption, speaking forth the accomplishment of God s eternal purpose; and verses 13 and 14, the Spirit s sealing and pledging, speaking forth the application of God s accomplished purpose.
[36]  First we have the Father s eternal purpose, then the Son s accomplishment of the Father s purpose, and finally the Spirit s application of what the Son has accomplished according to the Father s purpose.
[37]  Although God delights in us and has made us the objects of His grace, we still need redemption because He is the righteous God.
[38]  God s abundant grace has accomplished redemption for us and has applied forgiveness to us.
[39]  His abounding grace has made us an inheritance to God v. 11 and has qualified us to inherit all that God is v. 14 . In other words, this abounding grace makes us God s inheritance on the one hand and makes God our inheritance on the other hand.
[40]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SEVEN THE MYSTERY OF GOD S WILL
[41]  Verses 3 through 14 of Ephesians chapter one are actually one long sentence.
[42]  Therefore, we should not isolate any verse, clause, or phrase from the whole sentence.
[43]  Verse 5 says that God has predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.
[44]  The praise of the glory of God s grace spoken of in verse 6 is the issue of the sonship in verse 5.
[45]  God s will is God s intention to accomplish what He has purposed in eternity past and what He desires for Himself for eternity future.
[46]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE EIGHT TO HEAD UP ALL THINGS IN CHRIST 1
[47]  In this message we come to the heading up of all things in Christ.
[48]  To many of us, this may be an altogether new thought.
[49]  Instead of to head up all things in Christ, the King James Version says, He might gather together in one all things in Christ.
[50]  Many Christians have never realized that God has chosen us, predestinated us, redeemed us, forgiven us, and graced us for the purpose of heading up all things in Christ.
[51]  Have you ever realized that you were chosen and predestinated so that God might head up all things?
[52]  Have you ever considered that God redeemed you and forgave you of your sins in order to head up all things?
[53]  Christians may know a great deal about God s selection and predestination without knowing how these are related to the heading up of all things in Christ.
[54]  God has made Christ the Head over all things v. 22 . Through all the dispensations of God in all the ages, all things will be headed up in Christ in the new heaven and new earth.
[55]  God s eternal intention is to head up all things in Christ, who has been appointed to be the universal Head.
[56]  The first step God takes to accomplish this is to head up His chosen ones in Him.
[57]  One by one, God rescues His people from the heap caused by the universal collapse.
[58]  Most Christians, however, do not realize that this is what God is doing and do not pray about it.
[59]  However, even in the so-called church there is no heading up.
[60]  Not only the universe and human society are in a state of collapse, but even the so-called church is in the same condition.
[61]  By God s grace, we all must say, Lord, we are here to take the lead to be headed up.
[62]  In this message we shall give a further word on the heading up of all things in Christ.
[63]  Ephesians 1:9 and 10 say, Having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself unto a dispensation of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.
[64]  The dispensation which God purposed in Himself is to head up all things in Christ at the fullness of the times.
[65]  God has come to work Himself into man, not into man as originally created by Him, but into the man whom Satan has injected with himself.
[66]  Originally, God and Satan were fighting in the universe, but now they are fighting within man.
[67]  First we need to see what is the fullness of the times.
[68]  As we have pointed out, when Satan, the power of death, injected himself into man, Satan became death and darkness to man.
[69]  Satan s goal is to corrupt God s creation and to cause confusion.
[70]  We enjoy a miniature of this consummate dispensation in the church life today.
[71]  In the church we have the flow of life, we drink the water of life, and we eat the tree of life.
[72]  This is God s dispensation in the church life.
[73]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE ELEVEN THE NEW TESTAMENT BELIEVERS
[74]  Now we come to the matter of the New Testament believers being to the praise of God s glory 1:11-12 .
[75]  Ephesians 1:12 says, That we should be to the praise of His glory who have before hoped in Christ.
[76]  This verse does not mean that we shall praise God.
[77]  It means that so much will be worked out for us and in us by God s abounding grace that all the angels and positive things in the universe will praise God.
[78]  Verse 10, which speaks of heading up all things in Christ, ends with the words in Him, and verse 11 begins with the words in Whom.
[79]  Verse 11 says that we have been made an inheritance according to the purpose of the One who operates all things.
[80]  There is a difference between God s will and His counsel: the will refers to His intention, and the counsel, to the consideration.
[81]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE TWELVE SEALED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT
[82]  We have pointed out that 1:3-14 can be divided into three sections: the well-speaking of the Father vv.
[83]  God the Father has purposed, God the Son has accomplished what the Father purposed, and God the Spirit is applying what the Son accomplished according to the Father s purpose.
[84]  The Holy Spirit, who is God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God s image signified by the seal, thus making us like God.
[85]  These verses say, In Whom you also, hearing the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Whom also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise, Who is the pledge of our inheritance, unto the redemption of the acquired possession to the praise of His glory.
[86]  The word unto in verse 14 means a great deal.
[87]  We are God s acquired possession, and the redemption of the acquired possession is the redemption, the transfiguration, of our body.
[88]  The sealing of the Holy Spirit is the saturating, and the saturating is the sanctifying.
[89]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE PLEDGE OF OUR INHERITANCE
[90]  Second Corinthians 1:22 says that God hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
[91]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FOURTEEN A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION
[92]  In this message we shall consider the matters of a spirit of wisdom and revelation, and the eyes of our heart 1:15-18 .
[93]  In considering these matters, we come to the first prayer of the Apostle Paul in Ephesians: Therefore, I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and your love to all the saints v. 15 . Paul prayed for the saints because they had faith in the Lord and love toward the saints.
[94]  In his first prayer Paul prayed to the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory v. 17 . In verse 3 Paul spoke of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, putting God and the Father together.
[95]  A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION A. Our Regenerated Spirit
[96]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FIFTEEN THE HOPE OF GOD S CALLING
[97]  Ephesians 1:18 says, The eyes of your heart having been enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of His calling, and what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints.
[98]  According to this verse, we need to know two things: the hope of God s calling and the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints.
[99]  The Apostle Paul s first prayer in the book of Ephesians is that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation in order to know certain things, the first of which is the hope of God s calling.
[100]  Included in the hope of God s calling is the hope of the coming salvation of our soul 1 Pet 1:5, 9 .
[101]  If we lose our soul today for the Lord s sake, suffering in our soul for His testimony, we have the hope of receiving the salvation of our soul at the Lord s coming.
[102]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SIXTEEN THE SURPASSING GREATNESS OF GOD S POWER
[103]  Related to these three things we need to know three key words: hope, glory, and power.
[104]  The hope is the hope of God s calling, the glory is the glory of God s inheritance among the saints, and the power is the power toward us according to the operation of the might of God s strength which He wrought in Christ.
[105]  Hope, glory, and power are all related to the blessings in verses 3 through 14, where five aspects of God s well-speaking are covered: the Father s selection, the Father s predestination, the Son s redemption, the Spirit s sealing, and the Spirit s pledging.
[106]  The Spirit s sealing is that we may be transformed into God s image, fully saturated with Him in order to bear His appearance.
[107]  It is like the electrical power that is continually being transmitted from the power plant to our building for our daily life.
[108]  In the same principle, the divine power is being transmitted into us continually to make us the inheritance for the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose.
[109]  D. In Giving Him to Be Head over All Things
[110]  The last part of verse 22 says, And gave Him to be head over all things to the church.
[111]  Fourthly, God s great power that operated in Christ gave Him to be the Head over all things to the church.
[112]  The headship of Christ over all things is a gift from God to Him.
[113]  As a man, in His humanity with His divinity, Christ was raised up from the dead, was seated in the heavenlies, had all things subjected to Him, and was given to be the Head over all things.
[114]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SEVENTEEN CHRIST TO BE THE HEAD
[115]  In Ephesians 1 Paul prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of God.
[116]  If we claim to know God without knowing these three things, then we know God merely in an objective way, not in an experiential way.
[117]  This hope is being fulfilled by the surpassingly great power of God.
[118]  Because it is important that believers have the proper knowledge of this power, the Apostle Paul prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of God and know the surpassing greatness of the power that is toward us who believe.
[119]  Yes, we have the surpassingly great power within us, but our need today is to know this power.
[120]  Whether you are aware of it or not, there is a transmission taking place from the third heaven, the place where God is, into us.
[121]  Again I say that within us there is the divine power and that this power is the Triune God who has passed through creation, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension and has been installed in us as the all-inclusive power.
[122]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE EIGHTEEN THE CHURCH BEING THE BODY OF CHRIST
[123]  Ephesians 1:22 and 23 say, And He subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One Who fills all in all.
[124]  Even those of us in the church life do not know fully what is taking place between Christ and the church.
[125]  It was the surpassing greatness of God s power that raised Christ from among the dead, seated Him at God s right hand in the heavenlies, subdued all things under His feet, and gave Him to be the Head over all things to the church.
[126]  With us who believe, there are two creations, the old creation and the new creation.
[127]  We must admit that the old creation still remains with us.
[128]  We have seen that the Body of Christ did not come into existence before Christ s crucifixion, but after His ascension, when something from the ascended Christ was transfused into the believers.
[129]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE NINETEEN THE TRIUNE GOD DISPENSED INTO US
[130]  Ephesians 1 begins with the well-speaking of God and ends with the Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.
[131]  This indicates that the Body, the fullness of Christ, is the issue of God s blessing.
[132]  In this chapter there are seven crucial things requiring the same basic factor for their accomplishment: God s selection that we may be made holy and without blemish v. 4 , God s predestination that we may become His sons v. 5 , the sealing of the Holy Spirit that we may be fully redeemed vv.
[133]  Before the foundation of the world God selected us that we should be holy and without blemish v. 4 . How can we be holy? Is it by following certain so-called holiness teachings about matters such as clothing, make-up, and hairstyles? Certainly not! Holiness is the nature of God, and to be holy is to have the divine nature wrought into us.
[134]  If the Father s life has not come into us, how can we be His sons?
[135]  The Triune God is dispensed and wrought into us in the Body, the fullness of the all-filling Christ, that we may be His full expression v. 23 . The result of the sixth item is the producing of the Body of Christ.
[136]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE TWENTY DEAD IN OFFENSES AND SINS
[137]  In this message we come to chapter two of Ephesians.
[138]  We have seen that there is no mention of God s mercy in chapter one because everything there is excellent.
[139]  But chapter two describes a miserable situation, a situation that requires the rich mercy of God.
[140]  At the end of chapter one, we see the church as the Body of Christ being produced out of the transmission of the ascended Christ.
[141]  By being dead in offenses and sins, we lost the function that enables us to contact God.
[142]  No matter how active we were in our body and soul, we were deadened in our spirit, unable to contact God.
[143]  When we were dead in our offenses and sins, we were not only active in following the age of this world; we also walked according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit who is now operating in the sons of disobedience.
[144]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE SAVED BY GRACE
[145]  In this message we come to 2:4-10, a portion of Ephesians which reveals that we have been saved by grace to be the masterpiece of God.
[146]  Verse 4, which tells us that God is rich in mercy, begins with the words But God.
[147]  God s mercy reached us even when we were dead in offenses v. 5 . We did not deserve anything from God, but God had mercy upon us in our miserable situation.
[148]  Forgiveness and justification bring us back to God s presence to enjoy His grace and participate in His life, whereas making us alive enables us, as the living members of the Body of Christ, to express Him.
[149]  Rather, it is the salvation that imparts life into us to make us members of the Body of Christ so that God s eternal purpose to have a living Body for the expression of Christ may be fulfilled.
[150]  Verse 6 says that we have been seated together in the heavenlies.
[151]  In the book of Romans, Christ as our righteousness has brought us into such a state that we may be acceptable to God.
[152]  In the book of Ephesians, Christ as our life has saved us into such a position that we may be above all God s enemies.
[153]  In verse 8 Paul says that by grace we have been saved through faith.
[154]  It is by faith that we substantiate all the things Christ has accomplished for us.
[155]  Finally, we are God s masterpiece created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God before prepared that we should walk in them v. 10 . The good works for which God created us are not the good things according to our general concept, but the definite good doings which God pre-planned and previously ordained for us to walk in. These good things must be the doing of His will to live the church life and bear the testimony of Jesus, as revealed in the following chapters of this book.
[156]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO ONCE FAR OFF, BUT NOW NEAR
[157]  Ephesians 2:1-3 gives us a picture of our condition by nature.
[158]  In this message we need to see that verses 11 and 12 portray our position according to our status.
[159]  Because of our sinful nature, we were in a condition of death; according to our status, we were far off from God, Christ, God s kingdom, God s blessings, God s promise, and everything related to God.
[160]  According to verse 12, we were also strangers from the covenants of the promise.
[161]  In order to appreciate verse 13, we need to review the main points in verses 11 and 12.
[162]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE THE BREAKING DOWN
[163]  In this message we shall consider the matter of the breaking down of the middle wall of partition 2:14-15 .
[164]  In this message we come to the creation of the one new man 2:14-15 .
[165]  This matter is extremely crucial in the New Testament, but it has been neglected by most Christians.
[166]  In order to see the one new man, we need to have a proper understanding of the old man.
[167]  Before exhorting us to put on the new man, Paul tells us to put off the old man 4:22 .
[168]  After creating heaven and earth, God created man, not merely as an individual, but as a collective entity.
[169]  Genesis 1:26 speaks of man both in the singular and in the plural: And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion....
[170]  It indicates that Christ was not only the Creator of the one new man, the church, but also the sphere in which and the essence with which the one new man was created.
[171]  Christ created the one new man, the church, with God s nature wrought into humanity.
[172]  The phrase in spirit is found in every chapter of Ephesians, except chapter one.
[173]  In this message we shall give a further word concerning how to put on the new man.
[174]  Speaking of the new man, Colossians 3:11 says, Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bondman, and freeman; but Christ is all things and in all Gk.
[175]  . In his Word Studies of the New Testament Vincent says that in the Greek language the words rendered cannot be are very strong and mean that there is no possibility.
[176]  If we consider today s church life from the perspective of the putting away of the former manner of life, we shall have to admit that we have not adequately done this.
[177]  Our former manner of life, our heritage from Babel, and even the Jewish ordinances have been abolished in the flesh of Christ by His death on the cross.
[178]  In this message we come to 2:16-19, where we see that the Jews and Gentiles have been reconciled to God in one Body and that now we, the believers, are fellow-citizens of the saints and members of the household of God.
[179]  Both Jewish and Gentile believers have access to the Father through Christ the very Christ who abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances, broke down the middle wall of partition, slew the enmity to reconcile the Gentiles to the Jews, and shed His blood for redeeming both to God.
[180]  Now we come to verse 19: So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow-citizens of the saints and members of the household of God.
[181]  This verse covers two aspects of the church: the kingdom, indicated by the term fellow-citizens, and the family of God, indicated by the phrase the household of God.
[182]  This corresponds to the rock in Matthew 16:18, which is not only Christ Himself but also the revelation concerning Christ, upon which Christ will build His church.
[183]  Verse 20 reveals that in God s building Christ is the cornerstone.
[184]  Here Christ is referred to, not as the foundation Isa 28:16 , but as the cornerstone, because the main concern here is not the foundation but the cornerstone that joins together the two main walls: the wall of the Jewish believers and the wall of the Gentile believers.
[185]  Verse 22 says, In Whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.
[186]  In this verse Paul was saying that the local saints, the saints in Ephesus, were being built together in Christ into a dwelling place of God.
[187]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT THE STEWARDSHIP OF THE GRACE
[188]  Verses 2 through 21 of chapter three are a parenthesis, and 4:1 is a continuation of 3:1.
[189]  In this parenthetical, beseeching word, the Apostle Paul described to the Gentile believers his ministry for them, a ministry which he received in the stewardship of grace through the revelation of the mystery of Christ.
[190]  He also prayed in this parenthesis that the church might experience Christ to the fullest extent.
[191]  In releasing the revelation of God s mystery concerning the church in chapters one and two, Paul spoke on the basis of his status as the apostle of Christ through the will of God.
[192]  Sooner or later, every steward of God, every minister of God s riches, every faithful lover of Christ, will be imprisoned not only by Christ but also in Christ.
[193]  Paul saw this vision on behalf of the saints, for as he says in 3:1, he was a prisoner on behalf of the Gentiles.
[194]  If we enjoy Christ as our prison, we also shall see a vision not for ourselves, but for the church.
[195]  Many Christians read Ephesians again and again without seeing the revelation contained in it because they are not imprisoned in Christ.
[196]  This stewardship of the grace is for God s dispensation.
[197]  When we carry out our stewardship by dispensing Christ into others, it becomes the dispensation of God into them.
[198]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE THE REVELATION OF THE MYSTERY
[199]  In Ephesians 3, a parenthetical word, Paul begins to beseech the saints to walk worthily of God s calling.
[200]  What Paul speaks regarding himself in this chapter is a pattern for one who would walk worthily of God s calling.
[201]  In order to walk worthily of God s calling, we need to be a prisoner of the Lord, a steward, and a minister.
[202]  Paul was also a steward dispensing the riches of Christ to the members of the household of God.
[203]  By seeing this vision, we experience Christ, and Christ is wrought into our being to make us stewards to dispense the riches of Christ into others.
[204]  Verse 5 says that the mystery has been revealed to the apostles and prophets in spirit.
[205]  The word spirit here refers to the human spirit of the apostles and prophets, a spirit regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit of God.
[206]  It can be considered the mingled spirit, the human spirit mingled with God s Spirit.
[207]  Such a mingled spirit is the means by which the New Testament revelation concerning Christ and the church is unveiled to the apostles and prophets.
[208]  When we speak to others about Christ and the church, we should not speak from our mind, emotion, or will.
[209]  Chapter three of Ephesians reveals that the Apostle Paul had a walk worthy of God s calling.
[210]  In this chapter Paul told us that the revelation of the mystery concerning Christ for the church has been given to the apostles and prophets v. 5 . Paul s revelation of Christ was mainly a revelation of Christ s unsearchable riches.
[211]  Because Paul s walk was governed by his revelation of Christ, he could not keep from speaking of the riches of Christ.
[212]  The riches of Christ are what Christ is to us, such as light, life, righteousness, and holiness.
[213]  They take the lead to receive the revelation concerning Christ for the church, to live Christ, to experience Christ, to enjoy Christ, and to minister the riches of Christ to others.
[214]  Along with the types, there are the shadows and figures of Christ.
[215]  Although types and shadows are similar in certain respects, they are like human faces in that they not only share similarities, but also differ from each other.
[216]  Types are mainly persons or things that signify Christ, whereas shadows mainly refer to rituals and practices in the Old Testament that portray Christ.
[217]  Although the Passover lamb is a type of Christ, the Passover itself is a figure depicting how Christ, our Passover, saves us from God s judgment and feeds us with what He is.
[218]  Grass, flowers, grains, and trees all depict Christ s riches.
[219]  Verse 9 says, And to bring to light what is the dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God, Who created all things.
[220]  When God s chosen people partake of and enjoy the riches of Christ, these riches constitute them the church, through which God s multifarious wisdom is made known to the angelic rulers and authorities in the heavenlies.
[221]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-TWO TO BE STRENGTHENED INTO THE INNER MAN
[222]  In this message we come to 3:14-17, the first part of Paul s second prayer for the church, the prayer which is related to experience.
[223]  The Father here is used in a broad sense, signifying not only the Father of the household of faith Gal 6:10 , but the Father of every family in the heavens and on earth v. 15 . The Father is the source, not only of the regenerated believers, but also of the God-created mankind Luke 3:38 , of the God-created Israel Isa 63:16; 64:8 , and of the God-created angels Job 1:6 . The Jews concept was that God was Father only to them.
[224]  The need in chapter one is for us to see the things related to the Body of Christ, to see how the Body comes into existence and how it is constituted.
[225]  In our spirit we are also filled with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God v. 19 . The Greek word rendered unto in verse 19 means resulting in. Our being filled with the riches of Christ results in the full expression of God.
[226]  The first part of verse 17 says, That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.
[227]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE TO APPREHEND THE DIMENSIONS OF CHRIST
[228]  In this message we shall consider the matters of apprehending the dimensions of Christ and of knowing the love of Christ 3:18-19 .
[229]  In verses 16 through 19 the word that is used four times: that He would grant you...to be strengthened...into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts, that you...may be strong to apprehend...and to know, and that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[230]  If we have been strengthened into the inner man, Christ can then make His home in our hearts with the result that we are strong to apprehend with all saints what is the breadth, length, height, and depth of Christ and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of God.
[231]  From Paul s prayer we go on to being strengthened; from being strengthened we proceed to Christ s making His home in our hearts; and from this we progress to the apprehending and the knowing and finally to being filled unto all the fullness of God.
[232]  The dimensions of Christ are the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth.
[233]  Only God Himself knows the measurements of the universe.
[234]  After we experience the breadth and length of Christ, we begin to experience the height of Christ and then the depth.
[235]  Do not think that we firstly experience the depth of Christ.
[236]  The spiritual experiences of the depth of Christ come from the experiences of the height of Christ.
[237]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-FOUR TO BE FILLED UNTO ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD
[238]  When Christ makes His home in our hearts and when we are strong to apprehend with all the saints the dimensions of Christ and to know by experience His knowledge-surpassing love, we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[239]  Through His indwelling, Christ continually imparts the very element of God into our being.
[240]  In this way we fulfill God s intention that the church should be the expression of God.
[241]  When we speak of the fullness of God, we imply that the riches of all that God is have become His expression.
[242]  In the New Testament the fullness is the expression through the completeness of the riches.
[243]  Then they constitute us into the fullness of Christ, into the Body of Christ, the church, as His expression.
[244]  This fullness of God comes into existence in a practical way by our being strengthened into the inner man, by Christ making his home in our hearts, by our being rooted and grounded in love, by our grasping the dimensions of the immeasurable Christ, and by our knowing Him as the knowledge-surpassing love.
[245]  We all need such a vision, such a revelation.
[246]  If we see this vision, our being will be changed.
[247]  In this message we shall consider 3:20 and 21: But to Him Who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us, to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations of the age of the ages.
[248]  As we pointed out in the foregoing message, in verse 19 we see the church as the fullness of God.
[249]  After such a church has come into existence, the Apostle Paul sounds forth the doxology in verses 20 and 21, ascribing to God glory in the church and in Christ Jesus.
[250]  When the church on earth reaches the stage of being the fullness of God, we shall be able to say with Paul, To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus.
[251]  In verse 20 Paul speaks of Him Who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think.
[252]  God fulfills not only what we ask for the church, but also what we think concerning the church, and God is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think for the church through the power which operates in us.
[253]  God s creating power is the origin of the material things in our environment Rom 8:28 , whereas God s resurrection power accomplishes the spiritual things for the church within our inward being.
[254]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-SIX KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT
[255]  Ephesians 4:1 says, I beseech you therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord, to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called.
[256]  This verse is somewhat a repetition of 3:1, which begins the apostle s exhortation in chapters four through six.
[257]  His status as an apostle of Christ through the will of God authorized him to reveal the things concerning the church, to speak concerning the mystery of Christ.
[258]  Verse 2 says, With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing one another in love.
[259]  To have lowliness is to remain in a low estate, and to have meekness is to not fight for ourselves.
[260]  For this reason, we should not expect a new believer to be able to keep the oneness of the Spirit.
[261]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-SEVEN THE BASE OF OUR ONENESS
[262]  In exhorting us to safeguard the oneness 4:3 , the Apostle Paul points out seven things as the base, the very foundation, of our oneness: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father.
[263]  This Body, having been regenerated and being saturated with the Spirit as its essence, has the hope of being transfigured into the full likeness of Christ.
[264]  THE SECOND GROUP, RELATED TO THE LORD A. One Lord
[265]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-EIGHT THE GIFTS PERFECTING THE SAINTS
[266]  Ephesians 4:7 says, But to each one of us was given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
[267]  By descending and ascending, Christ also cut the way that He might fill all things.
[268]  More than nineteen centuries ago we were captured by Christ and put into His train of captives.
[269]  As those who have been captured by Him, we have no way to escape.
[270]  Although we have never seen the Lord Jesus, we have no choice but to believe in Him because we have been captured by Him.
[271]  In His travels Christ died for our sins and accomplished all things for the fulfillment of God s purpose.
[272]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-NINE THE BELIEVER S STANDARD
[273]  In 1 Timothy 1:16 Paul says, For this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.
[274]  ALL DISCIPLES BEING APOSTLES, PROPHETS, EVANGELISTS, AND SHEPHERDS AND TEACHERS
[275]  Every Christian who is up to the standard is an apostle, prophet, evangelist, and shepherd and teacher.
[276]  Do you think that the mystery has been made known only to the Apostle Paul and not been made known to all the other New Testament believers?
[277]  In the years the Lord s recovery has been in this country, the saints have seen more and more of the mystery of Christ.
[278]  By receiving this revelation, we are constituted apostles and prophets, and we are qualified to speak concerning Christ and the church.
[279]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FORTY THE WAY TO REACH THE STANDARD
[280]  In this message we shall consider the way to reach this standard.
[281]  Ephesians 3:1 says, For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you, the nations.
[282]  In order to reach the standard, we also need to receive revelation 3:3, 5 .
[283]  A prophet is one who is full of light, one who sees what others do not see.
[284]  In 3:7 Paul says that he became a minister according to the gift of the grace of God.
[285]  As we pointed out in the previous message, a minister is one who serves.
[286]  From another angle, we need to be strengthened into the inner man so that we may be rooted and grounded in love and may become strong to know the dimensions of Christ, to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, and to be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[287]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FORTY-ONE THE WAY TO BE PERFECTED
[288]  In 4:12 Paul speaks of the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.
[289]  At this point I need to say a frank and honest word about the degraded condition of today s Christianity.
[290]  We have pointed out that the gifted persons in 4:11 are for the perfecting of the saints.
[291]  What do you suppose the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers perfect the saints to do?
[292]  In order to be perfected, we must pay attention to life and to function.
[293]  The way to be perfected is to grow in life and to become skillful in function.
[294]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FORTY-TWO ALL BUILDING MEMBERS WITHOUT RANK
[295]  Throughout the centuries Christians have held the natural concept that the church is merely a social organization.
[296]  As Paul says in his Epistles, the church is the Body of Christ.
[297]  Verse 15 says, But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, Who is the Head, Christ.
[298]  Among the building members in the Body of Christ there should be no rank.
[299]  In Matthew 23:10 the Lord Jesus said, Neither be called leaders, because One is your Leader, the Christ.
[300]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FORTY-THREE ARRIVING AT THREE THINGS
[301]  This verse is the direct continuation of verses 11 and 12, which say that the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers have been given for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry.
[302]  B. The Full Knowledge of the Son of God
[303]  The full knowledge of the Son of God is the realization of the revelation concerning the Son of God for our experience.
[304]  The Son of God refers to the Lord s Person as life to us, whereas Christ refers to His commission to minister life to us that we, as members of His Body, may have gifts for function.
[305]  The more we grow in life, the more we shall cleave to the faith and to the realization of Christ and the more we shall drop all the concepts concerning minor doctrines which cause divisions.
[306]  Then we shall arrive at or attain to the practical oneness; that is to say, we shall arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[307]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FORTY-FOUR BABYISHNESS AND THE WINDS OF TEACHING
[308]  Ephesians 4:13 says that we need to arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[309]  It is difficult to define these items adequately because they are all related to life and life is very mysterious.
[310]  WINDS OF TEACHING A. A Teaching That Differs from God s Economy
[311]  In verse 14 Paul does not speak of the wind of heresy, but he speaks of the wind of teaching.
[312]  Any teaching, even a scriptural one, that distracts believers from Christ and the church is a wind that carries them away from God s central purpose.
[313]  We must beware of any teaching or supposed ministry that teaches something different from God s economy, that is, that teaches something other than God s dispensation for the building up of the churches.
[314]  The teachings that become winds, carrying believers away from the central lane of Christ and the church, are a deception instigated by Satan in his subtlety and utilizing the sleight of men, in order to frustrate God s eternal purpose to build up the Body of Christ.
[315]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FORTY-FIVE THE GROWTH OF THE MEMBERS
[316]  In verse 15, Paul says that we should hold to truth in love.
[317]  This is the love of Christ in us, by which we love Christ and the fellow-members of His Body.
[318]  Now with the very love with which God has loved us, we love the Lord and one another.
[319]  It is in such a love that we hold to the truth, that is, to Christ with His Body.
[320]  If we speak about things other than Christ and the church, we are not acting in love.
[321]  This is to have Christ increase in us in all things until we attain to a full-grown man v. 13 . The word Head here in verse 14 indicates that our growth in life with Christ should be the growth of the members in the Body under the Head.
[322]  Verse 16 says, Out from Whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.
[323]  Our growth in life is to grow into the Head, Christ, but our function in the Body is to function out from Him.
[324]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FORTY-SIX LEARNING CHRIST AS THE TRUTH IS IN JESUS
[325]  In this message we shall consider 4:17-21, with special attention to verses 20 and 21, which speak of learning Christ as the truth is in Jesus.
[326]  One reason for this estrangement is the ignorance which is in them v. 18 . Ignorance here means not only lack of knowledge, but also not wanting to know.
[327]  Fallen man does not approve of knowing the things of God Rom 1:28 because of the hardness of his heart.
[328]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FORTY-SEVEN HAVING PUT OFF THE OLD MAN
[329]  In His thirty-three and a half years on earth, the Lord Jesus formed the mold, the pattern, to which all those who believe in Him are to be conformed.
[330]  Because in every aspect of the Lord s living on earth there was the shining of light, His life was a life of truth, a life of the shining of God Himself.
[331]  In contrast to this heretical, modernistic teaching, we say according to the New Testament that when a sinner repents and believes in Christ and is baptized into Christ, God puts this one into Christ as the mold.
[332]  This is utterly different from the devilish, modernistic teaching which says that Christ established the highest standard of human living and that we must endeavor to copy Him and to live up to this standard.
[333]  If we would learn Christ as the truth is in Jesus, we must fulfill the condition of having put off the old man and of having put on the new man.
[334]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FORTY-EIGHT A LIVING THAT DOES NOT GRIEVE
[335]  In verses 22 and 24 we see that the condition for learning Christ is having put off the old man and having put on the new man.
[336]  Let us now consider the details of a living of learning Christ.
[337]  In previous messages we have covered the condition of learning Christ and the living of learning Christ.
[338]  The living of learning Christ is a matter of applying the principle of truth and of living according to grace.
[339]  Thus in the Gospel of John God comes to us as grace and truth, but in the First Epistle of John we go to God to enter into His love and light in fellowship.
[340]  We may apply this now to the book of Ephesians.
[341]  We have seen that the basic elements in the learning of Christ are truth and grace.
[342]  As members of the Body of Christ under the Head, we are learning Christ as the truth is in Jesus.
[343]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FIFTY LIVING IN LOVE AND LIGHT
[344]  This portion of Ephesians covers the matter of living in love and light, the fourth item of a walk worthy of God s calling.
[345]  In verses 3 and 4 Paul lists certain things not fitting for saints: But fornication and all uncleanness or unbridled greedy lust, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints; and filthiness and foolish talking or coarse jesting, which are not becoming, but rather giving of thanks.
[346]  In verse 8 Paul says, For you were once darkness, but now light in the Lord; walk as children of light.
[347]  Verse 10 says, Proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord.
[348]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-ONE LIVING BY BEING FILLED IN SPIRIT
[349]  Verse 15 says, Look therefore carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise.
[350]  To be drunk with wine in the body causes us to be dissipated, but to be filled with Christ unto the fullness of God causes us to overflow with Him in speaking, singing, psalming, giving thanks to God, and subjecting ourselves one to another.
[351]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-TWO LIVING IN THE RELATIONSHIP
[352]  In this message we come to 5:22-33, where we see the proper living in the relationship between wife and husband.
[353]  In verse 22 Paul exhorts wives to be subject to their own husbands.
[354]  The wife s subjection plus the husband s love constitutes proper married life and typifies the normal church life, in which the church is subject to Christ and Christ loves the church.
[355]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-THREE A MYSTERIOUS TYPE
[356]  In his exhortation in chapter five, the apostle presents the church as the Bride of Christ.
[357]  This aspect of the church reveals that the church comes out of Christ as Eve came out of Adam Gen 2:21-22 , that she has the same life and nature as Christ, and that she, as His counterpart, becomes one with Him as Eve became one flesh with Adam Gen 2:24 .
[358]  The church as the new man is a matter of grace and truth, whereas the church as the Bride of Christ is a matter of love and light.
[359]  The apostle s exhortation in chapter four is focused on the new man with grace and truth as its basic elements, but his exhortation in chapter five is focused on the Bride of Christ with love and light as its basic substances.
[360]  In grace and truth we should live as the new man, and in love and light we should conduct ourselves as the Bride of Christ.
[361]  In the same principle, Christ and the church make a complete unit.
[362]  According to the New Testament, Christ s care of the church has two aspects.
[363]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that the church has the same life and nature as Christ.
[364]  If the church did not have the life and nature of Christ, the church could not be Christ s counterpart and could never be a match for Christ.
[365]  In this message we need to dwell on the matter of the all-inclusive sanctification of the church.
[366]  On the contrary, most of us have been separated from the world unto God through the help we have received in the church meetings.
[367]  The washing in verse 26 does not deal mainly with sins, but deals with spots and wrinkles.
[368]  Spots are something out of the natural life, and wrinkles are signs of oldness.
[369]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-FIVE CHRIST IN THREE STAGES
[370]  Ephesians 5:25-27 presents Christ to us in three stages.
[371]  Here we see Christ in the stage of the flesh.
[372]  Finally, a third stage of Christ is revealed in verse 27, which speaks of Christ presenting the church to Himself in His coming back.
[373]  Furthermore, John 1 says that the Word which was God and was with God became flesh v. 14 . Great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest in the flesh 1 Tim 3:16 . God cannot be manifest in angels; He can be manifest only in the flesh.
[374]  According to verse 26, Christ gave Himself up for the church so that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word.
[375]  After the Lord Jesus gave Himself for us in the flesh, He was resurrected and in resurrection became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .
[376]  The elder may tell the one brother that in the church life we all must learn patience, whereas the elderly sister may tell the other that the Lord has put him into his situation so he could learn certain lessons.
[377]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-SIX SANCTIFYING, CLEANSING, NOURISHING,
[378]  God s economy is not a religion, but a wonderful, unlimited, immeasurable, unsearchable, and all-inclusive Person, Christ Jesus Himself.
[379]  We have pointed out that when we take Christ as our person, we experience Him speaking in us as the life-giving Spirit.
[380]  The Lord s intention in His inward speaking is not simply to tell us to do certain things or not to do other things; it is to impart Himself into us by speaking to us.
[381]  Whenever we tell the Lord that we want Him to be our person, He begins to speak within us.
[382]  In verse 29 there are two important words: nourish and cherish.
[383]  But if we take Christ as our person, we shall experience Him nourishing us.
[384]  What we have within us is not simply life or the Spirit, but Christ Himself as the very glory of God.
[385]  However, He will do this not in a religious way, but in the way that is according to God s economy.
[386]  Ephesians 5:27 does not say that Christ will present to Himself a nice church nor even a victorious church, but it says that Christ will have a glorious church.
[387]  Our Christ must not be a Christ in teaching, but be a Christ making His home in our heart, a Christ saturating our being with His element.
[388]  In the eyes of God, it does not matter whether we are good or bad, for the only thing of value in His economy is Christ Himself.
[389]  There is a great difference between sanctification and behavior.
[390]  In sanctification we do things without trying on purpose to do them.
[391]  They are the spontaneous expression of our taking Christ as our life and our person.
[392]  When Christ is our life and our person, He lives within us.
[393]  Instead, we all must be able to testify that we live, not according to outward teachings, but according to the Christ who dwells in us to be our life and our person.
[394]  We have pointed out that 5:25-27 presents Christ in three stages.
[395]  When Christ was in the first of these stages, the stage of the flesh, He went to the cross and there gave Himself up for the church.
[396]  If we open to Him and tell Him that we are willing to take Him as our life and our person, He will work within us as the life-giving Spirit to add Himself to us and to carry away our oldness and our natural disposition.
[397]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-NINE GOD S DESIRE FOR A GLORIOUS CHURCH
[398]  We have seen that God s intention in His economy is to obtain a glorious church.
[399]  Strictly speaking, God is not seeking a spiritual church, a heavenly church, nor even a victorious church.
[400]  When God filled the tabernacle and the temple, both of them were filled with glory, with the very manifestation of God.
[401]  This means that every part of this corporate man is glorious.
[402]  Christ is sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing us in order to present to Himself a glorious church.
[403]  Rather, Christ s presentation of the glorious church involves a process which began at the time of the Apostles and which has been going on throughout the centuries.
[404]  Today we also are participating in the process through which Christ is presenting the glorious church to Himself.
[405]  Let us consider in more detail the matter of ordinances as veils.
[406]  Sometimes in our meetings we shout praises to the Lord.
[407]  If we take the way of God s economy, the church will eventually become glorious, for Christ, the glory of God, will continually burn His glory into us.
[408]  Certain religious teachers attempt to systematize the revelation in the New Testament.
[409]  Under the influence of such systematic teachings, some suppose that since Christ is in the third heaven He cannot be elsewhere, particularly not in us.
[410]  Nevertheless, the Bible says that Christ is both in the third heaven and in us as well Rom 8:34, 10 .
[411]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-ONE A SUMMARY OF THE EXHORTATION
[412]  In this message we shall present a summary of Paul s exhortation in chapter five, concentrating on love and light.
[413]  Although it is rather easy to understand the difference between love and grace, it is more difficult to understand the distinction between light and truth.
[414]  Perhaps it will help if I illustrate from my own experience in married life.
[415]  Let us now trace the basic factors and the basic elements in chapters one, two, and three.
[416]  The major factor in chapter one is the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.
[417]  The infinite, unlimited, eternal power that raised Christ from among the dead, uplifted Him to the third heaven, and made Him the Head over all things, is to the church which is His Body.
[418]  Hence, the major factor in chapter one is the church as the Body of Christ, and the basic element is the well-speaking of the Father, Son, and Spirit.
[419]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-TWO THE BELIEVERS LIVING IN THE RELATIONSHIP
[420]  Just as Eve came out of Adam and went back to Adam to be one flesh with him, so the church comes out of Christ and will go back to Christ to be one spirit with Him.
[421]  The church, who is the new man for the fulfillment of God s purpose and the Bride for the satisfaction of the longing in Christ s heart, is also the warrior for the defeat of God s enemy.
[422]  Verse 1 says, The children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
[423]  If a brother in slavery stands in his position and obeys his master, he is in the eyes of the Lord a slave of Christ, doing the will of God, and his service is as to the Lord and not to men v. 7 . Such a slave is to do the will of God from the soul.
[424]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-THREE WARFARE TO DEAL WITH THE SPIRITUAL ENEMY
[425]  In this message we come to 6:10-20, a strategic section of this book dealing with spiritual warfare.
[426]  As we have seen, in Ephesians Paul covers various aspects of the church.
[427]  Just as a person s body is his stature and expression, so the church as the Body of Christ is the stature and expression of Christ.
[428]  In this chapter Paul goes on to point out that the church is the corporate new man created in Christ Jesus, the commonwealth of God, and the household of God.
[429]  Ephesians 6:10 says, For the rest, be empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength.
[430]  To deal with God s enemy, to fight against the evil force of darkness, we need to be empowered with the greatness of the power that raised up Christ from the dead and seated Him in the heavens, far above all the evil spirits in the air.
[431]  In chapter two we sit with Christ in the heavenlies v. 6 , and in chapters four and five we walk in His Body on the earth 4:1, 17; 5:2, 8, 15 . Then in chapter six we stand in His power in the heavenlies.
[432]  In this message and in the message following we shall consider the items that make up the whole armor of God.
[433]  15, 21, 24, 25 , truth here refers to God in Christ as reality in our living, that is, God realized and experienced by us as our living.
[434]  Christ has made peace for us on the cross, both with God and with man, and this peace has become our gospel 2:13-17 .
[435]  In the foregoing message we considered the first three items of the armor of God: the girdle, the breastplate, and the shoes.
[436]  The girdle is related to truth, the breastplate is related to righteousness, and the shoes are related to peace.
[437]  We have seen that truth is God expressed in our living as our standard, pattern, and principle.
[438]  When we live out God in our daily living, we are covered with Christ as our righteousness, and we have peace as our firm foundation.
[439]  In the first part of verse 17 Paul goes on to say, And receive the helmet of salvation.
[440]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-SIX THE APPLICATION BY PRAYER
[441]  In this message we come to 6:18-20, which in particular covers the matter of prayer.
[442]  We have seen that the armor of God is composed of six items: the girdle of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the firm foundation of the gospel of peace, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit.
[443]  In verse 18 Paul goes on to speak of watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints.
[444]  In this message we come to the conclusion of Ephesians, 6:21-24.
[445]  Verses 23 and 24 are Paul s blessing: Peace to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[446]  Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption.
[447]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-EIGHT THE CHURCH AS A HYBRID LIFE
[448]  His purpose is not just to create man, to rescue him from his fallen condition, and to bring him to heaven.
[449]  Furthermore, God s purpose is not simply to have us be holy, spiritual, and victorious.
[450]  Creation, salvation, sanctification, spirituality, and victory are all part of God s procedure to reach His goal, but they are not the goal itself.
[451]  In order to share in the recovery of the proper church life, we need to see what God s purpose was in the beginning.
[452]  Just as the members of our body are for the body, not for the members themselves, so we have become Christians fort he church.
[453]  In Galatians 3:27 and 28 Paul says that as many as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ and that we are all one in Christ Jesus.
[454]  Furthermore, the book of Ephesians reveals the Triune God more fully than any other book in the Bible.
[455]  Ephesians 1:3 says, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.
[456]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-NINE THE MINGLED SPIRIT FOR THE CHURCH LIFE
[457]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that God s purpose is to obtain the church by dispensing Himself into man and making Himself one with man.
[458]  For example, in chapter three Paul speaks of the fullness of God v. 19 , the riches of Christ v. 8 , and the power of the Spirit v. 16 . The fullness implies that the riches of all that God is become His expression.
[459]  Hence, Christ is the embodiment of God s fullness, and the Spirit is the realization of Christ s riches.
[460]  The dispensing of the Triune God into man is altogether related to the Spirit.
[461]  The processed God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is waiting for our spirit to respond to Him and to cooperate with Him.
[462]  Ephesians 4:23 says, And are renewed in the spirit of your mind.
[463]  Some say that the spirit here cannot be the human spirit because this is the renewing spirit.
[464]  The spirit in this verse is the regenerated spirit of the believers mingled with the indwelling Spirit of God.
[465]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SEVENTY ORDINANCES AND DOCTRINE
[466]  We have seen that the divine Spirit has been mingled with the human spirit to produce one entity.
[467]  This oneness of the divine Spirit with the human spirit is the church life.
[468]  Because the church is produced by the mingling of divinity with humanity, we may say that the church is a hybrid.
[469]  In 2:13-22 we see a contrast between ordinances and the Spirit.
[470]  Christ on the cross abolished the ordinances in order to produce the church.
[471]  Since we emphasize the need to set aside doctrine for the building up of the church, you may wonder what we do with the Bible.
[472]  In Matthew 4:4 the Lord Jesus said to the Devil who was tempting Him, Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.
[473]  Before we consider the matter of putting off the old man and putting on the new man, the church 4:22-24 , we need to see that the abolishing of the ordinances for the creation of the new man is part of the gospel.
[474]  Not many Christians realize that this matter must be proclaimed as part of the gospel.
[475]  Speaking of Christ, 2:17 says, He preached the gospel of peace.
[476]  But in Christ Jesus we have become near in the blood of Christ v. 13 . The context proves that we have been brought near to one another.
[477]  In verses 18 through 22 we see that we now have access unto the Father, that we are fellow-citizens of the saints and members of the household of God, that we are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, that the whole building is growing together into a holy temple in the Lord, and that we also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.
[478]  Now we come to a third negative thing the old man.
[479]  For the church life, we must not only put off the old man, but also put on the new man.
[480]  To put on the church life as the new man is to put on this entity produced by the mingling of the divine Spirit with the human spirit.
[481]  THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 1:4-5, 7, 13-14, 17-18; 2:4-6, 8, 10, 13, 16; 3:16-17, 19; 4:4, 7, 12-13, 15-16, 23; 5:26, 29; 6:11-13
[482]  In this message we shall consider more than thirty points related to God s accomplished work concerning the church.
[483]  If we turn to our spirit and contact the Lord regarding this matter, we shall realize that just as God is eternal, so His choosing of us was also related to eternity.
[484]  In 2:8 Paul tells us that by grace you have been saved through faith.
[485]  Before we were saved, we could enjoy certain worldly entertainments.
[486]  He has put us into the position of grace that we may be the object of His grace and favor, that we may enjoy all that God is to us.
[487]  Because we are His, we are sealed and possessed by Him.
[488]  When Christ makes His home in us, we shall enjoy Him as unlimited love.
[489]  We are rooted in Christ for growth, and we are grounded in Him for building.
[490]  When we are strengthened into our inner man, when Christ makes His home in our hearts, and when we are rooted and grounded in love, we are filled unto all the fullness of God 3:19 .
[491]  Furthermore, in 4:16 we see that we are knit together.
[492]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SEVENTY-THREE THREE ITEMS THAT DAMAGE THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 1:5-7, 13, 17, 22-23; 2:4, 5, 15, 18, 22; 3:8, 16-17, 19, 21; 4:4-6, 15; 5:18, 26-27; 6:11, 18
[493]  In this message we shall consider how the church became degraded.
[494]  Before we do this, let us look at some of the key verses in each chapter of Ephesians.
[495]  In 1:5 Paul says that we have been predestinated to sonship, that is, predestinated to become sons of God.
[496]  The fact that God has predestinated us, or marked us out beforehand, to be His sons means that we have been predestinated to be born of Him.
[497]  This implies that God must come into us and that we must receive His life and have a relationship with Him in life.
[498]  Having become the object of God s grace, we have been favored in Christ, and we have redemption through the blood of Christ.
[499]  This means that the preaching of the unsearchable riches of Christ, the strengthening of our inner man, Christ making His home in our heart, and being filled unto all the fullness of God are not for our individual spirituality, but for the church.
[500]  According to 4:15, we need to grow up into Christ in all things.
[501]  Finally, in chapter six Paul tells us to put on the whole armor of God v. 11 . We need to receive the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, by means of all prayer, praying at every time in spirit v. 18 . This is for the church to be God s warrior.
[502]  We have been made alive for God s dwelling place, and we enjoy the riches of Christ that we may be part of the church.
[503]  This turn to the tree of knowledge was expressed in the controversies concerning Christology that were common during the first several centuries in the history of the church.
[504]  Much of this debate was brought about by the threat of Gnosticism, which taught heresy concerning the Person of Christ, saying that He was not actually God incarnated as a man.
[505]  Some said that Christ was only God and not man, whereas others argued that Christ was only a man and not God.
[506]  The third item that has damaged the church throughout its history is organization.
[507]  This damaging and corrupting element began to appear in the second century, largely through the influence of a certain spiritual leader, Ignatius, who taught that bishops were different from elders.
[508]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SEVENTY-FOUR SEVEN ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 1:23; 2:15-16, 19, 21-22; 4:4, 12-13, 16, 24; 5:5, 25, 31-32; 6:11, 13
[509]  Satan s goal is to divide the Body of Christ through knowledge and doctrine and to destroy the functions of the members of the Body through organization, especially organization that issues in the clergy-laity system.
[510]  Today s Christianity is filled with religion, doctrine, organization, forms, rituals, and regulations.
[511]  People are helped to be saved, to become religious, to pursue spirituality, and to desire a closer walk with the Lord.
[512]  In the Lord s recovery we are not for religion, knowledge, organization, rituals, forms, or regulations; we are only for the all-inclusive Christ as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit.
[513]  Therefore, the dwelling place of God is in our spirit.
[514]  Finally, in chapter six we see that the church is a warrior to defeat God s enemy, the Devil.
[515]  As we consider God s economy as revealed in the book of Ephesians, we need to pray that the Lord will give us an open heaven with a clear sky.
[516]  If we would know God s economy, not only must we have the knowledge of the book of Ephesians; we must also touch the reality contained in this book.
[517]  In 1:11 Paul uses the word counsel, saying that God operates all things according to the counsel of His will.
[518]  For this reason, Genesis 1:26 says, And God said, Let us make man in our image.
[519]  Christ is also a mystery, and the church, as the Body of Christ to express Him, is the mystery of Christ.
[520]  The second step God took in working out His economy was predestination.
[521]  Hence, as God s creatures we need to be regenerated by Him that we may participate in His life to be His sons.
[522]  We have seen that God s economy is Christ with the church and that the word economy denotes a dispensation.
[523]  God s intention is to dispense Himself into His chosen people.
[524]  Throughout the centuries, Christians have argued about doctrines and practices.
[525]  In Galatians 6:15 Paul says, For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation Gk.
[526]  In 3:8 Paul says that he preached the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.
[527]  What Paul preached was not doctrine, gifts, knowledge, or power.
[528]  The unsearchable riches of Christ include all the aspects of what Christ is to us.
[529]  May the Lord grant us a clear sky so that we may see the vision of Christ and the church.
[530]  Although Ephesians is a short book, no other book in the Bible reveals Christ in His all-inclusiveness, both vertically and horizontally, as the book of Ephesians does.
[531]  Chapter three of Ephesians reveals three important things regarding Christ: that His riches are unsearchable, that He is making His home in our heart, and that His dimensions are universal.
[532]  If we are strengthened by the Spirit and Christ makes His home in us, we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[533]  It is by His descending and ascending that Christ constitutes us gifts to the Body.
[534]  The more He descends and ascends within us, the more we become gifts.
[535]  If you consider the verses we have covered in this message, you will see that the Christ we experience in the Lord s recovery is different from the Christ we heard about in religion.
[536]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SEVENTY-EIGHT TAKING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON
[537]  The book of Ephesians reveals that the church is not only the Body, but also the new man.
[538]  If we sincerely desire to take Christ as our life and as our person, we must let go of our ordinances.
[539]  For example, we should not have an ordinance about hair styles.
[540]  Without Ephesians 3, Ephesians 2 would only be doctrine to us.
[541]  It is a fact that Christ has abolished the ordinances in order to create the Jews and the Gentiles into one new man.
[542]  But for this to be practical in our daily experience, we must allow Christ to make His home in our hearts 3:17 .
[543]  As he was praying on the housetop, he saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth v. 11 . In this sheet were all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air v. 12 . Then a voice said to Peter, Rise, Peter; kill and eat v. 13 . However, Peter s response was, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean v. 14 . On this occasion, Peter did not take Christ as His person.
[544]  If we do not take Him as our person, we shall have the sense deep within that, no matter how much we love Christ and the church and no matter how much we are for the Lord s recovery, we are lacking something.
[545]  Christ is the embodiment of God and the content of the church.
[546]  Although all genuine Christians recognize that Christ is the Son of God, not many have an adequate realization that He is the embodiment of God.
[547]  In eternity past, God in Christ made a plan, selected us, and predestinated us, or marked us out.
[548]  However, after we came into the church life, we began to realize that our Christ is the embodiment of all that God is.
[549]  Ephesians 5:25 says that Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her.
[550]  This verse indicates that Christ is a church-loving Christ.
[551]  Although Christians pay attention to this verse, they may not also pay attention to Ephesians 5:25, where we are told that Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for the church.
[552]  In 5:25-27 we see that Christ gave Himself up for the church, not merely to save the church from hell and bring her into heaven, but to sanctify her and to cleanse her by the washing of the water in the Word.
[553]  In 2:15 and 16 we see that Christ is also the new-man-creating Christ.
[554]  For centuries, Christians have spoken about Christ s death on the cross without seeing the consummate point that He died for the creation of the new man.
[555]  He is the church-loving Christ, the new-man-creating Christ, the all-things-heading-up-Christ, the gift-making and gift-giving Christ, and the home-making Christ.
[556]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE EIGHTY PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN
[557]  BY GROWING UP INTO CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 4:12-16, 22-24
[558]  We have pointed out that the church is not only the Body, but also the new man.
[559]  Because the church is not only the Body with Christ as life but also the new man with Christ as the person, Paul in 3:17 emphasizes the importance of Christ making His home in our hearts.
[560]  The only way for Christ to be our person is for Him to make His home in our hearts.
[561]  The need in all the local churches is for the saints to take Christ both as their life and as their person by allowing Him to make His home in their hearts.
[562]  If we take Christ as our person, then as we come together in the meetings Christ will be expressed from our spirit and through our heart.
[563]  To perfect the saints is not mainly to teach them; it is to minister Christ to them.
[564]  Whenever someone ministers Christ to us, we spontaneously have the sense that we are fed and nourished, that we have received Christ as our food supply.
[565]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE EIGHTY-ONE THE CHURCH THE EXPRESSION OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 1:23; 3:8b, 17a, 19b; 4:13; 5:18b
[566]  It is not the expression of such things as doctrine, gifts, or power.
[567]  Let us now consider the difference between the riches of Christ and the fullness of Christ.
[568]  The riches of Christ are what Christ is to us in all His divine attributes and human virtues.
[569]  In the Lord s recovery we are fighting a battle.
[570]  Primarily we must fight against the use of good things as substitutes for Christ.
[571]  In his subtlety, the enemy, Satan, uses many things to attract people away from Christ.
[572]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE EIGHTY-TWO THE CHURCH THE OVERFLOW OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 1:23; 3:19b; 4:13; John 1:16
[573]  In order to be in reality the overflow of Christ, we need to be transformed.
[574]  Second Corinthians 3:18 says that as we behold and reflect the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face, we are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory.
[575]  The fullness of Christ, which is the Body, has a stature, for Paul speaks of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[576]  Chapter one reveals that the Body of Christ is the fullness of Christ, and chapter four, that the fullness of Christ has a stature.
[577]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE EIGHTY-THREE EXPERIENCING THE RICHES OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 3:8b, 17a; 2 Cor 2:10; 10:1; 11:10; 8:9; 12:9; 13:14
[578]  Ephesians 3:8 speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ, and 3:17, of Christ making His home in our hearts.
[579]  This indicates that the very Christ who is making His home in us is the Christ with the unsearchable riches.
[580]  Paul concludes 2 Corinthians with the words, The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all 13:14, Gk.
[581]  Romans 10:12 gives us a clue as to how we may enjoy the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[582]  In this verse Paul says, The same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him.
[583]  The riches of Christ should not just be studied they should be enjoyed.
[584]  In 2 Corinthians 10:1 Paul says, Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ.
[585]  Paul did not say that he imitated the meekness and gentleness of Christ.
[586]  To imitate Christ is one thing, but to live in Christ s meekness and gentleness is another.
[587]  In order to enjoy the meekness and gentleness of Christ, we need to be in the Spirit, for all the riches of Christ are in the all-inclusive Spirit.
[588]  This means that the love of God is the source of the grace of Christ, and that the grace of Christ is the expression of the love of God.
[589]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE EIGHTY-FOUR OVERFLOWING TO SPEAK Scripture Reading: Eph 5:18b-19; 1 Cor 14:1, 5, 23-24, 31-32
[590]  In 5:18 Paul charges us to be filled in spirit.
[591]  If we are filled in spirit, that with which we are filled will overflow from within us.
[592]  In 1 Corinthians 14:1 Paul says, Pursue love, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy Gk.
[593]  The way to be spiritual is to speak for the Lord and concerning the Lord.
[594]  The more we speak, the more we shall be filled in our spirit.
[595]  However, if we remain silent, we shall find that we cannot be filled in spirit.
[596]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE EIGHTY-FIVE ORDINANCES AND THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: Eph 2:11-18; Gal 6:15
[597]  The book of Ephesians reveals that God s economy is to work Christ into His chosen people to produce the church.
[598]  This book also exposes certain negative things that damage the church life.
[599]  The primary source of the divisions among Christians throughout the centuries has been ordinances.
[600]  God s intention in His creation of man was for mankind to be one.
[601]  The Apostle Paul was very clear about ordinances, and he knew the futility of debating whether certain practices are right or wrong.
[602]  In Galatians 6:15 Paul uttered a very significant word related to this controversy: For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation Gk.
[603]  The only thing that avails as far as God s economy is concerned is a new creation in Christ.
[604]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE EIGHTY-SIX SLAYING THE ORDINANCES Scripture Reading: Eph 2:11-22
[605]  It is easy to understand those parts of the Bible that correspond to our natural concept.
[606]  Here we are told that in Christ Jesus we who once were far off have become near in the blood of Christ.
[607]  In verses 11 and 12 Paul tells us to remember our situation before we were saved.
[608]  He reminds us that we were Gentiles in the flesh, the ones called uncircumcision by those who are called circumcision in the flesh made by hand.
[609]  He also reminds us that we were apart from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise.
[610]  Formerly we were outside of Christ; now we are in Christ and with Christ.
[611]  The point we are burdened to emphasize in this message is that on the cross Christ has slain all the ordinances.
[612]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE EIGHTY-SEVEN THE ORDINANCES VERSUS CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 2:11-22 THE CROSS
[613]  Ephesians 2 is an important chapter because it reveals that Christ died on the cross in order to create in Himself one new man.
[614]  In 2:11 and 12 Paul reminds us of our situation when we were apart from Christ.
[615]  We were alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, we were strangers from the covenants of the promise, we had no hope, and we were without God in the world.
[616]  But one day we were called by God, and we answered His call by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.
[617]  Now in Christ Jesus we who once were far off from God and from one another have become near in the blood of Christ.
[618]  As the cornerstone, He joins the two walls, the one of the Jewish believers and the other of the Gentile believers.
[619]  In Ephesians 2 Christ is referred to specifically as the cornerstone v. 20 . When the Jewish builders rejected Christ, they rejected Him as the cornerstone Acts 4:11; 1 Pet 2:7 , which would join the Gentiles to them for the building of God s house.
[620]  If we hold only to the all-inclusive Christ, not to any ordinances, He will be the cornerstone to join us together for the building of God s dwelling place.
[621]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE EIGHTY-EIGHT UNIVERSAL BUILDING AND LOCAL BUILDING Scripture Reading: Eph 2:21-22
[622]  Chapter two of Ephesians concludes with the matter of the building.
[623]  Although there are millions of Christians on earth today, very few have been built up with others.
[624]  The reason for this lack of building is that so many believers still hold on to ordinances.
[625]  It is important to see that the universal building can be accomplished only through the local building.
[626]  If we are not built up with others in our own locality, we should not expect to be able to be built up in any other locality.
[627]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE EIGHTY-NINE GROWTH BY FEEDING FOR THE BUILDING Scripture Reading: Eph 4:11-16; Rom 14:1-3, 5-6; 16:17; 1 Cor 5:9-11; Titus 3:10; 2 John 7, 9-11
[628]  God created mankind for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.
[629]  When Christ died on the cross to accomplish redemption, He slew all the ordinances in order to bring His chosen people back into oneness and to create in Himself one new man.
[630]  Many Christians think that what is mainly needed on the human side is teaching.
[631]  Deep within, even unconsciously, some of us may still be holding on to certain doctrines.
[632]  These doctrines hidden within us may cause us one day to become dissenting.
[633]  We must be careful to distinguish the faith from doctrines related to such things as the keeping of days, dietary regulations, the method of baptism, speaking in tongues, and foot-washing.
[634]  Remember that our faith consists of those things which a person must believe in order to be saved.
[635]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE NINETY-ONE FAITH BUT NOT DOCTRINE Scripture Reading: Eph 4:13-14; Jude 3; 1 Tim 1:19; 3:9; 6:12a; 2 Tim 4:7; Titus 1:4, 13b
[636]  In 4:13 Paul speaks of the oneness of the faith, and in 4:14 he refers to the winds of teaching, of doctrine.
[637]  This indicates that we need to distinguish between the faith and doctrine.
[638]  Apart from the four negative things mentioned above, we cannot find a fifth item in the New Testament concerning which we should be strict in accepting others.
[639]  Yes, the New Testament commands us to love one another.
[640]  God s intention is not to gain a people who are merely moral and godly in a religious sense.
[641]  His intention is to have a people who have been regenerated, sanctified, purified, transformed, and built up as the one new man.
[642]  He desires to have the church as the new man with Christ as his person.
[643]  God s concern is that we be filled with Christ, nourished by Christ, and built up in Christ as a proper church.
[644]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE NINETY-TWO THE PERFECTING OF THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Eph 4:7-16
[645]  In 2:15 Paul speaks of the creation of the one new man: Having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, making peace.
[646]  Then in 4:13 he speaks of arriving at a full-grown man, and in 4:24, of putting on the new man.
[647]  We have pointed out that the new man can become perfect in relation to his functions only through receiving the proper nourishment.
[648]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE NINETY-THREE THE CORPORATE LIFE OF THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Eph 4:17-32
[649]  We have seen that in chapter two we have the creation of the new man and in chapter four, the growth of the new man.
[650]  In order for the new man to grow, we need to experience the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and descending Christ.
[651]  This means that the all-inclusive Christ must be wrought into us to be our everything.
[652]  Because the book of Ephesians is a book on the church, we should view everything in it from the perspective of the church.
[653]  In verse 17 Paul charges us to no longer walk as the nations also walk in the vanity of their mind.
[654]  Those who walk in this way are darkened in their understanding, estranged from the life of God because of the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardness of their heart v. 18 . It is possible to be a saved person, one who has the life of God, yet walk in the vanity of the mind.
[655]  For example, some may do their shopping in the vanity of the mind and thereby become alienated from the life of God.
[656]  Whenever we return to the old manner of life, we shall spontaneously sense that we are darkened within and estranged from God s life.
[657]  In 4:17 Paul says, This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the nations also walk in the vanity of their mind.
[658]  They walk without God in the vanity of their mind, controlled and directed by their vain thoughts.
[659]  In 3:16 Paul goes on to speak of the inner man: That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.
[660]  It also causes us to subject ourselves one to another v. 21 . What we need for the church life is not to be filled in our minds with objective knowledge, but to be filled in our spirit with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God.
[661]  In chapter one we have the spirit of wisdom and revelation; in chapter two, the spirit as the place of God s dwelling; in chapter three, the spirit as the means of receiving revelation and as the organ that needs to be strengthened; in chapter four, the renewing spirit that spreads into our mind to renew all our inward parts; in chapter five, the spirit being filled with Christ unto all the fullness of God; and in chapter six, the mingled spirit as the organ in which we pray to fight the battle for the Lord.
[662]  A number of times we have spoken about the importance of having a clear sky.
[663]  Actually, to have a clear sky is simply to have a clear spirit.
[664]  The result of such a daily living is that we have the image of God.
[665]  This means that our life becomes the expression of God.
[666]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE NINETY-FIVE THE BEAUTY OF THE BRIDE Scripture Reading: Eph 1:9-11, 13b-14, 17-23; 3:16-17a, 19b; 5:25-27, 29-30, 32 SPOTS AND WRINKLES
[667]  In previous messages we have considered three categories of negative things that damage the church life: ordinances, doctrine, and the old man.
[668]  Now we come to the fourth category of these negative things the spots and wrinkles.
[669]  Paul refers to this in 5:27, where he says that Christ will present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things.
[670]  I believe that we are living in a day in which the Lord is preparing His Bride.
[671]  Furthermore, I have the full assurance that we are presently undergoing this process of preparation.
[672]  Christ is now preparing us to be His Bride.
[673]  The time is coming when He will present the Bride to Himself.
[674]  Surely at the time of her presentation to Christ, the Bride will not have any wrinkles or spots.
[675]  The deepest chapters in Ephesians are chapters one and three.
[676]  This word does not refer to the preeminence of Christ, to the authority of Christ, or to the expression of Christ.
[677]  In 1:11 Paul goes on to say, In Whom also we were made an inheritance, having been predestinated according to the purpose of the One Who operates all things according to the counsel of His will.
[678]  It is possible to render the Greek translated were made an inheritance as have obtained an inheritance.
[679]  At the time we were saved, God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, to indicate that we belong to God.
[680]  God gives His Holy Spirit to us, not only as a guarantee of our inheritance, securing our heritage, but also as a foretaste of what we shall inherit of God, affording us a taste beforehand of the full inheritance.
[681]  However, without the church as the Body to match Christ as the Head, it will not be possible for God to head up all things in Christ.
[682]  The heading up of all things in Christ takes place as the Triune God works Himself into man as the center of His creation.
[683]  According to 1:22, God has subjected all things under the feet of the resurrected and ascended Christ and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.
[684]  LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE NINETY-SEVEN THE CHURCH AS GOD S WARRIOR Scripture Reading: Eph 6:10-18 VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH
[685]  In Ephesians 1 we have a general view of what the church is and how the church comes into being.
[686]  Then in chapter two we see that the church is the new man created by Christ in Himself.
[687]  In chapter three we have a clear vision of Christ making His home in the hearts of those in the church.
[688]  For Christ to make His home in the heart of the church means that He is transfused into the center of the church s inner being.
[689]  In God s economy there is one army constituted of a corporate warrior.
[690]  Only as a corporate entity, the Body, can we put on the whole armor of God.
[691]  This indicates that the Spirit is the word of God.
[692]  We have pointed out that the sword is the only aspect of the armor that is for offensive warfare; that is, it is the only item of God s armor used for attacking the enemy.
[693]  Perhaps you are wondering what this has to do with our subjective experience of the killing power of the word.
