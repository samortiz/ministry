   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO CHRIST BECOMING OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:30; Eph 1:6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have previously seen how God's salvation is based on righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we will see how God makes Christ our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Righteousness is particularly related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we do not intend to come to God, nothing more needs to be said.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if we want to come to God, we have to take care of the matter of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a man does not have righteousness, he will not dare to see God's face.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After Adam and Eve fell, they hid themselves among the trees and ran from Jehovah's face when they heard His voice because they were naked.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once a man hears God's voice, even if he has not seen His face, he will immediately feel his nakedness; he will feel that he cannot see God without a covering Gen 3:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Bible righteousness is signified by a garment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Righteousness is like a garment; we can only see God when we put on this garment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have been baptized, and we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But we have to pay attention to one question: since the day we belonged to Christ, what has been the means by which we come to God?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On what basis do we come before Him?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What should we wear when we come to God?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our sins are forgiven and washed away, but we still need a garment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Righteousness is not a negative problem; it is not merely related to sin or to our forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Righteousness is a positive matter; it is a matter of how we come before God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must deal thoroughly with the matter of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a Christian, surely you pray.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Have you ever wondered if God would answer your prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why do you sometimes doubt that God will answer your prayers?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is because you feel that you are wrong, that you have this and that kind of defect, and that if you come to God, all the defects will be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Either we do not pray at all, or we pray with all these questions coming into our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On what basis do we come to God?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Either we do not pray at all, or we pray and immediately wonder how we can come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must be covered by something before we can come boldly before God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a question of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is a question of what we put on when we come before God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is the basis for us to come to God?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What do we have that will satisfy God?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God will not gloss over our sins; He has to examine us to the extent that He Himself is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every time we come to God, we need righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we stand before God, we need to present to Him righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whether we have boldness before Him and whether we are strong or weak before Him depend on whether or not we have righteousness before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do not have righteousness, we are afraid of being seen by Him; we are afraid that once He examines us more carefully He will see our lack.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not have righteousness, all our boldness is gone, and inwardly we shrivel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if we have righteousness, and if our righteousness is such that even God can say nothing, we will have boldness to come to Him, and we will dare to pray to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must remember that a basic condition for prayer is boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Without boldness we cannot pray.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are not bold, we cannot come before God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The necessary condition for coming to God is boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Boldness is being able to stand before God and being confident that He will not find any fault in us no matter how hard He searches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Without this, we cannot pray to Him with boldness, and we cannot even be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The question now is with what kind of righteousness can we come before God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In other words, what kind of righteousness is acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to be clear that the righteousness we are speaking of is different from the righteousness mentioned in the last chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Chapter one speaks of the relationship between righteousness and sins; it speaks of the relationship between God's righteousness and our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The righteousness spoken of here is something we offer to God to satisfy Him when we come before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is where the problem of most people lies.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yesterday they prayed before God, and they were bold because they preached the gospel twice, read five chapters of the Bible, and were in an upbeat mood before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When they felt that they were good and doing well, they thought that they had righteousness, and they were bold.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But the strange thing is that their "righteousness" is like malaria; sometimes it is feverish, and sometimes it is chilling.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yesterday it seemed hot, but today it becomes cold.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Yesterday their interest in reading the Bible was high, but today their interest is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yesterday there was the zeal to preach the gospel, but today there is no interest in talking to people anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Any preaching seems senseless and does not do much good.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As a result, when such a person prays today, he does not feel as invigorated as he did yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When he comes to God today, he only considers the fact that he has not studied the Bible well and testified well and that his living is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He feels that something is wrong within himself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He thinks that God will not answer his prayer today.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do you see this?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This kind of "righteousness" is fluctuating and vacillating; it is good for two days and not good for two days.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is down for two days and up for two days.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If our righteousness is fluctuating and vacillating, our Christian life before God will also be fluctuating and vacillating.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>One day we will be very bold before the Lord, and the next day we will become very timid.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>One day we will feel that God will surely answer us when we pray, and the next day we will feel that God will not answer us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Sometimes we can stand before God with boldness, while at other times we cannot stand before Him with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We fluctuate and vacillate this way because we are coming to God according to our own conduct and our own "righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If our conduct is good, we feel more at ease before God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But if our conduct is not so good, our hearts become cold towards the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Our life before the Lord is like a flickering candle in the face of the wind; sometimes we feel good, and sometimes we feel terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Sometimes we can pray, and sometimes we cannot pray.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Sometimes we feel invigorated, and sometimes we feel dejected.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is because our conduct is fluctuating.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Sometimes it is up, and sometimes it is down.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Sometimes it is hot, and sometimes it is cold.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Sometimes it is bright, and sometimes it is dark.</S>
