   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>These seven epistles start with the Lord and end with the call to the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Who are the overcomers?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What are the overcomers?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Are they special ones, those who are above the ordinary?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Bible the meaning of the overcomers is that they are the normal, ordinary ones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who are not abnormal during the time of abnormality are the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Most people are below this level.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The overcomers are not above this level, but at this level.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God is calling the overcomers today to rise up and walk according to the normal pattern in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The will of God never changes; it is just like a straight line.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today men fall, fail, and continually go downward; but the overcomers are recovered anew into the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here we see two more matters: First, the church is the golden lampstand, and the Lord walks in the midst of the lampstands; second, the Lord holds the seven stars in His right hand, which are the angels of the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Each of the various kinds of metals spoken of in the Bible has meaning: iron typifies political power, brass typifies judgment, silver typifies redemption, and gold typifies the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The glory of God is one thing that no one knows or comprehends.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although it is difficult to comprehend the holiness of God, we can still comprehend it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The righteousness of God can also be understood.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the glory of God has never been known, because it is the one characteristic that belongs most uniquely to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church is made of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The people in the church are born of God, not of blood, not of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church has absolutely nothing to do with man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some ask what the work of wood, grass, and stubble is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Wood, grass, and stubble are the works of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The work of gold, silver, and precious stones is that which is entirely of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These seven epistles were written to the angels of the seven churches, differing from the first seven Epistles written by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul wrote to the churches, although we see that there were all the saints, overseers, and deacons, especially in the book to the Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here the epistles were written to the angels of the seven churches, not directly to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, they were the words spoken by the Holy Spirit to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word angel in Greek is angelos.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This word represents one who is a messenger.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many people, after reading Revelation 2 and 3, have tried to find similarities between the last seven epistles and the first seven and have injected all manner of wrong explanations regarding the messengers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Who is this messenger?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The messenger spoken of here is singular in number; the epistles were written to a singular messenger.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, this singular number is corporate in nature; that is why, at the end of each epistle, the calling is to the overcomers in plural.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This messenger is a corporate messenger who can represent a minority in the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At this point the way of God is different.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Formerly, the church stood before the Lord; now the messenger stands before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The light of the lamp is inferior to the light of the star.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord has chosen the inextinguishable starlight and said that this is His messenger.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This star is in the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today a group of people is a messenger in the eyes of the Lord; thus, the nature of the church today is entrusted to them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the church has a problem before the Lord in her outward appearance, the Lord sees a group of people a messenger who can be the representative of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Formerly, the representatives of the church were the elders with position and office; now the responsibility of representing the church is given to the spiritual messenger.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This messenger is not necessarily the elders or deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today God places the responsibility upon whoever can represent the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who can represent the church have the responsibility committed to them by God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today it is not a matter of position and office, but of having real spiritual authority before God to such ones God turns over the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Revelation is written to the "slaves'' of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, unless you are a slave, you will not be able to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He who is not bought with the blood and constrained by love to be a slave cannot understand Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>John wrote Revelation in A.D. 95 or 96 at the time Domitian was Caesar in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Of the twelve apostles, John was the last to die; therefore, the church of the apostles ended with John.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When John was writing, the seven epistles were prophetic.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today when we read the seven epistles, we also must regard them as prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, when we consider them today, they have already become history.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>John was looking ahead, while we are looking back.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now we will look at the seven churches in the seven epistles one by one.</S>
