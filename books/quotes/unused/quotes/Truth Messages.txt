In the two Epistles to Timothy there are a number of unusual expressions not found elsewhere in the New Testament
Although the churches are a house of life, there has been a shortage in regard to the pillar in front of the house
My burden in this message is to emphasize the fact that the church must have these two aspects, the aspect of life and the aspect of truth
Whenever we are in a time of degradation and darkness, we need the shining of the light so that we may know how to walk in the proper way
We have pointed out that 1 Timothy 3:15 reveals two aspects of the church, the house of life and the pillar of the truth
Because in city after city there is the foundation of life, the enemy's attempt to undermine the churches has not been successful
On the one hand, he steals the money, but on the other hand, he claims to be one with the bank and to be for the bank
If we have both the foundation of life and the pillar of the truth, no evil thing or evil person will be able to creep into the churches
Suppose a number of brothers come from other places to a certain locality to deal with the situation in the church there
Some have even told the young people that since they cannot conquer their flesh, they should let it do whatever it desires
Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith'
In these verses Paul warns that during degradation some will turn away their ears from the truth to teachings that please their itching ears
To be deprived of the truth is to be in bondage, in slavery, but to know the truth is to be released from slavery, to be freed
The second function of the truth is seen in John 17:17, which says, 'Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth'
It is a very significant matter to have the truth, for it frees us from all negative things and saturates us with the divine element
The more truth we have, the more we are released from bondage and the more we are saturated with the element of God
Many also regard truth as meaning certain true, reliable principles, such as the principle that honesty is the best policy
Full of grace and truth,' and verse 17 says, 'The law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ'
Although you could read about the parade the next day in a newspaper, the newspaper account would not make the parade real to you
Many Christians today use the Bible like a newspaper, but they do not have the vision of what is written in the Word
He had the doctrine of justification by faith, that is, the newspaper account of it, but he did not have the reality
Miss Monson replied that by the tone of his voice and by the expression on his face, she knew that he had not truly been regenerated
The Holy Spirit worked upon him, and he repented with tears, even rolling on the floor as he made confession to the Lord
Through that one testimony, given by a pastor who had been an opium smuggler, hundreds of students turned to the Lord
Truth is not merely a report, not simply words written in the Bible; it is a heavenly, spiritual vision televised into our being
We all need to learn to differentiate the speaking that gives merely a news report from the speaking that televises a vision into us
The saints in Taipei would not receive a news report; they would see a vision of what is taking place in our meeting
As soon as the reality of the death of Christ is televised into our being and we see it as a vision, we are saved
Perhaps you have heard many messages about holiness, but as far as you are concerned, these messages are only news reports
Because we all need to see the heavenly vision, in Ephesians 1 Paul prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation
When light from the Father in the heavens shines upon the words in the Bible, these words immediately become truth to us
We have the doctrine in printed letters, and then the heavenly light shines upon words of the Bible to show us the truth
When, by the mercy of God, the light shines on these verses, they see the truth of Christ's death and are saved
To know the truth we first need the facts and then the light that televises the vision of the facts into our being
Christ, His Person, His redemptive work, and all His accomplishments are facts contained in and conveyed by the Word
If we read the Word without the shining of the Spirit, we may have doctrine or news reports, but not the truth, the reality, or the vision
When a hierarchy was strongly formed and began to assume its evil power in certain places, hardly anyone was aware of it
Although by the Lord's mercy we have had the foundation of life, we have not had the adequate shining of the light
The fact that so many could receive his word shows either that they did not know the truth or that they were not practicing it
Even if the Apostle Paul were to speak differently from the truth in the New Testament, we should refuse to accept his word
Now that you are speaking something different, you are like the Peter who was rebuked by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 16'
While this was going on, if a brother had stood up for the truth, he would have been a hero in practicing the truth
Every church must be a police station, and every saint must be an active, functioning policeman, knowing the truth and practicing the truth
Suppose a certain brother, much used of the Lord in His recovery, stands up in a meeting and demands that the saints worship him
In 1 Timothy 3:15 the Apostle Paul says that the church is not only the pillar of the truth, but also the base of the truth
When we walk according to the Spirit, we are walking in the truth; and when we walk in the truth, we are walking according to the Spirit
The New Testament reveals clearly that when the church is degraded, we need to walk not only according to the Spirit, but also in the truth
John lived longer than the other apostles, and these Epistles were written near the end of his life, much later than 1 and 2 Timothy
They do not receive the truth, and it exposes the fact that they are not in the way of the truth, but in the way of darkness
Paul charged Timothy in this way because the truth regarding any matter is not found all in one place in the Bible
Rather, it is found throughout various books of the Bible, with a part in one place and another part in a different place
No doubt, the cutting straight of the word of truth is not only for our personal understanding of the Bible, but also for teaching others
What the Lord said about leadership in Matthew 20:20-28 and 23:8, 10, and 11 shatters the human thought of leadership
Galatians 2:9 says, 'James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me'
Prior to that time, he practiced the truth concerning eating with Gentile believers according to the vision he received in Acts 10
When Paul saw that Peter and the others did not walk uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, he rebuked Peter before all
Through his weakness, Peter was damaging the truth of the gospel, the truth that both Gentile believers and Jewish believers are the same
We are told that Paul and his co-workers went not to Peter but to James, for all the elders, including Peter, were in James' home
In God's New Testament economy the leadership among His children is not official, permanent, or organizational
At one time that capacity may be with a certain brother, but at another time it may be with a different brother
When they were on their mission, Paul spontaneously took the lead because he had the greater spiritual capacity
Because Barnabas realized that Paul's capacity was greater than his, he did not argue with him over taking the lead
All these cases prove that the leadership among God's children today should not be official, permanent, or organizational
If the saints had been clear about the truth concerning leadership and had practiced the truth, no one would have accepted such a claim
If we are clear about the truth and practice the truth, from now on no one will dare say that he is the leader
If you take the janitor's word blindly, you cannot help but be deceived, for you are in darkness and are short of the truth
Whenever someone thought of Brother Nee as the leader and came to him for instructions, Brother Nee would never say a word
If the elders see that the floor has not been vacuumed, they should not sit on the throne and summon the servants to vacuum it for them
Although the elders should not lord it over God's flock, Peter does say, 'Ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder'
Not only the young ones submit to the older ones, but all, including the older ones, submit to one another in humility
According to my knowledge of the New Testament, the apostles have no authority in themselves to control the churches
If the churches and the saints go on according to the Word, according to God's oracle, the apostles have no authority to touch the churches
Among the children of God in today's New Testament economy, there is actually no leadership in the natural sense
All the apostles, all the local churches, all the elders, and all the regions of the work are on the same level
If we see this, we shall be cutting straight the word of the truth concerning leadership among God's people today
Speaking of the need of a replacement for Judas, Peter said that Judas 'was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry'
When the Apostles prayed about a replacement for Judas, they asked the Lord to show them whom He had chosen to 'take part of this ministry'
The ministry in the New Testament economy is a corporate ministry, a ministry that includes thousands of gifted people
We all need to praise the Lord that by His mercy and grace He has put us into the corporate ministry that builds up the Body of Christ
In 2 Timothy 4:5 Paul charged Timothy, 'Fulfill thy ministry' , apparently encouraging him to fulfill his personal ministry
Colossians 4:17 says, 'And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfill it'
In considering the verses that speak of personal ministry, we need to realize that all the believers are members of the one Body
Because this ministry is the service of the Body of Christ and because the Body has many members, every member has its own ministry
According to the members, there are many ministries; however, according to the Body as a whole, there is just one ministry
Regarding this matter of the ministry, we need to be clear both about the truth in the Bible and about the situation of today's Christianity
The Baptists, the Presbyterians, the Lutherans, the Episcopalians, and the Pentecostals all have their own ministries
The ministers, pastors, and preachers in the various denominations are working to build up the denominations, not the Body
In the Lord's recovery we are for the recovery of Christ as life and everything to us for the building up of the church
For the fulfillment of God's purpose in His recovery, we need to go back to the beginning, back to the pure Word
Because of the degradation of the church and the existence of many divisions, there apparently are now many ministries
The correct way to answer is to say that Brother Lee and his co-workers have been commissioned by the Lord to build up the Body of Christ
Because the ministries of those in the denominations are for the building up of the denominations, we cannot invite them to speak to us
If we do this, the light will shine upon this teaching concerning the ministry, and the teaching will become the truth, the reality, to us
We all have a part in this ministry, which is one ministry with different functions, different angles, and different aspects
We need to be clear about the truth regarding the ministry, about the situation of today's Christianity, and about our practice
The truth that sanctifies us for oneness involves the Lord Jesus, the Spirit of reality, and the word of the Father
In the New Testament, especially in the Gospel of John, truth does not mean doctrine; it means the reality of the Triune God
Because the Father's word is His expression, and because His word is truth, truth is the expression of the Father
We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that the Bible is not merely a book, but a word that expresses God
Whenever we come to the Bible, we should have the consciousness that we are coming to God's expression, to God expressed
Many Christian teachers have rightly said that the Bible is the written Word and that the Son is the living Word
Whenever we come to the Word with an open heart and an open spirit, we immediately touch both the Word and the Spirit as the truth
When the Word mingled with the essence of the Triune God is imparted into us as the truth, this truth sanctifies us
By contacting the written Word that is mingled with the living Word, something is transfused into us and works in us all day long
By taking the Word in this way, we have the clear conviction that something of the Lord has been wrought into us
As we are being set free, we are also sanctified, separated, made holy to God, not only positionally, but also dispositionally
It is to experience the living Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-being wrought into us through the living Word
If we desire to have the genuine oneness in the church life, we need the sanctifying truth to deal with our ambition
In John 17:17-23 we see that sanctification issues in the genuine oneness because this sanctification keeps us in the Triune God
The four factors of division-worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and opinion-can be dealt with only by the sanctifying truth
It is impossible for worldly Christians, ambitious Christians, self-exalting Christians, or opinionated Christians to be one
The Lords recovery on the contrary is based upon the genuine oneness which we can have only by being sanctified through the word of truth
The fact that the Lord cares for the genuine oneness among His people is seen by the rather negative record in Matthew 18:15-17
Those who are rebellious or disobedient to the church are to be viewed by the church as outside the fellowship
Recently there have been some among us who have made divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which we have learned
Some divisive ones have said that if we turn away from them, we are not the church and do not have the oneness
They have been undermining the Lord's recovery and causing divisions; nevertheless, they expect the church to include them
The Greek word translated 'appetites' means belly or the entire physical cavity; it is a derivative of the word meaning hollow
Because we cannot tolerate division, we need to keep a watchful eye on those who are divisive and reject those who are sectarian
How we thank the Lord for the sanctifying word, the sanctifying Spirit, the sanctifying God, and the sanctifying truth
Worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and opinions and concepts are being put to death so that we can maintain the genuine oneness
In order to have the genuine oneness, we need to be separated from worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and opinions and concepts
Chapters fourteen through sixteen are the last words of the Lord Jesus to His disciples before His betrayal and crucifixion
Just as the temple was the house of God, so the Lord's physical body was the house of God when the Lord was on earth
When the Lord Jesus was about to die, He told His disciples that He was going to prepare a place for them in the house of God
When we move out of ourselves and into the Father and into the Father's glory, we are one and are even perfected into one
Although some of us are gentle and meek because of our natural disposition, this does not mean that we are not ambitious or opinionated
To be sanctified is not merely to be separated from the world; it is to move out of ourselves and into the Triune God
If we do not move out of ourselves, we are wrong; for in the self there is worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and opinion
If you are troubled in this way because of your ambition, you should get into the Word right away and allow the Spirit to touch you
In 1928, at the beginning of the work in Shanghai, a certain brother who had been a postmaster became a co-worker
Not knowing what to do when he was first invited to a particular place to work for the Lord, he asked Brother Nee for advice
If we move out of ourselves into the Triune God and remain in Him, we shall regard ourselves as knowing nothing
In the Gospels they were in themselves, but in the Acts they had moved out of the self and into the Triune God
In John 14:6 the Lord said, 'I am the way, and the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me'
Although unbelievers can lodge only in themselves, we have a choice between dwelling in ourselves and dwelling in the Triune God
The Lord said that after He prepared a place for us in the Father's house, He would come to receive us into that place
Now that the place has been prepared for us in the Father, we can move into Him by being sanctified through the truth
To have the genuine oneness, we must firstly move out of ourselves and into the Triune God; secondly, we must allow the Lord to live in us
Blame yourself for not moving out of yourself and into the Triune God and for not allowing Christ to live in you
The glory which the Father has given the Son is the sonship with the Father's life and divine nature to express the Father in His fullness
Through His death and resurrection, the Lord has prepared a place for us in the Father and has opened the way for us to come into this place
After His resurrection, He began to bring us into the Father, that is, to move us out of ourselves and into the Father
We all need to experience this sanctification through the Word and the Spirit so that we may enter into the Father and into His glory
Before Babel, there was just one race; but after Babel, mankind was divided, and the many races came into existence
On the day of Pentecost the many races of divided mankind came together as one, not in creation, but in God's full redemption
In John 17:20 the Lord prayed not only for the disciples with Him at that time, but for all who would believe in Him through their word
In Acts 2 at least three thousand people were saved through the word of the Lord's disciples and they were truly one
It was with the first Babel that the God-created earth along with mankind fully became Satan's systematized world
In verse 15 the Lord prayed, 'I do not ask that You should take them out of the world, but that You should keep them from the evil one'
Although we cannot say that Satan is the world, we can say that Satan is the evil and that the world also is the evil
The entire world is the evil, and within this evil there are ambition, self-exaltation, and concepts and opinions
If these three things were removed from the world, the world would no longer be Babel, and there would no longer be divisions
Worldliness does not only involve superficial matters such as buying a certain style of clothing at a department store
Perhaps you have never before realized that the world includes your ambition, your self-exaltation, and your concepts
The entire world, including Christianity, is pernicious; it is full of the poison of ambition, self-exaltation, and concepts and opinions
The world is not merely certain modern fashions; it is ambition producing the self-exaltation that culminates in concepts
We are in the Triune God, where there is no ambition; and we are in the glorious expression of the Father, where there is no self-exaltation
Although we reject self-exaltation, we believe in our co-enthronement with our King to express our Father in His glory
We are not 'wolves' or 'donkeys'; we are 'lambs' and 'doves' who enjoy being in the Triune God and in the glory of the Father
If we remain in ourselves, we shall have the ambition that issues in the self-exaltation which is enthroned in our concepts
In addition to repentance we need to move out of ourselves and into the Triune God and remain in Him for the expression of the Fathers glory
In this portion of the Word, the Lord firstly gave a message to His disciples and then offered the prayer recorded in chapter seventeen
The Lord also said to Thomas, 'No one comes to the Father except through Me,' This reveals that the place is the Father
At the beginning of His prayer in chapter seventeen the Lord prayed Father the hour has come glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You
His divine element was confined in His humanity, just as God's shekinah glory was concealed within the tabernacle
To be in the Father is to have the life and nature of the Father and to be one with Him in that life and nature
When we are in the Father, we have the Father's life and nature; but when we are in the Father's glory, we express the Father
We have pointed out that, in a sense, prior to His death and resurrection, the Lord Jesus was not in the glory of the Father
Although we may have the confidence to say that we are in the Father, we may not have the boldness to say that we are in His glory
It is a basic concept in the New Testament that God's intention is to put us into Himself through the death and resurrection of Christ
We are not united to express God; however, we are one in God's expression, just as these fluorescent lamps are one in the shining of light
By being in the Father the disciples had the genuine oneness, but they still needed to be perfected in this oneness
The reason you may not have the boldness to say that you are in the glory of the Father is that you have not yet been perfected into one
To be perfected into one means to be rescued from worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and opinions and concepts
John 17:23 is a difficult verse to understand: 'I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one'
Recently, in one of the meetings in Anaheim, the saints were praying and sharing about the renewing of the mind
When the Son lives and moves in us with the Father living and moving in Him, we are rescued from opinions and are thereby perfected
Even among the Christians who seek the Lord, not many are truly living in the Father and in the Father's glory
The Lord's prayer in John 17 reveals that we need to be brought onward from being just in the Father to being in the Father's glory
According to the book of Acts, it is possible to be brought into the glory of the Father within a very short period of time
In the Gospels, the two sons of Zebedee, James and John, asked the Lord to give them a high position in the kingdom
The fact that the other ten disciples became indignant with them over this indicates that all twelve were competing for position
Without doubt, Peter, John, and the other early disciples could boldly testify that they were in the Father and in His glory
Oneness does not mean that we have the same concept or that we merely gather together without dissension or division
Of living in ourselves-in our goal, purpose, ambition, feeling, or concept-we should live in the Father and in His expression
The ark is a type of Christ with His two natures: the human nature typified by the acacia wood and the divine nature signified by the gold
We have pointed out that these materials were also used in making the boards for the building of God's dwelling place
If the gold had been taken away from the standing boards, leaving only the acacia wood, the boards would immediately have fallen down
The oneness of the standing boards of the tabernacle, or this oneness in the gold, symbolizes our oneness in the Triune God
By being overlaid with gold, the standing boards bore the glory of the gold, for the shining of the gold was their glory, their expression
The oneness of the fortyeight boards was not only in the gold signifying God but also in the shining of the gold signifying the glory of God
To prepare the wooden boards was not too difficult; however, to overlay these large boards was quite a difficult task
If the standing boards had been only gilded with gold, there would have been no gold for the rings that supported the weight of the boards
In order for the forty-eight heavy boards to be held together, they each had to be overlaid with a heavy layer of gold
When you see an unpleasant expression on the face of your husband or wife at the breakfast table, you are immediately offended
If you have been overlaid with a heavy layer of gold, you will not be offended, no matter how much unpleasantness you may have to face
Although you may have a certain amount of gold, the amount you have may not be enough to keep you in the genuine oneness
We have pointed out that according to the type of the standing boards of the tabernacle, our oneness is not in the wood, but in the gold
It does not seem to matter whether or not both are meek, both are rough, or one is meek and the other is rough
The picture of the standing boards in Exodus 26 clearly shows that the oneness of the boards is altogether in the gold
It is not an easy matter to acquire enough gold to thickly overlay a board of acacia wood fifteen feet long and twenty-seven inches wide
The fact that the tabernacle was built in the wilderness indicates that although it is impossible with man, it is possible with God
No matter whether we are meek or rough, slow or quick, proud or humble, educated or uneducated, we all have a problem with oneness
In no other portion of the Bible is the Triune God revealed in such a practical way as in chapter seventeen of John
Recently, some among us became dissenting, although they claimed to have seen the ground and to be for the Lord's recovery
In order for there to be the oneness among the standing boards of the tabernacle, every board had to have this portion
If we seriously consider the picture of the standing boards in Exodus 26, we shall be deeply impressed with how much we are short of God
We all need an adequate portion of God for the overlaying of the boards and the top portion of God for the rings that hold the uniting bars
The first 'in' indicates that we have been saved, whereas the second indicates that we are one in the expression of God
Because this is the case with many spiritual realities in the Bible, there are types depicting the details of them
Because the oneness revealed in John 17 is abstract and mysterious we cannot understand it adequately without the type in the book of Exodus
The tabernacle is a picture of the building up of the New Testament believers into God's dwelling place on earth
When these believers are put together, or, to use a New Testament term, are built up together, they become the dwelling place of God
In John 14 the Lord Jesus says that He and the Father will come to the one who loves Him and will make Their abode with him
If there is no oneness among the believers in Christ, how can there be any abode, any dwelling place, for God on earth today?
As we consider the picture of the tabernacle, we see both the details of this oneness and the steps by which we reach it
In the foregoing message, we pointed out that, in themselves, the forty-eight standing boards are separate from one another
The oneness among the standing boards is not in the boards themselves, but in the gold that overlays them, links them, and unites them
If the rings had been welded to the overlaying gold, they would not have been strong enough to bear the weight of the boards
We have something within us sealing us and testifying to us that we belong not to the world, but to the Father
If we go to a certain worldly place after we are saved, something within will tell us that we do not belong there
The five horizontal crossing bars were arranged in three lines, with the middle bar going from one end to the other
Above and below the middle bar were lines made up of two bars each, half as long as the middle bar, joined at the midpoint
On each vertical board there had to be at least one ring near the top, one at the middle, and one at the bottom
These three rings are the initial stage of our Christian life, and they indicate that the Christian life begins with the Triune God
We need the initial Spirit to spread throughout our being; that is, the initial gold must spread out in order to overlay us
In addition to admitting that we are poor in God, we should also learn to confess that we are poor in the oneness
When a board has been fully overlaid with gold, that is, with the Triune God, it is rich both in God and in the oneness
Even the Bible reveals that the church in this age may not be perfect; rather, it may have a number of defects
No matter what defects there may be, the ground of the church remains unique, and the church is still the church
All Christians have the initial Spirit, the three rings, but in many of them the gold has not spread because they lack transformation
They may still be involved with the four negative things implied in John 17: worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and opinion
Some people would refrain from expressing their opinion if they were in the presence of the president of the United States
Rather, it is to point out the actual situation among the saints throughout the centuries concerning the oneness
Although we have stressed oneness again and again, some who were once in the recovery still dared to damage the oneness
A particular part of our being cannot be reached by the overlaying gold until that part of us has truly been transformed
The reason there was no transformation was that in the experience of these dissenting ones there was no dealing of the cross
Only when we all have been transformed and overlaid with gold will it no longer be possible for there to be dissension among us
The oneness mentioned by the Lord in His prayer in John 17 is mysterious, for it is a oneness realized and practiced in the Triune God
Because these boards were built together to be the dwelling place of God, the tabernacle is a clear picture of the oneness in the Triune God
The third step was to make the uniting bars, which held the forty-eight boards together and brought them into oneness
By considering the picture of the tabernacle, we can have the proper understanding of the practical oneness for which the Lord Jesus prayed
We have pointed out that on each board there were the three rings signifying the Triune God, who is the sealing Spirit we have received
The golden nature of God will never overlay our fallen nature, but will overlay only our regenerated and transformed nature
By reading the Word we have come to see that this precious substance is the divine nature added to us with God the Spirit
Although we may have the initial Spirit and some experience of being overlaid with gold, we still need to go on to the uniting Spirit
There were three sets with five bars in each set, each set was arranged in three lines, and on each standing board there were three rings
What does it mean to say that the uniting Spirit has humanity, typified by acacia wood, overlaid with divinity, typified by gold?
We must keep the oneness of the Spirit by having lowliness, meekness, and longsuffering and by bearing one another in love
Lowliness, meekness, longsuffering, and the bearing love are all human virtues signified by the acacia wood within the uniting bars
In other words, it is difficult to determine whether the Greek word refers to the Holy Spirit or to the human spirit
Whether or not the uniting Spirit can actually join us into one depends on whether or not we are willing to cooperate with this Spirit
You may be standing firmly for the Lord's testimony as one of the boards, but are you willing to be crossed by the Spirit?
They will not have the uniting bond of peace until their spirits are willing to go along with the crossing Spirit
The uniting bars are the mingled spirit, the divine Spirit mingled with the human spirit to become the uniting bond of peace
If you have this willingness, you will immediately and spontaneously have the uniting bars, and you will experience the practical oneness
The uniting Spirit crosses through all the members of the Body when the spirits of the members are willing to be crossed by Him
If you consider the picture of the tabernacle in the light of John 17, you will see the truth concerning oneness
