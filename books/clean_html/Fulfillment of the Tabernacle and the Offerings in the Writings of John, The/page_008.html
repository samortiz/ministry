<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER Two</h1><h1 class=msg>THE WORD, THE TABERNACLE, THE LAMB OF GOD, THE DOVE, THE STONE,  AND THE HOUSE OF GOD</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 1:1-2, 14, 29, 36, 32, 42, 51</h1><p>In the following two messages we shall consider in some detail the extract of chapter one of John as seen in the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God. We shall consider in particular the significance of these six signs. In this message we shall give a preliminary word regarding the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God. Our focus here will be on the meaning of the Word in John 1:1.<p>From the time I began to study the Bible as a youth, I have been trying to find out the definition of the Word in John 1:1. Although I have read some excellent books on this matter, nothing I have read concerning this has been fully satisfying to me. Some expositors and Bible teachers say that the Word in John 1:1 refers to the concept of the Logos in Greek philosophy. According to these writings, the Logos was a basic element or substance in Greek philosophical thinking. One book I read recently says that the Logos involves the inner conception plus the outward expression. According to this understanding of the Word, the Logos, first there is the inner conception. When this conception is uttered, there is the outward expression. Therefore, according to this interpretation, the inner conception plus the outward expression equals the Word, the Logos.<p>This definition of the Word in John 1:1 is not adequate. Deep within me there is still the desire to know what this term means in the divine revelation, in the Bible. Therefore, I have been exercising my inner being and looking to the Lord that He would give us the proper understanding of the Word in John 1:1.<h2 class=head1>INTERPRETING THE BIBLE BY THE BIBLE</h2><p>When I was young, I was taught some basic things that have been helpful through the years in my study of the Bible. One of these basic matters is that we should interpret the Bible by the Bible. According to this principle, a particular verse in the holy Word requires the rest of the Bible to define it. This means that the entire Bible is the full, whole, complete, and perfect definition of any word or term used in the Bible. For more than fifty years, I have been keeping this principle in my reading and study of the Word of God. I cannot deny that I have been helped by consulting reference books and expositions. Nevertheless, even after receiving help from such books, there is still the hunger and the thirst to know the real significance, the proper connotation, of the different terms in the Bible. Therefore, after studying the writings of others, I have always had to come back to the principle of interpreting any verse in the Bible by the entire Bible itself.<h2 class=head1>THE LIVING WORD AND THE WRITTEN WORD</h2><p>Recently I began to receive light from the Lord according to His entire divine revelation concerning the real significance of the Word in John 1:1. Many years ago I learned that Christ is the living Word and that the Bible is the written Word. Actually, these are not two words. The living Word and the written Word are one and correspond to each other. Although I knew this, I did not apply this understanding to the Word in John 1:1. Now I see that the Word in John 1:1 involves the written Word with the living Word as its reality.<p>In order to have the proper understanding of the Word in John 1:1, we need to come to the Bible and see what the Word refers to in the holy Scriptures. If we do this we shall see that first it refers to Christ as the living Word. This living Word needs a written Word. Without the written Word, we are not able to apprehend the living Word. We need a book, the Bible, to define and explain the living Person of Christ. Christ, the universal Person, is the living Word of God, and the Bible is the written Word. The Bible is the Book of books, and Christ is the Person. The Book is the definition of the Person. The written Word, the Bible, is the definition of the living Word, the living Person of Christ. This is the living Word with the written Word.
