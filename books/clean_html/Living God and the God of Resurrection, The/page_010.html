<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING THE CREATING GOD<br />
AND THE JUDGING GOD</h2>
<p>God is the creating God and the judging God not only to human beings in general but also in the personal experience of the believers. In every believer He is first the creating God. He created the situation for us to hear and to obey the gospel and to be saved by grace. After we are saved by grace, He continues to work in us and in our environment so that our hearts would incline toward Him and love Him, thereby enabling us to set our hearts to follow Him and to fully offer ourselves to Him. The creating God initiates and creates every detail in the process of His giving us grace.</p>
<p>After giving us initial grace, He goes on to reveal, to manifest, the various aspects of His person so that we can receive grace according to the various aspects of what He is. He wants us to know Him as the mighty God, whose power transcends all things. He wants us to know Him as the living God; hence, we should not follow doctrine, but we should experience and express Him as the living God. He wants us to know Him as the God who hides Himself. He seems to turn a deaf ear to the corruption and evil on earth and to the things that contradict and offend Him, but He tries those who fear Him. He wants us to know Him as the living God who makes all things manifest in time. He manifests His light so that we may know Him as the God of light. He manifests His holiness so that we may experience Him as the holy God. He makes His various attributes known to us, such as His lovingkindness and His long-suffering. He also makes Himself known to us as the God of resurrection. It was not possible for death to hold Him, Hades could not overcome Him, and He destroyed the devil, who has the might of death (Heb. 2:14). As the God of resurrection, He wants to live in us as resurrection (John 14:19-20) and be mingled with us. Finally, God wants us to know Him as the judging God who executes judgment in the church and in the individual believers. After we are saved, we will gradually begin to know and experience God according to His characteristics, His attributes.</p>
<p>Both church history and our personal experience show that God works in His saints as the creating God, the revealing God, and the judging God. His work of creation within the believers begins their life of grace. Then He gradually reveals the kind of God that He is so that they may experience His various aspects. Furthermore, He judges. His judging always follows a revelation of Himself. After one cycle is completed, He begins anew to create, give grace, manifest Himself, and judge. After the completion of a cycle, God brings in another beginning. This is how the divine life grows in the churches and in the believers. Every new cycle begins with God&rsquo;s creation and ends with His judgment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REVERENCE AND GODLINESS</h2>
<p>God creates, gives grace, and judges so that His people can serve Him in reverence and godliness, according to His pleasure. Reverence is the fear of offending God, that is, of having anything that offends, opposes, or provokes God, such as sin, the world, the flesh, pride, and the will of man. Godliness is to be mingled with God in our daily life and in our service so that God is lived out of us. Reverence and godliness are two aspects of a life that every believer should have. Reverence rejects anything other than God, and godliness is God mingling with every part of our being so that we may be filled with God and be like God in order to express God. God&rsquo;s plan in the universe can be accomplished only by our living a life of reverence and godliness.</p>
<p>Our problem is that in our daily living we do not revere God nor do we express godliness. We are often loose, without restraint; we let the world usurp God&rsquo;s place within us, and we live by the flesh and the self. We often set God aside; hence, we are short of being mingled with God, and we cut off the way to receive grace. This is the reason that God judges us. God&rsquo;s judging is a purging that removes our irreverence and ungodliness. His judging also shakes everything that can be shaken within us, including the world, the flesh, the self, and the natural man.</p>
<p>God uses various means to judge and purge His people. Sometimes He allows us to suffer from sickness or poor health. Sometimes He lets our business fail, or He may allow troubles to arise in our family. Examples of God&rsquo;s judging are beyond enumeration. Before God stretches forth His hand of judgment, we live in peace and security, seemingly serving God, but in reality there is not much reverence and dependence on Him. Although we are for Him, we also are full of the self. Once His judging hand comes upon us, all our excuses and wrong concepts fall away. When we are subdued under His hand, we will abhor the self.</p>
<p>I had a schoolmate who loved the Lord and was reverent, godly, and blessed by God. Later, he became wealthy and lived an affluent life, but his heart toward the Lord became cold. Eventually, he stopped attending the meetings. When several brothers visited him, he was not aware of his condition and even justified his actions. One day he was captured by the Japanese military government and suffered much in prison. After his release he asked the brothers to pray that the Lord would forgive him, because he had failed the Lord&rsquo;s grace. He also confessed his sins with much weeping. This was God&rsquo;s judgment upon him in order to give him a new beginning. After this experience he and his whole household once again attended the meetings and resumed their service. This example shows that God not only gives us grace; He also judges us. When His grace is blocked from reaching us, He clears up the blockage by judging us so that we may receive more grace.</p>
<p>Only a person who has fallen short of God&rsquo;s grace and has been judged by God knows the meaning of reverence and godliness. Such a person does not have excuses or wrong concepts. Those who have not been judged do not know reverence or godliness and have many wrong concepts. A believer who is full of arguments, murmurings, excuses, and wrong concepts does not know reverence or godliness. He has not passed through God&rsquo;s judging hand, and he is short of grace. If God has mercy on him, he will be judged by God. God shakes everything that is incompatible with His nature so that His children can serve Him with reverence and godliness.</p>
