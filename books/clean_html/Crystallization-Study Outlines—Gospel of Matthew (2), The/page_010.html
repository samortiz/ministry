<li>For life, we need oil, the Spirit of God, even His filling, that we may be enabled to live the virgin life for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony&mdash;Matt. 25:4, 9-10:

<li>For service, for work, we need the talent, the spiritual gift, that we may be equipped as a good slave to accomplish what the Lord intends to accomplish&mdash; Matt. 25:20-23:

	<li>Our inward motive for serving the Lord is our love for Him&mdash;Exo. 21:5.</li>

				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Before coming to the meeting, we should prepare ourselves for the meeting with something of the Lord, either through our experience of Him or through our enjoyment of His word and fellowship with Him in prayer.</li>
				<li>2) After coming into the meeting, we need not wait, and should not wait, for inspiration; we should exercise our spirit and use our trained mind to function in presenting what we have prepared to the Lord for His glory and satisfaction and to the attendants for their benefit&mdash;their enlightenment, nourishment, and building up.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>
