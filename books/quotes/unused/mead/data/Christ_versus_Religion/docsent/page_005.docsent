   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BRIDEGROOM VERSUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>RELIGIOUS CONCEPT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we see the religious concept.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do not blame those Jewish people; we must blame ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have all become religious.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are still to some extent under religion's influence.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are talking about fasting and praying, while the Lord Jesus is saying, "Can the children of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus is not speaking in doctrines or religious rituals, but pointing to Himself as the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our God, our Creator, our Redeemer, our Lord and Master today is a Bride groom to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must all drop the religious concept and take up something new.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I cannot force you, but I would ask you from this day to contact the Lord again and again with the sense that He is your Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Would you?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is not much need to pray in the old religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am afraid that when you forget God, you just forget Him; then, whenever you turn back to Him, you immediately pray in that old way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is so easy to pray like that.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when you pray in the way of appreciating the Lord, it is entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not think this is my teaching; it is the Lord's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord is going to recover it, and He is doing it now.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must have a change.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Repent!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Change your concept!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Be buried!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Enjoy Jesus as the Bridegroom!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many times in my room by myself I have really become excited.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord is so much to me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is so good, so wonderful, far beyond what I can express.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is the Bridegroom!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bridegroom is with us we have His presence!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We not only have the presence of the Almighty God, but the presence of the Bridegroom, the most pleasant person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is so precious and so lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus must be like this to us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the matter of love, none of us keep any formalities or rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we really love someone, we drop all the forms.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If not, our love is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, since Jesus is our Bridegroom, we must drop all our rituals and formalities.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE BRIDEGROOM'S PRESENCE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need our concept radically changed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we come to our meetings, the church meetings, we are coming to meet the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever we come together, we are coming to be with our Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His presence means everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As long as He is with us, we need no regulations, no rituals, no doctrines or forms.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Why does Christianity today need so many doctrines, forms, rituals, and regulations?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because they have lost the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In a wedding we have the presence of the bridegroom, but in a funeral we have lost the presence of a dear one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Christianity people have lost the presence of the dear One, so there is no excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But we have the presence of our Bridegroom, and His presence is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How could we help but be excited?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to shout, we have to be exceedingly joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Bridegroom is with us Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>CHILDREN OF THE BRIDECHAMBER</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Bible not only tells us that the Lord Jesus is our Bridegroom, but that as such a Person to us we are four kinds of people to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Matthew and Luke tell us that He is the Bridegroom, and we are the children of the bride chamber.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are the people who are with the Bridegroom in His chamber.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We love the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this sense, we are not the bride, but we are the children of the bridechamber.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We gaze upon the Bridegroom; His presence is so good and pleasant to us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You see, the children of the bridechamber are certainly unlike those in the mortuary.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are not in a mortuary; we are in the bridechamber.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are fellows of the Bridegroom in the bridechamber.</S>
