The Third Proof</H2><P>Matthew 28:20 says, "Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age." Please note that it is the end of the age, not the end of the world. The Lord said, "I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age." Let me ask you. If the whole church is raptured before the tribulation, then would the length of the time for the Lord to be with the church be at least three and a half years shorter? Of course, I am not saying that this is a big proof, but I am saying that this is a small proof.</P><P>Acts 2:34-35 says, "The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I set Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet." The Lord will wait until the foes of Christ become the footstool of Christ. We know that this is at the end of the great tribulation. God will destroy those Gentiles who have destroyed the world and will give the authority to Christ. Then the enemies will become Christ's footstool. God says, "Until I set Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet." But our friends say that Christ has left the Father's throne even before God has made His enemies His footstool. It seems as if they are saying that Christ cannot wait. This point is also a small clue.</P><P>Furthermore, no one who studies Revelation carefully can ever say that Christ would leave the throne and come to the air before the tribulation. There is no such record in Revelation. I have never seen it. If indeed Christ comes to the air before the tribulation, how could Revelation forget to record this matter which is the center of the prophecy? Revelation 14:1-5 speaks of the firstfruits. Verses 6 through 13 speak of the tribulation. Verses 14 through 15 speak of Christ's coming to the air. In other words, Christ's coming to the air to receive the saints takes place after Revelation 6-12. From this we can see that the rapture of the saints occurs after the great tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN BELIEVING<br>THAT THE ENTIRE CHURCH WILL PASS<br>THROUGH THE TRIBULATION</H2><P>Does this mean that the entire church will pass through the tribulation? According to the Bible, there is no mention that the entire church will be raptured before the tribulation. One brother received a letter from a friend which said that whoever believes that the entire church will be raptured before the tribulation has someone else reading the Bible for him. This means that he believes whatever others say without investigating it. The Bible does not say that the entire church will be raptured before the tribulation. Does the Bible say that the entire church will be raptured after the tribulation? No, it does not say that either. The Bible does say that among the ones who have been saved and born again, a small number will be raptured before the tribulation, whereas the majority will be raptured after the tribulation.</P><P>Those who say that the entire church will be raptured after the tribulation have the following fundamental errors.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Watching and Waiting Becoming Meaningless</H2><P>Those who hold the concept that the entire church will pass through the tribulation cannot watch and be prepared for the Lord Jesus. Since they know that before the rapture there must be three and a half years of tribulation, there is no need for them to be prepared or to be watchful. Furthermore, since they know they have to wait three and a half years before Christ would come, it is not too late to delay watching until even three or five months before the end of the three and a half years. But the Bible tells us to watch always, to pray unceasingly, and to be ready for the Lord's coming back. If the entire church will pass through the tribulation, one could begin to get ready a few days before the end of the three and a half years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Not Waiting for the Lord but for the Antichrist</H2><P>If the entire church passes through the tribulation, our living on the earth will not be filled with waiting for Christ but for Antichrist. Daily we will only need to look and see if Antichrist has come. Thus, our eyes will be on the surroundings instead of looking above. This is contrary to the teaching of the Bible, for the Bible does not tell us to wait for Antichrist, but to wait for the Lord.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> </body></html>
