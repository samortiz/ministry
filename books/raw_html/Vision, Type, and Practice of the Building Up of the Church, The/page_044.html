        <h2 class="head1">LOVE BEING GOD ENJOYED AND TOUCHED BY MAN</h2>
<p>All the words in the Bible are intended for man&rsquo;s understanding. But our problem is that we might not have the proper understanding of what God says in the Bible. For example, our understanding of faith might not be the same as what God says in the Bible concerning faith. Likewise, our understanding of love might not be the same as what God says in the Bible concerning love. Christians often talk about faith, but many misunderstand what the Bible says concerning faith. Likewise, love is a favorite subject among Christians, but many misunderstand what the Bible says concerning love. For example, Ephesians 3:17 says that we need to be rooted and grounded in love, and 4:16 says that the church will build itself up in love. Many people understand these verses to mean that we need to love one another in the church so that we may be built up together. Such an understanding seems appropriate, but it is a natural understanding.</p>
<p>If asked what chapters 3 and 4 say concerning love, some people might answer, &ldquo;God is love.&rdquo; Although this is true, these chapters go a step further to show that love is God in the Son to be enjoyed by us. Grace is God being gained by us. Grace does not refer to general blessings, such as peace or benefits that God gives to man. Rather, grace is God Himself being gained by man. If we gain God as the Spirit, the divine life, and the divine nature, then we have received grace. After we receive grace and are brought back to God, we will realize that He is love. Both grace and love are God. God is grace, and He is also love. When God comes forth to reach man and to be gained by man, He is grace. When man returns to God in order to enjoy God, man touches love. Grace is God manifested; love is God touched. The Gospel of John speaks of God becoming flesh in order to reach man and be gained by man and therefore emphasizes grace (1:14, 16-17). First John speaks of man receiving grace and by this grace having fellowship with God, touching God, and entering into God; therefore, 1 John emphasizes love (4:8, 16). The source of grace is love, and when love proceeds out of God, it is grace. Hence, we need to see that love is deeper than grace. If as children of God we know only grace, we are still shallow. We must go deeper by entering into God and enjoying Him as love.</p>
<p>Thus, the word <em>love</em> in <em>rooted and grounded in love</em> and in <em>building up of itself in love</em> does not refer to our own love but to God in the Son being contacted, enjoyed, experienced, and touched by us. We are not only forgiven of our sins to gain life, receive salvation, and become persons of God; we must also enter into God, fellowship with Him, and touch Him. Then we will sense that Christ is making His home in our hearts. After regeneration Christ lives in our spirit, but Ephesians 3 says that Christ is making His home in our hearts (v. 17). Since the heart includes the soul as well as the conscience of the spirit, the heart is an organ that links the spirit with the soul. Therefore, although Christ lives in our spirit, He can touch our emotions, a part of our soul, so that we feel love and sweetness. We can experience Christ in such a way that we sense Him as our sweet and lovely Lord; He is our enjoyment and our love. There is an indescribable sweetness in our emotion that we sense as we enter into God and have fellowship with Him.</p>
<p>The more we live in God, touch Him, and fellowship with Him in the sweet feeling of our emotion, the more we will be rooted and grounded in love; in other words, we will be saturated with love. This can be likened to putting a handkerchief in water. The handkerchief will be soaked with water. When we fellowship with God and are saturated with Him in such a way that He can touch our emotions and cause us to enjoy His sweetness, we are touching the love of God. Therefore, being rooted and grounded in love means that we are fully immersed in the divine love. At this point, it will be impossible for us to hate, condemn, or murmur against others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LOVE OF GOD BEING UNLIMITED</h2>
<p>When we are immersed in God&rsquo;s love in such a way, we will sense that this love is indescribable; it is like the breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe. When the apostle came to this point in his Epistle, he could not find a suitable word to describe such a love, so he had to use these four words. The love of God is boundless, unlimited, and immeasurable. How broad is the breadth? How long is the length? How high is the height? How deep is the depth? No one can answer these questions. The apostle used these four immeasurable terms&mdash;<em>breadth, length, height,</em> and <em>depth</em>&mdash;to describe the love of God.</p>
<p>When we enter into God and touch His love, we will discover that His love is unlimited. The Bible tells us to love our enemies (Matt. 5:44; Luke 6:35). Loving our enemies requires the unlimited love of God. If we have received the unlimited love of God, it will not be difficult for us to love our enemies. Our own love is inadequate to love our parents, spouse, and children, not to mention our enemies. Our human love is limited, but the love of God is unlimited. If we enter into God to enjoy Him and touch the love of God, we will love our enemies. When we are saturated with the love of God, we will only be able to love others.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
