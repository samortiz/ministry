   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Roasted with Fire</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 12:8 the children of Israel were given the proper way to eat the flesh of the Passover lamb: roasted with fire.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Fire here signifies God's holy wrath exercised in judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Christ was on the cross, the holy fire of God judged Him and consumed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Psalm 22:14 and 15 say, "My heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then He cried, "I thirst" John 19:28 , because He was being burned by the holy fire of God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not Raw</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 12:9 the children of Israel were charged not to eat of the lamb raw.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today those who do not believe in Christ's redemption attempt to eat Him "raw."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that they regard Christ as a model or example of human living for them to imitate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In effect, to do this is to eat the Passover lamb raw.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not Boiled with Water</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, the children of Israel were not to eat the lamb boiled with water 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To eat of Christ as if He were "boiled with water" is to regard His death on the cross, not as death for redemption, but as martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many today do not believe that Christ died as the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to their concept, He was persecuted by man and died as a martyr, having sacrificed Himself for His teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To apply Christ's death in this way is to eat the lamb boiled with water.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be boiled in water is to undergo suffering, but not the suffering of holy fire.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, this suffering is simply the suffering of persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As fundamental Christians, we believe that on the cross Christ suffered for us under God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was burned and "roasted" by the holy fire of God's wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As our Redeemer, He was judged for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is to take Christ roasted with fire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the proper way ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A second way, advocated by modernists, is to take Christ "raw."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is to take Christ as an example and to imitate the way He behaved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The third way is to take Christ "boiled."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is to regard Christ's death on the cross as persecution and martyrdom, not as death for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How do you take Christ roasted, raw, or boiled?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you believe that Christ died on the cross as a martyr because of man's persecution, then you eat the Passover lamb by boiling it in water.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, if you believe that He died as our Redeemer, being roasted by the holy fire of God, then you eat Him as the Passover lamb roasted in fire.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With Its Head, Legs, and Inwards</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The children of Israel were to eat the lamb with its head, legs, and inwards 12:9, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The head signifies wisdom, the legs signify activity and move, and the inwards signify the various inward parts of Christ's being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To eat the Passover lamb with the head, legs, and inwards is to take Christ as a whole, in His entirety.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we eat Him, we take His wisdom, activities, move, and inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>With Unleavened Bread and Bitter Herbs</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to 12:8, the children of Israel were to eat the flesh of the lamb with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To eat with unleavened bread means to eliminate all sinful things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we enjoy Christ as our Passover, we must purge away everything sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At the same time, we need to eat bitter herbs.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that we need to regret and repent. to experience a hitter taste regarding sinful things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, many of us received Him as our life supply and also gave up everything sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the same time, we experienced regret and repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This indicates that we ate Christ with bitter herbs.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not take the lamb without the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whenever you receive Christ as your supply, you receive a life without sin, without leaven, that gives you a bitter feeling when you sin, that repents when you make a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This life is sensitive to sin, to any kind of wrongdoing, to anything of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To keep yourself unleavened, you have to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>With Nothing Left until Morning</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Exodus 12:10 says, "And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nothing of the Passover lamb was to be left until morning.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This indicates that we are to receive Christ in a full way, not partially.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not allow anything of Christ to be left over.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, take Him in full.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Its Bones Not Broken</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Exodus 12:46 says that the children of Israel were not to break any of the bones of the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When Christ was crucified as our Passover lamb, His legs were not broken John 19:33, 36 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The fact that Christ's legs were not broken signifies that in Christ, the Passover lamb, there is something unbreakable and indestructible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This unbreakable and indestructible element is His eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Roman soldiers and Jewish people could come together to put Christ on the cross, but they could not break His eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We can prove from the Scriptures that the bone signifies life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>According to Genesis 2:21, the Lord took a bone, a rib, out of Adam and built it into a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The woman, Eve, was produced from a bone taken out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hence, a bone signifies life that imparts life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The bone taken out of Adam imparted Adam's life into Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the same principle, Christ's unbroken bone signifies His unbreakable and indestructible eternal life that imparts His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In Christ as our Passover lamb there is such an unbreakable and indestructible life that can impart life into us.</S>
