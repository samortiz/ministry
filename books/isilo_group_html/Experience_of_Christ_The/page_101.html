Thus, Paul besought Euodias and Syntyche, two of his co-workers in the gospel, to think the same thing. It is possible that one of the sisters was in favor of Judaism. Whether or not this was so, the fact remains that they were not thinking the one thing. According to the first chapter of Philippians, there was envy and rivalry even in the preaching of the gospel (vv. 15-16). Surely this was an indication that some were not thinking the one thing. This is the reason that in chapter two Paul asked the saints in Philippi to make his joy full. If there was any fellowship in spirit, any comfort of love, any compassion and mercy, they were to make Paul's joy full. He wanted them to make his joy full by thinking the same thing, having the same love, and being one in soul.</P><P>We all need to learn to think the one thing, that is, to be occupied with pursuing Christ. We should not be concerned about foot-washing, head covering, speaking in tongues, or any other such matters. Let us leave these things alone and think about the experience and enjoyment of Christ. We need to pray, "Lord, teach me how to persecute You. I don't care for so many other things. I only care to pursue You." Do not be troubled by things such as the playing of a tambourine in the meetings. Playing a tambourine is not our goal, prize, or enjoyment. Our enjoyment, experience, goal, and prize are Christ. If others want to play the tambourine, I shall not oppose it. After they play the tambourine for a certain period of time, there will eventually be an opportunity for me to share Christ with them. This illustrates the fact that we must all learn that for us there is simply one thing: Christ as our experience, enjoyment, goal, and prize. We do not insist on anything, and we do not oppose anything. If we take this way, we shall maintain a good spirit in the churches for the experience and enjoyment of Christ.</P><P>We need to honor Christ and allow Him to do everything. Do not persecute Christ regarding things such as speaking in tongues, foot-washing, or playing the tambourine. Instead, persecute Him until He becomes your experience. We need to say, "Lord, it is not up to me whether or not Your people speak in tongues. Lord, I persecute You so that You will be my experience. Lord, when the opportunity comes in the meeting, I would like to share with Your saints something concerning my experience of You." This is the only thing we need to do. Let us all do the same thing and think the one thing. Do not have any other consideration, and do not be bothered by all the different practices. There is only one thing for us to do: pursue Christ and let Him become our experience, enjoyment, goal, and prize.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_100.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_102.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Experience of Christ &nbsp; pg 101</div><br></body></html>
