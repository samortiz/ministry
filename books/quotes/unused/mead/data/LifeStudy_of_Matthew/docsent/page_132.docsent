   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE THE ESTABLISHMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE KING S REJECTION 2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that Matthew is a book concerned with the doctrine of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In his Gospel Matthew does not give us a record of history; he takes the facts of history and puts them together to reveal the doctrine of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus far, we have seen that Christ was born, was anointed, was tested, began His ministry, drew a crowd, decreed the heavenly constitution, and continued His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His ministry produced the environment that enabled Him to reveal Himself in many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, His ministry caused Him to be fully rejected by that evil generation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have also seen that the Lord called the laboring and burdened ones to come to Him for rest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He showed them that the way to rest is to break the regulations of religion and to care for the Head and for the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is through all this that the kingdom of the heavens is established on earth among men.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We all need to be impressed with such a clear view.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now we must see that in order for the kingdom of the heavens to be established, there is the need of a spiritual battle, of spiritual fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This fighting is implied in 12:22-37.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the establishment of the kingdom a fight is raging on.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although we have covered many things, we have not yet seen that the establishment of the kingdom requires spiritual fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As Christ, the heavenly King, was establishing the heavenly kingdom among men on earth, He was fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>People, however, did not see this warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They saw what He did outwardly, but they did not realize what was taking place inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, Matthew selected another historical fact to point out the fighting that was going on as the King was establishing the heavenly kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>CLIMAX OF REJECTION</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the time of 12:22-37 the Lord s ministry was no longer so public.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead of carrying out His ministry publicly, He did so in a rather cautious, calm way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, what the Lord did in verse 22 in healing a man possessed by a demon was a fact of history and could not be concealed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A. A Person Possessed by a Demon</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brought to the Heavenly King</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>and the King Healing Him</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 22 says, Then there was brought to Him one possessed by a demon, blind and dumb; and He healed him, so that the dumb man spoke and saw.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A blind and dumb man signifies one who has no sight to see God and spiritual things; thus he is unable to praise God and speak for God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the real condition of all fallen people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a man was brought to the King, the King cast out the demon, and the man was able to see and to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He uttered what he saw.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This undoubtedly was a miracle and a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the Old Testament there is no record of a blind man miraculously receiving his sight.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For a blind man to receive his sight is a great sign.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>B. All the Crowds Being Amazed</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>and Wondering That the King</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Is the Son of David</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 23 says, And all the crowds were amazed and said, Is this not the Son of David?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The miracle performed in healing the blind and dumb person amazed the crowds, and they said, Is this not the Son of David?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was the recognizing of Christ as their Messiah, their King.</S>
