<h1 class="title">THE TRIUNE GOD DWELLING IN THE BELIEVERS AS THEIR LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:6; John 14:20; 15:5; 14:17; Rom. 8:11; John 14:23; Gal. 2:20; Rom. 8:2; Gal. 5:25; Rom. 8:4; 1 Cor. 6:17</h1>
<p>Before we fellowship concerning the proper way for believers to meet and to serve, we must consider how the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is life to the believers. Without the Triune God as life, the believers have no way to meet or to serve. The Triune God being life to the believers is the greatest topic in the New Testament, and the way for believers to meet and to serve is a great matter in our practice of the new way. Christians have had different opinions and views concerning the way to meet and to serve. Hence, we must come back to the Bible and see what is revealed in it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOSPEL AND SALVATION</h2>
<p>Religions teach man to fear God and adjust his behavior according to his fear of God. The philosophy of Confucius and Mencius teaches moral principles that require people to practice self-cultivation in their character and relationships. Such principles become the standard for their human living. However, as far as the Christian life is concerned, our living, our meeting, and our serving are not governed by religion or by moral teachings. Our meeting and serving depend on the Triune God in whom we believe and who has come to be our life.</p>
<p>How does the gospel and salvation differ from religion and philosophy? Religion teaches people about a God who is outside of man. What is taught in religion concerning God is erroneous and false. Judaism and Islam both speak of the one true God who created the universe, but their God is outside of man. He is high above in the heavens and deserves to be obeyed and worshipped by all men. According the New Testament, however, the God whom Christians worship is not only the Creator and the sovereign Lord of the universe. He has regenerated us, His believers, and has entered into us to be our life. He does not want to be the Lord who is merely worshipped, feared, and served outwardly by us. Rather, He wants to enter into us to be our life and be joined and mingled with us so that He can be one with us. This far exceeds the general teaching in religion.</p>
<p>Although we are fallen descendants of Adam, we all have a desire to do good. Whether we can do good is another matter. We consider that honoring our parents is good, commendable, and something to be proud of, but most of the time we fail, just as Paul says, &ldquo;To will is present with me, but to work out the good is not&rdquo; (Rom. 7:18). No one likes to steal; everyone thinks that stealing is a shame. Everyone likes to be proper and decent. We would prefer to give to others and to help them, rather than to steal. Everyone has the desire to do good, but no one has the ability to carry out this desire. The highest goal of religion and philosophy is to stir up within man the desire to do good.</p>
<p>The gospel and salvation are neither religion nor philosophy; they are God Himself. God is not content with being outside of us. He desires to enter into us. The New Testament reveals that the deepest part of our being is our spirit. Man is of three parts: a spirit, a soul, and a body (1 Thes. 5:23). Everyone has a physical body, which the Bible calls the outer man (2 Cor. 4:16). Our physical body is for us to contact the material world. Within our body is our psychological being, which the Bible refers to as our soul. The functions of the soul include thinking and remembering, loving and hating, and making judgments and decisions. In addition to our body and our soul we also have a spirit, which is our deepest part. The pursuit of human life is to gain satisfaction in these three parts. Our body needs food and clothing. After we are fed and warm, our soul needs amusement. Pursuing knowledge, listening to music, and so forth, are for the satisfaction of our soul. Nevertheless, even after gaining such things, there is still a thirst, a longing, in man&rsquo;s deepest part, which is deeper than his body and his soul. This part is represented mainly by the conscience, which is a part of the human spirit.</p>
<p>Our spirit is the innermost part of our being. Only God can satisfy the longing in our spirit. As soon as we believe in the Lord Jesus, He enters into our spirit to be our satisfaction. God is Spirit, and we also have a spirit (John 4:24). Hence, these two spirits match each other and can respond to each other. The chorus of hymn #450 in the Chinese hymnal says, &ldquo;Spirit begets spirit.&rdquo; This means that God the Spirit enters into our spirit and gives birth to, or begets, our spirit. Formerly, our spirit was inactive, asleep, dormant, and deadened. However, when we believed in the Lord Jesus and were washed by His precious blood, the Spirit entered into our spirit to awaken and enliven our dormant and deadened spirit thereby regenerating our spirit (3:3-8).</p>
<p>After entering into us, the Spirit remains in us to be with our spirit and even becomes one spirit with us. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; As soon as we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were joined to Him and became one with Him. God is not only outside of us as our Lord for us to worship; He is the Spirit and has entered into our spirit to be joined to us and mingled with us as one spirit. He is in us as our life. From the day that we believed in the Lord, He has been living in us. Hence, as believers, we have our natural life and also the life that we received from God when we were regenerated. This life is the Spirit, and this life is God.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION BEING SUPERIOR TO<br />
RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation, which is God as our life, is far superior to religion and philosophy. A person who is not saved may be very proper in his conduct and in the way he deals with things. When he does a good deed, he is pleased with what he has done. He might say, &ldquo;I am charitable and honest. I may tell a little lie if necessary, but I would never tell a big lie. Not only so, I am humble and not boastful.&rdquo; Such a person does not know himself. It is easier for a person to lie and boast than it is to drink water and breathe air. A person can lie and not be conscious of the fact that he has sinned, and he can easily boast of his intelligence. Man is born with the ability to lie. The Bible says that man is born a liar because he is a child of the devil (John 8:44). Hence, man lies automatically. If a person raises his hand to say that he does not lie, his hand is lying.</p>
<p>When such a person hears the gospel and repents, his conscience is enlightened, and he realizes that he is sinful, proud, and full of lies. The conscience is an important part of the human spirit. The gospel of God speaks concerning sin, the law of God, and His righteousness in order to touch man&rsquo;s conscience. When man&rsquo;s conscience is touched, his spirit begins to operate. Before a person steals, he might think, &ldquo;There is an unbalanced distribution of wealth in society. The rich are very rich, and I have been poor for many years. Since the rich do not share their wealth with me, I will take it myself.&rdquo; This illustrates the functions of his soul: first, he likes money; second, he considers that it is reasonable to steal; and third, he decides to steal when the circumstance allows it. While he is having these thoughts, a voice deep within him says, &ldquo;Do not steal; it is not right to steal.&rdquo; This voice is his conscience in operation. If the desire in his soul is very strong and overpowers his conscience, he will steal. While he is stealing, he is afraid not only of the police but also of his conscience within him. Therefore, he must hide from the police and suppress the inner accusation of his conscience.</p>
<p>We thank the Lord that regardless of race and nationality, the law of good operates among mankind. A person who does something bad is afraid of the law of good. The God of this universe put the law of good in man. This law operates in man. This is the difference between humans and animals. A dog that does something bad, such as biting someone or stealing food, will not lose its sleep or its appetite, because it lacks the operation of the law of good. Only humans can have such a reaction, because only humans have the law of good within them. When my children were young, I would tell them not to play with water. They would nod their heads submissively, indicating that they would obey. However, the moment I stepped out of the room, they would play with water. When they heard me open the door, they would immediately hide their hands behind their backs because their conscience told them that they had done something wrong. Every person knows that it is wrong to steal, because the law of good is operating in man&rsquo;s conscience.</p>
<p>As a result of man&rsquo;s fall, the function of his conscience was weakened. A person senses the accusation of his conscience when he does something very bad, but he does not feel anything when he does something that is not so bad. A person might have considered himself a gentleman before he was saved; he was not disturbed that he told white lies. However, after hearing the gospel and being enlightened, his conscience is activated, and he repents and confesses his sins. Initially, he does not think that he has committed many sins, but the more he confesses, the more he realizes that his sins are numerous. This indicates that the function of his conscience has been uplifted. Many who believe in Jesus are brought to tears when they repent and confess their sins. After a person receives Jesus as his Savior, he has peace and joy within and is able to praise Him for dying on the cross for him and for shedding His precious blood for his cleansing. This new believer will not be able to tell a white lie when he is tempted by Satan, because a believer has not only a keen conscience within him but also the Lord, who does not lie and does not cooperate with telling lies. It is as if an invisible hand bridles his tongue, making it impossible for him to lie. Every believer has had such an experience. These experiences prove that he is saved. Those who have not had such an experience might not be saved. Actually, it is not a hand that bridles a believer&rsquo;s tongue; it is a living person, the Lord Jesus, who bridles his tongue. Such experiences prove that not only is a person&rsquo;s spirit enlivened when he is saved but that God enters into his enlivened spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD<br />
BEING LIFE IN THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>Both men and women buy things when they go shopping. There is a sister who, before being saved, would look for sales in the newspaper every Saturday and then go shopping. If she saw a nice yet inexpensive piece of fabric, she would buy it. The only thing that prohibited her from buying things was insufficient funds in her bank account. After she was saved, she still liked to read the sale advertisements on Saturdays and buy discounted items. However, she began to feel uneasy within while reading the advertisements and had to stop. Although she had an inner feeling not to go shopping, she somehow found herself on her way to the department store. At the store she would select a dress, but a voice within her would say, &ldquo;Put it down; do not buy it.&rdquo; She would argue with the voice, saying, &ldquo;This item is very nice. I must not miss this opportunity.&rdquo; But the inner voice would keep saying, &ldquo;Put it down; go home!&rdquo; Eventually, she would have to put the dress down and go home. Many sisters have had similar experiences. God dwells in us and causes all sorts of trouble. This tremendous matter proves that we are saved, that our spirit has been enlivened, and that the living God is living in us. This is an experience of God being life to His believers.</p>
<p>Philippians 2:13-14 says, &ldquo;It is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure. Do all things without murmurings and reasonings.&rdquo; This is how God&rsquo;s salvation differs from religion and philosophy. Neither exhortation nor endurance can cause a believer to refrain from murmuring and reasoning. It is possible for a believer to refrain from murmuring and reasoning because God is operating in him.</p>
<p>As long as we have a family, schoolmates, colleagues, or companions, it is not possible to escape arguments. A newlywed couple may not argue during the first two days of their honeymoon, but some couples quarrel within the first few hours after they are married. The longer they remain as a couple, the more competent they are at arguing. When they become parents, they have even more arguments with their children. Who can say that he has never murmured? Husbands murmur to their wives, wives murmur to their husbands, children murmur to their parents, and siblings murmur among themselves. It is impossible for a person to escape arguing and murmuring. A person who can restrain himself from lying is holy, a person who can restrain himself from arguing is holier, and a person who can restrain himself from murmuring is an angel. But such a person does not exist on earth. Everyone lies, argues, and murmurs. Moreover, people like not only to argue but also to reason. They do their best to argue and reason in order to justify themselves.</p>
<p>Although we are saved, the old man, who likes to reason, is still with us. Therefore, the more we argue, the more we think that we are right. However, the moment we begin to argue, a voice within us tells us to stop arguing and to confess and pray. This is God being our life and disapproving of our arguing. Many believers have had such experiences. These experiences are different from religion and philosophy.</p>
<p>Philosophy with its ethics is for self-improvement. A person who practices self-improvement might become better, but he is still a human being. A believer, however, can say, &ldquo;I am better, not because of myself but because the living God lives in me. I know that He lives in me because He prevents me from shopping, He prevents me from quarrelling with my spouse, and He prevents me from venting my anger. He is operating in me. The true and living God lives within me, and He is becoming one with me.&rdquo; This is a fact. We should respond and say, &ldquo;Amen! Hallelujah! God is living, and He is living in my spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do not think that since I can give this message, I do not get angry. However, when I want to voice my resentment, a voice within me says, &ldquo;Why are you angry? James 1:20 says that &lsquo;the wrath of man does not accomplish the righteousness of God&rsquo;&rdquo; I occasionally reason with God, saying, &ldquo;Even so, this person has made me angry. Lord, let me be angry just this time.&rdquo; But He says, &ldquo;Calm down and pray,&rdquo; and I have no choice but to kneel down and pray. Sometimes I am at a loss and can only say, &ldquo;Lord, I am really angry.&rdquo; This is a prayer. Do not think that such a prayer is poor. This kind of prayer can often lead me to be enlightened and repent to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, be merciful to me and forgive me. I need the cleansing of Your precious blood.&rdquo; After such a confession, the fellowship within is restored, and I am able to enjoy the Lord again.</p>
<p>Believers are very different from unbelievers because the living God has been added into the believers. When an unbeliever gets angry, his anger can last a week. Sometimes when an unbelieving couple quarrels, the husband and wife will not speak to one another for an entire week. However, when genuine believers get angry, they can calm themselves down quickly. This is what the Bible means when it says, &ldquo;Be angry, yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your indignation&rdquo; (Eph. 4:26). Once the sun sets, our anger should be dispelled. It is not easy to do this, but it is easy if we have the Lord. If we harbor some resentment, our anger will dissipate when we pray. Some Christians are short of grace, so it can take them six hours to calm down. Other Christians have more grace, so their anger dissipates quickly, and they can apologize to their spouse. Apologizing to our spouse is not as easy as apologizing to others. The brothers in particular need grace to humble themselves in order to apologize to their wife. This is an experience of God being our life.</p>
<p>As genuine Christians, we can do what ordinary people cannot do, we endure what ordinary people cannot endure, we can suffer hardships that ordinary people cannot suffer, and we can bear accusations that ordinary people cannot bear. This is because God is in us. When we read the four Gospels, we appreciate the living of the Lord Jesus. This same Jesus is living in us today. He is the Triune God living in us as our life. For this reason, He said, &ldquo;Learn from Me&rdquo; (Matt. 11:29). I would be foolish to tell a monkey, &ldquo;You should imitate me and learn of me.&rdquo; How can a monkey learn of a human? Monkeys have one life, and humans have another life. The Lord Jesus is not only our life; He also lives in us so that He may live out of us. This is the difference between believers and people in religion or philosophy. We do not try to cultivate or improve ourselves. Rather, we have the living God who created the universe and who died for us on the cross. He is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit so that we may live out His life. This is the distinctive feature of the believers.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that this distinctive feature has been neglected in Christianity. Preachers mainly tell people, &ldquo;You are sinful and have made mistakes, so you need Jesus. The heavenly Father loves you and has sent Jesus to be your Savior. If you believe in Him, you will be saved.&rdquo; After they lead people to believe in the Lord, they say, &ldquo;Because you have believed in the Lord, you should improve yourself and conduct yourself in a proper way; otherwise, you will not glorify God.&rdquo; This kind of speaking is not right, but we repeatedly have this same mistaken concept. We pray, &ldquo;Lord, I was wrong yesterday. I lost my temper, and I lied. I ask You to give me grace. Help me not to lose my temper with my wife and not to lie again. Lord, I want to be a new husband.&rdquo; Praying in this way is a huge mistake.</p>
<p>We must realize that making resolutions following repentance is futile. Our failures themselves prove that we are unable to fulfill our resolutions. Only the One who is in us is able. Therefore, instead of making resolutions, we should say, &ldquo;Lord, I made a grave mistake, and I can make the same mistake again. Only by Your life supplying and bearing me can I be delivered from making such a mistake. I am like a garment. Lord, put me on, and let me put You on as well and live You out.&rdquo; This is what the Bible means when it says that we are in the Lord and that the Lord is in us (John 15:4-5). When we are in the Lord, we have put on the Lord, and when the Lord is in us, He has put us on. The Lord Jesus is the Spirit. When we were baptized into Him, we put Him on (Rom. 13:14; Gal. 3:27), and when He entered into our spirit, He put us on. Now He is our life to be expressed through us; that is, He lives Himself out of us. This is what Paul says in Galatians 2:20: &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD AS LIFE<br />
BEING THE QUALIFICATION FOR<br />
THE BELIEVERS TO MEET AND TO SERVE</h2>
<p>The characteristic of Christians is that the Triune God has entered into us to regenerate us, and He is living in us as our life so that He can live out of us. Hence, we can meet and serve together. Christian meetings are not based on the Chinese life, on the American life, or on an individual life. Our meetings are based on the Triune God as life in us. This is also the basis of our service.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD DWELLING IN US AS OUR LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Father, the Son, and the Spirit<br />
Dwelling in Us</h2>
<p>Concerning the Triune God dwelling in us as life, we must see that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit dwell in us. This is neither a saying nor a doctrine; it is the clear revelation of the Bible. Ephesians 4:6 says, &ldquo;One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.&rdquo; The Father is over the believers, passes through the believers, and dwells, remains, in the believers. This proves that the Father dwells in us. John 14:20 says, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you,&rdquo; and 15:5 says, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him...&rdquo; Just as the branches abide in the vine, and the vine abides in the branches, so also the Son dwells in us and we in Him. Furthermore, 14:17 says, &ldquo;The Spirit of reality...abides with you and shall be in you,&rdquo; and Romans 8:11 says, &ldquo;He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life...through His Spirit who indwells you.&rdquo; These verses prove that the Spirit dwells in us.</p>
<p>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not three Gods; God is one. God the Father dwells in unapproachable light, God the Son came forth and was manifested among men, and God the Spirit reaches and enters into man. The Father is not separate from the Son, and the Son is not separate from the Spirit. Our spirit is the organ that we use to receive God. In order to receive something, we must use the proper organ. Our stomach is the organ for receiving food, our ears are for receiving sound, and our eyes are for receiving light and seeing colors. Only our eyes can perceive colors. The Triune God is the Spirit; hence, in order to receive Him, we must use our spirit. The divine Spirit has entered into our human spirit. This is mysterious yet real.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Father, the Son, and the Spirit<br />
Dwelling in Us as Life</h2>
<p>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit, that is, the three in the Godhead, dwell in us as our life. In John 14:23 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&rdquo; Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; Romans 8:2 says that the Spirit is the Spirit of life. The Spirit of life dwells in the believers. Hence, the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;dwells in the believers as their life.</p>
<p>Our experience as believers also proves that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit dwell in us as our life. When we call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we are calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, but we feel that the Spirit is dwelling in us and that the Father who regenerated us is wonderful. When we call on the Lord Jesus, we receive the Spirit and sense the sweetness of the Father. When I was a new believer, I found it confusing to pray. I wondered whether I should address God as Father, Lord, or Spirit. At that time some brothers said, &ldquo;You should pray to the heavenly Father. Every once in a while you can pray to the Son, but you should never pray to the Spirit.&rdquo; However, when I prayed to the Father, I would unconsciously begin praying to the Son and say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Moreover, because I touched the Spirit, I also addressed the Spirit. After some consideration, I would repent and confess this mistake. Soon I was completely confused, not knowing whether I should call on the Father, the Son, or the Spirit. Eventually, I realized that it is not a problem to address either the Father, the Son, or the Spirit in prayer. For example, depending on the situation, we may address Brother Yueh as Mr. Yueh, Brother Yueh, Professor Yueh, or Classmate Yueh.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Walking according to the Triune God<br />
as the Spirit</h2>
<p>The Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;dwells in us as our life. Hence, we need to live and walk by the Triune God who is our life. For this reason, Galatians 5:25 says, &ldquo;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.&rdquo; However, this is not an easy matter to practice. When I lived in Yantai over forty years ago, very few homes used electric lights; most homes used kerosene lamps. From the time I was a young boy until I became an adult, I replenished the kerosene and wiped the lamps. Later, a brother installed electric lights in my home. Initially, when I returned home after a busy day, I would light the kerosene lamps, and my children would make fun of me. I would say to myself, &ldquo;Why am I so foolish? It is not necessary for me to light the kerosene lamps. I only need to turn on the switch, and the electric lights will shine.&rdquo; However, it still took several months before I was accustomed to using electric lights.</p>
<p>Using this illustration, we may say that before we were saved, we were kerosene lamps that frequently smoked. Now that we are saved and God lives in us, we can say that electricity has been installed in us. In spite of this, we are accustomed to lighting our kerosene lamp; that is, we still like to live by ourselves. When we are provoked to anger, we still exert much effort in order to endure. However, we no longer need to light our kerosene lamp. We can turn on the electric lights instead. We do not need to live by ourselves any longer. Instead, we should &ldquo;switch on&rdquo; by calling &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; This is to live by the Spirit.</p>
<p>I began serving the Lord when I was still young. People often asked me to tell them the most effective method to stop losing their temper. In those days I had not experienced calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name; hence, I would say, &ldquo;When you are about to lose your temper, you should say to yourself, &lsquo;Do not rush.&rsquo; This is good, because it is according to James 1:19. Moreover, when you are about to lose your temper, you should go pray.&rdquo; Being slow to anger and quick to pray is a very good practice, but it does not work.</p>
<p>Today I have learned the lesson. We have a &ldquo;switch&rdquo; that is always in us. The moment we call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; divine electricity comes. Sometimes I travel out of town and stay in others&rsquo; homes. My host usually shows me to my room and leaves immediately. Thus, I often need to spend a long time searching for the switch. We thank the Lord that He is our switch, and He will stoop down to reach us; we do not have to search for a long time. It is very convenient to turn on this switch. When we are about to get angry, we simply call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; and electricity flows immediately. This way is very effective. Over twenty years ago someone said that this practice was merely psychological. However, calling &ldquo;O Washington!&rdquo; will not make an American feel happy, nor will something happen when a Chinese calls &ldquo;O Confucius! O Confucius the sage!&rdquo; But the Lord Jesus comes and fills us immediately when we believers call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; and we experience Him. This is to let the Triune God be our life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASIS OF<br />
THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; MEETINGS AND SERVICE</h2>
<p>The Triune God being our life is the basis of our meetings and our service. The proper way for believers to meet and to serve is for them to take the Triune God as their life. We must be persons who live by the Triune God. For us to live is the Triune God; that is, for us to live is Christ. Only then can our meetings and our service be proper. It is not sufficient to meet or to serve according to the letter of the Bible. We must also live according to the Triune God as our life. When we live by Him, we are qualified to meet with the saints and to serve Him. Otherwise, we are not qualified to do anything. May we put this into practice.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; EXPERIENCE<br />
OF THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 6:17; Rom. 8:4; Eph. 5:18-19; Acts 6:5a; 13:52; 2:4a, 17a, 33; 4:31; 13:9</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You with all our heart, and we offer our thanksgiving and praise to You. Visit us day by day, and lead us moment by moment. We believe that You have called us out of our preoccupations and have gathered us into Your name for this meeting. We are meeting in Your precious, great, exalted, and rich name to enjoy You. Lord, come and visit us; touch every heart, open every spirit, and enlighten every mind so that we may hear with understanding and see a clear vision. Open the heavens to us. Give us a clear sky without any shadows, and remove our darkness. May Your Spirit fill this place and move in us.</p>
<p>Lord, we ask that You touch our deepest part so that we may know You, enjoy You, and be filled with You in our daily Christian life. Support our listening and our speaking. Give us instant utterance, and enable us to speak words that release You. Lord, dispense Yourself into us. We need You. Lord, we do not need religion, philosophy, doctrine, or mere words; we need You, the living God, the true and living Lord, and the Spirit who penetrates everything and is everywhere. May we gain You in this meeting, and may none of us go away empty-handed; rather, may we be satisfied. We give the glory to You. Shame Your enemy, and bless all of us who have called on You and are saved. In Your name we pray, Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO ASPECTS OF SALVATION</h2>
<p>Salvation is different from religion and philosophy, including Chinese ethical philosophy. Salvation is God dwelling in the believers as their life. Religion and philosophy are merely knowledge and doctrine. They are the highest things in human culture, and religion is noble. Human history proves that philosophy, particularly Chinese ethical philosophy, is beneficial to society; however, both philosophy and religion differ from the gospel of God and His salvation. Although this salvation contains certain truths and explains certain doctrines, salvation involves a living person&mdash;the Triune God who was incarnated to be our Savior. Objectively, this Savior was crucified on our behalf to bear our sins and to accomplish redemption so that our sins may be forgiven by God. This point is widely preached in Christianity.</p>
<p>However, salvation has not only an objective aspect but also a subjective aspect. The New Testament speaks of the two &ldquo;becomings&rdquo; of the Triune God. The first is the Word becoming flesh, that is, the Triune God becoming flesh, partaking of blood and flesh (John 1:14; Heb. 2:14), and thus being able to go to the cross to die and accomplish redemption (John 19:30; Heb. 9:22, 12). Afterward, He was resurrected from the dead and became the life-giving Spirit. This is the second becoming. First Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; This is a crucial item that is neglected by Christianity. Christ is God becoming flesh; hence, Christ is also a man. As God yet man, He went to the cross to shed human blood in order to accomplish redemption and wash away our sins. After the cross He went into death, even into Hades, and remained there for three days and three nights, and then He came out. His coming out of death was His resurrection. In His resurrection there was a second becoming; that is, He became the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAST ADAM<br />
BECOMING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Our Savior is Jesus Christ, the true God and our Lord. He is also the Spirit, the life-giving Spirit. As such, He can enter into our spirit. When He was in the flesh on earth, He was with the disciples, but He could only be among them; He could not enter into them. Therefore, He had to suffer death and be resurrected. Through His death and resurrection He was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit, becoming the life-giving Spirit. When He returned to the disciples on the evening of the day of His resurrection, He breathed into them. When I read this portion of the Bible as a young man, I thought that Christ should have spoken extensively to His disciples concerning His death and resurrection: how He passed through death, took a tour of Hades, overcame death, was not held by death, and walked out of death and how in resurrection He is omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient. Yet surprisingly, in John 20 when Christ came to meet with His disciples after His resurrection, He spoke only a few words, mainly saying, &ldquo;Peace be to you,&rdquo; and then He breathed into them (vv. 19, 22). This sounds like a fairy tale; it does not seem appropriate for a classic writing, much less the teachings in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
<p>Prior to the Lord&rsquo;s appearing, the disciples had been sorrowful for three days because their dearly beloved Lord, Jesus Christ, had been killed and buried in a tomb. They were exceedingly grieved and distressed. Although the doors were shut, the Lord suddenly stood in their midst and said to them, &ldquo;Peace be to you.&rdquo; While the disciples were still in shock, He breathed into them and said, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 22). <em>Breath</em> and <em>Spirit</em> are two different words in English, but in Greek they are the same word. The anglicized form of this word is <em>pneuma,</em> and its adjectival form is <em>pneumatic.</em> The Greek word may be rendered as &ldquo;wind,&rdquo; &ldquo;breath,&rdquo; or &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; in English. In John 3 it is rendered as &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; and &ldquo;wind&rdquo; (vv. 5, 8). The wind can be gentle for us to breath, or it can be strong. After His resurrection the Lord Jesus came to His disciples and breathed into them, saying, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; In other words, He breathed into them, saying, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Pneuma.&rdquo; It is correct to render this as &ldquo;Receive the Holy Breath,&rdquo; because in Greek the word for <em>spirit</em> and for <em>breath</em> is the same.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is God, and God is Spirit. He became flesh, partaking of blood and flesh, and went to the cross to die on our behalf. However, He did not remain in death. He came out of death and entered into resurrection. In resurrection He was transfigured into pneuma. This word can be rendered as &ldquo;spirit,&rdquo; &ldquo;air,&rdquo; or &ldquo;breath.&rdquo; Hence, He is now the pneumatic Christ; He is the Spirit.</p>
<p>Bible readers know that the Scriptures often use visible, physical matters to describe invisible, mysterious, spiritual, and profound matters. It is difficult to understand a statement such as, &ldquo;The atmosphere is filled with spirit.&rdquo; However, we can understand a statement such as, &ldquo;The atmosphere is filled with air.&rdquo; There is air in this room, in my home, and even in me. We would die without air. The atmosphere, the air surrounding the earth, provides the earth with an environment that is suitable for every kind of life to grow. When man landed on the moon, there was no air there; therefore, there were no living things there as well. The air typifies our Savior, the incarnated God, who went through death and resurrection to become the mysterious breath, the Spirit, who is omnipresent. Romans 10:6-7 says, &ldquo;Do not say in your heart, &lsquo;Who will ascend into heaven?&rsquo; that is, to bring Christ down; or, &lsquo;Who will descend into the abyss?&rsquo; that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.&rdquo; We do not need to say this, because Christ has already come down from heaven, and He has already come up out of Hades. He is the word that we proclaim, and this word &ldquo;is near you, in your mouth and in your heart&rdquo; (v. 8). As the word, the Lord is like the air, the breath; He is near us, in our mouth and in our heart.</p>
<p>The Bible uses air to portray the incarnated God, who came to be our Savior in order to accomplish redemption and thereafter became the wonderful Spirit. This Spirit is the &ldquo;air&rdquo; in the universe. Without air, the universe cannot have life. Without our Savior, man is lifeless, for he lives in death. Our Savior is the air, the breath, the Spirit. In John 7:39 the word <em>the</em> in the phrase <em>the Spirit</em> is an emphatic, definite article in the original language. &ldquo;The Spirit&rdquo; refers to the unique Spirit in the universe. Only this Spirit is the Spirit of life. Any other &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; cannot give life. Therefore, 1 Corinthians 15:45 says that the Lord became the life-giving Spirit, and Romans 8:2 says that He is the Spirit of life. The Spirit is God and Christ. When we say the Lord&rsquo;s name, He immediately comes into us. His name denotes His person, which is the Spirit. Therefore, whenever we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, He comes to us immediately, because He is the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING THE LORD JESUS<br />
AS THE SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Through Calling on the Name of the Lord</h2>
<p>Every believer has experienced calling on the Lord. We do not have to call loudly; we may also call softly. At night we may call softly so as not to disturb others. If we are in a convenient place, we may call with a loud voice. Our calling loudly is not for the Lord to hear us but for us to be released. A few days ago I had a cold, so the nurse taught me how to breathe deeply. In order to breathe deeply, we must use our diaphragm to inhale and to exhale. This is very beneficial. Calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name is spiritual deep breathing that enables us to receive spiritual help. A brother who has lost his job and is not able to pay his rent may pray silently, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! I am miserable. I cannot find a job or pay the rent. Please help me.&rdquo; This prayer is very good. I have frequently taught others to pray such a prayer. The Lord answers such prayers. However, the brother may not feel comforted afterward, because he did not meet the Lord and therefore has no joy. But if he prays loudly, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! I am really miserable! I have lost my job, and I cannot pay my rent. Don&rsquo;t You care, Lord Jesus? O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Afterward, he will shed tears. When he prays in such a loud way, not only will the Lord hear him; he will be released, his sorrow will be turned into joy, and he will enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s supply and consolation.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the Lord does not answer our silent prayers. As those who belong to Him, He knows that we have a problem even before we pray (Isa. 65:24). Therefore, in a sense, our prayer is unnecessary. The Lord said that we should not be anxious about what we will eat, what we will drink, or with what we will be clothed, for all these things the Gentiles are anxiously seeking. But our heavenly Father knows that we need all these things; hence, we need to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness (Matt. 6:31-33). Normally, we do not think about His kingdom, nor are we concerned about His kingdom or His righteousness, but the Lord wants us to be concerned. Not only should we be concerned; we need to seek our Father&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness. When He answers our prayer by giving us His kingdom and His righteousness, He also gives us something more, something supplemental&mdash;what we will eat and what we will drink&mdash;without our asking. This can be compared to buying a huge item in a store and receiving a free gift from the storeowner. From this perspective, we do not need to pray for our daily necessities.</p>
<p>However, we still need to pray for ourselves. I have experienced being in distress and having nowhere to turn, yet I called, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! I really thank You that You are with me.&rdquo; Immediately, the Lord was with me. If we do not call on the Lord and pray to Him, we will not have inward peace. But once we call and pray, we will have peace and joy, even if the problem is still with us. Therefore, calling loudly is for our sake, not for His.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by calling loudly we shut the devil&rsquo;s mouth. If we are not willing to call and pray, Satan will bother us and rule over our thoughts. At such a time we simply need to call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; and chase the devil away! Hence, when we call on the Lord loudly, we are experiencing deep spiritual breathing, which enables us not only to touch and gain the Lord but also to be cleansed, to shut the devil&rsquo;s mouth, and to have inner peace and joy.</p>
<p>Our Lord is not a doctrine, nor is He a religion; He is not knowledge, facts, or explanations. The purpose of doctrinal expositions and revelations of truth in the Scriptures is to show us a living person&mdash;Jesus Christ, the Lord of heaven and earth, the origin of the universe, and the Creator of all things. He became a man, died, was resurrected, and became the life-giving Spirit. He is waiting to be received by us. We should never think that it is difficult to believe in Jesus. On the contrary, it is easy to believe in Jesus because He is God, the Savior, and the Spirit. His name is Jesus. The Bible says that He is &ldquo;rich to all who call upon Him; for &lsquo;whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&rsquo;&rdquo; (Rom. 10:12-13). It may seem as if we cannot meet or touch the Lord, but we know His name. There is a name in the universe that is unique. History shows that the name of Jesus is extraordinary. Whenever we call on His name, we are richly supplied.</p>
<p>I know for a fact that many people who did not believe in the Lord after hearing the gospel were touched in their conscience on their deathbed; they felt that during their life they had done many wrong things toward their parents, spouse, children, relatives, and friends. Then before they breathed their last breath, they would recall the gospel that they had heard many years prior, call on the name of Jesus, and be saved. As believers, we can also testify that we often call on the name of Jesus and that as often as we call this name, He comes to us as the life-giving Spirit to give us life.</p>
<p>Many of us can testify that whenever we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we are refreshed inwardly and filled with joy. When we feel lonely or homesick and call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we experience Him as our Companion. Regardless of how intimate a person is to us, he can never be so intimate that he enters into us. But whenever I call on the Lord, I immediately sense that He is in me. Whether or not I call, He is still in me. But without calling on Him, I do not sense His presence. As soon as I call, I sense His presence. We can call on Him at any time. We are not bothering Him. We sense His presence the moment we call &ldquo;Lord Jesus!&rdquo; When we do not call, we may feel quite lonely, but once we call, we have a Companion. Even when we feel miserable, our misery will disappear when we call on His name, and we will be joyful.</p>
<p>Paul says that we need to be sober-minded before others (2 Cor. 5:13). For this reason, I do not call on the Lord&rsquo;s name loudly in the presence of others. However, when I am alone in my bedroom, I call and leap with rejoicing. When I hear someone&rsquo;s footsteps, I am sober. Therefore, no one knows that I was praying, skipping, and leaping with joy. Many other believers have had similar experiences. When we are sad or grieved, having no peace or rest, we need to pray, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! You know that I am suffering; I have nowhere to turn. Lord, You are compassionate and sympathetic.&rdquo; Although we may doubt whether the Lord would answer such an informal prayer, we will immediately have peace and support, and we will also sense that He is bearing our pain.</p><h2 class="head2">Through the Lord&rsquo;s Word</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word is made real by the Spirit. The Spirit is the word, and the word is the Spirit; both are one (John 6:63). We speak the Lord&rsquo;s word, but when we receive His word, we receive the Spirit. What we speak to others is the word, but what they receive is the Spirit. What comes forth is the word, but what enters is the Spirit. Thus, the Spirit and the word are one. On the one hand, we have the name of Jesus on which we can call. On the other hand, we also have His word, which is the Spirit, the breath, and which is in our mouth and in our heart (Rom. 10:8).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Through the Lord&rsquo;s Inward Regulating</h2>
<p>The Lord is in us, and He also rules and regulates us. He tells us when to speak and when not to speak. We are very talkative; when we hear others gossiping about someone, we want to add a few words. But before we open our mouth to speak, the Lord Jesus will say, &ldquo;Do not speak; that is gossiping.&rdquo; Then our tongue will be bridled, and we will not be able to say a word. We will also sense the Lord&rsquo;s inward presence. Then we can say, &ldquo;Lord, thank You for being with me. Without Your inward regulating and correcting me, my idle words would have been uttered.&rdquo; This is an example of a practical experience of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>In order to experience the Lord as the Spirit dwelling in us, we must see that we are joined to the Lord as one spirit and that we need to always walk according to the spirit in every matter.</p>
<p>The Lord is now the Spirit, and every believer has a human spirit. When we believed in the Lord by calling on Him, confessing our sins, and repenting, He came into our spirit. From that day onward the Spirit and our human spirit have been mingled as one spirit. This matches what the Bible says: &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 6:17). This is a precious word. Salvation is not only a person; it is a person who has come into us. I can proclaim with assurance and conviction that I am not by myself; Someone is with me. Every believer can say that the Spirit is mingled with his human spirit. The Spirit follows us wherever we go, and He is with us in every situation. This is the way that we can experience the Lord as the Spirit of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Since we are one spirit with the Lord, we should &ldquo;not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit&rdquo; (Rom. 8:4). It is not easy to read the Bible. We often read the Bible as if it were for others, and we rarely apply what we read to our own living. We may have read Romans 8:4 many times without experiencing it. In the Greek text the word <em>but</em> is emphatic. We should not walk merely according to the spirit; we should walk <em>but</em> according to the spirit. This is a most precious word. Our problem is that we know that the Lord is in us, that He is one spirit with us, and that we should walk according to the spirit, but we rarely walk according to the spirit. We do not walk according to the spirit ninety-five percent of the time. Those who have more growth in life might walk according to the spirit fifteen percent of the time. In two more years they may advance and walk according to the spirit twenty-five percent of the time, and after thirty years they may be able to walk according to the spirit seventy-five percent of the time. I have been a Christian for over sixty years, and although the percentage of time that I walk according to the spirit is higher than when I was young, it is still not sufficient, because according to the Lord&rsquo;s Word, we should walk only according to the spirit. I occasionally joke with ones I am familiar with. However, every time I joke, the Lord rebukes me, saying, &ldquo;What did you say? Why did you joke? You should use your lips, tongue, and teeth to speak for Me, not to tell jokes.&rdquo; I am often rebuked in this way because it is difficult to drop these small habits.</p>
<p>Before I was saved, I enjoyed going to Chinese operas and playing soccer. Now, however, regardless of how much I am compelled, I will not watch Chinese opera or play soccer. These were &ldquo;big balls&rdquo; that were easy to abandon and overcome, but it is rather difficult to deal with &ldquo;little balls.&rdquo; Telling jokes is a little ball. We usually feel that it does not matter whether or not we play with this ball, because it is not a big ball. Afterward, however, we feel remorse and confess our mistake. We even make up our mind never to play with this little ball again. But after five minutes we begin to play with this ball again with another brother. This shows that we do not walk according to the spirit all the time. Walking according to the spirit can be compared to a chain with many links. It is not necessary for every link in the chain to be disconnected in order for the chain to be broken. A chain is broken when only one link is disconnected. Likewise, if we fail to walk according to the spirit even one percent of the time, our &ldquo;chain&rdquo; will be broken. If I tell a joke today but overcome in every other matter, in the evening I cannot say, &ldquo;Lord, thank You that I lived an overcoming life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sisters have a particularly difficult time overcoming the matter of shopping. Businessmen devote much time studying the devilish tactics of how to stir up people&rsquo;s emotions and attract their eyes. Hence, we should beware of department-store display windows. Once we glance at them, it is easy to be &ldquo;hooked.&rdquo; Many sisters who love the Lord have experienced being happy when buying something but then regretting afterward. There is a sister who bought a piece of expensive fabric and was happy. However, for a week after that she could not sleep well. Whenever she looked at the fabric, the Lord would tell her to give it to a needy sister. Although she struggled, she was eventually compelled by the Lord to give it away. Then she was released. Many of us have had similar experiences.</p>
<p>I have been giving messages for nearly sixty years, but I still make mistakes. Whenever I speak longer than necessary, a voice within tells me to stop speaking. Nearly every time after giving a message, I have to confess, &ldquo;Lord, I have spoken unnecessary words again. Please forgive me.&rdquo; Before giving a message, I always offer a prayer with a strong spirit, saying, &ldquo;Lord, preserve me to be only Your mouthpiece, and keep me from speaking unnecessary words.&rdquo; However, toward the end of a message I can become excited and speak in a joking way. This is to speak not according to the spirit. A person who speaks according to the spirit will not utter superfluous words. I have learned many lessons in this matter.</p>
<p>Being talkative is a common fault between husbands and wives. Because they are too familiar with one another, they tend to talk about everything and do not keep matters pertaining to others confidential. A wife will usually become unhappy because her husband talks too much. Those who are married are learning this lesson. I have been learning this lesson for sixty years. A husband knows that it is not easy to make his wife greet him with a smiling face. He must be very careful and refrain from sarcastic words and insinuating remarks; otherwise, his wife will get angry. Likewise, a wife should be careful. A husband can get angry because his wife says unnecessary things. We all have spoken too much and have thus provoked our spouse to anger. If we could be silent, we would be successful and overcoming. I dare not say that I have learned this matter, but I have learned a secret: Whenever the conversation becomes tense, I stop talking and call softly with a smile, &ldquo;O Lord! O Lord!&rdquo; In this way both parties are appeased. A believer who can walk according to the spirit in his married life is an overcomer. We all have this same problem and can sympathize with one another. It is difficult to walk according to the spirit.</p>
<p>It is good that the Spirit has entered into us, but this is also a problem because He troubles us. Marriage is wonderful because you gain a spouse, but marriage is also difficult because a spouse is also a problem. Some couples quarrel on their wedding day concerning whether the windows should be opened or closed at night. The husband cannot sleep with the windows closed, but the wife cannot sleep with the windows opened. Who should give in? As believers, we have an advantage because the Spirit is in us as our supply and consolation. However, we also have a problem because He never gives in and always interferes with the things in our daily life, both great and small. He requires us to walk only by the spirit, not according to anything else. The word <em>but</em> is a severe restriction to us.</p>
<p>Many saints walk according to the spirit in many things except in the matter of their hairstyle. Brothers, do you comb your hair according to the spirit? Sisters, can you tell the Lord that your hairstyle and hair adornment are according to the spirit? I doubt that many sisters can say that her hairstyle is according to the spirit. Some arrange their hair like a high tower. Many women wear their hair so that it is difficult to tell whether they are a male or a female. The Bible says that a woman should not cut her too short (1 Cor. 11:15). God does not like indistinctness between males and females. He wants women to adorn themselves as females and men to express themselves as males so as to avoid confusion. The sisters should be careful when they go to a beauty parlor; it is difficult for people to be according to the spirit in such a place. I will never go to a luxurious and fashionable place to get a haircut. I go only to simple and ordinary places.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT&mdash;<br />
BEING FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>If we would walk only according to the spirit, we will be filled inwardly with the Spirit daily. Immediately after I was saved, I read numerous spiritual books, most of which were published in England. These books said that the infilling of the Spirit is a very difficult yet great matter. It is indeed a great matter for sinners to be filled with the Spirit. The books I read said that the first blessing a sinner receives is regeneration and that the second blessing is being filled with the Spirit. After many years, however, I discovered that these two matters are great but not difficult.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Miraculous Normality</h2>
<p>Recently, I spoke concerning three items of truth: regeneration, the inward filling of the Spirit, and the outward filling of the Spirit. I pointed out that these matters are miraculous yet normal. Hence, I coined the term &ldquo;miraculous normality&rdquo; to indicate that these normal things are also miraculous. Moody said that regeneration is the greatest miracle in the universe. Is it not a great miracle that a filthy, defiled, and vile sinner is able to receive God&rsquo;s life and be regenerated to become a son of God? A person does not need to roll on the floor remorsefully, moaning, &ldquo;Lord, I am a sinner, but I no longer want to be a sinner; I want to be a son of God,&rdquo; before God will respond. Rather, a person needs only to say, &ldquo;Lord, I am a sinner; thank You for dying for me,&rdquo; and he is saved immediately. Hence, regeneration is a great miracle, yet it is very normal.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Be Filled with the Spirit Being Normal</h2>
<p>To be filled with the Spirit is a great miracle, but it is also normal. Because we are one spirit with the Lord, we should exercise daily to walk according to the spirit. Even though we might not be able to walk according to the Spirit a hundred percent of the time, we should aspire to advance daily. Our being filled with the Spirit depends on our walking according to our human spirit. Let us use an illustration. Although a vessel that is nearly filled with water is surrounded by air, it can contain only a small amount of air. If the vessel is emptied of some water, it can be filled with more air. The more the water is poured out, the more the vessel can be filled with air. When the vessel is completely emptied of water, the vessel will be filled with air. Hence, it is not difficult to be filled with the Spirit; it depends on how much we are willing to be emptied. When I was younger, I was taught that it is very difficult to be filled with the Spirit. A person needs to fast, to pray, and to fulfill many other requirements. Hence, I exhausted myself and exerted much effort, but I was unable to be filled with the Spirit. Now I have experience, and I realize that we do not need to exert any effort to be filled with the Spirit. This is a miraculously normal experience. We need only to confess our sins, live according to the spirit, and walk according to the spirit, and then we will be filled spontaneously with the Spirit. For example, when I go to get a haircut, the Spirit within me tells me how long my hair should be. My hair is short not because I do not like long hair; rather, my hair is not long because the Spirit within me does not want my hair to be long. This is to walk according to the spirit, and the result is that we are filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>It is not easy for brothers to wear neckties according to the spirit. My hometown was conservative, and people were criticized for speaking English and for wearing Western suits. For this reason, I did not wear a Western suit until I was invited to visit the church in Manila in 1950. At that time it was difficult for me to wear a necktie. The Philippines is in a tropical region; therefore, most of the suits given to me by the brothers were white. It is difficult to find suitable ties for white suits. If I wore the ties given to me by the saints, I would be doing a necktie show instead of giving a message. Wearing neckties according to the Spirit is a difficult matter. Three years ago a brother gave me a necktie that had fine red stripes. Others might say that the necktie is okay, but the Spirit within me did not allow me to wear it. I still wear ties that are plain and without stripes or lines, because I feel comfortable wearing them.</p>
<p>It may not be easy to walk according to the spirit, but we have to practice. The extent to which we walk according to the spirit is the extent to which we will be filled with the Spirit. Just like a cup must be emptied of water in order to be filled with air, so we must be emptied every day in order to be filled with the Spirit. When we are completely empty, we will be completely filled with the Spirit. This is not a difficult matter. The Lord has already accomplished redemption and has resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit. Now He is waiting to fill us. Just as air surrounds the cup and is also within the cup, so the Spirit surrounds us and is in us. As soon as we are emptied, He will fill us within. It is not difficult for Him to fill us; the hindrance is that we are not emptied.</p><h2 class="head2">To Be Filled with the Spirit<br />
Being Miraculous</h2>
<p>Although being filled with the Spirit is not difficult, it is a great miracle. The Spirit is Christ, who is the embodiment of God (Col. 2:9), and He has entered into us. Not only so, He desires to dwell in us (John 15:5) and to make home in our hearts (Eph. 3:17). The Greek word for <em>make home</em> is <em>kata,</em> meaning &ldquo;to enter deeply.&rdquo; When I travel, I am often received by the saints. Sometimes my host says, &ldquo;This is your room.&rdquo; I dare not use any other room, because I do not have the right to do so. However, when I am in my home, I have the right to put my belongings in any room according to my preference. This is what it means to make home. Even if I were to stay in a home as a guest for one year, I still would not be able to make my home there, because I am not the host. Only the host has such a right.</p>
<p>Christ is in us, but is He a guest or the host? Our heart has many parts: the conscience, the mind, the emotion, and the will. Our mind is a room, our emotion is another room, and our will is still another room. Sometimes we allow Christ to occupy only a part of our mind, not our whole mind. Sometimes we do not allow Him to occupy our emotions, and at other times we do not allow Him to occupy our will. This compels Him to remain in our spirit. As a result, instead of making His home in us, He is imprisoned. He wants to enter this room, but we do not allow Him; He wants to enter that room, but we disagree. Hence, He can remain only in our spirit; He is not allowed to enter into the other parts of our being. For this reason, we have no way to be filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>Although I have been a Christian for many years, I dare not say that all the rooms of my being&mdash;my conscience, my mind, my emotion, and my will&mdash;have been occupied by the Lord Jesus, but I can say that He has occupied much of my being. Christ should not be a guest or a prisoner in us; rather, He should be the Host who can settle down and make His home in us. According to Ephesians 3:19, the result of Christ making His home in our hearts is that we will be filled unto all the fullness of God. This means that if we would let Him gain ground in us, He will fill us. As God&rsquo;s vessels, we should be filled with only God (Rom. 9:23). Some vessels have been damaged and are filled with sand and clay. Other vessels are somewhat better and are filled with gold. Suppose we are vessels filled with gold. Would we still be willing to be fully emptied? When we are emptied, the Spirit will fill us. Perhaps we would say, &ldquo;Lord, if I were filled with filthy things or with vinegar or oil, I would be willing to be emptied and cleansed so that You could fill me. However, I am filled with gold and with jewels, which I treasure. Please let me keep them.&rdquo; We can choose not to be emptied, but then we will not be filled with God. In order to be filled with God, we must be emptied of everything, including what is worthless and what is valuable.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Practical Experience<br />
of Being Filled with the Spirit</h2>
<p>Hence, it is not difficult to be filled with the Spirit; rather, it is as easy as filling a vessel with air. It depends on whether or not we are willing to be emptied by giving up the things that we love. The sisters are reluctant to let go of purchasing items on sale every Saturday. If they continue to fill themselves with unnecessary sale items, they will not have room for the Spirit to fill them. If instead of going shopping they would be willing to pray for ten minutes to be strengthened inwardly and to be emptied of themselves, they would be filled with the Spirit. The young people are reluctant to give up the worldly way of styling their hair, which is according to fashion. If they were willing to give it up, they would be filled with the Spirit. It is very difficult for the brothers to choose a necktie. A brother who loves the Lord and desires to be used by the Lord may need to change his necktie in order to be useful. Being filled with the Spirit is rather easy, but it depends on whether we are willing to be emptied. Once we are emptied, we will be filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it is difficult to be filled with the Spirit, but on the other hand, it is easy. Ephesians 5:18-20 says that when we are filled with the Spirit, we will give thanks and praise. According to my experience, thanking and praising are, on the one hand, the issue of being filled with the Spirit and, on the other hand, the way to be filled with the Spirit. It is not easy for sisters to style their hair according to the spirit. It is difficult for them not to follow the fashion of the world when they go to the beauty parlor. However, if they would be willing to thank and praise the Lord while they are in the beauty parlor, saying, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I thank You and praise You; You are wonderful, and You are so lovely!&rdquo; they would be filled with the Spirit. In other words, if we can pray, we will be emptied of the unnecessary things in us. The more we pray in this way, the more we will be filled with the Spirit. Therefore, it is not hard to be filled with the Spirit, because we have a Lord who is worthy to be praised. As we praise Him, appreciate Him, and admire Him, we will spontaneously worship Him. This will help us to let go of and to be emptied of all our preferences and choices. As a result of being emptied, we will be filled with the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">The Result of Being Filled with the Spirit</h2>
<p>The result of being filled with the Holy Spirit is to have joy within. Acts 13:52 says, &ldquo;The disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The Holy Spirit always comes with joy. Furthermore, we will have peace (9:31); we will be calm, without complaints or murmuring, and there will not be any resistance in us. The reason we murmur, complain, and are full of resistance is that we are not filled with the Spirit. If we would be filled with the Spirit, everything within us will be calm, and we will not be affected by any outward turmoil. Regardless of how our outward circumstances change, we would remain calm and enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
THE TRIUNE GOD AS LIFE<br />
AND OUR MEETINGS AND SERVICE</h2>
<p>The Triune God as life is related to the believers&rsquo; meetings and service. This is the proper way for us to meet and to serve. We are qualified to meet and to serve because the Triune God indwells us, His Spirit and our human spirit are joined as one spirit, we can walk according to the spirit in everything, and we can be filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>Such a qualification is not required in Christianity. Many years ago I was led by the Lord to begin meeting as the church in my home with the breaking of bread. At that time, one of my former schoolmates who lived nearby saw what I was doing and decided that since I could break bread at home, he also could break bread at home. Eventually, he used the same table to eat breakfast in the morning, break bread at noon, and play mah-jongg in the evening. Not only so, in Christianity couples who have quarreled severely at home will also go to the Sunday worship and offer money.</p>
<p>The meetings in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery need the qualification of life. In the meetings we must exercise to function by calling on the Lord, singing hymns, praying, and prophesying. If we quarrel with our spouse five minutes before the meeting, we will not be able to open our mouth to sing, pray, or prophesy. Therefore, this way requires that we overcome and are revived.</p>
<p>Likewise, the service in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery requires the qualification of life. It is easy to invite people to come and hear the gospel or to attend a love feast. However, to visit people in their homes or to preach the gospel by knocking on doors requires that we pay a price. If we do not pay a price, even if someone opens the door to us, we will be &ldquo;deflated&rdquo; persons, without the Spirit, and our effort will be wasted because we will not be able to speak with power. In order to speak with the Spirit and with power, we must be filled with the Holy Spirit, which requires us to pay a price.</p>
<p>Only when we take the Triune God as our life can we have proper meetings and service. If we do not have such a life and living, we will not be qualified to meet or to serve. If I were sick with tuberculosis, a stomach ulcer, or other ailments, it would be impossible for me to compete in the Olympics. The athletes who compete in the Olympics are restricted in many matters, including their diet and sleep. This is the only way that they can build up a healthy body and be qualified to compete in the games. Christianity is desolate and weak because the believers are sick. Even in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we have not been freed of this sickness. Hence, when we meet, most of the believers are silent, and we have no way to maintain the meetings without a speaker. This kind of situation necessitates big meetings with one person speaking and the rest listening. On the one hand, such meetings can supply and edify people, but on the other hand, after a prolonged period this way of meeting will annul the organic function of the saints.</p>
<p>A new believer is like a newborn babe whose organs are complete. Even though he is small, he has the senses of hearing, seeing, and smelling and the ability to move. However, he needs exercise in order to develop. A baby whose eyes are kept covered will not be able to see after ten years. If he is not allowed to walk, he will not be able to walk after ten years. The organic functions in a human being need to be developed through exercise. The worship service in Christianity annuls rather than develops the organic function of the believers. The way of one man speaking and the rest listening may provide a long-term supply, edification, and teaching, and it may be used to maintain the situation. However, after meeting in this way for five years, a believer&rsquo;s organic function will be annulled. Such meetings are not according to the Bible. The Bible says that when believers meet, they should testify for the Lord (1 Cor. 14:26). Whenever they meet, they should learn to speak. A mother teaches her child by helping the child to practice speaking. When a child learns to speak, he must learn to exercise his ears, because he cannot learn to speak without the ability to hear. This kind of instruction is for development. We have been enlightened to see that if we desire to take the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must practice accordingly. This requires us to be filled with the Spirit, that is, to be filled with God, in our spirit and to let Christ make home in our hearts. We will then be filled with the fullness of God, and our meetings and service will be full of the riches of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OUTWARD FILLING OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When we speak of being filled inwardly with the Spirit, we must also mention being filled outwardly with the Spirit. The Greek word for the inner filling of the Spirit is different from that for the outward filling of the Spirit. Pouring water into a cup is inward infilling, and putting the cup into the water is outward filling. In 1936 I wrote an article entitled &ldquo;The Work of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; In this article I referred to the work of the Holy Spirit in three steps: regeneration, inward filling, and outward filling. At that time I coined the term &ldquo;outward filling,&rdquo; that is, being filled outwardly. The Spirit is not only in us but also upon us. On the day of Pentecost the Spirit entered into the disciples and was poured upon the disciples. Acts 2:33 says, &ldquo;Having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He has poured out this which you both see and hear.&rdquo; This pouring out is like being baptized, which is outward. When we drink water, we are filled with water inwardly. When we are baptized, we are immersed into the water. Drinking water is to be filled with water, and being baptized is to be enveloped with water. This kind of outward filling is for power, not for life.</p>
<p>Verse 31 of chapter 4 says, &ldquo;When [the disciples] had so besought, the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness.&rdquo; Paul was filled with the Holy Spirit when he went forth to preach the gospel, that is, when it became necessary for him to preach the word (13:9). The outward filling of the Spirit is for the believers to be empowered. I believe that I have the infilling of the Spirit as well as the outward filling of the Spirit while I am speaking the word, because I have the boldness, utterance, and strength to release my burden. I also believe that when I am outwardly filled, others are filled as well. This is the outward filling. This is not a matter of life but of power. It is for our work and our service.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EATING, DRINKING,<br />
AND ENJOYING THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 6:54-57; Matt. 26:26-28; 1 Cor. 10:3-4; Matt. 4:4; Jer. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:2; Isa. 12:3-4; Rom. 10:12</h1>
<h2 class="head1">SALVATION BEING<br />
TO EAT, DRINK, AND ENJOY THE LORD</h2>
<p>Salvation is God entering into us to be our life. It is marvelous that we can experience Him by allowing Him to fill us and to make home in us, that is, to occupy every part of our being. In our experience this is also something normal that does not require us to exert any effort or to do something. Salvation is high and mysterious because God has accomplished everything so that He can work Himself into us to be our life, our living, and our person. This is the highest revelation in the New Testament. Salvation is different from and higher than religion and philosophy, including the ethical teachings of Confucius.</p>
<p>God has also become our enjoyment. He is our food and drink so that we can eat and drink Him. To say that we can eat and drink God may sound offensive and seem to be wild, but it is the revelation in the Bible.</p>
<p>God first created the heavens and the earth. Then He created man in His own image and formed a spirit within man in order for man to receive Him. The New Testament says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness&rdquo; (John 4:24). Only the human spirit can touch and receive the divine Spirit. Only our human spirit is capable of worshipping the Spirit of God. Worshipping the Spirit is the inclination and obligation of our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING THE LORD</h2>
<p>After creating man, God did not give him numerous messages or commandments. Rather, God placed man in front of the tree of life and charged him not to be careless concerning his eating. In other words, it was not a matter of man&rsquo;s conduct but of what he ate. The first thing in the Bible concerning man is the matter of eating. Whether man would be acceptable or unacceptable depended on what he ate.</p>
<p>To eat is to receive, that is, to take in food that is outside of us so that it becomes our life essence. The food that we eat is digested and then assimilated into the cells of our body and even becomes the constituents of our cells, our very substance. Chinese children who live in China are usually short, thin, and pale, but if they go to the United States, in just five years they will grow tall, become husky, and look healthy. This difference is caused by their eating. American food is rich in nutrients; thus, those who eat American food grow up looking like Americans. While an American brother was living in Taipei, his child became yellowish in complexion. One day I asked the brother why his child&rsquo;s complexion was yellowish, and the brother said that his child had been eating too many carrots. This shows that we look like what we eat, or in other words, we are what we eat.</p>
<p>I grew up in a Christian home and often contacted American pastors. One day I asked my mother why the American pastors smelled like cows. She replied, &ldquo;They eat beef every day, so they smell like cows.&rdquo; My maternal grandfather lived near the sea, and his home smelled of fish. When I asked my mother about this, she said, &ldquo;They eat fish every day, so they have the smell of fish.&rdquo; We are what we eat.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Believers&rsquo; Food</h2>
<p>We need to ask ourselves, &ldquo;What are we eating?&rdquo; I am not referring to the physical food that nourishes our body; I am referring to spiritual food. To believe in the Lord Jesus is different from believing in a religion. Religion teaches people to devoutly worship God, but to believe in the Lord Jesus is to eat Christ in our spirit. The expression <em>eating Christ</em> does not sound nice, but in the Scriptures the Lord Jesus compared Himself to different kinds of food. In John 1:29 He is spoken of as the Lamb of God. In chapter 6 He is the bread of life (vv. 35, 48, 51), and in verse 57 He said that those who eat Him will live because of Him. The words <em>because of</em> can also be rendered as &ldquo;through&rdquo; or &ldquo;by.&rdquo; The Lord is the bread of life, and those who eat Him will live through Him and by Him. The Lord&rsquo;s comparison of Himself to the bread of life indicates that we need to eat Him in order to be nourished by Him. No matter how much we may appreciate or praise the bread of life, it has nothing to do with us if we do not eat it. However, if instead of appreciating and praising we would take a few bites, we would receive nourishment. Bread is not for appreciation; it is for eating.</p>
<p>The expression <em>eating Christ</em> may sound rather wild, but the Lord Jesus came to be our bread. He is the bread of life to be the strength for our living and walk; hence, He is not for us to appreciate but for us to receive by eating. The breakfast that I ate this morning gives me the strength to speak. Without such a rich and nutritious breakfast, I would not have the strength to release this message. A car needs to &ldquo;eat&rdquo; gas in order to run; a car cannot run without gas.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the bread of life, and those who eat Him will live by Him. The bread of life should be made from wheat; however, the Lord says that this bread is His flesh: &ldquo;My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink. He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him&rdquo; (vv. 55-56). It is a mystery that bread, which is of the vegetable life, can be flesh as well. This shows that it is not easy to understand the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">The Vegetable Life and the Animal Life<br />
Being Types</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s words are simple in meaning yet profound in significance. He is the bread of life, which is of the plant life. Furthermore, His flesh is true food, and His blood is true drink. Both <em>flesh</em> and <em>blood</em> refer to the lamb. Hence, on the one hand, the Lord is typified by the vegetable life&mdash;bread; on the other hand, He is typified by the animal life&mdash;the lamb. The Lord as bread is for feeding and for the multiplication of life, and the Lord as the Lamb is for redemption by the shedding of blood so that we may partake of Him.</p>
<p>The vegetable life typifies the Lord Jesus, showing that He feeds us and is being reproduced in us. He is the grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died in order to bring forth His believers as many grains for His multiplication (12:24). He is bread to feed us so that we may live because of Him (6:57). A grain of wheat that is sown into the ground is for the multiplication of life, and wheat grains that are ground into flour and made into bread are for feeding. Hence, the vegetable life typifies the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>The animal life also typifies the Lord Jesus, showing that He accomplished redemption in order for us to partake of Him. He is the Lamb of God for our sins to be taken away (1:29). During the Passover, the children of Israel killed the lamb, put the blood of the lamb on the doorposts and on the lintel of the house, and ate the flesh of the lamb together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs (Exo. 12). This picture shows that the Israelites were sinful and deserved to be slain. However, through the blood of the lamb they were redeemed by God; He passed over them and did not slay them. As a result, they were able to enjoy peace and could eat the flesh of the lamb.</p>
<p>This was the atmosphere when the Lord Jesus spoke concerning eating His flesh and drinking His blood in John 6. He said that His flesh is true food and that His blood is true drink (v. 55). This means that we should accept everything that has been accomplished through His blood. His blood redeems us so that we are spared from destruction, from God&rsquo;s judgment, and are placed in a peaceful situation for us to enjoy Him as food, as our life supply.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the bread of life. In verse 51 the Lord said, &ldquo;The bread which I will give is My flesh.&rdquo; This indicates that the composition of the bread is not only of the vegetable life but also of the animal life; it is flesh-bread. The New Testament indicates that the Lord is the grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died to be reproduced in us and to be our life supply. He is also the Lamb of God who shed His blood for us and gave Himself to us so that we may partake of Him.</p>
<p>During the Passover, a lamb was slain, and the people enjoyed the lamb peacefully through its shed blood. The Israelites ate the lamb in haste with their loins girded, their sandals on their feet, and their staff in their hands (Exo. 12:11), because they had to leave the land of Egypt immediately after eating the lamb. After the people ate the lamb, it entered into their cells and became their constitution. Hence, they were living by the lamb that they had eaten and were thus strengthened to walk out of Egypt.</p>
<p>The pictures in the Old Testament are types of the realities in the New Testament. The Lord Jesus is the incarnated God becoming the Lamb of God and taking the form of a man with blood and flesh so that He could shed His blood for our sins and accomplish redemption for us. Then in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit to enter into us so that we may partake of Him. Furthermore, He is the bread of life, the flesh-bread, so that we may be redeemed, fed, and supplied. Our need today is to eat Him, to drink Him, and to enjoy Him practically.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Eating the Lord in John 6</h2>
<p>In 1958 I held a conference in Taipei concerning eating, drinking, and enjoying God. After the first message a brother who was a college professor told me that although the message was good, some of the phrases that had been used were barbaric. He was referring to the expression <em>eating Jesus.</em> I replied, &ldquo;This way of speaking began with the Lord Jesus, not with me. He said, &lsquo;He who eats Me...&rsquo; He was the one who took the lead to use this expression.&rdquo; Christianity is veiled and has not seen the matter of eating Jesus. We thank the Lord that He has opened our eyes to see this truth in the Bible. John 6:57 in the Chinese Union Version of the Bible reads, &ldquo;He who eats My flesh&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;he who eats Me.&rdquo; The translators added the word <em>flesh</em> because they did not see this truth and dared not translate what was written. However, adding the word <em>flesh</em> changes the meaning. The Lord Jesus did not tell us to merely eat His flesh; He told us to eat Him.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s words are profound and difficult to comprehend. The Jews were therefore puzzled and contended with one another, saying, &ldquo;How can this man give us His flesh to eat?&rdquo; (v. 52). The disciples also murmured, saying, &ldquo;This word is hard; who can hear it?&rdquo; (v. 60). The Lord Jesus then said to them, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing&rdquo; (v. 63a). The Lord first spoke of bread, then of flesh and blood, and then of the flesh profiting nothing because it is the Spirit who gives life. The Lord&rsquo;s words indicate that He is not only the bread of the vegetable life and the bread of the animal life; He is also the Spirit. For the Feast of the Passover the Jews killed a lamb, shed its blood, and then ate its flesh. This lamb is a shadow of Christ. The Lord Jesus is the real Passover lamb who was slain for the shedding of His blood. However, we cannot eat His physical flesh, so He became the life-giving Spirit for our enjoyment. Therefore, He said, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order to understand the revelation in John 6, we must consider these key words. The Lord Jesus is the bread of life. This bread is also flesh for the accomplishing of redemption. Furthermore, in resurrection He became the Spirit for us to have life. But even the Spirit is abstract and difficult to comprehend. Therefore, in the second part of verse 63 the Lord went on to say, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; This indicates that as the Spirit, He has become the words that He speaks to us. The words that I speak come out of me, so my words are me. If I stand here for an hour without speaking, there is no way for you to know me. When I open my mouth and speak, my words become my expression because they are me. The Lord Jesus is bread, the Spirit, and the Word. When we receive His words, we receive the Spirit, and the Spirit becomes life to us. This life is our supply and consequently becomes our element. Hence, to receive His words is equivalent to eating Him.</p><h2 class="head2">Eating the Lord by Praying over His Words</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is our spiritual vitamins. He is the bread of the vegetable life and the bread of the animal life in order to be our supply. He supplies us through His words. When His words enter into us, they are spirit. When we speak forth His words into others, His words become spirit again. When I pray, &ldquo;Lord, You are the bread of life,&rdquo; I receive the word, and the Spirit, who is life, becomes my supply. When I release this supply of life, the Spirit enters into others as the word. Hence, the word and the Spirit are one.</p>
<p>The Scriptures are the Lord&rsquo;s words, and to receive His words is to eat Him. Therefore, we need to read the Scriptures daily and turn them into prayer. This is what we call pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s words. God is Spirit, and He is embodied in the Word. If we did not have the Bible, it would be very difficult for us to understand the Spirit, and consequently we would not be able to touch God. God is Spirit. But the Spirit is mysterious and abstract. We thank the Lord that the Spirit is in the Word, the Bible, which has a definite form. We can touch God in any verse of any chapter in the Bible. Genesis 1:1 says, &ldquo;In te beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; We should not only read this verse; we should also pray, &ldquo;God! In the beginning, oh, in the beginning God! You are the beginning. You are the beginning of everything, and You are the beginning in my living. Be my beginning today. You are my God, my beginning. You were in the beginning, and You are my beginning.&rdquo; By praying in this way, we will receive light and be supplied. Through pray-reading, the words in the Bible become the Spirit, and we are supplied with life.</p>
<p>Dr. Hu Shih was a famous philosopher in modern China who commended the Chinese Union Version of the Bible as a great accomplishment for the Chinese language. However, what he commended was the letter, because he remained unsaved. He knew the Bible in letter, not according to the Spirit. Once while I was preaching the gospel in the villages, I met a group of elderly sisters who had very limited education. They had learned only a few verses, including, &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son&rdquo; (John 3:16), and &ldquo;Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners&rdquo; (1 Tim. 1:15). When they prayed with these verses, the Spirit came forth, and I was supplied. Dr. Hu Shih had a doctorate degree, but if he were to talk about the Bible, the Spirit would not be conveyed. In contrast, when these illiterate elderly sisters prayed over the Bible, I was supplied. This is to experience the Lord&rsquo;s words being spirit and life.</p>
<p>I hope that instead of becoming doctors of philosophy, we would be people who pray-read the Bible. Then the words of the Bible will become spirit and life (John 6:63). The Bible, including both the Old Testament and the New Testament, contains the words spoken to us by the Lord. In Matthew 4:4 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.&rdquo; This quotation from Deuteronomy 8:3 shows that the Lord acknowledged the Old Testament as the Word of God. This verse also indicates that we should not only read the Word; we should also pray-read the Word. By pray-reading the Word, it becomes our spiritual food.</p>
<p>Let me repeat, God&rsquo;s Word is not only for us to gain knowledge but also for us to receive as food. Do we gain knowledge, or do we receive food when we read the Bible? For nearly ten years after my salvation I read the Bible diligently. I would even lose my temper if my mother interrupted me to eat a meal. This Bible reading was not profitable, because it killed me and caused me to lose my temper. We should not take this way to receive the Bible. We need to study the Bible for life, not for knowledge.</p>
<p>As a result of such a background, I did not lead the saints in Taiwan merely to study the Bible. Instead, I led them to have the life-study of the Bible, and I later also used the term <em>pray-read.</em> When we read the Bible, we should not simply use our eyes to see or our mind to think. Rather, we should use our spirit to pray in order to receive what we read. Through prayer the words in the Bible convey the Spirit and thus supply us with life and become our spiritual constitution. As a result, we are people who are mingled with the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING GOD BEING THE PROPER WAY<br />
FOR BELIEVERS TO MEET AND SERVE</h2>
<p>The chorus of hymn #450 in the Chinese hymnal says, &ldquo;Spirit begets spirit, and spirit worships Spirit, / Thus I am filled with the Spirit; / The Spirit becomes the word with abundant life / Flowing forth rivers of living water.&rdquo; This chorus was written not according to someone&rsquo;s imagination; it is from our experience. The Spirit has regenerated us, so we can worship the Spirit of God with our human spirit. This is the way for our entire being to be filled with the Spirit. The Spirit is also the word to supply us with abundant life. Hence, rivers of living water can flow out of us to supply and water others.</p>
<p>This should be the condition of our meetings. Sometimes the weather is not good, but we still come to the meetings, because the purpose of our meetings is to eat the Lord, to drink Him, and to enjoy Him. We also meet to supply one another with the flow of living water. Stanza 4 of <em>Hymns,</em> #501 says, &ldquo;Thy Spirit touched, Thy word received, / Thy life in me is thus conceived.&rdquo; When we receive the word, we touch the Spirit in the word and are inwardly supplied. We should eat, drink, and enjoy the Lord not only in the meetings but also in our daily life so that He can become our supply. This is a practical way to experience the Triune God as life.</p>
<p>We must be people who enjoy God so that we can meet and serve properly. Suppose there is a prayer meeting tonight, but instead of enjoying the Lord the first thing in the morning, we are busy preparing for the day and rush off to work. If we are busy for eight hours without enjoying the Lord, by the time we return home after work, we will be too tired to attend the meeting. Even if we go, we will not have any energy, nor will we have the Spirit or the word. Our spirit will be &ldquo;deflated&rdquo; like a flat tire. Hence, we must force ourselves to utter a few words, &ldquo;Lord, thank You for gathering us together; what a grace!&rdquo; Some may say that this is better than nothing, but can such a meeting be considered a prayer meeting?</p>
<p>In changing the way that we meet, it is important that everyone functions; we should not have only one person speaking while the rest listen. To have one person speak means that one person is a pastor, and to have the rest listening means that they stop serving as priests and that their function is annulled. If we desire to function in the meeting, we must enjoy the Lord in our daily life. We cannot function without enjoying the Lord, just as it is difficult for us to function when our physical body is hungry, thirsty, and has no energy.</p>
<p>In order to cope with such a situation, people think that the best way is to have a gifted person give a wonderful message every Lord&rsquo;s Day. However, the more believers listen to such messages, the more deadened they become, and the less they function. This fills me with grief. The church in Taipei is the birthplace of my ministry. I witnessed the marriage of many saints there, and some of their sons have even become elders. However, the saints there cannot speak the truth with clarity. I blame myself for taking the wrong way of producing a group of co-workers who minister the word on the Lord&rsquo;s Day while the saints come merely to listen.</p>
<p>There is a brother who has served as a co-worker for over thirty years and has been sent to seven different localities. In every place he was responsible to give the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning message. Therefore, every Saturday night he had to search the ministry books and compose a message. This was a suffering to him. It was also a suffering for him to stand on the platform and give the message. But now he is released because we no longer meet in the way of one man speaking; instead, we can all function. In order to function in the meeting, we need to enjoy God as our life. This is the proper way for believers to meet and to serve.</p><h2 class="head1">EATING THE LORD</h2>
<p>Our Lord is edible and drinkable. We eat the Lord through His word and drink Him by calling on His name. Isaiah 12:3-4 says, &ldquo;You will draw water with rejoicing / From the springs of salvation, /...Give thanks to Jehovah; call upon His name!&rdquo; Here calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name is linked to drinking from the springs of salvation. To draw water from the springs of salvation is to drink, and the way to drink is to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name. Hence, when we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, we drink the Lord.</p>
<p>This kind of drinking also includes eating. When children drink milk, they are also eating. Milk is not only a beverage; it is also food. It is not sufficient to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name; we must match our calling with His word. Sometimes when we call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; we are so joyful that we praise, worship, or even give thanks with His words. We may say, &ldquo;You are the bread of life, and he who eats You will live because of You!&rdquo; This is to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name and enjoy His word. Calling is drinking, and enjoying the word is eating. Hence, when we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name and pray-read the Word, we eat of Him and also drink of Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MOST EXCELLENT WAY OF PRACTICE</h2>
<p>Eating and drinking to enjoy the Lord are like our physical eating and drinking and therefore must be done at fixed times and should neither be too much nor too little. In order to have a healthy body, we should eat small portions many times a day. We should not eat too much each time but should eat until we are eighty percent full. The later it is in the day, the less we should eat. The same applies to calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name and pray-reading His Word. Every day we should spend time early in the morning to read the Word, but we should not spend too much time reading. We should also call and pray while we read. Immediately after I was saved, I received the help to read through the Bible once a year. This is a very good practice. I have also helped others to do the same. Although this is beneficial, it mainly gives people knowledge, not enjoyment. It is possible to read a long portion without receiving the life supply. Now we know that we only need to spend ten minutes in order to pray-read two verses. Everyone is busy in the morning; some go to work, and others go to school. Although we do not have much time, we can still set aside ten minutes to pray-read two verses. After pray-reading we will have a sufficient supply.</p>
<p>Whether or not we spend ten minutes to pray-read the Word makes a big difference in our day. Without this time our day will not be profitable. Pray-reading and calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name change our entire being. We will not lose our temper as we used to, nor will we be as anxious as before, and overcoming will become something spontaneous. Therefore, the first thing that we should do every morning is to enjoy the Lord. Then we can exercise to live in the spirit and walk according to the spirit. In this way we will experience the infilling of the Spirit spontaneously, and if necessary we will also be filled with the Spirit outwardly; that is, we will have the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. As a result, we will be able to preach the Lord Jesus with boldness. Furthermore, we will no longer speak the same old things; instead, we will be filled with wisdom and will touch people.</p>
<p>If we walk in this way the whole day, we may be tired in the evening, yet our spirit will still be strong. Although we may feel tired, we can continue because our spirit is strong. We will still want to meet either with our family or with the saints in our small group or in a larger meeting. Furthermore, we will be energized to open and function by praying and supplying others. If all the saints would supply one another in this way, everyone would be supplied. Even if only half of those in attendance function, that meeting would be brought to the third heaven.</p>
<p>Such a meeting would be unlike our past situation in which we sat deadened in a meeting. Sometimes a prayer meeting was supposed to begin at 7:30 P.M., but at 7:37 the saints were still waiting for the responsible brothers to take the lead. The responsible brothers would reluctantly call a hymn, because they did not have a definite inspiration. After singing we would pray formally for the items on the prayer list. Such meetings were destined to die because the saints were taking a dead way and had a dead living. These saints were not helped to enjoy the Lord, and they did not talk about the Lord in their daily life; thus, their meetings were not living. Only when we experience the Triune God as life and exercise to enjoy the Lord can our meetings be fresh and living.</p>
<p>The unique way to experience the Triune God as our life is to enjoy Him. We must spend time to enjoy Him. Our calling on the Lord and our enjoying Him please the Lord. Do not think that we need to do something for the Lord or offer something to Him. What we do for Him may not necessarily please Him, and what we offer to Him may not be acceptable to Him, but our enjoying the Lord pleases Him and is acceptable to Him (Psa. 116:12-13). Every mother is pleased when her children enjoy a meal that she has prepared for them. A mother&rsquo;s joy is not in receiving presents but in her children enjoying a meal that she has prepared.</p>
<p>We often make the mistake of coming to the Lord to do something for Him or to offer something to Him when we have not enjoyed Him. This is religious and does not please Him. As lovers of the Lord, we should not focus on doing things or on offering something; we should enjoy Him first. Every morning upon rising, we need to enjoy Him until our spirit is fanned into flame. As a result, we will be able to walk according to the spirit, to speak the Lord&rsquo;s words from our spirit, and to proclaim Him to people during the day. Furthermore, the Spirit will prevail in us, and we will be filled with the Spirit. Then in the evening we will be able to attend the meeting and to function in the meeting. This is the way for our meetings to be delivered from the forms of Christianity. Otherwise, regardless of how much we try to change our method, we will have a change in name only. It is not a matter of changing a method but of living Christ. We must live a life of enjoying the Triune God as our life. Then our meetings will become a fresh and rich testimony of our living as well as a declaration of our living.</p>
<p>We thank the Lord that He is the Spirit and the Word. Moreover, He has given us His name. Now we have the Spirit, the Bible, and the Lord&rsquo;s name. Our need is to spend some time to exercise our spirit and enjoy the Lord. We do not need to spend too much time. We only need to use ten minutes to contact and enjoy the Lord in the morning. It is best to also set aside a few minutes to enjoy the Lord during the day. This will affect our entire day, and it will also influence our meetings and our service. With such a living we will be equipped to practice the new way, the God-ordained way of preaching the gospel, having home meetings, and functioning in larger meetings. The practice of the new way depends on our experiencing the Triune God as our life. I hope that the saints will receive these words and exercise to be persons who enjoy God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOING DOOR-TO-DOOR TO VISIT PEOPLE<br />
AND LEAD THEM TO THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 15:4-5, 16; Mark 16:15-16; Matt. 28:18-20; Gen. 3:7-9; 1 Tim. 1:15; Luke 19:5-6, 9-10; John 4:3-7; Luke 9:1-4; 10:1-6; Acts 16:13-15; Rom. 12:1; 8:4; Acts 13:52; 4:8, 31; Phil. 1:27; 2 Tim. 1:8</h1>
<h2 class="head1">SALVATION CAUSING PEOPLE<br />
TO BE FILLED WITH JOY</h2>
<p>The focus in our practice of the new way is to go door-to-door in order to visit people and lead them to the Lord. Going door-to-door is to visit people and lead them to salvation. The Lord Jesus lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, of which the last three and a half years were the period of His ministry. During this time He preached the word to many, and after He was resurrected from the dead, His parting word to His disciples was, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations&rdquo; (Matt. 28:19). A common characteristic of Christians is that they love to see people receive salvation. You may be zealous, indifferent, uplifted, or depressed, but as long as you are a Christian, you are filled with joy when you see someone receive salvation.</p>
<p>I have preached the gospel in different situations: in large meetings and in small gatherings, in meetings that were filled with excitement and in meetings that were calm and quiet. The first time I preached the gospel in a large gathering was in a basketball stadium in Taipei in 1958 with over ten thousand in attendance. Last year in Taipei we preached the gospel specifically to high-school students, with approximately fifteen thousand in attendance. Probably two-thirds of the students stood up at the end as an expression of their desire to receive the Lord.</p>
<p>Regardless of the occasion, a person who is saved rejoices, and those who witness his salvation also rejoice. Every believer has the desire to preach the gospel. We know that preaching the gospel is good and right, but we often have many reasons that discourage us from preaching the gospel. In truth, however, there is only one reason&mdash;our spirit is low. When our spirit is uplifted, we do not have problems, but when our spirit is low, everything poses a problem. A common excuse for not preaching the gospel is, &ldquo;I am not in the mood,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I do not have a heart to preach the gospel.&rdquo; Preaching the gospel, however, is not a matter of being in the mood or of having a heart; it is a matter of whether or not we are burning in spirit.</p>
<p>I have over sixty years of experience in preaching the gospel. The first time that I preached the gospel, I went by myself to the villages. I had been saved for less than a year and was not quite twenty years old, but I began preaching the gospel. I wrote a gospel tract entitled <em>The Wonderful Way for Souls to Be Saved</em> and printed the title in big characters on pink paper. It was very attractive. I went by myself every Lord&rsquo;s Day to the villages. Although I did not have any companions, my heart was burning within me. I would leave early in the morning and walk for several hours, speaking the gospel to whomever I met. The villagers thought that I was strange and wondered why I spoke to everyone. At first they could not understand what I was saying, but they listened attentively because they felt that what I spoke was reasonable and that I was educated.</p>
<p>I did not have enough experience at that time, nor was there anyone who could teach me. Today we are blessed because we are being taught how to prepare for the gospel. At that time I did not know how to prepare for the gospel. Furthermore, after leading people to salvation, I did not know how to baptize them or where to baptize them. I did not have anyone to assist me. Although I walked several hours to the nearby villages, preached the gospel for the whole day, and was exhausted by the time I walked back home, there was an unspeakable joy in me. Hence, if we desire to be rejoicing Christians, we need to lead people to salvation. Once we stop leading people to salvation, our joy disappears.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING APPOINTED AND COMMANDED<br />
TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals that the Lord has appointed and commanded us to preach the gospel. The Lord appointed us to bear fruit (John 15:16), and He commanded us to proclaim the gospel and to disciple all the nations (Matt. 28:18-20). Therefore, preaching the gospel is not of our own initiation; it is the Lord&rsquo;s commission to us.</p>
<p>The four Gospels, particularly the Gospel of John, contain a charge from the Lord concerning the gospel. We need to be impressed deeply with this matter. The Lord says that He is the vine and that we are His branches (15:5). The branches of the vine are special. When I was young, there was a vineyard in the courtyard of our house. Vines do not have pretty flowers; a person must look closely in order to notice the flowers. Hence, they are not like peach, apricot, or apple trees. Furthermore, unlike pine trees, cypresses, and firs, vines are not for producing wood. The branches of the vine have just one purpose&mdash;bearing fruit. When the Lord Jesus spoke concerning the vine in John 15, His emphasis was on fruit-bearing.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Branches of the Vine for Fruit-bearing</h2>
<p>In verse 4 the Lord said, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you.&rdquo; In order for us to abide in the Lord, we should be like branches that remain in the vine. Such branches are supplied with sap, which includes the riches of the vine&rsquo;s life and nature, in order to grow. The growth of the branches has an outflow, an expression, which is the bringing forth of clusters of grapes. Strictly speaking, the word <em>cluster</em> is used to describe how the grapes are borne by the branches of the vine. The branches of peach trees and apple trees do not bear clusters of fruit; only vines have branches that bear fruit in clusters. A vine tree would not look nice if each branch bore only one grape. Every branch of a vine has at least a few clusters of fruit, and every vine tree has many branches. Therefore, when we look at vine trees that are growing on trellises, we notice clusters of grapes. This shows that bearing fruit is the purpose of the branches of the vine.</p>
<p>Our relationship with the Lord is not like the relationship between two friends, nor is it like the relationship between students and their teacher. Our relationship with the Lord is like the relationship between the branches and the vine tree. He is the vine, and we are the branches. Since we are branches, what is our purpose? The branches of the vine are not suitable to be used as wood. They cannot be used even for fuel because they are hard to burn. When the branches of the vine become useless, they are thrown away. Hence, it is not a wonder that every branch that does not bear fruit will be taken away (v. 2). We are branches, and our responsibility is to bear fruit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Bearing Fruit Meaning<br />
to Lead People to the Lord</h2>
<p>Among Christians there are two main understandings of bearing fruit. One group of Christians says that <em>fruit</em> in John 15 denotes moral virtues, such as patience, humility, and honoring one&rsquo;s parents. Thus, to bear fruit is to live out these virtues. I agreed with this understanding when I was a young believer. Another group says that believers are branches of the Lord, who is the vine. Therefore, to bear fruit is to lead people to salvation.</p>
<p>Most people lean toward the first understanding, because of the tendency to explain the Bible according to one&rsquo;s situation. The kind of person that we are determines the way that we understand the Bible. Even if two people were to read the same version of the Bible, they would understand it in different ways. Sisters tend to have one explanation, and brothers tend to have a different explanation. Believers tend to say that fruit-bearing denotes the virtues of our character. Such an explanation is for our convenience. This understanding means that we do not need to struggle to go forth, nor do we need to labor; instead, we can stay at home and be lazy. Such a believer may claim that he is humble and full of endurance. He may not revile when he is reviled, and he may not get angry. Therefore, he has clusters of fruit all over him. It is easy and convenient to bear this kind of fruit. If fruit-bearing is to lead people to salvation, we would all be exposed.</p>
<p>We need to examine our conscience before the Lord. We need to ask ourselves, &ldquo;How many people have I led to salvation?&rdquo; Many people have been saved for more than ten years, but they have not yet led two people to salvation. Most of us would have to confess that we have not led even one person to salvation.</p>
<p>An elder recently testified that he has served as an elder in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for twenty years, but he has not led one person to salvation. It is hard to believe that an elder who is among us has not brought one person to the Lord in twenty years. Another brother has been saved for many years and preaches the gospel zealously, but he has not been able to lead others to be baptized. I believe that this has been our situation.</p>
<p>Such a situation indicates that although the Lord has planted a vineyard here with numerous branches, there are few grapes. Some branches have only one grape, and some branches are bare; they do not have even one grape. This is our condition. We moved to Anaheim in 1974. At that time about one thousand saints from different places formed seven local churches in this area. However, there were not many new believers among us. After ten years I began to notice our barrenness and felt that this situation could not be tolerated. The churches have remained, but the number of saints had decreased to under a thousand. This was also the situation in the Far East. Then I woke up and realized that something is wrong; instead of bearing fruit, we are caring only for the meetings. As a result, we have become experts and professionals concerning going to meetings. Every year we meet zealously at least four times per week, but we do not bear fruit. In October of 1984 I realized that we can no longer take this way. Hence, I went back to the Bible to find out what the Bible says about fruit-bearing and to understand why we were not bearing fruit.</p><h2 class="head2">Our Destiny Being to Go Forth and Bear Fruit</h2>
<p>If we take a deeper look at John 15, we will see that fruit-bearing does not denote the virtues in the believers&rsquo; living, because in verse 16 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit.&rdquo; Some versions of the New Testament translate <em>go forth</em> as &ldquo;go,&rdquo; but according to the Greek text, the proper translation is &ldquo;go forth.&rdquo; <em>Go forth</em> implies a geographical distance. To bear the fruit of virtues in our living does not require us to go forth. We can stay at home and be meek. If everyone is trying to push forward, but I yield and withdraw, I am being humble and expressing more virtues. If it is merely a matter of bearing fruit, it can be explained as bearing the fruit of virtues in our living. However, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain.&rdquo; This refers to the need of the branches in the vine to bear grapes, that is, our need to lead people to be saved. Preaching the gospel is not merely to proclaim and explain the truth; rather, preaching the gospel is the issue of the outflow of life. Furthermore, we do not ask people to come to us; rather, we need to go forth, to approach them. Approaching people is for saving them; without our going forth to people, we cannot save them. This was why the Lord Jesus said that we need to go forth and bear fruit. Bearing fruit is a divine mandate, and it is our destiny because we are branches. Branches in the vine must bear fruit. In order to bear fruit, we must go forth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Going Forth to Preach the Gospel<br />
Being the Lord&rsquo;s Commission to Us</h2>
<p>In Mark 16:15 the Lord charged the disciples to &ldquo;go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation.&rdquo; This verse says to preach the gospel to all the creation, not only to all people. The Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;The gospel should be proclaimed everywhere. Not only human beings need to hear the gospel; all creation needs to hear the gospel.&rdquo; This is how we should preach the gospel. Many years ago I used to say that we should preach the gospel every day and that if we cannot find a human being, we should preach to the cats and dogs. I was not confident when I said this, because I did not yet understand the Lord&rsquo;s word in Mark 16. However, I now have the confidence to say that if we can preach the gospel to cats and dogs, we can surely preach the gospel to human beings. If we cannot find any cats or dogs, we can preach the gospel to the furniture in our home. I have never preached the gospel to a pine tree, but I have often preached to the ocean. I learned to preach the gospel by speaking to the ocean, because in my early days of serving the Lord I had a hard time speaking in front of people. If we would preach the gospel to creation, we will surely have a desire to preach the gospel to people in order to lead them to be baptized so that they may be saved.</p>
<p>In Matthew 28:18-19 the Lord said to the disciples, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord has commissioned us to go forth; hence, we must obey. The Lord&rsquo;s word here indicates that we should go and disciple the nations with His authority. In order to disciple the nations, we need authority so that they can be baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, that is, into the Triune God. We must accept this clear and solemn charge.</p>
<p>As branches of the vine, our destiny is to go forth and bear fruit. As far as the Lord is concerned, He has commissioned us to proclaim the gospel to the nations, to disciple them and to baptize them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. If we cannot find any human beings, we should proclaim the gospel to creation. Of course, if we were not Christians, if we were not saved, we would not be held accountable to the Lord for not preaching the gospel. However, since we are saved, we cannot resign from preaching the gospel. One day we will meet the Lord and give Him an explanation. On the one hand, preaching the gospel is something that we must do in our Christian life; we do not have any excuses. On the other hand, we love to preach the gospel because it gives us joy. I hope that after this fellowship we will not neglect preaching the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S WAY</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals the Lord&rsquo;s way to preach the gospel. Christianity has been on the earth for two thousand years and has been brought to every country in the world. There are now numerous Christian groups and many different ways to preach the gospel. I was brought into Christianity when I was a young boy, and I saw many ways of gospel preaching. After I left mainland China and moved overseas, I heard that a certain Christian group would preach the gospel to people by playing a game of basketball for them. I will not criticize this, because it is a method of gospel preaching. However, the Bible is not silent concerning how we should preach the gospel. The Bible reveals that there is a definite way to preach the gospel, which was the Lord&rsquo;s practice. Since the Lord appointed and commanded us to preach the gospel, He must have a way. He does not require us to discover a way to preach the gospel. Regrettably, Christianity has changed numerous things in the Bible, including the way to preach the gospel.</p><h2 class="head2">God Approaching Man</h2>
<p>For decades I have been studying the Lord&rsquo;s way to preach the gospel. While reconsidering this matter, I discovered new light that I had not seen previously. Immediately after man&rsquo;s fall, God came to visit man. After Adam and Eve fell, they sewed fig leaves together to cover their shame, their sin (Gen. 3:7). Then God came to them and called Adam, saying, &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; (v. 9). The first time that the gospel was preached in the universe, God came to where the sinner was; the sinner did not go to where God was. Of course, God needs sinners to approach Him, but He first approaches a sinner so that the sinner can approach Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Coming among Men through Incarnation</h2>
<p>Four thousand years later the God who personally visited fallen Adam not only visited mankind but even entered into humanity by putting on the flesh and becoming a man in order to dwell among men for thirty-three and a half years (John 1:1, 14). The Bible says, &ldquo;Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners&rdquo; (1 Tim. 1:15), and &ldquo;the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost&rdquo; (Luke 19:10). The first step in His coming is to seek those who are lost, and the second step is to save them. Every unbeliever is lost, and the Lord wants to come to where they are to seek and save them. This may be likened to a shepherd seeking the sheep that have strayed off and bringing them back to the flock.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Saving People by Going Forth<br />
and Preaching the Gospel to Them</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus was qualified to carry out His ministry when He was thirty years old; hence, He went forth to work. The main thing that He did was to proclaim the gospel by going to people instead of asking them to come to Him. He went time after time. Luke 19 and John 4 are two examples of the Lord going forth to preach the gospel. In Luke 19 the Lord Jesus was passing through Jericho, and Zaccheus wanted to see Him. Due to his small stature, Zaccheus climbed up in a sycamore tree, and when the Lord Jesus noticed Zaccheus, He said to him, &ldquo;Today I must stay in your house&rdquo; (v. 5). The Lord did not consider it enough to see Zaccheus; He wanted to visit Zaccheus in his house. In John 4 the Lord Jesus had to pass through Samaria and went to Sychar, where He waited by Jacob&rsquo;s well for an immoral woman to come draw water from the well. The Lord Jesus used this opportunity to preach the gospel to her. This shows that the Lord&rsquo;s way was not to invite people to come and listen to the gospel but to go to where people were and preach the gospel to them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Disciples Doing What the Lord Did</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus was not the only one with this practice; He also asked the disciples to do the same. He first sent out twelve disciples to go two by two (Matt. 10:1-4; Mark 6:7), and He also sent out seventy disciples two by two (Luke 10:1). When He sent them, He said, &ldquo;Go; behold, I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves...Into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace to this house. And if a son of peace is there, your peace shall rest upon it; but if not, it shall return upon you&rdquo; (vv. 3, 5-6). The Lord sent the disciples as lambs in the midst of wolves, and as they went from house to house, they would eventually find the sons of peace. The disciples were sheep in the midst of wolves, but there were sons of peace among the wolves. When we go to knock on doors, people may slam the door in rejection or speak evilly of us. But one of the houses we visit will be the home of sons of peace, and we may gain three persons there. This may seem unbelievable, but it is our experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXAMPLE IN ACTS</h2>
<p>In the four Gospels the Lord Jesus preached the gospel by going to visit people. In Acts the apostles had the same practice. Paul did not practice what most preachers do today. He did not go to a locality and build a place for holding church meetings and then invite people to come and listen to his sermons. In Philippi he went to a place of prayer outside the gate by the river in order to visit the seekers of God who had gathered to pray (16:13). Building a place for meetings and inviting people to hear the gospel is troublesome, requires a great deal of preparation, and involves a large number of people. In contrast, it was very convenient for Paul to find people by the river. This can be compared to our going out to knock on doors. If we move to a new place, we can go out the next day to knock on doors and baptize people. This is the example that Paul left for us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TESTIMONIES</h2>
<p>An elder in a church went to the training in Taipei and learned how to go door-knocking, and he became &ldquo;addicted.&rdquo; Now he eagerly waits for the evening so that he can go out to knock on doors and baptize people. He has even considered moving to Taipei because it is easier to knock on doors there. Sometimes after knocking on one door, you can baptize two people, and after knocking on another door, you can baptize three more people. Some saints were able to baptize twenty people in one night. The saints have also encountered negative situations, such as being rejected, reviled, and spurned and having the door slammed in their face. However, the Lord did not say that He sent the disciples out in the midst of gentlemen; He sends us into the midst of wolves (Luke 10:3). Hence, we should not be bothered, because the Lord has warned us beforehand.</p>
<p>Christianity does not seek out the sons of peace. Formerly, we made this same serious mistake: we asked people to come to us for the gospel; we did not go to them. We built large meeting halls, invited someone who was eloquent, burdened, and competent to speak the gospel, and invited people to come and listen. We exerted much effort to invite guests by putting advertisements in newspapers and distributing tracts and invitations everywhere. In the early days there were not many cars in Taiwan, so we would hire pedicabs to bring people to the gospel meeting. When cars became popular, we hired taxis to bring people to the meeting. Those who were willing to come seemed to be doing us a great honor. Sometimes we also prepared a love feast and invited over a hundred people, but only ten would show up, and perhaps one or two would be baptized.</p>
<p>When we began the work in Taiwan, we told the saints to bring people to the gospel meetings. Sometimes six or seven hundred people were brought to the meetings, and up to two hundred would be baptized. We were even able to baptize over seven hundred people in one meeting. We brought forth many children, but in the end they &ldquo;died&rdquo; prematurely. Our mistake was that we were asking people to come to us, but the Bible says that we must go. It is difficult to invite people to come, but it is very easy to go to people where they are. This is confirmed by our experience.</p>
<p>In America there are restaurants that take orders by phone and then deliver the food to the customers. I was once in a place that had few hospitals. People there did not need to find a nurse or a doctor if they needed an injection. There was a person who rode a bicycle with the sign Injections in Your Home; he was willing to go to a home to take care of people. Based on this example, I would ask, &ldquo;Should we not be willing to go to people&rsquo;s homes to preach the gospel?&rdquo; I have discovered that the proper way to preach the gospel is to go to people&rsquo;s homes. John 4:35 says that the fields &ldquo;are already white for harvest,&rdquo; and Matthew 9:37 says, &ldquo;The harvest is great, but the workers few.&rdquo; There is harvest everywhere that is ready to be reaped, but we are still distributing invitations that ask the harvest to come to us. Eventually, no one will come. We need to go and reap the harvest.</p>
<p>I have good news to announce to you. From the second half of 1986 to the end of 1987, we held three terms of full-time training in Taipei. The trainees were required to go out door-knocking and to visit people, and they went &ldquo;from house to house&rdquo; (Acts 5:42). They knocked on approximately seven hundred fifty thousand doors and baptized forty thousand people. Through this we gained experience and learned that door-knocking works and is very effective. We have also learned that we should not baptize too many people in one evening, because we cannot take care of them. This can be compared to giving birth to too many children and not being able to give them proper care. I believe that only a few of those whom we baptized are not clear about their salvation. Without proper care some might lose contact with us after a few years, and they will stop meeting. However, they will not forget that they called on the Lord&rsquo;s name, were baptized, and are believers in the Lord. Once a person is saved, he is saved eternally.</p><h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL BEING AN ITEM<br />
IN THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; DAILY SPIRITUAL LIFE</h2>
<p>The proper way to preach the gospel as revealed in the Bible is to go and visit people. The question is whether we are willing to go. We need to ask ourselves whether we are saved, whether we belong to the Lord, whether we love Him, and whether we want to meet Him at His return. Since the answers to all these questions are affirmative, what will we tell the Lord at His return concerning His commission to us to preach the gospel?</p>
<p>Hence, we must have a new beginning to live a normal life before the Lord. We must not continue to live the way that we did in the past. At that time we knew that we needed to preach the gospel, but because we lacked enthusiasm and our spirit was low, we needed the gifted ones to stir us up. We no longer need to be stirred up; we only need to breathe. It is easier for us to breathe on our own than it is for us to be stirred up. Do not expect me to lead a revival meeting; I do not have such a burden. We need to live a normal life. A person cannot become strong and healthy in one day. The way to be healthy is to live a normal, regular life. Preaching the gospel is a normal item in the spiritual life of a Christian. It is not a special act.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO PREACH THE GOSPEL REGULARLY</h2>
<p>In order to have a normal spiritual life, we must first tell the Lord that we desire to live by preaching the gospel. People do not work seven days a week. In the United States people work only five days a week. If we are willing to preach the gospel, we have to consecrate ourselves to the Lord and set aside a little time to knock on doors every week. We simply need to be persistent. Furthermore, we must deal with the Lord before we go out. Strictly speaking, we should not wait until we are about to go out before we deal with the Lord. We should fellowship with the Lord and let Him deal with us daily. Before going out we should have further dealings with the Lord. Without sufficient prayer and dealings, we will not be filled with the Holy Spirit, and as a result, people will not open their hearts to us. When we have proper dealings with the Lord, people will open their doors and their hearts to us. Moreover, the Holy Spirit will be one with our speaking.</p>
<p>I can say assuredly that if we would practice going out once a week to preach the gospel, we would gain four people a year; we would lead them to salvation and meet with them once a week. Whether we would lead four people to be baptized within one week or would need to spend two months in order to gain them, we should not become self-satisfied or conceited to think that we can lead several more people to be baptized. According to the parable of the sower, many people will hear the gospel, but it will not bear fruit in everyone. Hence, we may gain six or seven people, but two or three of them might not remain. Whatever the case may be, we will gain at least four people every year if we practice this fellowship.</p>
<p>Every successful person does things in a normal, regular manner. A student who studies only when he is happy will never be able to obtain a doctorate degree. In order to be a successful student, a person must have a plan and regularly spend a substantial amount of time to study. Instead of studying until he is exhausted, he should study a little and rest a little. I hope that we will learn to preach the gospel in this way.</p>
<p>We love the Lord, but we did not receive definite help concerning preaching the gospel. The first time I went to the Philippines, I helped the saints determine how many people they would bring to the Lord within a year. Most of the saints promised to bring one person. However, the situation in the Philippines, Taiwan, and the United States is the same: everyone makes a resolution to bring one person to the Lord every year, but in the end, not one church has had success in this matter. I later realized that although I led the saints to preach the gospel, I did not give them a definite way to practice.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEFINITE STEPS FOR PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being Revived</h2>
<p>It is not difficult to preach the gospel, because it depends on our living. In order to preach the gospel, we first need to be revived; otherwise, our spirit will not be strong.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living an Overcoming Life</h2>
<p>After being revived, we need to live an overcoming life. Some people think that it is difficult to overcome. To live an overcoming life is to walk according to the spirit. When we get up every morning, we should first think of the Lord and call on His name and then spend ten minutes to read two verses and pray over them. By praying over the verses, we will be supplied with spiritual air, water, and bread. This is a good way to begin our morning. We also need to walk according to the spirit during the day. This is the way to have an overcoming living.</p>
<p>Without a good beginning we will not be able to overcome in our homes when dealing with our spouse or children, nor will we be able to overcome in our dealings with those outside our home. We might overcome gross sins, but we will fail in the trivial matters of our daily living. A brother might give his wife a rude stare when she says something inappropriate. This kind of response is of the devil. Some might even throw their chopsticks, shout abusively, or refuse to eat dinner. When we lack fellowship with the Lord and do not walk according to the spirit or live in the spirit, being rude or getting angry becomes our living. But if we have fellowship with the Lord and walk according to the spirit, we will not be able to stare rudely. When we live in the spirit, the Lord will not permit us to look at others&rsquo; shortcomings. He will cause us to look first at ourselves.</p>
<p>It is simple for Christians to live an overcoming life. I have been a Christian for more than sixty years. In my early years the books I read said that it is difficult to overcome and that we must endeavor, pray desperately, and fast repeatedly. But after I began pursuing and experiencing life, I realized that the authors of those books were blind guides leading people to walk blindly. Now I can say that overcoming is not difficult; it depends on whether or not we want to overcome. Suppose a person has been ill for many years, and there is now medicine that can heal his illness. If he wants the medicine and takes it, he will immediately be healed. The medicine will not heal him if he merely studies its content without taking it. As long as he will take the medicine, it will work even if he does not know what it is.</p>
<p>In an earlier chapter I pointed out that regeneration, the inward filling of the Holy Spirit, and the outward filling of the Holy Spirit are miraculously normal things. An overcoming life is also miraculously normal. The question is whether or not we want to live such a life. Perhaps some would say, &ldquo;We want to, but we do not understand it. We will accept it after we understand.&rdquo; There is no need to wait or to understand. On the day that Jesus went to Jericho, Zaccheus did not know who Jesus was. Zaccheus may have heard people saying that Jesus was good and therefore wanted to see Him. Thus, there is no need to understand; all that is required is that we receive.</p><h2 class="head2">Calling on the Lord&rsquo;s Name</h2>
<p>As long as we are willing to practice according to this fellowship, we will overcome. Every morning we need to call, &ldquo;Lord Jesus.&rdquo; It is not difficult to call on the name of the Lord. The Lord has done all the difficult work; He was crucified, bore our sins, and accomplished redemption for us. He was buried in the tomb, entered into Hades, and walked out of Hades for us. He also resurrected and ascended into heaven for us. He has accomplished this for us. He is the processed Triune God consummated as the life-giving Spirit. The God who created the heavens and the earth in Genesis 1:1 became breath in John 20. The Lord Jesus breathed into the disciples and said, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 22). This indicates that the Lord is the Spirit. Therefore, 1 Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; As the last Adam, the Lord became a life-giving Spirit through the processes of incarnation, death, and resurrection. This life-giving Spirit is just like air. Hence, we can call on Him and breathe Him in, that is, receive Him. Romans 10:13 says, &ldquo;Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved,&rdquo; and verse 12 says that the Lord is &ldquo;rich to all who call upon Him.&rdquo; When we call on Him, we are saved, and we enjoy Him.</p>
<p>If we would practice calling on the Lord in our daily living, we would live an overcoming life, and we would walk according to the spirit in all things, whether great or small. Our being happy because our spouse is rejoicing should be according to the spirit, and our being unhappy because our spouse is not rejoicing should also be according to the spirit. This is an overcoming life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living a Fruit-bearing Life</h2>
<p>The Lord has appointed us to bear fruit, and our destiny is to bear fruit. Living an overcoming life is the means for us to bear fruit. Our living must be to go forth to bear fruit. If we do not visit our neighbors and preach the gospel to them, we are indebted to them (1 Cor. 9:16; Rom. 1:14). We do not have any excuse. We also need to spread the gospel gradually to surrounding areas. This is a long-term matter. We cannot depend on so-called Christian revivals.</p>
<p>None of the revivals in Christianity has lasted for a long period. The most famous revival was the great Welsh Revival, which began around 1905. This revival was so prevailing that there was hardly an unsaved person in Wales during this time. However, that revival did not last longer than fifteen years. Today Wales is like any other heathen country. So-called revivals do not last. The revival that I am referring to in this fellowship is the revival that comes from fellowship with the Lord daily by drawing near to Him, walking according to the spirit daily, and living an overcoming life daily. Such a revival will last.</p>
<p>We need to be specific and set apart two to three hours every week to go out door-to-door to visit people. If we are willing to practice this, I can guarantee that we will gain four people in one year, and they will be reliable. According to the principle in Matthew 13, even if only one out of four persons is reliable, the church will increase onefold yearly. Because some saints are elderly, some are sick, and some have other situations, only half the saints in a locality might be able to go out and knock on doors to visit people. Or perhaps only one-fourth of the saints can go out. We cannot increase if no one is willing to go out. However, if we are willing to take this way, the church will have a fifty-percent rate of increase. This means that if there are one hundred people meeting today, next year there will be one hundred fifty, and the third year there will be two hundred twenty-five. In this way, the whole world can be saved in twenty-five to thirty years.</p>
<p>The problem is not on the Lord&rsquo;s side but on our side. It depends on whether or not we are willing. The truth in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is very clear, and our way is also clear. The question is whether or not we would cooperate with the Lord. This is not a short-term revival or a gospel festival. The human life does not depend on festivals. Although festivals are good and are an encouragement, for the long run we need to live a normal life. Our practice must not depend on festivals, because when the feasts are over, everything ends. We must continue steadfastly, just as we live our daily life.</p>
<p>Recently during the gospel festival in the churches in the San Gabriel Valley, over one hundred thirty people came from the church in San Francisco and were revived. I hope that such a revival will continue. However, after we are revived, we should not try to go out to knock on doors and gain twenty people in one day. It is more than enough if we gain one person per week. There are fifty-two weeks in a year. If we go out weekly to knock on doors, we will gain people, and we should begin to take care of them every week. This is the way for the church to have at least a fifty-percent rate of increase. Moreover, those who are added to the church will not be unreliable; rather, they will stand firm. After two years these new ones will also be able to go out and knock on doors to lead others to be saved. This is the definite way to practice preaching the gospel.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEADING NEW BELIEVERS TO MEET<br />
IN THEIR HOMES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 15:16; Acts 2:41, 46-47; 5:42; 16:15, 33-34; Matt. 18:20; Acts 12:12</h1>
<p>The title of this chapter is &ldquo;Leading New Believers to Meet in Their Homes.&rdquo; These words are simple, but for two thousand years the church has neglected meeting in the homes. Christianity pays attention only to worship services in a chapel. We have changed our terminology from <em>chapel</em> to <em>meeting hall</em> and from <em>worship service</em> to <em>meeting;</em> thus, we meet in a meeting hall. Strictly speaking, we are doing the same old thing but with a new label, because we focus on meeting in a meeting hall but neglect meeting with believers in their homes. This practice is not scriptural. In John 15:16 the Lord says, &ldquo;I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain.&rdquo; The Lord committed two matters to us: going forth to bear fruit and bearing remaining fruit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN ADDITIONAL WORD<br />
CONCERNING THE LORD&rsquo;S COMMISSION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Being the True Vine</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s words in the Gospel of John are simple yet profound. In particular, chapter 15 concerning the vine is rather simple, but the mystery of life contained in this chapter is profound. In verse 1 the Lord said that He is the true vine. There are innumerable vines in the universe, but there is only one true, genuine vine that has eternal value, and this vine is the Lord Jesus Himself. He is extraordinary, for He is God and also man. The statement <em>He is God</em> is simple, but it implies that He is the embodiment of the Triune God. God became a man; He had a physical human body. As the embodiment of the Triune God, Jesus possesses divinity as well as humanity. Divinity and humanity are mingled in Him; therefore, He is both God and man. Such a One is the true vine in the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Believers Being Branches</h2>
<p>As believers, we are not only the Lord&rsquo;s disciples; we are also branches in the true vine. This relationship shows that we are joined to the Lord in life. We are connected and mingled with Him as one to have the same life and the same living. The trunk and the branches of the vine have one life and one living. It is not possible for the trunk to have one way of living while the branches have another way of living. The trunk and the branches have one living, which is the outflow of the life that they possess. The practical expression of this outflow is fruit-bearing.</p>
<p>The destiny and responsibility of the branches of the vine are to bear fruit. If the branches do not bear fruit, they are useless and are not even good for fuel. The branches of the vine are good only for bearing clusters of fruit. When I was a young child, there was a vine in the courtyard of our house, and every year trellises were set up for the vine to spread and bear fruit. When there was a rich harvest of grapes, we could see clusters of grapes hanging from each of the branches on the trellises. This beautiful scene portrays the believers as branches of the Lord as the true vine bearing clusters of fruit.</p>
<p>We thank the Lord that by His mercy we believed in Him and were saved. We now attend the meetings with rejoicing. It is wonderful that we can sing, &ldquo;Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine.&rdquo; However, the Lord Jesus will ask, &ldquo;How many grapes are you bearing?&rdquo; Some of us may be bearing eight or ten grapes, but others may have only one grape, and still others may not have a single grape. This is our condition. If we were the keeper of a vineyard and noticed such a sad condition of a vine, would we not abandon it? The church is the Lord&rsquo;s vineyard, but do we have clusters of fruit? If we do not have clusters of fruit, what will the Lord do? Someone may say that he has twenty-eight grapes. Although twenty-eight seems like a large number, it is still a count of individual grapes. We should count grapes according to clusters, not individually. Is this our condition?</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Flourishing and the Decline of Christianity</h2>
<p>For the past three and a half years I have been collecting statistical data concerning Christianity in America and Great Britain. This data indicate that for a quarter of a century, from the end of World War II to the 1970s, the membership in the major Christian denominations in America and Britain has been decreasing rapidly. The statistics also show that after World War II Islam is the most prosperous major religion in the world. Four years ago it increased fivefold.</p>
<p>History shows that the spread of Christianity in the previous centuries was related to the spread of imperialism in weak and backward nations. Christianity took advantage of the situation, and the gospel was preached in those countries. In China the Western missionaries were sometimes considered to be higher than the emperors. Before the end of World War II the president of the United States, Mr. Roosevelt, proposed the abolition of all unequal treaties. Due to America&rsquo;s influence, other countries accepted this proposal. This is how many countries lost their colonies. Great Britain was known as an empire upon which the sun never set, but she lost nearly all her colonies. After some of the countries became self-governing, they closed their doors and rejected Christian missionaries. Therefore, the major denominations gradually lost their fields for overseas mission work.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the United States and in Great Britain the testimony of Christian evangelism is too poor. According to my observation, Christianity has not increased during the past twenty-six years in the United States; rather, it has been decreasing. This decline in numbers is unavoidable. Several gospel giants have been raised up, but they have not rescued the waning situation.</p>
<p>The leaders of the major denominations in America met together a couple of months ago to discuss how to evangelize the world by the year 2000. They concluded that there is a shortage of manpower. The Southern Baptist denomination has over ten million believers. There are close to sixty million believers in all the Protestant churches, and the Catholic Church has more than fifty million members. The United States has a population of approximately two hundred twenty million, and nearly half of them are Christians. Yet when the leaders came together to discuss how to evangelize the world, their conclusion was that they do not have the manpower. Where are the believers? They are going to worship services every week.</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Recovery Being at a Standstill</h2>
<p>Taiwan is the birthplace of my work in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery outside of China. Hall one of the church in Taipei was built under my supervision. I designed the blueprint. I began the work in Taiwan more than thirty-eight years ago on August 1, 1948. When I visited Taiwan three and a half years ago, I was shocked by the attendance figures. When I left Taiwan for America in 1961, there were over twenty thousand saints in the church in Taipei, and about one-fourth of them were active and meeting regularly. Twenty-three years later the number in the church in Taipei dropped to a little over ten thousand. When I inquired of the brothers, they said that quite a few had died, many had gone abroad, and others had moved or lost contact with us and could not be located. No matter how many reasons we may have, the unique reason for the decrease in the number of saints is our lack of fruit-bearing.</p>
<p>In the early days I worked in San Francisco in America. In 1958 some brothers requested me to appoint a few elders for the church. At that time there were over twenty saints meeting regularly. After thirty years the church has approximately two hundred saints, including Chinese and Caucasians. This is an increase, but it is very slow. This slow increase is due to our lack of fruit-bearing.</p>
<p>The brothers in Taiwan told me that they have baptized many people and brought many to salvation. Where are all these ones today? Most of them &ldquo;died&rdquo; prematurely because they lacked care. Hence, we have two weak points: we do not bear enough fruit, and our fruit does not remain.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Contradicting the Lord&rsquo;s Law</h2>
<p>These two weak points are the result of contradicting the Lord&rsquo;s law. The Lord commissioned us to go forth and bear remaining fruit. However, we made the big mistake of inviting people to come instead of going forth. After the previous message a saint testified that his small group had a love feast to preach the gospel. The sisters prepared several dishes, and the brothers gave out invitations to people, but eventually only two people came. Another brother testified that he also prepared love feasts for the gospel, but no one came. These things happen because we have contradicted the Lord&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s charge at the end of Matthew is a great word: &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations&rdquo; (28:18-19). We need to go by the authority that has been given to the Lord. At the end of Mark the Lord said, &ldquo;Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation&rdquo; (16:15). We have acted contrary to the Lord&rsquo;s law: instead of going forth, we ask and compel people to come. We exert much effort to drag people to hear the gospel. This is our first mistake.</p>
<p>It is true that some people come when we invite them. When I was in Taipei, we invited many people who came and were baptized, but few remained. If a hundred were baptized, they would eventually die one by one until less than five remained. The reason is that they were not given proper care. The new ones did not die immediately, but they died after a period of time. We must give newborn babes long-term care if we want them to remain. If we do not take care of them, we are contrary to the law of nature. This is our second mistake.</p>
<p>In 1984 I noticed that there was no increase in most of the churches in the East and in the West. The churches that had some increase had a very slow rate of increase. This situation in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not limited to one place; it is everywhere. In 1984 we had nearly eight hundred churches in six continents, but there has not been an increase in the number of saints. In other words, we are not bearing fruit, because we do not go forth.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that we must go forth. The Lord Jesus preached the gospel by coming down from heaven. From His point of view, He came to us. When He preached the gospel in His earthly ministry, He went from Galilee to the land of Judea and from the land of Judea to Galilee. He visited the home of Zaccheus, and He waited for the woman in Samaria. He went with the gospel. Later, the Lord sent out seventy disciples and charged them to go from house to house to look for the sons of peace. This is the principle in the Bible: go to preach the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">An Effective Way</h2>
<p>During the last one and a half years of the full-time training in Taipei, there have been about eight hundred trainees. Their experiences have helped us in our study of the new way in order to find out some guidelines. We discovered that many people will not get saved unless we visit them in their homes. Many of these people are college professors who are between fifty and sixty years old. These people would not come to a gospel event. However, we can gain them if we go to their homes. Going from house to house is the most effective way to find the sons of peace.</p>
<p>Six months ago more than fifteen hundred saints attended the summer training in Anaheim. Instead of having evening training meetings, we asked the trainees to form groups and go out to knock on doors. As a result, we baptized over thirty-seven hundred new ones, sixty percent of whom were Spanish-speaking people who were formerly Catholics. This news probably spread to the Catholic authorities, because in September and October of last year three hundred Catholic bishops gathered for a conference to discuss how to cope with this situation. As a conclusion to the conference, the chairman said, &ldquo;Unless a person goes out to knock on doors, he has not yet given himself to the gospel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the ten days of door-knocking during the summer training, we had an elders&rsquo; meeting for the elders in the United States. The elders admitted that the training brought great joy to all the saints. Based on the brothers&rsquo; fellowship, I said that our practice may be compared to the children of Israel keeping a feast; hence, we should practice door-knocking. Many localities responded to this fellowship. In September the churches in the San Gabriel Valley held a door-knocking festival, and many saints were revived. However, I am concerned that such a fire of revival may burn for only a moment, and then the saints will become colder than they were previously. Although it is good to have a festival, we need to live a normal life.</p>
<p>Six months ago over thirty-seven hundred people were baptized, and at least another eight hundred were baptized through them. Therefore, a total of forty-six hundred people are being taken care of by about seventy saints who finished two or three terms of full-time training in Taiwan. Babies need to be nourished; otherwise, they will die prematurely. As a result of the endeavoring of the seventy saints, about fifteen hundred new ones have remained. Half of them attend meetings about once or twice a month, so their situation is not too good. The other half, however, have home meetings at least once a week. These seven hundred are the best harvest. Through them several new local churches have been raised up. Other new ones have been added to existing churches.</p>
<p>Through the door-knocking festival that was carried out by the churches in the San Gabriel Valley, over one thousand people were gained. Some saints who have been to the training in Taipei went to San Gabriel to care for the new ones. Eventually, over two hundred new ones have remained, and the churches in Monterey Park and in San Gabriel City have been raised up. Therefore, within less than a year we gained around one thousand new ones in Southern California. This almost equals the total number of saints in all the churches in Southern California. In less than a year the churches have increased more than twofold. For the past fourteen years we have not had a one-percent increase, let alone a twofold increase, or an increase of one hundred percent. Through two door-knocking festivals we gained one thousand remaining fruit even though people rejected the gospel, and there were negative situations. This proves that knocking on doors is the most effective way. Visiting people in their homes is the most excellent way to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>This way is revealed in the Bible, and it is also logical. People do not come when we invite them; they do not want to come. But when we visit them, they are hesitant to refuse. If they refuse to open the door, we still can say a few words to them. It may be easier to knock on doors in Taiwan than in America. According to the statistics gathered by the training in Taipei, only three out of ten doors refused to open to us. Sometimes when someone opened the door, the saints simply stepped inside with smiles beaming on their faces. Once inside they would sit down and talk with the person for a short while and then bring out <em>The Mystery of Human Life.</em> In less than ten minutes this person would begin to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, and in another five minutes he would be baptized. For every twenty doors that we knocked on, at least one person was baptized. In the last year and a half we have knocked on seven hundred fifty thousand doors and baptized forty thousand people. We have knocked on some doors three or four different times. Some trainees knocked on the door of a home that is very close to the meeting hall, and the owner said, &ldquo;This is the fifth time you have come to knock on my door. I admire your persistence, so I have decided to be baptized. You do not have to persuade me anymore. If I am not baptized, you will come again.&rdquo; He knows us. Some may say that he was baptized because he was embarrassed to turn us down; therefore, he is not truly saved. However, according to the Lord&rsquo;s words, we do not have the right to discern between true believers and false believers (Matt. 13:24-30, 37-43). If someone calls on the Lord&rsquo;s name, confesses his sins, repents, and desires to be baptized, we should baptize him in the name of the Lord (Acts 8:36-38).</p>
<p>From our research we know that there will be one son of peace for every twenty doors that we knock on. Therefore, as long as there are twenty homes in an apartment building, we will baptize at least one person if we go there to knock on doors.</p>
<p>We should not be bothered if someone refuses to open the door or gives us a dirty look. Instead, we should politely say, &ldquo;We will come at another time.&rdquo; Door-knocking does not violate the law; hence, if he calls the policeman, we will not be arrested. If we visit him again, he may eventually &ldquo;surrender,&rdquo; accept, and become a son of peace. This is truly the best way. It is not a wonder that the Bible compares leading people to salvation to fishing. The most foolish way to go fishing is to prepare a lot of bait on the shore and ask the fish to jump out of the water to bite the bait. We must admit that we have been foolish. The Lord said that those who preach the gospel are fishermen, &ldquo;fishers of men&rdquo; (Matt. 4:19). We should therefore go to the fishpond to catch fish instead of foolishly asking the fish to jump out of the water.</p><h2 class="head2">The Most Profitable Way</h2>
<p>The most obvious benefit to door-knocking is that we bring joy and peace to people (Luke 10:5-6). To door-knock is to be a fisher of men in order to gain all kinds of fish, including big fish, small fish, good fish, and bad fish. We may gain medical doctors and professors and also people who steal. Someone may be contemplating suicide when we knock on his door and lead him to salvation. A couple may be quarreling and considering separation, but they are united when we knock on their door. We have many such testimonies. The testimonies of the forty thousand newly baptized believers are very inspiring. Door-knocking is a great benefit to human society.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Specific Steps for Practicing Door-knocking</h2>
<p>Door-knocking should not be done in a light way. We have learned a great deal concerning this. Every time we door-knock, we need to be formed into groups of three people: one elderly person, one middle-aged person, and one younger person. We should also be properly attired. If three husky young men dressed like hippies go out together to knock on doors, no one would dare to open the door to them. However, if an elderly saint, especially a sister, would knock on the door, people would readily open the door to her. Once the door is opened, the younger saint can immediately step to the front and do the speaking. The speaking of a young sister is pleasant to the ears. Even if she does not speak very well, people will still listen. We should also consider what we should say. We should not use our own words; rather, we should say what we were taught in the training and use <em>The Mystery of Human Life.</em> A college professor in his sixties may listen to and be subdued by a young sister speaking in a logical manner. Eventually, he will be led like a lamb to be baptized. Sometimes the wife who has not yet believed will help fill the bathtub with water. Then the brother in the group should do the baptizing. Such a coordination is wonderful and effective.</p>
<p>If we would go out in this way to knock on doors, people will not reject us. Even if they do not accept us, they will still be pleasant. Those who accept us will be very grateful. When we invite people to come to us, we are the ones who are grateful. However, when we knock on people&rsquo;s doors, they will be grateful because we will deliver the gospel, the truth, and the Bible to them. We are not giving them something insignificant; rather, we are giving them the Lord&rsquo;s name, His salvation, and the Triune God. These are great gifts. Someone may refuse today, but tomorrow he may consider letting us come in and talk with him. Someone may not open the door today, but the Holy Spirit will work in him and cause him to think, &ldquo;These people come to preach the gospel; they are giving me Jesus. Jesus is not bad. He is better than Buddha. Moreover, the Bible is the best book, and it contains the highest truths. I should listen to them.&rdquo; Although he is not clear, he may have such thoughts.</p>
<p>The trainees are rich in experience. When someone opens the door, the faces of the trainees are beaming with smiles. They know that they are meeting a son of peace. There was a newly married couple who had moved into their new home, but they felt that they needed a religion. After comparing the different religions, they considered Christianity to be the best, but they did not know how to join. This couple was so happy when the trainees knocked on their door. The trainees told them, &ldquo;You do not have to go join a religion. We can come to your home. It is very convenient.&rdquo; Sometimes a person rejects the trainees the first time but five days later receives them. Sometimes people are so grateful that they give the trainees gifts. There are innumerable testimonies. We could not have such results if we had invited people to come and listen to the gospel.</p>
<p>For this reason, many trainees who have gone door-knocking have become &ldquo;addicted.&rdquo; Every night they must go out to knock on doors and lead two or three people to be baptized; otherwise, they feel as though they are missing something. They have tasted the joy of preaching the gospel. There is an elderly sister who is eighty-five years old; she goes out to knock on doors in coordination with the younger saints. Because of her age, manner, and attire, every door opens for her. After entering the house, the young sister speaks, the elderly sister sits to the side and prays softly, and the middle-aged brother nods his head. This is the secret to our practice of door-knocking.</p>
<p>One very important point is that those who go out must rely on the Holy Spirit. Before going out to knock on doors, the trainees must spend twenty minutes to pray, thoroughly confess their sins, and ask for the filling of the Holy Spirit. This brings blessing to their door-knocking. We have the real things&mdash;the truth and the gospel. Mormons and Jehovah Witnesses do not have the real things. Therefore, our door-knocking will be effective.</p><h2 class="head1">SETTING UP MEETINGS<br />
IN THE NEW ONES&rsquo; HOMES</h2>
<p>After leading people to salvation through door-knocking, we should immediately set up a meeting in their home. This is to nourish them after begetting them. What we practiced in Taiwan was mainly an experiment in order to learn what was effective and efficient in door-knocking. Three terms of research have proven that door-knocking is effective and efficient. We gained more than forty thousand new ones, but only a little over six thousand have remained, because we do not have enough saints to take care of them. The other thirty-four thousand are not false ones; they did not remain because they were not cared for. Therefore, we should not baptize too many new ones, nor should we walk away fifteen minutes after someone is baptized. We have begotten too many babies and are unable to take care of them. Hence, we need to consider our capacity to nourish the new ones. We should not beget so many new ones if we are not able to feed them. Otherwise, they will die, and they will not be left with a good feeling.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Extending the Time of &ldquo;Delivery&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Begetting fewer for the sake of caring for them does not mean that we need to extend the time of &ldquo;delivery.&rdquo; We still need to practice leading people to be baptized within fifteen minutes. Prolonging the time does not necessarily mean that people will be saved. The shining of the light of the gospel and the strength of the power of the Spirit can cause a person to be saved and baptized within fifteen minutes.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Edifying New Believers<br />
Immediately after Their Salvation</h2>
<p>We should not leave immediately after leading someone to salvation. We need to sit down with him and his household for one hour to edify him. First, we should lead him to sing a hymn concerning the assurance and joy of salvation. Then we should ask him to pray and teach him to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name. We may say, &ldquo;Our Lord Jesus is the eternal God, but in order to save us, He became flesh and died on the cross for our sins. Then He was resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit. Today He entered into you as the Spirit. We thank the Lord that He created you with a human spirit. When you repented and confessed your sins, your conscience was enlivened, and you were washed by the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood. As a result, the life-giving Spirit entered into your spirit and is mingled with you as one spirit. Our pneumatic Lord has a name. Whenever we call on His name, we will enjoy and experience Him. The way to call on His name is to use our spirit and call from deep within, &lsquo;O Lord Jesus!&rsquo; This is like taking a deep breath. Then you will feel comfortable, at ease, peaceful, and joyful.&rdquo; After leading someone to be baptized, we must stay for an hour to teach him basic truths and help him to exercise his spirit. This will make him stable.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Teaching the New Believers<br />
in the Home Meetings</h2>
<p>We must &ldquo;strike while the iron is hot.&rdquo; We should not wait a week before going back to visit a new believer. Rather, after three days we should go back and teach him to read the Bible. After another three days we should teach him to sing hymns. It is best to visit a new believer ten times during the first month. This is the way to make him stable. After the first month, we can visit him once a week for half a year. This will establish him. Within the first six months we need to teach him how to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, to speak for the Lord, to testify, to read the Bible, and to receive light from the Lord. We should not bring him to the meeting hall or to the Lord&rsquo;s Day meetings. Rather, we need to set up a meeting in his home. We should gather his family, his spouse and children, together and help them to function in the meeting. We may even ask the little ones to pray and to sing. By functioning in this way, his family members who are not yet saved will be saved. This kind of home meeting is a church meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Changing Our Way of Meeting</h2>
<p>We must have a big change in the way that we meet. We cannot continue to meet as we have in the past, with a rigid and formal big meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning for everyone to come and listen to a message, a meeting in the evening for the Lord&rsquo;s table, a meeting for prayer on Tuesday night, and sometimes a meeting on Thursday night. We must be flexible and focus on the homes. After a new one is saved, we should not compel him to attend the church meetings; instead, we should immediately set up a meeting in his home to nourish, to teach, and to perfect him. Although this time should be flexible and according to the new one&rsquo;s convenience, we must meet in his home at least once a week. Such a practice will keep the new believers from dying prematurely.</p><h2 class="head2">Having a Definite Consecration<br />
for the Practice of the New Way</h2>
<p>If we love the Lord, we should respond to this fellowship. First, we should consecrate ourselves to the Lord and set aside a definite time, two to three hours a week, to go out door-knocking. This time should be used either to lead people to be baptized or to meet in the home of a new believer. After our initial contact with a new believer, we should meet with him ten times in the first month and once per week thereafter. We should do this every week for one year. After twelve months the new one will be established. Then he will beget and teach others in the same way that he was begotten and taught. This will make him remaining fruit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SKILLFULLY NOURISHING FOR FRUIT TO REMAIN</h2>
<p>When my grandson was born, he weighed less than six pounds. When my wife and I went to the hospital to visit him, we did not believe that he could grow up properly. However, because of his condition, he received special care and has grown up quite well. Today he plays football at school and excels in academics. Therefore, it does not matter whether a baby is weak at birth. If he receives proper care, he will grow up healthy and strong. Likewise, a person may not seem clear at the time of his baptism. However, after he comes out of the water, we should edify him. We need to teach him that the Lord Jesus is the life-giving Spirit and that he has a spirit with which he can call on the Lord&rsquo;s name. We should also help him to practice. After three days we can visit him again and teach him a new lesson. If we give him ten lessons in this way, I believe that he will live and grow strong even if he was weak in the beginning. However, regardless of how good a person&rsquo;s situation is, if we abandon him immediately after his baptism, he will die within a couple of months.</p>
<p>We need to correct our previous mistake. Instead of inviting people to come and listen to the gospel, we should deliver the gospel to their homes. Instead of dragging people to the church meetings, we should set up a meeting in their home, delivering the church meeting to their home. Most of the new believers are not used to the way that we meet. Some of them might have family restrictions or other situations that prevent them from coming to the church meetings. If we compel such ones to come to the church meeting, we may damage them. However, meeting in a new believer&rsquo;s home would be very convenient. If he is very busy, we can accommodate his situation and spend fifteen to twenty minutes to fellowship with him. For example, two sisters may go to the home of a new one, who is a housewife, when she is in the middle of cooking a meal. One of the sisters can help the new one in the kitchen, and the other can fellowship with her. In such a situation it would be hard for the new one to make excuses. This can be compared to putting food into someone&rsquo;s mouth. In most situations the new one will accept it. If we nourish and take care of the new ones in this way, at least eighty percent of them will remain.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN ESTIMATION</h2>
<p>I hope that the elders and the saints in all the churches will be stirred up by the Lord to live a revived and overcoming life and also to build up three matters: preaching the gospel by knocking on doors and visiting people, setting up meetings in the homes of the new believers in order to nourish and help them weekly, and teaching the new ones to call on the name of the Lord, to read the Bible, to pray, to sing hymns, to speak for the Lord, to testify, and to function in the home meetings. We must not follow the custom in Catholicism and Protestantism of having one person speaking and everyone else listening. Instead, we should lead the new ones to build up the habit of speaking for the Lord in the home meetings, the group meetings, and in the larger meetings of the church. If we would practice this, the new ones will be established.</p>
<p>If there are one hundred saints meeting in a church, only twenty of them need to go out and knock on doors. However, this does not mean that only twenty people should devote themselves to door-knocking. Some may be able to go out only once every three weeks, and others may be able to go out twice a week. The elderly ones may not be able to go out at all because of their health, and some elderly ones may be strong enough to go door-knocking. This would be very helpful. If twenty people can go out every week, they can be formed into seven teams. They should be able to knock on at least twenty doors in one and a half hours and find a son of peace. If they find a son of peace, they will have to spend an hour to edify him. Therefore, they would spend a total of two to three hours.</p>
<p>If every team is able to gain a new one per week, that would be fifty-two new ones in a year. If we reduce the number by twenty percent, every team would have forty new ones, and there would be a combined total of two hundred eighty new ones, which nearly equals three times the number of saints in the locality. If we reduce the number further to half by subtracting the undependable ones, there would still be one hundred forty new ones, which still exceeds a twofold increase. Such a rate of increase would be wonderful. After gaining the new ones, we need to make them remaining fruit. The way to preserve them is for sixty out of the remaining eighty saints in the church to rise up and care for the new ones. These sixty may be divided into twenty teams to nourish and teach the new ones.</p>
<p>Thus, in a church with one hundred people, eighty would be active, and the remaining twenty might be inactive because of sickness, weaknesses, or other legitimate reasons. It would be easy for eighty people to take care of a hundred and forty new ones. After a year, at least one hundred people would remain. This is to have a twofold increase yearly. This is the easiest and the most profitable way. I am confident that we will succeed. If we would take this way, we would need a little over twenty-five years to save and baptize all the people in the world. This is an extremely great matter. It would not be a repetition of our last ten years of barrenness. If we are willing to put our effort into practicing the new way, after twenty-six years the whole world would be evangelized, and everyone would be saved and baptized. This would deal a fatal blow to Satan.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE OF THE EARLY CHURCH</h2>
<p>The practice of the new way does not come from our imagination. It is according to the pattern shown in the Bible. In Acts 8 the disciples were scattered abroad because of a great persecution. Prior to the persecution, the church in Jerusalem had brought in three thousand and five thousand new believers at two separate times (2:41; 4:4). Many more were brought in at various other times. There were thousands of believers in Jerusalem. They all enjoyed gathering together and were not willing to go out to other places. Therefore, persecution was raised up, and consequently, the believers, not including the apostles, were scattered to various places (8:1). These believers went out announcing the word of God as the gospel (v. 4). I do not believe that they found a meeting place and invited people to come and listen but that they preached the gospel by knocking on doors from house to house to visit people, just as they did in the church in Jerusalem (2:46; 5:42).</p>
<p>Immediately after a person was saved, he met from house to house (2:41, 46). In the homes they practiced fellowshipping, praying, breaking bread, announcing the gospel, and baptizing people (v. 42; 5:42). This was the regular life of the early saints, and as a result, &ldquo;the Lord added together day by day those who were being saved&rdquo; (2:47). This was the way ordained by the Lord, and He confirmed it with blessings. In Taipei we are now practicing this same way, and even though we are limited, we have seen the same result: new ones are being added to the church day by day.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN EFFECTIVE PRACTICE</h2>
<p>Immediately after we lead a person to believe in the Lord and baptize him, we must spend some time to edify him and then set up a meeting in his home in order to teach him the fundamental truths. This is the first step in our practice. The second step is to have a home meeting with him once every three or four days in order to lead him to practice and learn to exercise his spirit, to pray, and to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name. If possible, we should go to his home ten times in the first month and after that meet with him once a week.</p>
<p>We should teach the new ones to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name from deep within their spirit, not softly. Such an exercise is not only helpful to the new ones but also beneficial to us. Many of us have been saved for years, but we often call on the Lord habitually and softly; hence, we are not released. If we would call loudly with our spirit, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! I love You!&rdquo; we would feel different within. We should not lead the new ones by teaching them our old and ritualistic ways. We must give them the proper practice and help them to exercise and release their spirit in order to receive the genuine, spiritual supply.</p>
<p>Such a supply is not a psychological effect but a spiritual fact, just as the benefit that we receive from our physical deep breathing is not something psychological. Regrettably, Christians have lost the practice of calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name. The Greek word for &ldquo;call on&rdquo; is <em>epikaleomai,</em> which means to call out loudly, to call by name. Some Christians think that we do not need to call loudly, because the Lord Jesus can hear us when we call softly, and He knows all our needs. On the one hand, this is correct, but on the other hand, there is a great difference in our experience between calling loudly and calling softly. Hence, if the environment permits, we should exercise our spirit to call on the Lord loudly from deep within when we get up in the morning. This will have a great effect on our living throughout the rest of the day. Therefore, the first things we need to teach the new ones are to exercise their spirit, to pray, and to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>According to the progress of a new one, we should lead him to attend the small group meeting with other believers in his neighborhood. This is the third step. If he is at home alone, it will not be easy for him to stand firm. The brothers and sisters who he blends with in the small group meeting will become the best help for him. They can have mutual care and supply. This can be compared to burning coals. It is not easy for one or two pieces of coal to catch on fire. Even if they start burning, the fire will not last long, but it is easier for four or five pieces of coal to burn strongly. Such a practice is not legal; it is organic. We need to lead a new one according to his situation; otherwise, bringing him to a group meeting may &ldquo;kill&rdquo; him.</p>
<p>The basis of the group meeting is first found in Matthew 18:20: &ldquo;Where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.&rdquo; This indicates that as long as there are two or three gathered together, they can have a group meeting. In Acts 12 Peter was kept in the prison, and &ldquo;prayer was being made fervently by the church&rdquo; (v. 5). The saints were not gathered together to pray in a large meeting as we do today; they prayed separately in many homes. Therefore, after Peter was rescued out of the prison, he went to the house of the mother of John and told those assembled there to &ldquo;report these things to James and the brothers. And going out, he went to another place&rdquo; (vv. 12, 17). This is proof that in those days the saints met in many homes for prayer. Those were small group prayer meetings.</p>
<p>When we go to lead the new ones, our spirit must be living and uplifted. This is the fourth step. Only when we are living can we cause those whom we lead to be living. Only when our spirit is uplifted can we enliven others and cause their spirit to be opened and fanned into flame. If we are depressed and downhearted, we will cause the new ones to be discouraged, and they will be unable to touch the spiritual reality. We must be living in our daily life. Then we will be joyful and exulting, either singing, praising, or calling. Consequently, we will bring the spiritual atmosphere into the new one&rsquo;s home and enable him to touch the spiritual reality and gain the supply. Perhaps when we visit him, he is not happy, or he is quarreling with his wife. But through our visit he will be supplied, enlightened, and comforted, and he will obey our leading and teaching and thus begin to sing and to pray. Hence, the home meetings depend on the kind of persons we are. If we are living, the dead will be made alive, but if we are dead, the living will become dead because of us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHANGING THE SYSTEM<br />
BEING TO CHANGE THE HABITS<br />
IN OUR DAILY LIFE</h2>
<p>The churches in all the localities should have a complete, genuine change of system. We should no longer live according to the old manner of life, which is to invite people to come and listen to the gospel. Instead, we should go out every week to visit people. Furthermore, we should not invite new ones to come to the church meetings and listen to messages; rather, we should deliver the meetings to their homes. Formerly, we always invited people to come to a big meeting and listen to a wonderful message. If they did not obtain something when they came to the meeting, their appetite was spoiled such that they did not come again. As a result, we lost them. Now we need to repent and have a thorough change in our way. Instead of asking people to come to the meeting, we should deliver the meeting to their homes. Every week we should deliver the meeting to others. After a few years we will raise people up and establish them. Then according to their situation, we can gradually lead them to have group meetings and attend district meetings. Furthermore, we should also encourage them to function in the meetings.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei has been practicing home meetings, group meetings, and district meetings. There are about fifty people in a district meeting. When the number in a district meeting exceeds a hundred, it needs to subdivide. The advantage of such a meeting is that we can know one another through mutual care, fellowship, and intimate contact. Moreover, such a meeting also provides the saints with opportunities to function. After a new one has been led in the home meeting and has learned how to sing, to pray, and to speak, he will spontaneously be able to open his mouth and fellowship or testify in the group meeting and in the district meeting. Hence, there will no longer be the need for someone to give a message in the district meeting. Everyone can prophesy, and the prophesying will be enjoyable.</p>
<p>The God-ordained way revealed in the Bible is not to invite people to come and listen to the gospel but to go and knock on doors in order to visit people. Furthermore, it is not to invite people to come to a meeting of the church but to deliver the meeting to their home. If we lead people in the fundamental truths and help them to exercise their spirit, they can live the church life without being brought to the church meetings. A new believer may require us to spend six months to a year with him before he can become remaining fruit. But if we do this, the church will definitely increase twofold yearly. This is a tremendous rate of increase. May we all see this and take action.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">ENDEAVORING TO HAVE<br />
CHURCH MEETINGS RICH IN MUTUALITY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:26; Heb. 10:25; Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:12-16; Matt. 24:35; Rev. 2:5, 7; 3:1, 15-20; Col. 3:16; 2 Tim. 2:22; Rom. 10:12; Eph. 5:18-19; Rom. 8:4; Phil. 1:20-21; 2 Tim. 1:8; 4:2; Eph. 1:22-23; John 15:1-5</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The title of this chapter is &ldquo;Endeavoring to Have Church Meetings Rich in Mutuality.&rdquo; The words <em>church</em> and <em>mutuality</em> are complicated. The Greek word translated &ldquo;church,&rdquo; <em>ekklesia,</em> denotes &ldquo;a called-out congregation.&rdquo; The word <em>church</em> has been damaged by its usage in traditional Christianity and has lost its original meaning. When the Brethren were raised up in Great Britain over a hundred years ago, they felt that the word <em>church</em> was inappropriate. Hence, based on the notion of a congregation, they used the word <em>assembly</em> instead of <em>church.</em> Some believers in the Pentecostal movement in America do not use the word <em>church</em> and thus call themselves the Assemblies of God. Some of their missionaries who went to China around 1930 used the word <em>assembly.</em></p>
<p>When we were raised up by the Lord in China, we knew that the Chinese term for <em>church,</em> which is <em>jiao-hui,</em> was coined by the Western missionaries for the translation of the Bible. This term was not in the Chinese vocabulary. <em>Hui</em> means &ldquo;gathering&rdquo; and <em>jiao</em> means &ldquo;religion&rdquo;; hence, this term means &ldquo;religious gathering.&rdquo; Christian meetings should not be religious gatherings but a gathering of the called-out ones. According to the meaning of the Greek word, in our Chinese publications we use the term <em>zhao-hui,</em> which means &ldquo;a called-out assembly.&rdquo; We made this change because the Lord&rsquo;s Body is not a religious gathering; it is the assembling together of those who have been called out by God. We have been called out of the world to become God&rsquo;s called-out congregation, the church as the Body of Christ for the expression of God. This is the significance of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MUTUALITY IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h2>
<p>The word <em>mutuality</em> is used in relation to church meetings and is the basic principle of the meetings of the church. This is shown in three portions of the Word. Colossians 3 says that we need to practice &ldquo;teaching and admonishing one another&rdquo; (v. 16). Teaching one another means that you teach me and that I teach you; admonishing one another means that you admonish me and that I admonish you. This indicates that as believers, we should be full of mutuality when we come together. Hebrews 10:25 says that we should not abandon &ldquo;our own assembling together...but exhorting one another.&rdquo; Since we are the Lord&rsquo;s disciples, we should not abandon proper Christian meetings. Moreover, whenever we meet, there should be mutuality. First Corinthians 14:26 says that whenever we &ldquo;come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.&rdquo; This verse refers to the gathering of the whole church (v. 23). In such a gathering there should not be only one person speaking; rather, each one should function for building up (v. 26), that is, for mutual building up.</p>
<h2 class="head2">One Person Speaking Being a Meeting<br />
Related to the Work, Not a Church Meeting</h2>
<p>A meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening does not refer to a meeting of the church. Rather, it refers to a meeting related to the work. The purpose of such a gathering is to listen to God&rsquo;s speaking. Meetings related to the work may have one or two speakers, because their main purpose is to teach. In the Bible such meetings were not held regularly. On the day of Pentecost Peter stood and spoke to all the people. That was not a church gathering. The meetings of the church have a different setting.</p>
<p>In Acts 20:5-11 the apostle Paul spent seven days with the church in Troas. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day the church gathered together to break bread. Because Paul was planning to leave the next day, and being concerned that he might not return, he grasped the opportunity in that meeting and spoke until daybreak. During such an all-night meeting, Paul spoke for the first half of the night, then they broke bread, and he spoke again until daybreak. Such a meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening was not a regular meeting of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking to One Another with Hymns</h2>
<p>In this conference one person is speaking, and the rest are listening. However, this is not a meeting of the church. It is a Chinese-speaking conference. As such, these meetings are not regular church meetings but special gatherings. Regular church meetings should not have only one person speaking and the rest listening. Instead, church meetings should be mutual in nature, that is, everyone speaking and everyone exhorting. In other words, there should be mutual teaching and mutual exhorting. There may also be the speaking of hymns to one another (Col. 3:16; Eph. 5:19). Regrettably, such a practice has been abandoned by Christianity.</p>
<p>I was born in a Christian family, and from my youth I attended the so-called services with my mother. In those services I never saw believers speaking to one another. Even in our meetings it is rare to see such a practice. At the most we have one person calling a hymn and all the saints singing together. The Bible says that we should not only sing hymns but also speak them. This does not mean that I alone speak to all of you but that we all speak to one another&mdash;you speak a line, and I speak another line. This kind of mutuality should not have rules or regulations. As soon as there are rules and regulations, the practice of mutuality will become mechanical and lose its sweetness. Genuine mutuality is without regulations and causes the saints to be released and to touch the Lord.</p>
<p>Meetings related to the work, with one person speaking and the rest listening, are not suitable for mutual speaking because there are too many people present. The best setting for the practice of mutuality is the small meetings of the church, such as a home meeting with three to five people, a group meeting with eight to ten people, and a district meeting with not more than fifty people. In a meeting with around eight hundred people, speaking to one another would become shouting at one another in a disorderly manner. In such a large meeting it would be best to divide into groups for the practice of speaking to one another. We need to be trained in this matter.</p>
<p>We have never practiced speaking hymns to one another. However, in a conference in Indonesia twenty years ago, I asked the saints to speak a hymn to one another. Since then I have not seen another meeting like that one. The Holy Spirit did a powerful work that day, for the mutual speaking was full of enjoyment and supply, even though several hundred saints were present.</p>
<p>I would encourage the married couples to practice speaking to one another. A husband can say to his wife, &ldquo;You should love the Lord,&rdquo; and the wife can respond, &ldquo;You should also love the Lord.&rdquo; The husband may say, &ldquo;We should pray,&rdquo; and the wife can respond, &ldquo;Yes, we should also praise!&rdquo; Such mutual speaking is wonderful because it will eliminate quarrels and arguments. Sometimes if a husband notices that his wife is about to quarrel, he can say, &ldquo;You should pray.&rdquo; If his wife becomes angry and says, &ldquo;You should pray too,&rdquo; he can take the opportunity to say, &ldquo;Right! Let us pray together.&rdquo; She will surely agree with him. Such mutual speaking would be wonderful!</p>
<p>Married couples often argue when they eat together. If a husband criticizes another sister&rsquo;s cooking, his wife will not be offended, but if he appreciates another sister&rsquo;s cooking, his wife will become suspicious. She might say, &ldquo;Are you saying that my cooking is not good?&rdquo; Eventually, this will lead them to argue. If at such a time they would speak to one another with hymns or with verses, the works of the flesh will be abolished.</p>
<p>The Bible teaches us to speak hymns to one another. Hymns are rhythmic and can be compared to proverbs. In Chinese the hymns have couplets and rhymes and are appealing to the ear. Hence, they are inspiring and suitable for speaking to one another. We should constantly practice speaking hymns to one another so that in the meetings our speaking to one another will be enjoyable. Christian meetings of the church should be rich in mutuality. They should not have only one person speaking and the rest listening.</p><h2 class="head2">The Disadvantage of One Person Speaking<br />
and the Rest Listening</h2>
<p>The practice of one person speaking and the rest listening is a heavy burden to the speaker. It is difficult to be a pastor or a preacher. After studying theology, some people prepare fifty-two sermons to use while they are learning pastoral duties with their first congregation. Having to prepare sermons is a suffering to the young pastors. However, congregations are happy when their pastor is knowledgeable, eloquent, and able to tell stories. If the pastor is not eloquent and does not use parables or tell stories, the congregation will get tired of listening to him. Although there are advantages to one person speaking and the rest listening, there are more disadvantages.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Practicing Mutuality<br />
for the Building Up of All the Saints</h2>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching in the Scriptures does not instruct us to practice having one person speaking and the rest listening in the meetings of the church. Rather, it teaches us to practice mutuality. I was very zealous when I was first saved. The denomination that I attended had a prayer meeting and a message every Tuesday night. The pastor had been there for over a decade and had exhausted his messages, so he proposed that another person should be asked to speak or that everyone should take turns to speak. I was known in that denomination as a person who loved the Lord and the Bible, so I was asked to speak. However, that was still one person speaking and the rest listening.</p>
<p>Christianity cannot avoid the practice of one person speaking and the rest listening. But according to the teaching of the apostles, whenever the believers gather together, each one has (1 Cor. 14:26). We have practiced each one having a psalm in the sense that we have the right to select a hymn for everyone to sing. In the worship services in the denominations, only the person designated by the pastor can call a hymn. This is against the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</p>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching is with a view to the mutual building up of all the saints. A feast is not composed of only one dish. Regardless of how much one person speaks, it is still only one &ldquo;course,&rdquo; not many &ldquo;courses.&rdquo; A meeting in mutuality may be likened to a rich feast with numerous courses of delicious food. A real Chinese feast has at least twelve courses. If there are only three or four courses, it is considered as an ordinary meal. When we invite people to a feast, we should not prepare only three or five courses. We must prepare at least twelve courses; twenty courses would be better. Not only so, the twenty courses should be in &ldquo;mutuality&rdquo;; if every course is steak, people will not like it. A good restaurant always serves a variety of dishes. The Lord&rsquo;s arrangement is much better than the arrangement in a restaurant. His Word says that when Christians come and meet together, each has to prepare a &ldquo;dish.&rdquo; These &ldquo;dishes&rdquo; should be in mutuality. This will express the riches of the church and enable all the saints to be built up.</p>
<p>Some people think that such a practice would cause chaos in the meetings. If this were true, we would lose the Lord&rsquo;s presence. When we come together, there should be the supply of grace, not disturbance or confusion. Such meetings will cause everyone to learn and to be encouraged. Such meetings will be full of peace, not chaos (vv. 31, 33). In order to supply grace, we must first have grace. A brother once suggested that we ask a restaurant to cater our love feasts. I was greatly opposed to this suggestion because it would annul our love feasts. We have the most enjoyable and rich love feasts when every saint prepares a dish. This also applies to our meetings. We should never serve &ldquo;catered food&rdquo;; instead, each person must prepare something. </p>
<p>In America every household is asked to bring one dish to the love feast. With this kind of arrangement there is not much variety; hence, it cannot be considered a love feast. In this respect, the Chinese saints are better than the American saints. When the Chinese saints have a love feast, every home will prepare different kinds of food. As a result, a hundred homes will bring more than a hundred dishes. Even if two households bring the same dish, they are prepared differently. Whether steamed buns, boiled dumplings, fried dumplings, stir-fried beef, or spicy chicken, every household prepares them in different ways. This kind of love feast is truly rich! This is a picture of the church meetings. When three hundred saints meet together, there should not be only one person speaking. Everyone should speak, and everyone should listen; we speak to one another, and we listen to one another. This is not confusion; it is active mutuality. The richness of such a meeting is indescribable.</p>
<p>Most of us have probably not tasted such a meeting. If we would taste it, we would not like the meetings with one person speaking and the rest listening. We would hate such meetings. Suppose I am your pastor, and I must preside over and speak in every meeting. Regardless of how eloquent I am, after half a year you will be tired of listening to me. But the taste would be different if everyone would speak. It does not matter whether or not we know how to speak. If we would practice this, at least twenty out of a hundred saints will learn to speak, and the meetings would be enjoyable. This is the strong point of mutuality; it is for the building up of all the saints.</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:25 says that we should not abandon our own assembling together. This word was written to the Jewish believers, and it urged them to not shrink back to Judaism. For them to go back and meet in Judaism was to abandon their own meeting as believers. Not only so, in the meetings they needed to exhort one another. When I was with the Brethren, they frequently quoted this verse without emphasizing the phrase <em>exhorting one another.</em> They applied this verse to a &ldquo;one-way&rdquo; exhorting, that is, the speaker exhorting the congregation instead of everyone exhorting one another. At that time, I did not see this light. Later, I heard Brother Nee say that the meeting spoken of in Hebrews 10:25 is mutual, not &ldquo;one-way.&rdquo; It is not a meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening, but at least eight or ten people speaking in order to have mutuality.</p>
<p>Hence, the believers&rsquo; meetings must be mutual and should not be like the meetings of a conference. During conferences the workers or apostles who have received a burden from the Lord invite people to listen to God&rsquo;s speaking. However, due to our fallen nature, we like such meetings. We are not saying that such meetings are wrong, because they meet a particular need related to the work. But genuine church meetings must have the characteristic of mutuality.</p><h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE NEED<br />
TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM</h2>
<p>My burden for this conference is our changing the system and taking a new way. We need a change in three matters. First, our former way of preaching the gospel by inviting people to come is wrong. The Bible says that when we preach the gospel, we need to go; that is, we need to go to people&rsquo;s homes and deliver the gospel to them. Our inviting people to come did not have much result, and if we had some fruit, very few remained. We must change this practice.</p>
<p>Second, after someone is baptized, we should continue to visit him and have home meetings with him. This is the way to keep the new believers and make them remaining fruit. In the past we compelled people to come and listen to the gospel, to believe in the Lord, and to be baptized. But when we asked them to come to the church meetings, they would stop attending after a few times. Over time we also would lose interest in them and give up. As a result, they died a premature death. How can babies grow without being fed? Preaching the gospel by inviting people to come is a mistake, and not meeting with a new one in his home in order to feed him after he is saved and baptized is also a mistake. We should deliver the gospel to people in their homes and also send the meetings to their homes. We should not only lead people to salvation; we must also nourish them.</p>
<p>Third, our former way of practicing the church meetings with one person speaking and the rest listening is also wrong. Even if two or three speak, it is still wrong. A new believer is burning in spirit and has a strong desire to testify, but he is not given the opportunity to testify. Our former way of meeting makes it easy for people not to speak. When a person is saved, he wants to speak, but because only one or two function while everyone else is silent, he does not dare to speak.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRADITIONAL WAY<br />
OF ONE PERSON SPEAKING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Advantages</h2>
<p>The practice of one person speaking and the rest listening is a traditional way that has advantages and disadvantages. The first advantage is that it maintains a pleasant facade. I used to invite people to come and listen to the gospel. If someone came, I expected the gospel meeting to have a particular facade. The meeting hall should look nice, the seats should be arranged neatly, there should be at least several hundred attendees, the singing should be pleasant, and the brother who gives the message must be eloquent so that he can capture everyone&rsquo;s attention. I was happy to sit with my friend in such a situation. Everyone likes such an impressive front.</p>
<p>If I invite people to my home to listen to the gospel, people might be disappointed without something impressive. A large meeting with a great facade has the power to move people. The first time I went to America, I stayed in San Francisco. Some brothers took me to a gospel campaign by Billy Graham. It was my first time to attend such a campaign, and the environment was inspiring. There were thousands of people in attendance. The environment was so compelling that everyone was moved to tears when the piano began playing the hymn. Nevertheless, the church cannot depend on a great facade.</p>
<p>The second advantage of one person speaking and the rest listening is that the believers receive some nourishment. A new believer does not know the truth concerning God, Christ, incarnation, redemption, crucifixion, or resurrection. He needs to listen to messages concerning these matters in order for him to be nourished and edified. We cannot deny that the meetings with one person speaking and the rest listening can meet such a need.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Disadvantages</h2>
<p>The disadvantages to one person speaking and the rest listening outweigh the advantages. I admire Billy Graham. His presentation and application of the gospel are appropriate, and his utterance is excellent. However, he has noticed that depending on evangelistic campaigns is not effective. He found out that many people are moved by the gospel, but when they are sent to different denominations, they eventually &ldquo;enter into a refrigerator&rdquo; and become &ldquo;frozen.&rdquo; Therefore, he proposed that the believers should have small prayer meetings and small Bible-study meetings in their homes. These small meetings were very popular in Southern California. However, they did not have a way to continue, because there was no content; the spirit of prayer was weak, and the living Bible was dead.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Annulling the Spiritual Functions<br />
of the Believers</h2>
<p>The first disadvantage to one person speaking and the rest listening is that it annuls the spiritual function, the organic function, of the believers. It is not easy to understand spiritual things; therefore, the Bible often uses physical things as an illustration. The Bible says that after we are saved, we need to grow until we are full-grown (Eph. 4:13). This verse uses the growth of our physical body as an illustration of a spiritual matter. There is a saying: &ldquo;A sparrow may be small, but it has all the vital organs.&rdquo; A child may be very small at birth, but he is still complete. He has the sense of hearing, the sense of sight, and the sense of smell. He also has the ability to eat, to speak, and to walk. However, a newborn child does not know anything and cannot function; he cannot see distinctly nor hear clearly. He needs to grow for the development of his organic functions.</p>
<p>Every mother longs for her child to say Mama because she does not want her child to be dumb. When a child begins to grow, his mother teaches him to say Mama. If after nine months the child cannot say Mama, his mother begins to worry that the child may be dumb. The longer it takes for a child to speak, the greater a trial it is to the mother. When the child finally opens his mouth and says Mama, his mother is very happy. Before the child had sufficient growth, he could not speak, because his ability to speak was not adequately developed. If a person covers his eyes for five years, he will become blind. If a person lies in bed for five years, he will lose his ability to walk. Children need their eyes and legs to develop properly. When I contracted tuberculosis, I was confined to complete bed rest for a full year. A year later when I got up, I was not able to stand, let alone walk. My legs were so withered that I needed an extended period of time to learn to stand and more time to learn to walk again. I was over forty years of age, but I had lost the function of my legs in only one year. This shows the importance of the development of our organic functions.</p>
<p>If in all the meetings of the church only one person speaks and the rest listen, after five years no one will be able to speak; they will become dumb. This is our situation. When I returned to Taipei in 1984, I noticed that many of those in the meeting had listened to my speaking for over thirty years. Some of them had been listening to me before they were married. I saw them get married and raise their children. Some of their sons are serving as elders in the churches. If these saints were asked to speak, they would say that they are unable to speak. For thirty years these saints were &ldquo;ruined,&rdquo; for they were not told to &ldquo;walk,&rdquo; or to speak. Therefore, they are not able to function. This is our situation.</p>
<p>The saints who have been saved for more than twenty years would say that it is Brother Lee&rsquo;s responsibility to explain the truth of sanctification and other such fundamental truths. If they have been listening to messages for twenty years but cannot give a message on sanctification, why should we still care for such a system? Our practice has annulled the organic functions of the believers.</p><h2 class="head4">Organic Functions Being Related to Our Living,<br />
Not to Our Profession</h2>
<p>We need to have a revolutionary change. If we continue in this way for another twenty years, our situation will worsen. In the past we led people to be saved and asked them to come to the meetings. On the surface, it seemed as though we were feeding and teaching them, but it was a lazy way. If we want to feed, take care of, and teach the new ones, we must learn and be equipped.</p>
<p>Someone once said to me, &ldquo;We will not succeed if we try to have our meetings in mutuality, because everyone is busy making a living in order to feed a family. People are exhausted after six days of working, so on the seventh day they want a good worship service. They like to go to a nice chapel with a good atmosphere and comfortable seats that are arranged nicely. They want someone who can sing, someone who can pray, someone who can read the Scriptures, and someone who can speak and minister a good message. Such a situation refreshes everyone. But instead of providing that kind of meeting, we want everyone to function. How can you expect a banker to give a message? A banker goes to a worship service for entertainment and relaxation, and he gives a lot of money, hoping that the chapel would be better equipped. It is better to have a music pastor and an assistant pastor. Then people will be pleased with the service.&rdquo; According to this person, my fellowship concerning the change of system will not work.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago a responsible brother in San Francisco said to me, &ldquo;This is an age of specialization, and students major in different fields. Therefore, in spiritual things some people should study to be pastors, and others should learn to preach the word, just as only some people become medical doctors. Since no one is capable of doing everything, how is it possible that you want everyone to speak in the meetings? This way will not work.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;The Bible says that each person should speak in the meetings. For our work we need to major in a particular field, but we cannot do that in our living. Is it possible for some to major in eating and for others to specialize in drinking? Who is saying that we have to major in speaking? Regardless of a person&rsquo;s profession, he needs to eat, to drink, and to speak. Likewise, as long as you are a believer, you have to speak whenever you meet in the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our living is not divided into different fields. Everyone has to eat, to drink, to breathe, to wear clothes, and to speak. Our worship and our service are not a profession; they are our living. Meeting together is not our job as Christians. Meeting together is our living, and it is the expression of our living. Therefore, it cannot be considered a field of study.</p>
<p>One person speaking with the rest listening annuls the life functions of the believers. For this reason, when I went back to Taipei in 1984, I repented sincerely. I confessed that I have damaged everyone because it was I who brought such a practice from mainland China. Such a practice is not only in Taipei; even churches in the United States and in other places around the world have learned this way. I am the one who caused this harm. But I thank the Lord that now a saint who has been saved for only two months or even ten days can praise, testify, and speak for the Lord. The trainings that we have had in Taiwan since 1984 are teaching us to abandon all the old things.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Building Up the Habit in Our Living</h2>
<p>The training charges the trainees to baptize a person in his home after leading him to believe in the Lord; they should not bring him to the church meeting in which one person speaks. We do not want a new one to be influenced negatively in the meetings. A new one who attends a Christian meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening will feel that it suits his natural human nature, and if the content is not bad, he will be deeply impressed. As a result, it will be difficult to change his concept later. Learning to speak English is a good example. If a person does not learn proper pronunciation from the beginning, it will be difficult to correct his pronunciation later. When he is accustomed to the wrong pronunciation, it will be impossible to correct him. Likewise, after a person is saved, we should meet in his home and teach him some basic lessons and life practices. After three to five months we can bring him to the church meetings. Many new ones do not like to attend the church meetings. They prefer to meet at home because everyone can speak. They like the new way of meeting.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate my point with a true story. Over thirty years ago I set up a workers&rsquo; home in Taipei with forty-eight beds. The new full-time serving ones stayed there to receive training and learn to work. The cook had a problem because the forty-eight people came from different provinces in China. The Szechwan people liked spicy food, the northerners liked steamed buns, the southerners liked rice, and the Shantung people liked dumplings. When the cook served dumplings, the northerners were happy, but the southerners were not. When he served spicy food, the Szechwan saints enjoyed it, but the northerners could not eat it, and those from Shanghai suffered. These different reactions are the result of different habits. The workers had developed certain dietary habits since their childhood; hence, they found it difficult to accept other kinds of food.</p>
<p>In the same principle, if a new believer attends worship services and listens to sermons, after two months it will be difficult for him to change. He will develop the habit of listening to sermons. However, if immediately after a person is saved he begins to speak, to testify for the Lord, and to praise, give thanks, and sing hymns, he will enjoy such practices. If at this time he comes to the church meetings where he must sit and listen, he will feel uncomfortable, because he has a different taste. In this respect, for one person to speak and the rest to listen is not the right way. The right way is to have mutual encouragement and mutual teaching.</p><h2 class="head3">Choking and Killing<br />
the Spiritual Life of the Believers</h2>
<p>The practice of one person speaking and the rest listening not only annuls the life function of the believers; it also chokes and kills the believers&rsquo; spiritual life so that they do not sense the need for the growth in life. As a result, the meetings are for recreation and are the fulfillment of their duty. The believers simply flow with the tide. Some brothers regret serving as elders, because in every meeting they have to sit on the front row and take care of the meeting, which includes calling a hymn, praying, and speaking. Before they were elders, some of these brothers always sat at the back and never opened their mouth for three or five years. But once they were made elders, they immediately had to sit on the front row and function in every meeting. For this reason, I have said that the best way to make the brothers function is to appoint them as elders. As soon as they are appointed as elders, they function in the meetings. I have also observed that when some elders who were active in the meetings withdrew from the eldership, they stopped functioning. We no longer see them in the meetings or hear their voices. The moment a person ceases to be an elder, he is no longer active and stops functioning. This is wrong, and it shows that their spiritual life was choked and killed. This is the second drawback to our old practice.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Building Up a Social Group<br />
but Not the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>The practice of one person speaking and the rest listening can build up only a social group, which is an organization. It cannot build up the Body of Christ, which is an organism. According to our practice of one person speaking in the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting, the rest of the believers merely sit and listen, give money, and then go home. This way of meeting can maintain a social group and build up an organization, but it cannot build up the Body of Christ. An organism needs to eat, to drink, to rest, and to exercise. An organism also needs training to learn how to move according to its inward supply and outward expression. A wooden desk is an organization. It can be built by nailing a few pieces of wood together, and it can retain its original appearance even if it is put aside for thirty years. Our body, however, is organic and requires activities in order to be maintained and built up.</p>
<p>For example, I speak with my mouth, but my eyes, my eyebrows, and the rest of my body are also moving. When a person dies, his body is motionless; when he is alive, the body is always moving. If I were to lie down for a long time without moving, I would appear to be dead. But if I am speaking and jumping, you can be sure that I am alive; even my hair seems to be alive. This is the expression of an organism. Therefore, the church as an organism should not meet in a way that is similar to a social organization. The church should meet in the way of the members supplying one another out from the Head. In the church meetings there should be the mutual supply by everyone speaking to minister life. This is the manifestation of an organism and the practical building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CRUCIAL MATTERS TO BE RECOVERED<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY TODAY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Recovering the Church Meetings in Mutuality<br />
as Revealed in the Bible</h2>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today we should recover what is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25. These verses are the Lord&rsquo;s divine speaking and ordination, but they are not being practiced in Christianity. These two verses are in the Bible but not in Christianity; hence, they must be recovered.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Recovering the Organic Building Up<br />
of the Church</h2>
<p>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; Then through the apostle in Ephesians 4:11 He said that He &ldquo;gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers.&rdquo; These are gifts who, instead of building up the church directly, perfect the saints to do the work of the ministry (v. 12). In the New Testament there is only one ministry, and this ministry carries out the work of the building up of the Body of Christ (v. 16). This one ministry is the work of the gifts. After the saints are perfected, their work is also this ministry, which is for the building up of an organism, the Body of Christ, not the building up of a social organization.</p>
<p>In verse 15 the apostle says, &ldquo;Holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.&rdquo; Meetings with one person speaking do not give the believers the sense that they should grow in life. But the main goal of the church meetings is to minister life in order for the saints to grow. This growing is the building up. The growth of a newborn child is his being built up. In order to grow, the child must eat, drink, and exercise. This growth, development, and edification is for the building up of his human body. Likewise, as members of the Body of Christ, we need to grow through the spiritual supply for our development. Such a need cannot be met by meetings with one person speaking and the rest listening. Rather, meetings where everyone functions to supply one another for the manifestation of the functioning of every member of the Body will cause everyone to grow up into the Head, Christ.</p>
<p>Verse 16 says, &ldquo;Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; <em>Out from whom</em> refers to the Head, Christ. <em>All the Body</em> includes you and me. The phrases <em>through every joint of the rich supply</em> and <em>through the operation in the measure of each one part</em> indicate that we all have to function so that we can be joined together and knit together. Joining is through the joints, and knitting is through the operation of each part. Both result in the gradual growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love. The gifts do not build up the Body directly; rather, they perfect every member of the Body so that the members can carry out their function for the direct building up of the Body. This building is the growth. In order to grow, there is the need of a life supply. Without the life supply, the Body cannot grow, and without growth, the Body cannot be built up. This word in Ephesians 4:16 is very clear.</p>
<p>We must see that if we continue to meet according to our old way, we will not have the building up of the Body; instead, we will only have the sustaining of an organization. The harm caused by the old way includes annulling the organic function, choking and killing the spiritual life, abandoning the building up of the Body, and abolishing the reality of everyone functioning. When we speak of recovery, we mean the recovery of the organic building up of the church by restoring what has been annulled, choked and killed, abandoned, and abolished.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO COOPERATE WITH THE LORD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Revived Living and an Overcoming Life</h2>
<p>If we desire to take the way of recovery, we must cooperate with the Lord. First, we must have a revived living and an overcoming life. As believers, we must have a revived living. To be revived is to be enlivened within and to live solely for the Lord. Such a revival will lead us to live an overcoming life. In Revelation 2 and 3 the Lord said seven times that we need to overcome all the negative situations and have an overcoming living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Pray-reading the Word<br />
and Calling on the Lord&rsquo;s Name Daily</h2>
<p>Second, we need to live a life of daily pray-reading the Word and calling on His name to enjoy His riches (Col. 3:16; 2 Tim. 2:22; Rom. 10:12). This must be our practice in our daily life. It is regrettable that we have neglected this. We often do not read the Word for several days, nor do we pray-read. We should read the Word daily and also pray-read the Word by turning the Word into prayer. Then the Word will become living to us and will be our food (Jer. 15:16). Reading the Word may be a mental process, but once we turn the Word into prayer, we will receive the supply of life. In addition, we need to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, but many of us may not call for a number of days. We should call on the Lord every day and in everything (Eph. 5:20). Sometimes while I am writing an article, I call on the Lord from deep within. Then I am inwardly supplied and able to enjoy the riches of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Experiencing Christ<br />
by Continually Being Filled in Spirit,<br />
Walking according to the Spirit,<br />
and Living Christ</h2>
<p>Third, we also need to be filled in spirit, walk according to the spirit, and live Christ continually so that we may experience Christ (v. 18; Gal. 5:16, 25; Phil. 1:20-21).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Ready in Season and out of Season<br />
to Testify for the Lord, to Speak Christ,<br />
and to Proclaim the Gospel Everywhere</h2>
<p>Fourth, wherever we are, whether in season or out of season, we should testify for the Lord, speak Christ, and proclaim the gospel (2 Tim. 4:2). This should be manifested in our living throughout the day.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Increasing Our Spiritual Constitution</h2>
<p>Fifth, we should increase our spiritual constitution daily through spiritual exercises and learning. I would again propose that we use ten to fifteen minutes every morning to pray-read two verses from the Bible. It is best to do this with two or three others. Husbands and wives are the best companions for pray-reading. This kind of pray-reading is a surety, a disinfectant, and an antitoxin. If a couple can read two Bible verses together every morning, it will be very easy for them to live in the spirit the rest of the day, and they can avoid quarrelling with one another. As a result, they will have some spiritual constitution.</p>
<p>In addition to pray-reading, we need to speak to whomever we meet, whether in season or out of season. This is also a good way to be constituted spiritually. If we can increase our spiritual constitution every day, we will spontaneously supply others in large meetings and in small meetings. Such a living will make it possible for 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25 to be recovered among us and for Matthew 16:18 and Ephesians 4:12-16 to be fulfilled for the building up of the church, which is the Body of Christ and the organism of the Triune God. The church can be built up only through meetings in mutuality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>In order to change the system for everyone to function and for the building up of the church, we need to be revived. On the one hand, we do not need to wait for a revival. As long as we are willing to receive grace, we can be revived. On the other hand, being revived requires that we take the initiative to obtain grace. First, we must be determined to live for the Lord. Then we need to consecrate ourselves to set aside a specific time to go out every week either to visit people, to preach the gospel, or to lead a home meeting. Finally, we need spiritual exercises every day so that we can have spiritual experiences and be enriched in our spirit to increase our spiritual constitution. As a result, we will have something with which to supply others when we come to the meeting.</p>
<p>Husbands and wives should pray-read two Bible verses together. Then they will live in the spirit and walk according to the spirit. They should also speak the Lord, proclaim the gospel, and testify of the Lord to whomever they meet. This will increase their spiritual constitution so that whether in large meetings or in small meetings, it will not be difficult for them to speak. If we have such a living, spontaneously some will call hymns, some will pray, and some will teach. After the meeting different ones will share. The result of practicing mutuality is that we grow in life and build up the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God.</p></body></html>
