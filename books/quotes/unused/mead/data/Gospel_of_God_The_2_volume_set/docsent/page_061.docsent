   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE WORK OF CHRIST REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By the grace of God, we have seen in the past few evenings what God's salvation is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Tonight is the sixth evening.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I hope to give a quick review of what we have covered in the previous five meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we will continue.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have seen sin, the law, God's love, His grace, and His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have seen how man became a sinner and how the law came in to expose man's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have also seen that though man is proved to be a sinner, God still loves him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not only has God loved us, but He has also shown us mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have also seen how God's grace has been manifested, what the nature of this grace is, how it came about, and that it can never be mixed with human effort.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Last night we saw that, in spite of God's love and His desire to give us grace, there was one hindrance to grace's coming to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If one thing had been left unsettled, God's grace could not have come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Though grace is now here to reign, it reigns only through righteousness Rom 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Grace cannot reign by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the Lord showed us how righteousness was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His righteousness has dealt with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the same time, it enables us to receive grace from God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have covered these during the last five evenings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now, we will go on with the gospel of God and His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The salvation accomplished by God through the Lord Jesus has manifested God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the same time, it satisfies God's righteous requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At this time we will cover the work of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is an excellent and sweet subject.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It deals with the way the Lord Jesus accomplished God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to see how the Lord Jesus satisfied God's demand and how He has manifested God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the same time, we have to see how the Lord Jesus satisfies the heart of the Christian so that we would be satisfied with His work also.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A song which we sing says, "God's heart is satisfied with the work of the Lord Jesus, and our hearts are also at rest with His work."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is satisfied, and we are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If time permits, I hope that we can cover both of these aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE LORD JESUS BEING BOTH GOD AND MAN</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first thing we have to see is that the Lord Jesus is God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may say that only God can bear man's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Never consider the Lord Jesus as a third person coming to die a substitutionary death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not think that God is one party, we are another party, and the Lord Jesus is a third party.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Bible never considers the Lord Jesus as a third party.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the contrary, it considers Him as the first party.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You may have been told that the gospel is like a debtor, a lender, and the lender's son.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The debtor has no money to pay back his debt.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The lender, being very severe, insists on the payment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the lender's son steps forth to pay the debt on behalf of the debtor, and the debtor becomes free.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the gospel that man preaches today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But this is not the real gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If this were the case, at least two points would not be fair and would be contrary to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First, this kind of understanding makes God the mean One and the Lord Jesus the gracious One.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In such an illustration, we do not see God loving the world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, we see only His righteous demand and the demand of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We see a severe God, One who is without grace and One whose words to man are always harsh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We see that the Lord Jesus loves us and gives grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is a wrong gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, although this is a wrong gospel, God still uses it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Actually, I was saved through this kind of illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But although I was saved, during the first three years I could never praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I always felt that the Lord Jesus was good, that I should thank and praise Him, that without Him everything was hopeless, and that it was fortunate that He came.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But I felt that God was very harsh, severe, and mean.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was not at all lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It seemed that everything good was with the Lord Jesus and everything bad was with God, that God is terrible and the Lord Jesus is lovable.</S>
