 <h2 class="head1">BABYLON THE GREAT AND HER DESTRUCTION</h2>
<p>Chapters twelve through fourteen of Revelation are written in the way of symbols. Chapters fifteen and sixteen, however, contain both signs and literal words. Following this, chapters seventeen and eighteen are again written in symbols.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Religious Aspect&mdash;the Great Harlot</h2>
<p>Revelation 17:1-2 says, &ldquo;And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits upon the many waters, with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and those who dwell on the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.&rdquo; The harlot symbolizes religious Rome, the apostate Roman Catholic Church, and the waters symbolize many peoples and nations. In the eyes of the Lord the Roman Catholic Church today is a harlot, an evil woman, who is &ldquo;sitting&rdquo; upon so many people. The Roman Church claims nearly one-fourth of the population of the earth. Even today, the kings, the political leaders on the earth, are committing spiritual fornication with her. The ambassadors, ministers, and leaders of many nations are sent to the Vatican; this is to commit fornication with the great harlot. The kings of the earth and those who dwell on the earth truly have been made drunk with the wine of the teachings, the heretical doctrines, of Roman Catholicism.</p>
<p>Verse 3a says, &ldquo;And he carried me away in spirit into awilderness.&rdquo; In order to see this vision, we need to be in our spirit andapart from the world. Many people are not clear about the vision of the great harlot because they have not come&ldquo;outside the camp&rdquo; (Heb. 13:13), to a place apart.</p>
<p>Revelation 17:3b and 4 continue, &ldquo;And I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication.&rdquo; Scarlet is dark red, which is a sign of the Roman Catholic Church. All the cardinals, for example, wear scarlet, and within the Vatican we can see many items of scarlet. Moreover, scarlet corresponds to the color of the great red dragon (12:3).</p>
<p>This woman is also clothed in purple (17:4). Purple is a blend of blue, the heavenly color, and red, the earthly color. Catholicism mixes the heavenly things with the earthly things. She is also gilded with gold, precious stone, and pearls. Although the Vatican is full of these precious materials in a literal sense, the gold, precious stone, and pearls here are signs, having the same meaning as the precious materials of the New Jerusalem in chapter twenty-one. When we look at the Roman Catholic Church, we can see many things of God, but these things are misused by her. Although the Roman Church has some things of God, she also has many pagan and heathen things mixed with them. This reminds us of the parable in Matthew 13:33, in which a woman hides leaven in three measures of meal. The meal signifies Christ as food to both God and man, and leaven signifies the many pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters brought in by Catholicism. Even certain declarations by the pope have some truth in them, but within Catholicism there are pagan, heathen, and heretical things mixed with the truth.</p>
<p>The great harlot holds in her hand a golden cup full of abominations. <em>Golden</em> signifies something of God, but the cup is full of abominations. According to Deuteronomy 7:25 and 26, abominations refer to idols. Outwardly the cup is of God, golden, but within it is full of idols. The Roman Catholic Church is exactly this way. She claims that she preaches the truth of God, but this so-called church is full of idols, full of abominations.</p>
<p><em>The unclean things of her fornication</em> in Revelation 17:4 refers to spiritual things mixed with politics, which is fornication. The golden cup is full of idols and full of the mixture of spiritual things with political things.</p>
<p>Verse 5 says, &ldquo;And on her forehead there was a name written,MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.&rdquo;Here there is not only one harlot but many. I must take the boldness to say that the harlots are the denominational churches into which the evils of Catholicism have been transmitted. These transmitted evils include the celebration of Christmas and Easter. These are evil pagan practices which were transmitted to the &ldquo;reformed&rdquo; churches. The birth of Jesus is the fine flour, but Christmas with the Christmas tree and Santa Claus is leaven. In the same way, the resurrection of the Lord is fine flour, but Easter is leaven. Also, to be a servant of the Lord is proper, but to have the title of <em>Reverend</em> is an evil transmitted into the church. Many of the Lord&rsquo;s children who are otherwise pure in the eyes of God are still holding on to these things. It is difficult for the Christians in the United States to be rid of this leaven.</p>
<p>Some in the Church of England and other &ldquo;reformed&rdquo; churches have considered going back to Catholicism. This shows that the Roman Church is the mother harlot, and the many denominations are the daughter harlots. We should not say that <em>harlots</em> refers only to denominations that do not have many real believers. There are many real believers in the Roman Catholic Church. A few hundred years ago there were a number of spiritual persons within the Roman Church such as Madame Guyon, Brother Lawrence, and Father Fenelon. They were spiritual but under the influence of that leaven. Even Madame Guyon visited images of Mary. We must be careful concerning the leaven.</p>
<p>Verse 6 says, &ldquo;And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And I marveled with great marvel when I saw her.&rdquo; The Roman Church does not kill the saints directly but does so indirectly through the Roman Empire. History tells us that more saints were killed by the Roman Church in this way than by the other persecutions of the Roman Empire.</p>
