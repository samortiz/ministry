No other portion of the Word contains such a portrait of what a local church is. This portion is very short; yet, in these eight verses every feature of a local church can be seen, including its nature, standing, element, sphere, and relationship. There are twelve significant items presented in these eight verses, each of which deserves our full attention. These items are very mysterious and full of spiritual implications and spiritual, hidden, mysterious, and divine secrets.<h2 class=head1>AN EXCELLENT PORTRAIT OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>First Corinthians is a long book consisting of sixteen chapters. Chapter one, verses 2-9, is a condensation of the entire book, giving us a skeleton of its structure. Although in these verses Paul speaks concerning the church in Corinth, he does not speak about its condition. Many times when we speak concerning a church, our speaking is mainly about the church&#8217;s condition. This may be compared to the way we describe a person. When we describe a person, we usually speak about his condition and appearance. Very few of us would describe a person according to his nature and standing. However, if we do not avoid speaking about a person&#8217;s condition, it is hard to present a genuine portrait of what that person really is; we may not express what the real nature of that person is. Likewise, whenever we speak about a church, it is easy to center on the condition of that church. It is not common to hear someone speaking about a church according to its nature, essence, and element. However, if our speaking is centered on the condition of a church, we may spread rumors and give others an inaccurate impression of that church.<p>When Paul dealt with the church at Corinth, the condition of the church was negative and miserable, full of divisions, confusion, errors, and even heresies and rebellion. According to the New Testament record, no other church&#8217;s condition may have been as negative as that of the church in Corinth. However, Paul was wise and logical. Paul loved the church, and he would never depreciate or defame the church. Often biographers place a handsome portrait of the subject of their book on the opening page in order to give the reader a positive impression of that person. In the same way, Paul, in the opening of his epistle to the Corinthians, presented a beautiful, marvelous, and excellent portrait of the church of God.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH OF GOD</h2><p>Verse 2a says, &#8220;To the church of God.&#8221; This expression indicates that the church not only is being possessed by God, but that it has God as its nature and essence, which are divine, general, universal, and eternal. Paul does not refer to the church in Corinth as a pitiful church with troublesome Jewish teachers and proud philosophical Greeks. Although others may have looked at the church according to its condition, Paul knew the real nature of the church, so he had the boldness to call it &#8220;the church of God.&#8221;<p>As the church of God, the church is not only being possessed by God, but has God as its nature and essence, which are divine, general, universal, and eternal. Every element has its nature, and in the nature of the element is its essence. God is the nature and essence of the church. Therefore, the church is divine.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH...IN CORINTH</h2><p>&#8220;The church...in Corinth&#8221; (v. 2b) was a church in a city, remaining in a definite locality and taking it as its standing, ground, and jurisdiction for its administration in business affairs. As such, it was physical, particular, local, and temporal in time. The church of God to whom Paul wrote was not in the heavens but in Corinth. Corinth was a very sinful, modern Greek city, which was famous for its fornication. However, the church remained in that locality for a local testimony of Christ. A local testimony of Christ is a part of the universal testimony of Christ. The universal testimony is composed of and constituted with the local testimonies.<p>The church takes a locality as its standing, ground, and jurisdiction for its administration. A local church has an administration which has a jurisdiction for business affairs. The standing, ground, and jurisdiction of the church is physical rather than divine, particular rather than general, local rather than universal, and temporal in time rather than eternal. These are the local aspects of the church.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH...SANCTIFIED IN CHRIST</h2><p>The church is &#8220;sanctified in Christ&#8221; (v. 2c), having been sanctified, made holy, in Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed Triune God in His fullness, as its element and sphere. Christ is the embodiment of the processed Triune God in all His fullness. Now we are in this Christ, and we have this Christ as our element and sphere. Just as wood is the element of a table, Christ is the element of the church. He is also the sphere, the realm, of the church.<h2 class=head1>BEING COMPOSED OF THE CALLED SAINTS</h2><p>The church is composed of the &#8220;called saints&#8221; (v. 2d)-the church of the saints, the sanctified ones, who have been called out of the satanic world. We have been called by God to be sanctified in Christ. We are no longer in the world; we are in the church which is called by God and sanctified in a wonderful person, Christ, who is our element within and our sphere without.<h2 class=head1>WITH ALL THOSE WHO CALL UPON THE NAME OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST IN EVERY PLACE</h2><p>Verse 2 contains five qualifications for a genuine church. As we have seen, the church which is genuine is the church of God, it is the church in a locality, it is sanctified in Christ, and it is composed of the called saints. Verse 2e continues with the fifth qualification: &#8220;With all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place.&#8221; This long phrase indicates that the church which is genuine is related with all the saints who call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in every place around the globe. Paul does not address the church as being related to all those who have been baptized by immersion or all those who speak in tongues or keep the Sabbath. Rather, the church is related to all those-including the believers today, those who came before us and those who will come after us-who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place.<p>Being related with all the saints keeps us from being sectarian, isolated, or divided. Regardless of their particular practices, we are related by God in Christ to every kind of Christian, and no matter where we are, we cannot be separated from them. Without this relationship we would become isolated and divided. If we have nothing to do with other believers, we are not a local church. Rather, we are a local sect, a local division. We must be open, and our openness must be in every direction. We are open to all those who call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, regardless of their particular practices.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST BEING &#8220;THEIRS AND OURS&#8221;</h2><p>Verse 2f says, &#8220;Our Lord Jesus Christ...theirs and ours.&#8221; This indicates that the church which is genuine has the Lord Jesus Christ as &#8220;their&#8221; portion, &#8220;their&#8221; possession of the divine inheritance, for &#8220;their&#8221; enjoyment. He is the portion of all believers in every place.<h2 class=head1>GRACE AND PEACE FROM GOD OUR FATHER AND THE LORD JESUS CHRIST</h2><p>Verse 3 says, &#8220;Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221; This indicates that the church which is genuine is under the dispensing of &#8220;grace,&#8221; which is the embodiment of the processed Triune God for the enjoyment of His called ones, and &#8220;peace,&#8221; the processed Triune God as the issue of the enjoyment of Him as grace by His called ones. Grace and peace are dispensed to the church from God the Father as the source of the Divine Trinity, from the Lord Jesus Christ as the course of the flow of the Divine Trinity, and from the Holy Spirit as the reaching of the flow of the Divine Trinity. This is not mentioned in word in verse 2, but is implied in denotation (2 Cor. 13:14).<p>Based on the qualifications of a genuine church in chapter one, verse 2, the church has the standing to receive the divine dispensing of God Himself as grace and peace. This is from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. This also implies that this dispensing is from the Spirit because whenever the Father and Son are mentioned, the Spirit is implied. Therefore, the grace and peace is from the Triune God, the Divine Trinity- the divine Father, the divine Son, and the divine Spirit-one God in different aspects, with all the riches of the Divine Trinity. The Triune God is the grace and peace to His called ones for their enjoyment.<h2 class=head1>BASED UPON THE GRACE OF GOD GIVEN IN CHRIST JESUS</h2><p>Verse 4 says, &#8220;I give thanks to God always concerning you based upon the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus.&#8221; This indicates that the church which is genuine has the grace of God given to it in Christ, not the condition in itself, as its base. The grace of God is not given to the church based upon the spirituality or condition of the church. The grace of God alone is the base for the church. Paul&#8217;s thanks to God in verse 4 was based upon the gift of grace which was given to the church in Christ Jesus. In the New Testament, the phrase &#8220;in Christ&#8221; is mainly used related to the Triune God (2 Cor. 5:19) and the believers corporately (1 Cor. 1:30). Therefore, the grace of God given to the believers is the Triune God Himself.<p>The church is standing on the base of grace in order that it may receive further grace. We have received grace as our base, and today we are standing upon grace, not upon our attributes, virtues, or excellencies. Therefore, we are qualified to receive more grace, even grace upon grace. John 1:16 says, &#8220;For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.&#8221; We are qualified by grace to receive grace upon grace. We have to thank the Lord that the more storms there are in the church, the more &#8220;waves&#8221; of grace there are. Every storm brings another &#8220;wave&#8221; of grace. Moreover, this grace issues in peace. In His Divine Trinity, God is not only grace but peace to us. After receiving grace, we are at peace, and we can say, &#8220;Hallelujah, Amen!&#8221; We are in the peace because we have enjoyed grace, and we have grace because we have received grace upon grace.<h2 class=head1>ENRICHED IN EVERYTHING IN CHRIST</h2><p>Verses 5-7a say, &#8220;That in everything you were enriched in Him, in all expression and all knowledge, even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you, so that you are not lacking in any gift.&#8221; The church which is genuine is enriched in everything in Christ, so that it is not lacking in any gift. The gift referred to here is the inward initial gift issuing from grace, such as the eternal life and the Holy Spirit (Rom. 6:23; Acts 2:38; Heb. 6:4), not the outward miraculous gifts. The Triune God as grace to us issues in and becomes the gift. We have received grace, and we have the gift which is out of grace, so that we are not lacking in any gift.<h2 class=head1>AWAITING THE UNVEILING OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST</h2><p>Verse 7b says, &#8220;Awaiting the unveiling of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221; This indicates that the church which is genuine should have a normal sign, that is, the awaiting of the unveiling, the appearing, of the Lord Jesus Christ. We are not waiting to get a good car or a high appointment. Rather, since we have received grace upon grace, we are awaiting the unveiling, the appearing, the second coming, of the Lord Jesus Christ from heaven.<h2 class=head1>BEING CONFIRMED TILL THE END BY GOD</h2><p>In verse 8 Paul says, &#8220;Who will also confirm you till the end, unreprovable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221; This indicates that a genuine church needs to grow in life, as mentioned in 1 Corinthians 3:6, after its initial receiving of grace, that it will be unreprovable in the day of Christ&#8217;s coming. After receiving grace as our base, we have to grow in grace so that we will be unreprovable in the day of Christ&#8217;s coming. &#8220;Who&#8221; in verse 8 refers not to Christ but to God in verse 4. God has given us grace, and this very God will also confirm us to the end. He is the Alpha and the Omega. He is the giver of grace at the beginning and the completer of our growth in life at the end. He will confirm us until the end, unreprovable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.<h2 class=head1>CALLED INTO THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE SON THROUGH THE FAITHFUL GOD</h2><p>Verse 9 says, &#8220;God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.&#8221; This indicates that the church which is genuine has been called by God the Father who is faithful into the fellowship of, the participation in, His Son Jesus Christ, who is the consummated, all-inclusive, indwelling and life-giving and dispensing Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17-18), as its divine portion for its enjoyment of the consummated Triune God. First Corinthians 15:45b says, &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit,&#8221; and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, &#8220;And the Lord is the Spirit.&#8221; This life-giving Spirit, the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God, is the church&#8217;s divine portion for its enjoyment of the consummated Triune God. Moreover, the church is now one spirit with this Spirit.<p>Through the faithful Triune God, we were called into the fellowship, communion, enjoyment, and participation of Jesus Christ our Lord. We have been called into an enjoyment, and this enjoyment is our fellowship. Moreover, this fellowship is Jesus Christ. He is our portion, both &#8220;theirs and ours&#8221; (1:2). We are enjoying the Son of God as the embodiment of the Triune God in full. Every meeting of the genuine church is an enjoying and feasting meeting.<p>As we have seen, there are five qualifications for the genuine church. First, it is the church of God. Then, it is the church expressed in a definite locality. It is also the composition of those who have been sanctified in Christ and the composition of the called saints. Last, it is not isolated, divided, or separated from the other saints, but is related to all those who call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in every place. Such a church has Christ as its portion, enjoyment, Lord, Head, and everything. Such a church also is ready, qualified, and positioned to receive the dispensing of the divine grace with the divine peace. If we have the five foregoing qualifications, we are standing, not on the base of our condition or good works, but on the base of the grace we have received, which is God Himself. On this base we are receiving more grace for our enjoyment, and on this base we also have the gift which issues from grace, so that we are short of nothing. We are enriched in the initial heavenly gift, such as the eternal life and the Holy Spirit. In such a standing, there is nothing more to do but to await His coming back.<p>As a wonderful conclusion to such a portrait of the church in verses 2 through 8, Paul goes on to say, &#8220;God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord&#8221; (v. 9). The One through whom we were called is the Triune God as indicated by the reference to &#8220;God&#8221; and &#8220;His Son.&#8221; Furthermore, Paul&#8217;s use of the preposition &#8220;through&#8221; implies a process through which the Triune God passed in order to call us. The phrase &#8220;through whom&#8221; is fully defined in Ephesians 1. Ephesians 1:3-6 is a portion of the Word on the Father&#8217;s choosing and predestination, speaking forth God&#8217;s eternal purpose. Verses 7-12 go on to speak of the Son&#8217;s redemption, speaking forth the accomplishment of God&#8217;s eternal purpose. Then verses 13-14 speak concerning the Spirit&#8217;s sealing and pledging, speaking forth the application of God&#8217;s accomplished purpose. In total, verses 3-14 unveil the Father&#8217;s choosing, the Son&#8217;s redeeming, and the Spirit&#8217;s sealing and pledging. Following this, Paul goes on to pray that the church would know the hope of God&#8217;s calling (vv. 17-18a). The Father&#8217;s choosing, the Son&#8217;s redeeming, and the Spirit&#8217;s sealing consummate in our calling. We were called through the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, that is, through the Father&#8217;s choosing, the Son&#8217;s redeeming, and the Spirit&#8217;s sealing. The Father&#8217;s choosing was before the foundation of the world, the Son&#8217;s redeeming was almost two thousand years ago, and the Spirit&#8217;s sealing began fifty days after the Lord&#8217;s resurrection. This was the process that the Triune God passed through in order to call the genuine church into the fellowship of the Son, Jesus Christ.<p>What a marvelous portion of the Scriptures 1 Corinthians 1:2-9 is! This portion unveils to us what the genuine church is. According to outward appearances, the church may appear pitiful, but within the church is wonderful. I am so happy that I am in the church and that I am for the church.<p>Today the Lord&#8217;s recovery is composed of such genuine churches. When we consider the Lord&#8217;s recovery, we should not consider its outward condition. If we merely consider its outward condition, we may be deceived. We must go further, deeper, and higher to look at the church&#8217;s intrinsic items-its nature, essence, element, standing, and ground. If we look at the churches in this way, we will be preserved from being deceived, and we will enjoy all the riches of the intrinsic items of the church. May the Lord be merciful to all of us.<p>A message given by Witness Lee<br>in Long Beach, California on June 2, 1990</p></body></html>
