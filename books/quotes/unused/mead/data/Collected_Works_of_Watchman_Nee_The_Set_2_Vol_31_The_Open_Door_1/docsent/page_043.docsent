   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I hope to hear from you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I received a letter from Sister Chin in Peking saying that Brother Witness plans to go to Peking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She also said that Sister Chi's husband Chi Tsung-sin was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Oh, may the doors to the Lord's gospel be opened wide.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We left Shansi province and came to Honan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not long afterwards, we continued on our way to Tsao-Yang County, where we are living temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>My elder brother sent a telegram telling me to go to Ch'ang-sha and then to go home Tientsin together with my younger brother.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Please pray for this matter!</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thank and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sister Dai, Sister Chang, and Sister Shao are all in Tientsin, and they all come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have also witnessed God's work recently in the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is doing His own work through the present environment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The spiritual growth of several brothers is something that I must praise the Lord for.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The brothers and sisters receive much help from them in both the Bible studies and the gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thank the Lord for gracing us!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are still remembering the physically weak ones in our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We also mention Brother Luan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>May God grace him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If God wills, He will cause him to become healthy; if not, may the Lord manifest His great power in man's weakness as He did in the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brother Yin went to Ch'ang-sha about three months ago.</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The illness she contracted after childbirth cannot be healed easily.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May the Lord be merciful to her and heal her.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thank the Lord, His grace to me is greater than what I am worthy of.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am "cold" so many times, but the Lord repeatedly draws me with His love.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>My heart cannot but be drawn towards Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is true that the Lord's love is deeper as time goes by, and His grace is greater as the years go by.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Please greet the brothers and sisters in the Lord and the ones that I know: Brother Nee, Brother Luan, and Sister Chang.</S>

   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Brother James Chen came to Swatow last month.</S>

   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I have heard that Satan worked mightily to try to close the door of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But if the Lord has opened the door of the gospel, who can close it?</S>
