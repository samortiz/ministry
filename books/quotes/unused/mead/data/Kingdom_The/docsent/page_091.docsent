   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN TRANSFORMATION ITS HARVEST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:9b; Rev 12:10a; 14:1, 3, 4, 14-16; 21:2, 10, 11, 14, 18, 19, 21; 22:1, 2a</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The seed of the kingdom is sown in Matthew, the sprouting of the seed takes place in Acts, and the growth occurs in the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then in the book of Revelation there is the maturity, which is the harvest for the full coming of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The book of Revelation presents the maturity, the harvest, the full coming, and the full manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have seen that the seed was sown in Matthew 13 and that it grew in 1 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"I planted, Apollos watered, and God gave the growth" 3:6, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>. In 1 Corinthians 3 we also have seen the matter of transformation; the plants have been transformed into minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The life of the seed has metabolized the plant into precious materials useful for building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The gold, silver, and precious stones are materials for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Corinthians 3:9 reminds us that we are God's farm and God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As God's farm, we grow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whatever is grown is then metabolized into precious materials for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE HARVEST OF TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Revelation 12:10 says, "Now is come...the kingdom of our God."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What is the coming of the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The answer is found in Revelation 14.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Revelation 14:1, 3-4 mention the firstfruit, the 144,000.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The number 144,000 is the product of twelve times twelve multiplied by one thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Please remember that twelve is composed of four times three, signifying the mingling of humanity with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now we have twelve times twelve multiplied a thousandfold.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means maturity among maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus they are the firstfruit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Never forget that the seed is sown in Matthew 13 and grows in 1 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The harvest is found in Revelation 14.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, we have the seed, the growth, and the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is the harvest?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The harvest is the coming of the kingdom, for Revelation 12:10 tells us that the kingdom has come.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When did the kingdom begin to come?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Matthew 3 the proclamation was made that the kingdom was near.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, it had not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The kingdom began to come when the Lord Jesus appeared as the sower to sow the seed, and it has been coming from that time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This coming is the growing and spreading of the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Coming means growing and spreading until maturity is reached.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This maturity is the full coming of the kingdom; it is the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Regarding the harvest, the matter of primary importance is the firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you read Leviticus 23, you will see that in God's economy He first has the harvest of the firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In a field some fruit will ripen earlier than the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The farmer will harvest this as the firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sometime after the firstfruit has been harvested, the remainder of the crop will ripen.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At that time there will be the full harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At the beginning, there is the firstfruit, and later there is the full harvest.</S>
