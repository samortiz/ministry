   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO THE REALITY OF THE KINGDOM 1 Scripture Reading: Matt 5:3-12, 13-16, 20-45a, 48</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 5, 6, and 7 reveal the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to Matthew, the kingdom has three main aspects: the reality of the kingdom, the appearance of the kingdom, and the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we are going to understand all the chapters and verses in Matthew regarding the kingdom, we have to see these three main aspects of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some of the verses in Matthew are concerning the reality of the kingdom; others are concerning the appearance of the kingdom; still others are concerning the manifestation of the kingdom in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must realize that as the reality of the kingdom comes into being, the enemy, Satan, will also come in to do some distracting, frustrating, and damaging work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This working of the enemy produces the outward appearance of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today these two lines exist together: the reality of the kingdom and the appearance of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Matthew 13 there is the wheat, but there are also the tares.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is the great tree growing up out of proportion and not according to its kind, and there is the leaven corrupting the fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The tares, the great tree, and the leaven constitute the outward appearance of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually there will be the harvest time, the full coming of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That will be the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not consider that it is unnecessary to discern these three aspects concerning the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you do not see these three aspects, you cannot understand what Matthew says concerning the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the very reason why many Christians have never been clear concerning the kingdom in Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They simply have never seen the three different aspects of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The reality of the kingdom is fully revealed and covered in Matthew 5, 6, and 7.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These chapters have been called the Sermon on the Mount.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus called His disciples and brought them to the mountaintop where He gave them the discourse which is recorded in Matthew 5, 6, and 7.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not easy to realize and apprehend what is revealed in these three chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the past, these three chapters have not been realized in a full, adequate, and proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although they may have used some of the sentences, phrases, and terms from these chapters, most Christians have not apprehended them in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These chapters are the revelation of the proper kingdom life, and some of the verses are very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you do not realize the governing principle, it will be difficult for you to apprehend the real meaning of these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord's discourse on the mount is divided into seven sections which reveal seven aspects of the life of the children of the kingdom.</S>
