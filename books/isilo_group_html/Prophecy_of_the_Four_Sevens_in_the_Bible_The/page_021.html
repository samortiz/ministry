Before the ascension of Christ, there was such a scroll, but it was not opened. After His ascension, Christ as the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, and the Lamb opened this scroll. The seven seals with which the scroll is sealed are actually the contents of the scroll and the contents of the book of Revelation. This book is just the opening, the unveiling, of the seven seals. Today by the Lord's mercy we have an open scroll before us.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Prophecy of the Four 'Sevens' in the Bible &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
