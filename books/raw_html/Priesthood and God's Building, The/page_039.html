<h1 class="title">THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PRIESTHOOD</h1>
<p>In order to read the Bible properly, we need to understand the meaning of the words, but we also need to touch the feeling conveyed through the words. This can be likened to writing an essay. A good essay expresses the inner feeling of a writer through words. Consequently, when others read the essay, they should touch the feeling behind the words. Similarly, when we read the Bible, we must understand the words and the context, but we also must touch the feeling behind the words. If we do this, we will be able to touch the meaning behind the inspired writing of the Scriptures by touching the Spirit in that particular portion. As we consider the matter of the priesthood in the Bible, the light is becoming much clearer and brighter, and we are touching God&rsquo;s feeling in this matter. Nevertheless, we need to speak further in order to help the saints comprehend this matter more thoroughly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRIESTHOOD AND<br />
THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire in this universe is to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life and to be mingled with man as one so that man may have His image to express Him and His authority to represent Him. Moreover, God desires that those who receive Him as life would be built up together as one entity to be His dwelling place, which is the Body of Christ. This is the focus of the entire Bible.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish His desire, God is in the Son, and the first step in accomplishing His purpose involves His coming as the Son to man (John 1:1, 14). In this process the Son is the center. The second step involves His coming as the Spirit of reality to man (14:17; 15:26; 16:13). If God did not come in the Son to be the Spirit, He could not be mingled with man, and man would not have His image to express Him and His authority to represent Him. Furthermore, without this process, man could not be blended together and built up as a corporate entity. Therefore, in order to accomplish His heart&rsquo;s desire, God came to man first in the Son and then as the Spirit. God comes to us in the Son, and the Son is received by us as the Spirit, who comes into us as life and upon us as power. This enables us to express God&rsquo;s image and represent God&rsquo;s authority. Furthermore, in this one Spirit we are one Body.</p>
<p>The Body being one is related to the Spirit in two aspects. On one hand, we need to be filled with the Spirit inwardly as life, and on the other hand, we need to be baptized with the Spirit outwardly as power. Romans 8:2 says that we have received the Spirit of life inwardly; this enables us to be members of the Body of Christ (12:5). This relates to the inward filling of the Spirit. First Corinthians 12:13 then says, &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body.&rdquo; This relates to the pouring out of the Spirit upon us, because the water of baptism does not enter into us; instead, we are immersed into the water.</p>
<p>Both inwardly and outwardly, the Spirit is the ultimate manifestation of God reaching us. God the Father comes to us in the Son, and the Son with the Father enters into us as the Spirit. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit work as one to attain God&rsquo;s goal. This is confirmed by the Lord Jesus&rsquo; charge that we baptize people into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19). Through this process, God enters into man and comes upon man. God can enter into man and come upon man because the Father is in the Son, and the Son is now the life-giving Spirit. The Triune God accomplishes His eternal purpose as the Father, Son, and Spirit. This is on God&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>On our side it is not enough to merely be human beings; we must also be priests so that God can accomplish His purpose. A priest draws near to God, fellowships with God, lives before God, and allows God to flow through him so that God can saturate him and be lived out of him. We can see this matter clearly with the patriarchs and with the Israelites in the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRIESTHOOD AND THE PATRIARCHS</h2>
<p>In Adam we see God&rsquo;s desire for man to have His image and to exercise His dominion, His authority (Gen. 1:26). With Adam we also see that in order for man to bear God&rsquo;s image and represent His authority, man needs to receive God as life (2:9, 16). A person who receives God as life, lives before God, and lets God live in him will spontaneously bear God&rsquo;s image and represent God&rsquo;s authority. God&rsquo;s original thought concerning the priesthood is illustrated through Adam.</p>
<p>Following Adam, a further aspect of the priestly service can be seen in the lives of Abel, Enoch, and Noah. In addition to walking with God, their lives speak of the need for a redemptive sacrifice (4:4; 5:22; 6:9; 8:20). Redemption is a requirement related to the priesthood. After Adam&rsquo;s fall, there was the need for a lamb to be killed in order to accomplish redemption on man&rsquo;s behalf. Although man needs to live before God and walk with God, man also needs to be joined to God through the death of Christ the Lamb. After Adam&rsquo;s sin, man was separated from God and driven out of the garden of Eden (3:24). As a consequence, he could no longer contact God in the way that Adam could prior to the fall. Man was alienated from God and far off from God (Eph. 2:12-13). Every man is far off from God even before he is born. Hence, there is a need for a redemptive sacrifice, the shedding of blood, so that man can be brought back to God and contact God. This is a matter of the priesthood.</p>
<p>In Abraham&rsquo;s life we can see more concerning the priesthood. Abraham built an altar, pitched a tent, and lived a practical priestly life (Gen. 12:7-8; 13:4, 18). Furthermore, he enjoyed God&rsquo;s appearing, he received revelation from God, and he experienced wonderful fellowship with God. All these experiences are aspects of the priestly service. Hence, his experience of the priesthood was evident in his life even more than in the experiences of Abel, Enoch, and Noah. Abraham even received God&rsquo;s blessing through the high priest Melchizedek, a proper type of Christ as the eternal One, who is our perpetual High Priest (Heb. 7:1-3; Gen. 14:18-20). Abraham even became a person who blessed others (20:17). Wherever Abraham went, he was able to bless others. Hence, his service as a priest before God was more advanced than the service of Abel, Enoch, and Noah.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
