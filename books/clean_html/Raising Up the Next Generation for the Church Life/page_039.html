<h2 class="head2 alignleft">Excerpts from the Ministry:</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s heart is to carry out His economy. His heart is not that we always please Him and make Him happy, nor that we should be good, spiritual, holy, or victorious. He desires neither a good man nor a bad man but a God-man. God created us according to His image and wanted us to take His life, signified by the tree of life. Because we became fallen, God became a man to save us, to redeem us. He died an all-inclusive death for us, and He resurrected to beget us by imparting God&rsquo;s life and nature into us, making us God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</p>
<p>We should not regard the Bible as a book that teaches us to be a good man or a spiritual man. The Bible reveals that God wants us to be a &ldquo;Christ-man.&rdquo; To be a Christian is to be a Christ-man, a man of Christ.</p>
<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s economy requires our cooperation. To cooperate with God means to be bound together with God. We may use a three-legged race as an illustration. The runners in such a race must run in pairs, with each partner having one leg bound to one of his partner&rsquo;s legs. In order for the partners to run, they must cooperate with each other and not move independently. This is a picture of the proper Christian life. To be a Christian is to be bound together with Christ and to have one living with Him by one life.</p>
<p>The birth of Samuel involved Hannah&rsquo;s cooperation with God. The old priesthood had become stale and waning, and God wanted to have another beginning. For Samuel&rsquo;s birth, God initiated things behind the scenes. On the one hand, He shut up Hannah&rsquo;s womb; on the other hand, He prepared a provoker (1 Sam. 1:5-7). This forced Hannah to pray that the Lord would give her a male child. In her prayer she made a vow and said, &ldquo;O Jehovah of hosts, if You will indeed look upon the affliction of Your female servant and remember me and not forget Your female servant, but give to Your female servant a male child, then I will give him to Jehovah for all the days of his life, and no razor will come upon his head&rdquo; (v. 11). This prayer was initiated not by Hannah but by God. God chose Hannah because she was willing to cooperate with Him. God answered her prayer and opened her womb, and Hannah conceived and bore a son (v. 20). Then according to her vow, she offered her son to God, placing him in the custody of Eli. From this we see that Hannah, Samuel&rsquo;s mother, was one who cooperated very much with God. Her case shows us the kind of persons God expects to have today.

<p>The Ark was a type of Christ as the embodiment of God. It also signified Christ as the presence of the Triune God to be with His people for the carrying out of His economy to establish His kingdom on earth. To bring out the Ark was just to bring out the presence of God. When the children of Israel began to move with the ark from Mount Sinai, Moses offered a prayer to God, saying, &ldquo;Rise up, O Jehovah, and let Your enemies be scattered&rdquo; (Num. 10:35). The Ark took the lead to travel onward. The move of the Ark was a picture of God&rsquo;s move on the earth.</p>
<p>In 1 Samuel 4 the elders of Israel were actually usurping God. At that time, God did not intend to move. The children of Israel had no thought of or concern for God&rsquo;s economy, and their bringing out the Ark indicated that they were usurping God for their safety, peace, rest, and profit. They were usurping God, even forcing Him, to go out with them.</p>
<p>Today many Christians usurp God by praying for their prosperity, health, or family without any consideration of God&rsquo;s economy. When we ask God for His healing, we must be fully related to His economy. If you are ill, you should not pray for healing in the way of usurping God. On the contrary, from the depths of your spirit you should say, &ldquo;Lord, I am not here on earth for my health, my prosperity, my children, or my work. I am here for Your economy. Do You still want me to live on earth for Your economy? I have seen Your economy, I realize that You need Nazarites, and I have a heart to be a Nazarite for You. As one who has been born of God and who has the life and nature of God, I ask You what is on Your heart concerning me.&rdquo; If God intends that you continue living on earth for His economy, you will be healed, either through a physician or through some other way. The point here is that, instead of usurping God, we must pray, live, and be persons according to God&rsquo;s heart and for His economy. (<em>Life-study of 1 &amp; 2 Samuel,</em> pp. 22-23)</p>

<p>For us to live for Christ, we need to exist. Without our human existence we cannot live Christ. But today those in the fallen world care for nothing but their existence; they do not care for the purpose of their existence. To exist is one thing, but to exist for the divine purpose is another thing. The purpose ordained by God for our existence is to live Christ, to live God out, and to have God&rsquo;s testimony. But the people of this world have only their existence; they have no purpose. Eventually they make their existence itself the purpose of their existence. They know nothing but existence. Satan picks up the existence of human beings or of human living and uses this existence to usurp people so that today the whole world cares only for existence, not for God&rsquo;s purpose in existence.</p>
<p>All things necessary for our human existence need to be under a divine limitation. Anything that exceeds our need becomes worldly, &ldquo;Egyptian,&rdquo; something of Pharaoh, and it frustrates us from the economy of God&rsquo;s purpose. In everything God&rsquo;s economy must be the deciding factor. Our living should not be like that of the &ldquo;Egyptians,&rdquo; the worldly people. We need a place to live, and we need to keep our house clean. But if we continue with our cleaning when it is time to go to the meeting, our cleaning becomes &ldquo;Egyptian,&rdquo; something apart from the economy of God&rsquo;s purpose. We are on earth not for cleaning but for a feast unto the Lord. Even how much time we spend with our children should be decided by God&rsquo;s economy. Other Christians may act like the people of the world, but we have to be a holy people, a separated people.</p>
<p>Our living and our existence depend on the provision from the heavenly source, not on the supply from the world. For this we need the vision, and we need the exercise of our faith. Moses was a man of great faith to lead two million people out of Egypt into the wilderness, where there was no earthly supply for their human existence. (<em>Life-study of Exodus,</em> p. 156)</p>

<p>The picture portrayed in 1 Samuel 7:1-5 is very beautiful. Here we have a people returning to God and a man&mdash;Samuel&mdash;who was one with God on earth. We may say that Samuel was the acting God on earth. At least we may say that Samuel was the representative of the very God in heaven to rule over His people on earth. As such a person, Samuel began to minister.</p>
<p>Samuel was faithful to God to do according to what was in God&rsquo;s heart and mind. His whole being and person, not just his doing, living, and work, were according to God. Samuel&rsquo;s being and God&rsquo;s heart were one. For this reason it is not too much to say that Samuel, a man according to God, was the acting God on earth. God&rsquo;s mind was Samuel&rsquo;s consideration. He had no other thought, consideration, or thinking. His living and working were for the carrying out of whatever was in God&rsquo;s heart. As a consequence, Samuel was one who turned the age.</p>
<p>In this replacing priesthood, Samuel anointed Saul and David to be kings (10:1; 16:1, 13) as God ordained that he should go before His anointed continually (2:35b) to supervise the king, observing what the king was doing. This indicates that Samuel, the acting God on earth, was greater than the king. Samuel could be qualified to such an extent because for many years God had been perfecting him for His economy, not for anything else.</p>
<p>When God&rsquo;s economy is carried out among His people, they are blessed. This means that our welfare, our well-being, is altogether linked to the carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy. We should not seek our well-being apart from God&rsquo;s economy. Because this has been neglected and even lost, it needs to be recovered. I wish to say, especially to the young saints, that we should not expect to have prosperity for ourselves. Rather, as saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we should expect that through us the Lord will do as much as possible to accomplish His economy. Then we will be blessed. (<em>Life-study of 1 &amp; 2 Samuel,</em> pp. 27-30)</p>

<p>The church cannot go on if parents do not have a sense of being entrusted. We do not want to see our children being rescued back from the world. Suppose we beget children, lose them to the world, and then try to rescue them back. If we allow this to happen, the gospel will never be preached to the uttermost part of the earth. Our children have been taught many teachings, and we have been taking care of them for years. At least these children should be brought to the Lord. We are wrong if we do not take care of our children. Please remember that it is the parents&rsquo; responsibility to ensure that their children turn out the right way.</p>
<p>Please give me the liberty to say this word. Throughout church history, the greatest failure among Christians is the failure in parenting. This is something no one cares much about. The children are young; they are in your hands and can do nothing much themselves. If you are loose with yourself, you will also be loose with them. We must realize that parents must exercise self-control, sacrificing their own freedom. God has committed a human body, along with his soul, into our hands. If we do not exercise self-control and give up our freedom, we will have a difficult time answering to our God in the future.</p>
