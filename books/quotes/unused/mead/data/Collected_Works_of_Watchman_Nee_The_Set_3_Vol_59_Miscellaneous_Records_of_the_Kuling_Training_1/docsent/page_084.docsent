   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Sister Wang Shu-ging: If some schools insist on cutting the girls' hair, what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Can we sue the school?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Watchman Nee: The Bible does not permit believers to sue anyone cf.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 Cor 6:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If others sue us, we can respond to the suit, but we cannot initiate a lawsuit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When problems arise between believers and unbelievers, the unbelievers can be the plaintiff.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Believers can defend themselves, but that is all they can do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A believer cannot turn around and file a suit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is all right for Christians to be defendants, but never plaintiffs.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This applies to a Christian's personal affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As citizens of a state, however, we have the right to enjoy the freedom guaranteed by the constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christians can enjoy the same freedom as others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a school forces girls to cut their hair, the parents can sue the school, and we can help the parents in their fight against the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is the freedom of individual citizens to keep their hair.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no law that says that a person cannot be a citizen of the Republic of China if he or she keeps long hair.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A school principal cannot say that a girl can no longer be a student if she has long hair.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a matter of personal liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If someone asks me to intervene in this matter, I will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, we have to be proper in our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may invite those for a meal, go to the court together, and then drive them home afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In such matters we should be free from personal feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are here to fight for the truth only.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the post office writes a letter saying that they will not deliver Bibles, we can invite the postmaster to a meal and still sue him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A Christian can fight for his right under the constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yet we are fighting for the truth, not for personal conflicts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In territories occupied by the Communists, some members of the party confiscate property and possessions and distribute them to others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a Christian receives such distributed goods, he has no choice but to keep them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But when the situation changes, he can inform the original owners to come and retrieve their goods.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is more serious for a school to demand its girl students to cut their hair than to cut their fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Cutting one's finger only involves individuals, but cutting the hair involves the truth and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a sister is not clear about the truth and has cut her hair already, she should cover her head with a scarf.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When her hair grows back, she can take the scarf off.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Question: Some time ago the church in Swatow excommunicated a co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Was that right or wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Watchman Nee: Concerning this matter I need to say a word to the brothers in Swatow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have been in the work for over ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have to apologize to the brothers with respect to a few things related to the excommunication of that co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After that incident Swatow sent Brother Wen-kwang to Shanghai and asked us to excommunicate the same brother from the work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We were reluctant to assume the burden of others in our work, but this was wrong on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The real matter did not involve whether or not the brother should have been excommunicated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There was no question about the rightness or correctness of the act itself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Unfortunately, the church in Swatow was in the position of rebellion when it excommunicated him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The co-workers should have been the ones to excommunicate that co-worker from the work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It should not have been handled through the church in Swatow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the brothers in Swatow executed the excommunication, it exposed them to a position more precarious than that of "The Lord rebuke you" in Jude.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the co-workers had handled the situation then, the issue of authority would not have been involved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I admit that I was wrong in leaving the brothers in Swatow in a quandary.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I did not have the opportunity to make this matter clear before; I wish to take this opportunity today to make this clear.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church's excommunication can only be applied to six kinds of people, as spoken of in 1 Corinthians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Others who are not clearly wrong in conduct, but who are wrong only in attitude or motive, should not be excommunicated, because there is no absolute standard for such things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church can only exhort the various parties.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the parties choose to ignore the church, at the most the church can turn its head the other way and consider them as Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As for the case spoken of in Matthew 18, it involves offenses against individuals; it is an entirely different matter altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Question: If a person commits an error with respect to submission to authority, can we point out his error to him?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Watchman Nee: If a person has never touched authority, it is useless to point out his error to him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For example, if you work in the Public Works Department and a few of your colleagues speak defiantly against their superior, it is useless to point out their error to them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They are unbelievers who are totally in the realm of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you point out their error, at the most they will nod their heads; they will not change their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What use is it to do this?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You must first help a person to see authority.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whether or not you point out the error is not that crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In pointing out others' error, you should be like one who is touching contamination and defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When such things come to you, you should recoil.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You have to exercise extreme care in such things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You should not be sucked into the tide of rebellion and should not fall into the realm of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The basic problem with a rebellious person is that he has not seen authority.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Suppose a man smokes.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What use is it to help him merely stop smoking?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He needs some basic dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He needs to touch authority.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Miscellaneous dealings are not very effective.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You have to bring a man face to face with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Only after you have done this can you say, "The way you just acted was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Those few words amounted to rebellion."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You have to learn to fear God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God is never loose with you in such matters.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Suppose a person is very lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He invites himself to this and that house for dinner but never takes up any job.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You have to announce his name to the brothers and sisters and forbid anyone to invite him to their home.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you do this, you will stop his habitual ill.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Some idle ones may criticize you, but in a nice way you can say, "Sorry, I do not have the time to listen to you."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The problem today is that many people love to play politics.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This makes the situation worse.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>There is so much gossip because so many like to hear such gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We have to grow in faith and in love.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We should rebuke the brothers and sisters who should be rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The best way is, of course, to exhort them with love.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>At any rate, we should not play politics in dealing with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Question: How should we muzzle a person who loves to speak and spread rumors?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Watchman Nee: Brother Miao made the best remark of his life when he said, "The ears are a trash can.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>No one throws good things like gold, silver, flour, or rice into a trash can."</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If anyone comes to you with gossip, you should say, "Sorry, my ears are not trash cans."</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>They will have no choice but to take their trash elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Those who cause divisions should be marked out, and no one should have any communication with them.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We should maintain our purity in our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If any word is to go out, we must first examine it and see if there is any element of rebellion or gossip in it.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Much so-called fellowship among believers is actually gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We must quarantine all rebellions.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Titus 3 says that we should refuse a factious man after a first and second admonition v. 10 . This refusal does not mean an open excommunication.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>It is a measure that aims at preserving the purity of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Many times measures taken among the brothers and sisters have nothing to do with love; they are a matter of dealing with infection.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If a man speaks in a rebellious way, the best way to love him is to separate him from others.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is the greatest love one can give to him, because this will bring him profit and save others.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Quarantine is exercised under the principle that it is an effort of recovery for the quarantined and a measure of prevention against infection for others.</S>
