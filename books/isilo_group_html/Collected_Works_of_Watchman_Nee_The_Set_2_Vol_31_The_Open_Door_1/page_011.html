Since you and Brother Nee have left Shanghai, I have been going on according to the principle of separation between the church and the work. Last Lord's Day I delivered a message with much fear and trembling. I hope that Brother Tang Shou-ling and David Hsu will come to Shanghai, but they have not come, and I do not know where they are. Letters take a long time, and communication is difficult. I hope that you will pray for us. Please give my greetings to Brother Nee.</p><p>Brother Chang Kwang-rong<br />December 4<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Women's Work in the Refugee Camp,<br />Shanghai</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>I received your letter yesterday from Mr. Ho. Presently, I am taking care of a women's meeting at the refugee camp in Jiao-Tung University. The number is around forty, and the condition of the meeting is quite good. I spoke for three days and then had to stop because of a cold. Some seminary students took my place and continued. We will see how the Lord leads us to go on. I have been using a series of hymns to teach the women to study the truth and to learn to read. I hope this series of meetings can last for a period of ten days. This is only the first attempt on my part to learn to do something.</p><p>There are about twenty thousand refugees in the Jiao-Tung University refugee camp. They are all local people living in and around Shanghai. The China Inland Mission workers have picked up part of the work from the International Relief Organization. They are preparing to have meetings for women and children, in addition to providing relief work. They expect me to render more help to the work there. This may be a good opportunity for me to do some work among the women. Recently, I have been reading the biography of Mr. Muller and have received much help in the matter of guidance and trusting in God. Since the Lord has put me on this frontline, I feel that I should follow those who are my seniors to go on in this one flow, even though I admit that I am far behind. Sister Roh-chen wrote and told us that Sisters Yu and Lee are still in Hong Kong because they have had difficulty entering Yunnan. I wonder whether you already know about this? Sister Ding Shu-shin left for Singapore a few days ago, and Sister An-sin went to Hong Kong on the same steamer. Peace to you in the Lord!</p><p>Sister Hwei-fen<br />November 27<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter From James Chen, Swatow</h2><p>My respected Brother X and Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>By the Lord's grace, I came to Swatow again on the nineteenth of last month and have been greatly encouraged through meeting the brothers and sisters here who are in tribulation. Although many of the brothers and sisters have scattered into the inland regions, it is a comforting thought to realize that they are all preserved in the Lord's peace. Recently, some heartbreaking events happened among us. Brother Liu Liang-wei passed away, and a few days ago Sister Sun Pei-fang also went to be with the Lord. Within a period of three months, we lost two precious believers, and our hearts were broken. It is surely excellent for those who have departed to be with the Lord, but the meeting in the Swatow cannot help but be affected by this. The door of the gospel around the Swatow and Chaochow regions is still open, and there is a calling from various places. I intend to go with a few brothers to labor in these places. But seeing the darkness all around and the coldness of man's heart, I wonder how a weak one like myself can meet the need. I ask you not to forget to pray for me so that the Lord can gain something, amen. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother James Chen<br />December 3<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
