        <h2 class="head1">EATING THE LORD</h2>
<p>Our Lord is edible and drinkable. We eat the Lord through His word and drink Him by calling on His name. Isaiah 12:3-4 says, &ldquo;You will draw water with rejoicing / From the springs of salvation, /...Give thanks to Jehovah; call upon His name!&rdquo; Here calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name is linked to drinking from the springs of salvation. To draw water from the springs of salvation is to drink, and the way to drink is to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name. Hence, when we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, we drink the Lord.</p>
<p>This kind of drinking also includes eating. When children drink milk, they are also eating. Milk is not only a beverage; it is also food. It is not sufficient to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name; we must match our calling with His word. Sometimes when we call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; we are so joyful that we praise, worship, or even give thanks with His words. We may say, &ldquo;You are the bread of life, and he who eats You will live because of You!&rdquo; This is to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name and enjoy His word. Calling is drinking, and enjoying the word is eating. Hence, when we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name and pray-read the Word, we eat of Him and also drink of Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MOST EXCELLENT WAY OF PRACTICE</h2>
<p>Eating and drinking to enjoy the Lord are like our physical eating and drinking and therefore must be done at fixed times and should neither be too much nor too little. In order to have a healthy body, we should eat small portions many times a day. We should not eat too much each time but should eat until we are eighty percent full. The later it is in the day, the less we should eat. The same applies to calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name and pray-reading His Word. Every day we should spend time early in the morning to read the Word, but we should not spend too much time reading. We should also call and pray while we read. Immediately after I was saved, I received the help to read through the Bible once a year. This is a very good practice. I have also helped others to do the same. Although this is beneficial, it mainly gives people knowledge, not enjoyment. It is possible to read a long portion without receiving the life supply. Now we know that we only need to spend ten minutes in order to pray-read two verses. Everyone is busy in the morning; some go to work, and others go to school. Although we do not have much time, we can still set aside ten minutes to pray-read two verses. After pray-reading we will have a sufficient supply.</p>
<p>Whether or not we spend ten minutes to pray-read the Word makes a big difference in our day. Without this time our day will not be profitable. Pray-reading and calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name change our entire being. We will not lose our temper as we used to, nor will we be as anxious as before, and overcoming will become something spontaneous. Therefore, the first thing that we should do every morning is to enjoy the Lord. Then we can exercise to live in the spirit and walk according to the spirit. In this way we will experience the infilling of the Spirit spontaneously, and if necessary we will also be filled with the Spirit outwardly; that is, we will have the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. As a result, we will be able to preach the Lord Jesus with boldness. Furthermore, we will no longer speak the same old things; instead, we will be filled with wisdom and will touch people.</p>
<p>If we walk in this way the whole day, we may be tired in the evening, yet our spirit will still be strong. Although we may feel tired, we can continue because our spirit is strong. We will still want to meet either with our family or with the saints in our small group or in a larger meeting. Furthermore, we will be energized to open and function by praying and supplying others. If all the saints would supply one another in this way, everyone would be supplied. Even if only half of those in attendance function, that meeting would be brought to the third heaven.</p>
<p>Such a meeting would be unlike our past situation in which we sat deadened in a meeting. Sometimes a prayer meeting was supposed to begin at 7:30 P.M., but at 7:37 the saints were still waiting for the responsible brothers to take the lead. The responsible brothers would reluctantly call a hymn, because they did not have a definite inspiration. After singing we would pray formally for the items on the prayer list. Such meetings were destined to die because the saints were taking a dead way and had a dead living. These saints were not helped to enjoy the Lord, and they did not talk about the Lord in their daily life; thus, their meetings were not living. Only when we experience the Triune God as life and exercise to enjoy the Lord can our meetings be fresh and living.</p>
<p>The unique way to experience the Triune God as our life is to enjoy Him. We must spend time to enjoy Him. Our calling on the Lord and our enjoying Him please the Lord. Do not think that we need to do something for the Lord or offer something to Him. What we do for Him may not necessarily please Him, and what we offer to Him may not be acceptable to Him, but our enjoying the Lord pleases Him and is acceptable to Him (Psa. 116:12-13). Every mother is pleased when her children enjoy a meal that she has prepared for them. A mother&rsquo;s joy is not in receiving presents but in her children enjoying a meal that she has prepared.</p>
<p>We often make the mistake of coming to the Lord to do something for Him or to offer something to Him when we have not enjoyed Him. This is religious and does not please Him. As lovers of the Lord, we should not focus on doing things or on offering something; we should enjoy Him first. Every morning upon rising, we need to enjoy Him until our spirit is fanned into flame. As a result, we will be able to walk according to the spirit, to speak the Lord&rsquo;s words from our spirit, and to proclaim Him to people during the day. Furthermore, the Spirit will prevail in us, and we will be filled with the Spirit. Then in the evening we will be able to attend the meeting and to function in the meeting. This is the way for our meetings to be delivered from the forms of Christianity. Otherwise, regardless of how much we try to change our method, we will have a change in name only. It is not a matter of changing a method but of living Christ. We must live a life of enjoying the Triune God as our life. Then our meetings will become a fresh and rich testimony of our living as well as a declaration of our living.</p>
<p>We thank the Lord that He is the Spirit and the Word. Moreover, He has given us His name. Now we have the Spirit, the Bible, and the Lord&rsquo;s name. Our need is to spend some time to exercise our spirit and enjoy the Lord. We do not need to spend too much time. We only need to use ten minutes to contact and enjoy the Lord in the morning. It is best to also set aside a few minutes to enjoy the Lord during the day. This will affect our entire day, and it will also influence our meetings and our service. With such a living we will be equipped to practice the new way, the God-ordained way of preaching the gospel, having home meetings, and functioning in larger meetings. The practice of the new way depends on our experiencing the Triune God as our life. I hope that the saints will receive these words and exercise to be persons who enjoy God.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
