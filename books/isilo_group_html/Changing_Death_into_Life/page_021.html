<p>The Lord Jesus told the man who had been sick for thirty-eight years to rise and walk (v. 8). After this John says that the Lord Jesus will raise the dead, that those who hear His word and believe have passed out of death into life, and that the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and will live (vv. 21, 24-25, 28-29). This shows that from the Lord&rsquo;s perspective, the impotent man was a dead man; he was in death. From our perspective, he was sick. The impotent man also felt that he was sick. However, from the Lord&rsquo;s perspective, this man was not sick but dead, because being sick and weak indicate death. A person becomes sick and weak because death is in him. Death is the source of sickness and weakness, and it is the ultimate expression of sickness and weakness. Sickness and weakness come from death; they are the precursors of death, and they bring in death. Sickness and weakness are the predecessors of death. A person who becomes sick and weak is getting closer to the gates of death. When he becomes so sick and weak that he cannot breathe, he is pronounced dead. Therefore, from the Lord&rsquo;s perspective, the impotent man was not sick but dead. This man was impotent because he was dead.</p>
<p>People are dead. They do not merely have problems; they are dead. They are not only impotent but also dead, and they have problems and are impotent because they are dead. Problems, weaknesses, and the lack of strength and ability to do good are the issue of being dead. People are dead; hence, they are sick, weak, and without strength.</p>
<p>Where does death come from, and why does death exist? Death comes from sin and is the issue of sin (Rom. 5:12, 17). Death is in us because sin is in us, and we are impotent because death is in us.</p>
<p>We do not become stronger as we live longer; rather, the longer we live, the weaker and more frail we become. Young people feel that they are strong and believe that they will become stronger with time. However, in reality they will become weaker instead of stronger. Eventually, they will get old. In thirty years the young sisters will become old women. They will have wrinkles on their faces, and their hair will turn white. Their backs will be bent, and they will have lower back pain. They will walk slowly. The young people will eventually manifest these conditions. When they climb stairs, they can take two steps in one stride and ascend quickly. However, in thirty years they will take only one step in one stride, and they will almost be out of breath. The young people will gradually become weak. But this is not yet the end. Eventually they will lie on a bed and will not be able to rise. Then they will be so weak that they are short of breath. After this they will be so weak that their eyes will stop moving. What does that mean? It means that they are dead. I hope that this is clear.</p>
<p>Hence, we are not living daily but dying daily. When a child is five years old, we can pat him on the head and say, &ldquo;You are so good. Next year you will be six years old, and the following year you will be seven. In three more years you will be ten. Then you will be taller and bigger.&rdquo; People tell me that I am almost fifty-five years old and that I will soon be sixty years old. I do not like to hear this, because my age is not increasing but decreasing. For example, I initially had eighty dollars, but I spent five dollars. Eventually, I spent sixty dollars. Now I need to be careful because I have only twenty dollars left. If I continue to spend dollars, I will soon have nothing to spend. Am I saving every day or spending every day? A common Chinese proverb says that it is rare to have someone who is seventy years old. This means that to live to be seventy years old is to live a long life. To live to be eighty years old is to live an even longer life. Suppose a person will live to be eighty years old, but now he is seventy-eight years old. What will be his feeling? He has only two &ldquo;dollars&rdquo; left. In two more years, after two more birthdays, his life will be over. The more advanced in age a person is, the closer he is to death. Please do not condemn me for saying this. We should ask the older people who have lived a long life whether they are happy. We might say, &ldquo;Dear sir, you are already seventy-eight years old. You have lived a very long life.&rdquo; He will say within himself, &ldquo;I wish I were only eighteen years old. How good it would be if I could subtract sixty years. Alas! I am already seventy-eight years old. This is not a very good feeling. When I am eighty years old, the feeling will be worse!&rdquo; The longer we live, the closer we are to death. Our life is not getting longer but shorter. The shorter our life gets, the closer we are to death. Therefore, we are not living daily but dying daily.</p>
<p>Those who have contracted tuberculosis have a tuberculosis bacteria that eats away at them every day, making them weak. If these people do not get sufficient rest and also do not deal with the tuberculosis bacteria in them, they will be weak, and one day the bacteria will kill them. Suppose worms are eating a piano so much that it sounds abnormal. If we do not deal with the worms in the piano, one day there will be nothing left of the piano. Likewise, there are worms of death, bacteria of death, that eat us and cause us harm, making us sick and weak. If we fail to deal with these worms of death, one day they will eventually kill us. All of our problems and bad habits come from these worms of death. Our impotence, lack of strength, comes from the bacteria of death. If instead of killing the worms of death, we deal only with our problems and habits in order to eliminate our impotence, our problems will not be solved, and our habits will not be eliminated. Furthermore, we will not be saved from our impotence.</p>
<p>What can kill the worms of death in us? Self-cultivation, teaching, outward methods, and human effort cannot kill the worms of death. Self-cultivation, teaching, outward methods, and human efforts can change only our outward behavior and improve only our outward condition; they cannot terminate the death in us. These can be compared to beautifying a corpse in a funeral home. A corpse can be made beautiful outwardly, but death cannot be reversed so that the corpse becomes living. Likewise, self-cultivation, teaching, outward methods, and human efforts cannot remove death from within man, nor can they make man living. Only life&mdash;not self-cultivation, teaching, methods or human efforts&mdash;can remove death from man and enliven man. Hence, our need is life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Changing Death into Life &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
