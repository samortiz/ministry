   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE IDENTIFICATION WITH CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:22, 45-49; Rom 5:18-19; 6:3-11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Identification with Christ is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From our point of view, there have been many people who have lived on the earth from the ancient days until now.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even though we know that the world s current population is a few billion, we do not know how many people have died or how many people are yet to be born.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All we know is that there are a few billion people who are alive today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From God s point of view, however, there are only two men in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>ADAM AND CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the book of Romans, there are only two men in the world: Adam and Christ Rom 5:12, 15, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Adam is the first man, and Christ is not only the second man but also the last man 1 Cor 15:45, 47 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first man is Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The second man, however, is not Cain but Christ, because those who came after Adam came out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The second man is Christ, and because there is no man after Christ, He is also the last man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Adam is the first man, because there was no man before him; Christ is the second man and the last man, because there is no man after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is no one between Adam and Christ, because Adam is the first and Christ is the second.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Everyone in Adam Being a Sinner</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are only two men in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There was no man before Adam, and there is no man after Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In God s eyes every man is in Adam, comes from Adam, and belongs to Adam, which is to say that every man is identified with Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before we were saved, our name was Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whoever is not saved is in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A person should not think that he is not a sinner because he has not committed some specific sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When Adam committed sin in the garden of Eden, we were in him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Adam s sin made every man a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Chinese people arrived in China by passing through the Pamir Mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although we may not have personally passed through the Pamirs, we passed through the Pamirs when our ancestors passed through the Pamirs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Likewise, when Adam sinned, we also sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Consequently, all who are from Adam have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we all are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everyone in Christ Being Saved</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In God s eyes every man who has believed into Christ is saved because a saved person enters into Christ and is identified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although the Bible speaks of Noah and his family passing safely through the flood Gen 8:13-19; 1 Pet 3:20 , strictly speaking, it was the ark that passed through the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Noah s family passed through the flood only because they were in the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, eight people did not pass through the flood, but rather one ark with eight people passed through the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In God s eyes there was only the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God saw the ark passing through the flood; He did not see eight people passing through the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When God looks at a saved person, He sees only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God does not see Mr. Chang or Mr. Lee; He sees only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everyone who is saved is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Apart from Christ, God does not see any other person; He sees only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One day the Word, who was with God and who was God, became flesh; that is, God put on humanity, and His name was Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Jesus was God, yet He put on the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the Lord Jesus responded to Philip s request to see the Father, saying, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>John 14:9 , He was speaking of both His divine nature and His human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When He went to the cross, He put His human nature on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When He died on the cross, He died as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, the veil of the temple was split in two from top to bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The veil being split signifies the Lord being split, Matt 27:51; Heb 10:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The cherubim embroidered on the veil were also split.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The veil signifies Christ, and the cherubim embroidered on it signify the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The splitting of the veil signifies that all creatures died with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Jews think that the death of Jesus was just the death of a rebel, but a saved person knows that Jesus died to bear his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Those who have a further understanding of salvation know that Jesus also bore all of the old creation in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His death, however, was not an end, because He resurrected after three days to become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, whenever anyone calls on His name today, the Holy Spirit enters into him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, Christ and man are identified.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Before His ascension, Jesus was Emmanuel Matt 1:23 , meaning God with us ; after His resurrection, He is with us even more.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now He lives in us until the consummation of the age 28:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Everyone who is saved has Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once we were in Adam, but now we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once we were in a kingdom of darkness, but now we are in another kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There are only two kingdoms in the universe: the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today we have been transferred from the kingdom of Satan into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once we were only in Adam, but through the second birth, that is, regeneration, we have entered into Christ and are now in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, even though we are in Christ, we still bear Adam s resemblance.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Nevertheless, God sees only the ark, not us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we see ourselves, we see the old creation, but when God sees us, He sees only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>IDENTIFICATION WITH CHRIST BEING</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>THE WAY TO SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Noah s family passed through the flood because they were joined to the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Redemption is based on union.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must be joined to Christ in order to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In order to be joined to Christ we must be delivered from Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>From Adam we have inherited sin and death, which must be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, a person must be freed from the sin in Adam in order to be joined to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>BEING IDENTIFIED WITH CHRIST AND</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>LIVING IN THE LAW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>For those who are in Adam, sinning is easy and natural.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Sinning is as easy and natural as breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Those who are not saved do not need to prepare to sin or even make an effort to sin, because sinning is easy and natural.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Although it is easy to sin in Adam, it is impossible not to sin in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>No matter how much force and effort we exert, we will sin because the law of sin and of death is a part of Adam Rom 7:23; 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There is also a law in Christ, and in this law of the Spirit of life, we have been freed in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death v. 2 . This is because the death of Christ, which dealt with sin, and the resurrection of Christ, which dealt with death, have been given to us through our identification with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is natural for a person in Adam to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is also natural for a person in Christ to be freed from sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is also natural for a Christian to obey God s will in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Whenever we behold Christ, we are freed from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Whenever we behold Christ, we become holy.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It is natural for us to obey God s will and to practice the goodness of God in the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is to be identified with Christ; this also is the way of a Christian.</S>
