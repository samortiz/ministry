   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You have to make them realize that you mean what you say.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many times you give a proper order, but you forget about it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You should not tell your children that it is all right if they do not carry out your order this time, just as long as they do it the next time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you excuse them, you are not doing them a favor.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You should show your children that once you say something, they must carry it out whether or not you remember it.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Show them from their youth that words are hallowed, whether they are a promise or an order.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, if you tell your child to sweep his room every morning, you must first consider whether or not it is within his ability to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If he does not do it today, you must make sure that he does it the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If he does not do it the next day, you must make sure that he does it the third day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You must uphold your order this year, and you must uphold it next year.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You have to show your children that your words are not uttered lightly and that once they are uttered, they have to be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If they find that your words do not count, your words will become ineffective.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, every word out of your mouth must be practical and principled.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Correcting Exaggerated Words</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Your words must be accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes you see only two cows but you say that there are three, or you see five birds but say that there are eight.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You must correct yourself immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In speaking to your children, you must learn to always correct yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You should learn to say, What I just said was not that accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are two cows, not three.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You must show them that words should be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everything that happens in the family should be for the building up of Christian character.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You must sanctify your words.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When you say something wrong, you must make a point to admit your mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this manner you will train your children to sanctify their words.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many parents say five when they mean three or three when they mean two.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They speak loosely and do not set up good patterns at home.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As a result, their children never realize that words are sacred.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All these problems occur because there is a lack of discipline from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should experience the Lord s discipline and lead our children to the Lord s discipline.</S>
