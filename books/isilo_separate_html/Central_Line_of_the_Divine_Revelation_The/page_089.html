By Sowing unto the Spirit<br>with the Desire and Aim of the Spirit in View,<br>to Accomplish What the Spirit Desires</H2><P>Another way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is by sowing unto the Spirit with the desire and aim of the Spirit in view, to accomplish what the Spirit desires (Gal. 6:7, 8b). Our human living is a sowing. Whatever we do, we are sowing seeds, and whatever we sow, we will reap. If we sow something high and good, we will reap the same, and if we sow something mean and low, we can expect to reap the same thing. Everything that we do in our daily life is a sowing. We should not think that the way we comb our hair is a small matter. Even this is a sowing. After a certain period of time, we will reap what we have sown. Galatians 6:8 says, "For he who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life." We must endeavor to sow properly. If we sow according to the Spirit, we will reap according to the Spirit.</P><P>Our sowing unto the Spirit is with the desire and aim of the Spirit in view. Our desire and aim are not ours but the Spirit's. Christ lives in us, but our sowing may be according to our own desire. We may comb our hair in a certain way because of our own desire. However, when we comb our hair, we must have the desire and aim of the Spirit in view. Our desire and aim should be that the style of our hair would express the Lord whom we love, who is the Spirit within us, that people could even see Christ in our hair style. In our sowing we must have the desire and aim of the Spirit in view, to accomplish the aim of the Spirit. Whatever we have, wear, or do should correspond with the Spirit's purpose, desire, and intention. What we will reap depends on what we sow.</P><P>To sow to the Spirit in this way is to receive, experience, and enjoy the Spirit as the all-embracing blessing of the gospel. If we live a life without the Spirit and sow according to the flesh, we cannot expect to enjoy Christ as the all-embracing blessing. Several years ago the major denominations in America came together to consider a joint work to evangelize the world. Their conclusion was that they could not do this because of the shortage of persons. There are many millions of Christians in America today, but how many of them are living Christ? How many are living Christ in the way that they comb their hair or purchase shoes? This is not a small matter. Our purchasing of a necktie is a sowing. The reaping will come when we stand before people with our tie to preach the gospel. If the tie is too worldly, our preaching will be empty. If we are not dressed according to the Spirit, people will not have the heart to listen to our message. To sow to the Spirit is to live Christ, and this is to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. By Boasting in the Cross of Christ<br>and Living a New Creation</H2><P>The way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ as the Spirit is also by boasting in the cross of Christ and living a new creation, which is neither religion nor nonreligion (Gal. 6:14-15). The cross of Christ is our boast. We boast in the fact that everything has been terminated on the cross. The love of cars, the love of a big house, and the love of stylish fashions have all been terminated. Everything has been "crossed out." This is our boast. Now we are living a new creation. Since we boast in the cross, we cannot live in the old creation; we must live in the new creation. Everything must be new because we are a new creation in Christ. This is the way to enjoy Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. By the Grace of Our Lord Jesus Christ<br>with Our Spirit</H2><P>The consummate way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ as the Spirit is by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ with our spirit. The book of Galatians concludes with 6:18: "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen." The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ being with our Spirit is the way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_088.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_090.html">Next</a> </body></html>
