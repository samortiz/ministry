   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In her work of spreading the Lord's recovery, she was assigned a young sister apprentice to help me in starting the Lord's testimony in Tientsin.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As a senior of ten years in the work, she sustained me in whatever needs I had in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Both the church in Tientsin and the church in Peiping were greatly and continually benefited by her presence.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Peace Wang and I, along with others, traveled through northwest China and ministered in many places.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In our trips she always strongly supported me, and those with her always received her help and care.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the turmoil caused by the opposition of Mrs. Nee's aunt to her niece's marriage, Peace Wang was the only one who remained in Shanghai facing the difficult situation through the whole period of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>During those days she helped me care for the church there during Watchman's absence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Later, in the turmoil stirred up among the brothers and sisters in Shanghai in 1942, when Watchman was forced to discontinue his ministry, Peace Wang had a clear vision of the real situation from the Lord and stood firmly for the Lord's gift to His church, Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By then she was really a wall against the tide, withstanding all the misunderstanding and attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Her standing laid the foundation for the later recovery of Watchman's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After the church in Shanghai closed in 1942, she remained in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This was done with the express purpose and expectation that both the church in Shanghai and Brother Nee's ministry would be restored.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>She was the unique seed for this two-fold purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, after the war, in 1946 the Lord used her with the help of Brother Yu Cheng-hwa to reopen the doors of the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was she in the summer of that year who earnestly invited me in writing to visit the restored church there.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During my visit the church was greatly healed, and I was very much confirmed and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After the restoration of the church in Shanghai, she strongly exercised her spiritual function in taking care of the young believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A number of young saints were raised up and edified through her function and under her care.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All of this was a great step in bringing Watchman back to his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through her earnest invitation, I was burdened at the end of 1946 to stay in Shanghai and work together with her for the rebuilding of the church and for the restoration of Watchman's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She was an indescribable help to me in the ministry, so much so that a revival was brought in in 1947 and 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That was a further step in bringing Watchman Nee back to his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, he resumed his ministry in Shanghai through that revival.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From 1942 to 1948 she played a crucial role under the Lord's leading and anointing to maintain the lifeline of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After he resumed his ministry, Watchman's first burden was to carry out his training on Kuling Mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In his second training there, in 1949, Peace Wang was of great assistance to him in caring for the sisters and young trainees.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After the revival reached Hong Kong in 1950, she came from Shanghai with rich blessing to visit the church there and the churches in Amoy and Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Following this trip she returned to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was her last trip in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am deeply indebted to her for my salvation, growth in life, and ministry in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Next to Watchman Nee, she did the most to perfect me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many among us remember her in the same way with heartfelt gratitude.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She was a tremendous asset in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Having Finished the Course</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sister Peace Wang was also imprisoned in 1956 and remained in prison until she went to be with the Lord whom she loved at the age of about seventy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Truly she finished her course in the race.</S>
