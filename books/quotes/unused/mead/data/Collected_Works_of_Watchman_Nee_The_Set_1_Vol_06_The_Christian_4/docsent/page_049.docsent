   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Perhaps when you read up to this point, you will think like many other believers, "Would it not be too proud of me to say that I am already saved?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I am not better in any way in my conduct than others.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How can I say this?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Dear readers, for us to know that we are saved is not to be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The words "to be saved" are in the passive voice; they show that we are being acted upon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is there for us to be proud of?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To say that we do not need to be saved or that we have no need of salvation is indeed proud; it is indeed to consider ourselves better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But to say that we are saved indicates that we were sinners and were to perish, but that we are now saved by Him through trusting in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This shows how deep the Lord's grace is to us and how great is the saving work of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It shows how great the Lord's power is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not an exaltation of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we know that we have received grace and are saved, of course, we will all the more praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To sing of the Lord Jesus in our songs all the time is an exaltation of the Lord; it is not a self-boasting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more we see the depth of our sins and the immensity of the Lord's forgiveness, the more we will love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should say as Paul said: "By the grace of God I am what I am" 1 Cor 15:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God says that we have eternal life already that we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, for me to say that I am saved is not boasting; it is to believe and to acknowledge that God is right.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is pleased when we believe in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must believe in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is true that our works are no better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But we are not saved because of our good works.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus did not come to save the righteous but the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost" Luke 19:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners" 1 Tim 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul said that he was the foremost of all sinners, but that he had obtained mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If it is up to us, we will not be able to say that we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even the world cannot find one who can say that he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If salvation is due to our merits and excellence, there will be no possibility for us to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who trust in their works are shaky all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sometimes their conduct is better, and they will hope that they can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes their conduct is not as good, and they think that they will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These ones have never fully trusted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Dear readers, we are not saved because of our good works.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are saved because Christ has saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How great is His grace!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many say: "I know that if one trusts in the accomplishment of the Lord Jesus on the cross, he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But I do not feel anything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Am I saved just like this?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brothers!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Bible does not say: "I give these happy feelings to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe in the name of the Son of God."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the Bible were written in this way, one would not be saved if he did not feel anything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the Bible says, "I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life" 1 John 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"These things."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What are these things?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They are the words of the Bible, the Word of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We know that we have eternal life and are saved, not by the way we feel, but by what the Word of God says.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Bible says that we who have believed in the Lord are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are, therefore, saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When God says that we are saved, surely we are saved, whether we feel that we are saved or not.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have believed in the Lord Jesus and have been washed of our sins by His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, we are saved because God's Word says so.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For example, a poor man may be very poor and cannot make ends meet; he may be living in extreme sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He decides to write a letter to one of his friends, who is quite well off, to ask for help.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After a few days, he does not receive any reply.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He may think that his friend despises him and is not willing to help him, and his heart is in distress.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The more he thinks about it, the more it seems unlikely that his friend will help him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He decides then to tell this matter to his neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some say that a friend should always help one in financial difficulties and has no reason to refuse to help.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Others say that this may not necessarily be true because it is a compassionless age.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the man hears the hopeful words, he rejoices, and when he hears the discouraging words, he is in distress.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The next day his friend sends someone to give him a reply.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When he opens the letter, his heart jumps within him; he does not know if a promise is within.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After he opens the letter, he shouts to his family, "The matter is now settled.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He has written a letter to me saying that, from now on, he will take up all my expenses.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All right.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The matter is decided.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I do not care if others think that it is hopeful or hopeless any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He has said himself that he will bear all the responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I can live now in peace."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Are not many believers like this poor man?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What a pity that many children of God listen to others' talk and to their own feeling; they are drifting back and forth.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The poor man was assured once he had a word from his friend.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The children of God are likewise assured when they have the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God says that if we believe in Jesus Christ, we shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He has said it Himself, and everything is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What more is there to worry about?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What are our feelings worth?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What are man's ideas worth?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If God says that we are saved, it is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>His Word is the final verdict.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Since God has graciously declared His faithfulness, we should accept His Word without doubt.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Some may say, "What was said may be true.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But I am afraid that my faith is not perfect, and therefore, I cannot be saved."</S>
