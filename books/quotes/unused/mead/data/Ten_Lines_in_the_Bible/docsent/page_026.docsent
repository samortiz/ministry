   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>EGYPT S USURPATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Regrettably, before long the descendants of Abraham went down to Egypt due to the need for food.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They were lost after going down to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The children of God should have submitted themselves to God s authority, but instead they submitted themselves to Pharaoh s authority to be under his rule.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As a result, God lost the means by which He could reign on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God no longer had an outlet on the earth that was linked to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>X. THE FORMATION OF THE NATION OF ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the children of Israel were usurped by Egypt, they fell away completely from God s authority to Pharaoh s authority, being no longer under the rule of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At this point, God sent Moses to deliver them with great power.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They kept the Passover, came out of Egypt, and crossed the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through the blood of the lamb, God delivered them out of Egypt with a mighty hand and led them to the foot of Mount Sinai Exo 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the children of Israel were delivered by God and led to the foot of Mount Sinai, God wanted them to become a kingdom of priests, who, on the one hand, would allow God to have authority among them, and on the other hand, would be a people serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When their condition was normal, God exercised His authority through the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, after entering into Canaan, they followed the customs of the Gentiles and wanted to have a man as their king 1 Sam 8:4-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Initially, God found Saul and appointed him to be the king, but Saul reigned according to man s will, not according to God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Later God found David, a man according to His heart 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The nation of Israel was formed, God s authority was exercised among them, and God s glory was expressed among them as well.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At this point, the nation of Israel reached its golden age.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It became the sphere of God s reign, and through it God was able to express His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>XI.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE DEFEAT OF THE NATION OF ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The good times did not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Within a short period of time the nation of Israel was defeated and became desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The people lost their nation and were conquered by Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Babel again captured the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Babel was the place of man s collective rebellion; it was also the place out of which Abraham had been called by God and set apart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Babel again captured Abraham s descendants, bringing them back to the place from where they had come, so that those who had served God would serve the devil in the temple of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even the vessels in the holy temple were carried away with them and placed in the temple of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the books written during this captivity, God is called the God of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God did not have an outlet of heaven on the earth; He lost the means by which He could reign on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, God withdrew back to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>XII.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE RESTORATION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Seventy years after the captivity of God s people, men such as Ezra and Nehemiah were raised up; they returned from the land of captivity to recover God s temple and His city, and once more the nation of Israel allowed God s authority to be exercised on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the nation of Israel was defeated, the priests were defeated first, and then the kings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The order was the same in the recovery; first the temple was recovered through Ezra the priest, and then the city was recovered through Nehemiah, a royal descendant.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The recovery of the temple was the recovery of the testimony and fellowship; the recovery of the city was the recovery of the authority and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At this point, God s reign was recovered, and the people of Israel were restored once more.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>XIII.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE DEFEAT AFTER THE RESTORATION</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, shortly after the restoration, the nation of Israel was defeated again.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can see the condition after their defeat in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the Lord Jesus came to the earth, demons were everywhere among the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Israelites would not allow God to reign among them; instead, the devil was reigning in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At that time, the kingdom of the devil was among them, not the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>XIV.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE COMING OF THE LORD JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At this point, the Lord Jesus came to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the Lord came out to preach, the first sentence He spoke was, The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near Matt 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From this we can see that the Lord s coming was to bring the kingdom of the heavens to the earth and to exercise God s authority among men.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Moreover, the Lord told Nicodemus that he must be born anew in order to participate in this kingdom John 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord also plainly said that the casting out of demons was for the kingdom of God to come to the earth Matt 12:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The word of the Lord Jesus in Luke 17:21 also shows us that His presence in the midst of the children of Israel was the presence of the kingdom of God in their midst, because it was God s authority coming to them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>During the three and a half years when the Lord was among the children of Israel, He was the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although the Lord displayed much power among them, the Israelites still rejected Him; therefore, in Matthew 21:43 the Lord said, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation producing its fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This nation is the church.</S>
