   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TWO SPIRITS IN EPHESIANS 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father" Eph 2:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even this short verse has the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Through Him" means through the Son; but until we add "in one Spirit," our access is somewhat theoretical.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we are in the Spirit, we are in the presence of the Father to enjoy all the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verses 21 and 22 go on to tell us that in Christ "all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, in Whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How big is our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It must be big enough to contain God's habitation!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we build a meeting hall, we need to have a good-sized lot.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The lot where God's habitation is, our spirit, is universally spacious.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All of us together are one lot, for God has only one habitation; we are not separate small lots.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE TWO SPIRITS IN EPHESIANS 3</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The mystery "has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit" 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The revelation came to them not in their mentality but in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul prays that the Father "would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man" 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we listen to a message, it has the effect of strengthening our whole being into the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The inner man is the regenerated spirit, where the Spirit of God dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During the day we may find it easy to gossip or feel discouraged, but after a meeting we have no use for gossip and the discouragement is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is because our being has been brought into the inner man, where the good land, with the riches of Christ, is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The result of our being thus strengthened is that Christ makes His home in our hearts through faith 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the Spirit works and our spirit, the inner man, responds, Christ settles down in our heart, becoming our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By enjoying this settled Christ as the riches of the good land, we are "filled unto all the fullness of God" 3:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE TWO SPIRITS IN EPHESIANS 4</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ephesians 4 also refers to both the Holy Spirit and the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verse 4, where it says, "One Body and one Spirit," the reference is to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One Body implies one habitation; one Spirit means the one Spirit in all our spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 23, "And are renewed in the spirit of your mind," indicates that our mind is now occupied and saturated by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The nations walk "in the vanity of their mind" v. 17 , preoccupied with worldly entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our mind, in contrast, is being renewed from the old creation to the new, so that our mind is a mind of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Ephesians 4:30 we are exhorted not to "grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in Whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This sealing Spirit, who is the good land to you, will not leave you, but do not grieve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE FILLED SPIRIT IN EPHESIANS 5</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled in spirit" Eph 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be drunk is to have our body filled with wine.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather than this, we are to have our spirit filled with God, with the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our spirit must be filled!</S>
