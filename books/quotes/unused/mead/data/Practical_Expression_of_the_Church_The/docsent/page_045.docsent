   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GROUND FOR THE GIFT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We all need to be defeated, captured and gained by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we have been captured by Christ, He has the ground to give us the gifts; but if we still have not surrendered to Him to be captured by Him, He has no ground to give us the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must be willing to surrender and be captured by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must be the first foe in His train of defeated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then He will have the ground to give us the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The gift is the basis for the function.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The function comes out of the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ephesians 4:11 says, "And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Perhaps the Lord's intention is to establish you as a teacher in the church, but to this very day He cannot do it because you will not give Him the position.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You still are not captured by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You still are not subdued by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You still have not surrendered to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Though He intends to establish you as a teacher in the church, you will not give Him the ground to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When you are willing to be subdued and captured by Him, you will give Him the ground to give you the gift and establish you as a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>GROW IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For the gift we need the grace, and the grace is given according to the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With the gift is the capacity to receive the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The grace is the life; so to have the capacity as a teacher, we need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our two eyes and our two arms are gifts to our body, but the capacity of the eyes to receive blood is much smaller than that of the arms.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that blood is given according to the capacity of the members.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the meaning of Ephesians 4:7, "But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The grace is given according to the measure of the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you are a bigger gift, you have a larger capacity to receive the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you are a smaller gift, you have a smaller capacity to receive the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And the grace is the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A boy has two eyes, but he needs to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To grow means to take in more blood.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then his two eyes will be full of life supply and full of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is this growth in life that will afford the function to his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First, we must be captured by Christ; then the gift will be given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we need to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more we grow in life, the more we will receive the life supply and the more this life supply will afford us the function.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose a brother has been captured by Christ and has given Christ the authority to establish him as a teacher; but after this he does not grow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then he is a teacher who cannot function so well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is just the same as the boy's eyes: his eyes will not function so well if he is short of the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here a brother has been established by the Head, but he cannot function adequately because he is short of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But suppose this brother, by holding the reality, begins to grow into the Head in all things Eph 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then he will not only be a teacher, but a teacher full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And this rich, abundant life will afford him a rich function.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>EVERY MEMBER, A GIFT TO THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we refer Ephesians 4 to Psalm 68, we see that there was a battle fought by Christ in the universe, and Christ has defeated all His enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He led all the defeated foes in His victory train while He was ascending to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, He has gained the ground to fill all things in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ has gained the ground in the universe, but has He gained the ground in you?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You must be captured by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You must be defeated and fully taken over by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then He will have the ground in you to make you a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The gift in Ephesians 4 differs from the gift in Romans 12.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Romans 12 the gift is the ability, but in Ephesians 4 the gift is the person as a member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All the members are gifts to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>My little finger is a real gift to my body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Without it, I am short of something.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Without my two eyes, I lack the ability to see.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The two eyes are gifts to my body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord has given my body two eyes that I may see, and He has given two legs that I may stand.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In like manner, all the members of the Body of Christ, the church, are gifts to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every member is a gift, but this gift must be established by the Head by being captured by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord's intention is to give you as a gift to the Body, but if you would not be captured by Him, He can never establish you as a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Not until you are willing to be captured by Him will He have the ground and standing to make you such a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is a real shortage in the elders of nearly every local church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There are not many efficient elders.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is because so many dear brothers would not be captured by the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They may pay the price to give up the denominations and come back to Jerusalem to take the ground of unity in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But when they come to this point, they must be captured by the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They must be absolutely defeated and taken over by the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But so many are not willing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They say, "Lord, wait a little while; I am not ready yet."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They may not say this outwardly, but this is their feeling within.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We may pay the price to take the way of the church life, but when we come to the matter of being subdued by the Lord, a real quarrel exists between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the reason so many dear ones are not able to function in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You may say that a certain brother is a good brother.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Yes, he is a good brother.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You may say that he loves the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Yes, to a certain extent he loves the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But why is he not able to function?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is simply because the Lord has not yet gained the victory in him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He must give the ground to the Lord, and then he must grow.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is only by being captured by the Lord that the Lord will establish this brother as an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then by the growth in life, the function of an elder will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The living function will be manifested because he has been captured by the Head and is growing in Him.</S>
