   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HUSBANDMAN AND THE VINE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I believe you are persuaded that John is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This book is on the profound economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is expressed in these simple words: I am the vine, and My Father is the husbandman.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the universe God is a husbandman, a farmer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Farming is God's economy!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Just as the farmer's economy is farming, growing things, so is God's.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What does God grow?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He grows a vine tree, a vine with many branches.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ is this vine; Christ is God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A vine differs from a tree in that it has virtually no trunk.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you cut off the branches of a vine, there is practically nothing left, only the root.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ said, "I am the vine; you are the branches."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This vine, including the branches, is God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that His economy includes us, for we are the branches of this vine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE BRANCHES OF THE VINE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How could we be branches of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a farmer grows wheat, wheat is his economy, but wheat is not the farmer himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But this vine which is Christ is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God as a farmer grows Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By cultivating and developing this vine, God develops Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How does He do this?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is by the branching out of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The branches are just the spreading of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whatever is in the vine is in the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By your natural life, by yourself, are you a branch of the vine?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By your fallen nature you are not only a branch of Adam, but even a branch of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Just as a branch is the branching out of a tree, so when we were born we were just the branching out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As branches of Adam, we were also branches of Satan; this is what all the people on earth are today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The wonderful thing is that the moment we believe in the Lord Jesus, He branches out into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This branching out makes us branches, branches of this wonderful Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not look at yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This morning you may have lost your temper, and even now you may feel like a branch of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more you look at yourself, the more you will be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Look at the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"I am the vine, and you are the branches."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You just say, "Hallelujah, Lord, You are the vine and I am a branch.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Bible says so."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be a branch in the vine means that Christ has become your life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Life is not liberation; it is a Person, a living Person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As branches we are those filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do not say you do not feel that you are filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the Lord says, "I am the vine; you are the branches," you have to say a strong amen.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Just keep saying, "Hallelujah, I am a branch!"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You will be filled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>DISTRACTED FROM CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God wants you to be filled with Christ, to have Christ as your life and as your person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is not interested in religion, nor in any work or service you would like to do for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He wants you to live Christ day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we do not have such a daily life, when we meet together it will be just for a theatrical performance.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we shout to release our spirit, we shall be actors in a theater.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is not what the Lord wants.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you take Christ as your life, you will not say even a word without the assurance that you are speaking with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The whole of Christianity is off.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even the saints in the Lord's recovery today are somewhat off, distracted, from the center lane of life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we are concerned about how to meet in a quiet way or a loud way, with or without guitars this is a sign that we are off.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible has nothing to say about how to meet or what kind of instrument to use for our music.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Shouting or silence, guitars or no guitars, mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But to meet with Christ and in Christ means everything.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do not push the saints to release their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What kind of spirit are they releasing?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Perhaps it is a spirit full of self or of the natural life.</S>
