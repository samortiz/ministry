   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN ENJOYING GOD AS FOOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY READING THE WORD Scripture Reading: John 6:27-36, 41-43, 47-58, 60-61, 63, 66-68; 12:50; Matt 4:4; Jer 15:16; 2 Tim 3:16 READING THE WORD BEING ONE WAY TO ENJOY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have considered how to enjoy God through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter we will consider how to enjoy God through reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those who enjoy God know that God is Spirit and that we contact Him with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are, however, two ways or means for us to contact Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first is prayer, and the second is reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A person who absorbs and enjoys God prays and reads the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A believer who does not pray or read the Word has stopped enjoying God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order for us to absorb God, eat and drink Him, and enjoy Him continually, we need to pray and read the Word every day.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Both praying and reading the Word are necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We cannot have one without the other.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Concerning breathing in God through prayer, we have pointed out that God dwells in our spirit through His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, prayer is to turn to our spirit to breathe out, item by item, the things within us and to breathe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With the breathing out, there must be the breathing in. In this way we breathe in God Himself as well as everything related to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such breathing out of ourselves and breathing in of God are genuine prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Genuine prayer does not depend on how many things we bring before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It depends on breathing out what is within us and breathing in what is within God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Breathing out and breathing in deliver us from everything related to us and fill us with everything related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Breathing in God, who is Spirit, through prayer affords us the most excellent way to enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Prayer, however, is not the only way that God has ordained for us to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He has also ordained reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God created everything in this universe in pairs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order for the human race to propagate, there is the need of both male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Neither male nor female alone is adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Transmission of electric waves requires both an antenna and a ground wire; either one alone is insufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the universe there are two sides to everything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A man with only one leg can only jump and hop; he cannot walk.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is unpleasant and also awkward.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everything has a top and a bottom, an inside and an outside, a front and a back, a positive and a negative.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Similarly, enjoying God has two tracks, not one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On one track our eyes are closed, but on the other track our eyes are open.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One track does not require our thoughts, but the other requires our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One track begins in our spirit and is unrelated to physical things, but the other track begins with black and white letters and ends in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to enjoy God, we need these two parallel tracks.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we walk, we need both left and right legs.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Similarly, when we absorb God, we need to close our eyes to pray and to open our eyes to read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everyone who properly breathes in God prays and reads, and reads and prays.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we want to enjoy God, we must learn to use both feet.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must learn to take both tracks.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must learn to pray, and we must learn to read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>OUR PERSON DETERMINING THE WAY WE READ</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If prayer is our spiritual breathing, what is reading the word?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a big subject.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Different people receive different things when they read the same Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every Bible is composed of sixty-six books, beginning with creation in Genesis and ending with an admonition that no one should add or delete from God s Word in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Bible we have in our hands is the same, but it seems as if we read different Bibles because we receive different things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You may receive one thing, and I may receive another.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We receive different things from the same Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A brother with a deep knowledge of God and the Scriptures once said that the kind of person we are determines the kind of Bible we have.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is absolutely true.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A young person once asked, Why do you say that we should not lie?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the book of Joshua God blessed Rahab the prostitute who lied.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>She hid the spies sent from Joshua, lied, and received a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I could not answer him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>An older brother who longed for his children and grandchildren to treat him well said, The Bible is wonderful in its expounding of filial piety.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He admitted that he joined Christianity because the Christian Bible provides the clearest teaching on filial piety.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He even asked me to come to his home once a week to teach his descendants the teachings of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When I asked what should be the topic of the meetings, he responded, What else is there to speak about in the Bible except filial piety?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In his understanding, the Bible was a book on filial piety.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A sister once came to me and said that she had found an important point in the Bible: husbands should love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then she asked me to visit her husband since he needed this teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To an old man with many children and grandchildren, the Bible is a book on filial piety, but to a wife with a cold husband, the Bible is a book on husbands loving their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I am not joking.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Perhaps after the sister comes, the next day her husband may come and say, I fully agree with Christianity, because its Bible teaches wives to be submissive to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is a very good teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In order to have a good family, a person must accept the Christian Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I hope some sisters can come to my home and teach my wife the most important subject in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is higher than the Chinese teaching on wives nagging their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Bible says that a wife must submit to her husband, just as the church submits to Christ and as Sarah submitted to Abraham, calling him lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>No other book speaks of submission as well as the Bible does.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A thoughtful scientist once said, When I was young, I despised the Bible, considering it to be a book of fairy tales with no scientific basis.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But now I can see that the Bible contains the highest science.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>His word puzzled me since I am not aware of the science he was referring to.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When I asked him if he was referring to John 3:16 or to 1 Timothy 1:15, he did not even know where these verses were.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In his eyes the Bible was a book of science.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>A lawyer once said to me, When I was young, I was a student of law, and I opposed Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I despised the Bible, thinking that it was a simple book.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But after so many years, I regret not having studied the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Had I read the Bible fifteen years ago, my strength of argument as a lawyer would be much better today.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I have studied many books on law, but no book surpasses the book of Romans in its arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This book shows Paul not only as a man of eloquence but also of argument.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>His arguments subdue and silence men.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However, he did not even know the topic of Paul s arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Another man who studied literature said, I have read many famous writings, but nothing matches the Bible in its form, structure, and literary style.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Bible contains prose, poems, historical stories, and many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is like an encyclopedia.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>However, he did not know the content of the prose, poems, stories, and histories.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This point should now be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The same Bible can be a different book in the hands of different people.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>To a certain kind of person the Bible is a certain kind of book.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Those who are full of hatred find hatred in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Those who are full of love find love in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Those who lie find lies in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Those who are honest find honesty in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The kind of person one is determines the kind of Bible he reads.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>What kind of Bible do we wish to have in our hands?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Do we want a book on literature, science, arguments, filial piety, love for husbands, submission for wives, honesty, or lies?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The kind of Bible we have depends on the kind of person we are.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Different kinds of people have different kinds of Bibles.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>No one can change this principle.</S>
