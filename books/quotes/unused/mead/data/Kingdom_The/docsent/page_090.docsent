   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Ephesians also mentions the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 5:5 speaks of an inheritance in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although Ephesians is a book on the church, it also refers to the kingdom, because the proper church life is the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do not follow the traditional teaching which says that the church is the church and the kingdom is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must not separate the church from the kingdom; they are two aspects of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The genuine church life is the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we are sealed with the Holy Spirit, filled with the Holy Spirit, and possessed by the Lord as the all-inclusive Spirit, then we are participating in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may put Ephesians 5:18b and 3:19b together: "Be filled in spirit..that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means to be saturated thoroughly and fully with all the riches of God's element.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to pay the price for the Lord's transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that we must give up what we hold on to.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whatever you hold on to, that is the price you must pay.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some brothers hold on to their long hair.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The problem is not the long hair itself: the problem is their holding on to long hair.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is the holding on to certain things which hinders our transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whatever you hold on to is the price you must pay.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You are holding on but you must take your hands off.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You should not hold on to anything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is what it means to pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we will pay the price, the Lord can spread within us, and we can be matured.</S>
