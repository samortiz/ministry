[1]  WITHSTANDING THE DEVIL Scripture Reading: James 4:7; 1 Pet 5:8-9; 2 Cor 2:11
[2]  Second Corinthians 10:4-5 says, "For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but powerful before God for the overthrowing of strongholds, as we overthrow reasonings and every high thing rising up against the knowledge of God, and take captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ."
[3]  God has given us our mind; it is ours, not Satan's. We are the only ones who have the right to use our mind; Satan has no authority over our mind.
[4]  The Bible shows us clearly that many physical diseases are the result of Satan's attack.
[5]  The fever of Peter's mother-in-law was an attack from Satan, and the Lord Jesus rebuked the fever Luke 4:39 .
[6]  But the Lord Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, saying, "Dumb and deaf spirit, I order you, come out of him and enter into him no more" v. 25 . The dumbness and deafness of the child were outward symptoms of his demon possession; they were not ordinary illnesses.
[7]  Revelation 12:10 says, "The accuser of our brothers...who accuses them before our God day and night."
[8]  Revelation 12:11 says, "And they the brothers overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death."
[9]  On the one hand, when we sin before the Lord, we must confess our sins.
[10]  No matter what Satan is doing, even if he is putting us to death, our attitude should be such that we still trust in the blood of the Lamb and still declare His victory.
[11]  We must be sure that they have enough strength before the Lord to go on before we give them stronger advice or urge them to move ahead.
[12]  Second, where there is the clear work of the Holy Spirit, we should raise the standard a little, for with the clear operation of the Spirit of the Lord and the spirit of revival, the Lord's word has the ability to uplift the capacity of a person.
[13]  If we raise the standard very high when the Spirit of the Lord has not done anything, we are not helping these accused ones to go on; rather, we are giving Satan opportunities to accuse them even more.
[14]  But if you do not have the assurance within and you do not have the power to uplift him, your exposure of his failures will only quench his prayers, his reading of the Bible, and his meeting life.
[15]  An even clearer example can be seen in Matthew 8, when the Lord Jesus ordered the disciples to depart to the other side of the sea.
[16]  In conclusion, Satan not only attacks our body, our conscience, and our mind, but also attacks us through our environment.
[17]  We cannot withstand the devil if we do not submit to God.
[18]  Our conscience will condemn us if we withstand the devil without submitting to God.
[19]  We should also believe that in manifesting Himself on the earth, the Lord not only destroyed the works of the devil, but also gave authority to His disciples to cast out demons in His name.
[20]  Second, we must believe that through death the Lord Jesus has destroyed him who has the might of death, the devil Heb 2:14 .
[21]  The Lord's death pronounces the greatest defeat for the devil because the Lord's death is not only a punishment but also a way of salvation.
[22]  Colossians 2:12 says, "Buried together with Him in baptism, in which also you were raised together with Him through the faith of the operation of God, who raised Him from the dead."
[23]  Verse 13 tells us how we died and resurrected; verse 14 tells us what the Lord did at the time of His death; and verse 15 says that the Lord Jesus stripped off the rulers and the authorities and "made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it."
[24]  Little did they realize that the Lord Jesus would go into death, come out of death, and overcome the authority of death!
[25]  Fourth, we must believe that the ascension of the Lord has put Him far above the power of Satan.
[26]  Ephesians 1:20-22 says, "Raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all...not only in this age but also in that which is to come; and He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church."
[27]  This means that the Lord Jesus is already seated in the heavenlies and is far above all the power of Satan.
[28]  May we have faith toward the four things the Lord has accomplished for us, and may we exercise strong faith to withstand Satan and reject his work upon us.
