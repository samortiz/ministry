   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Honoring Christ as the Unique Head</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in Our Daily Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A young brother who has been saved only a short time may approach some older brothers with a spiritual question he has been unable to resolve on his own.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He may want to know whether or not he should go swimming at the beach, participate in sports, go to movies, or drink beer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the older brothers have learned the lesson to honor the headship of Christ, when a brother opens to them in this way, they will immediately say, Brother, we cannot tell you what to do because we are not the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are not the Lord, and even you are not your lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jesus Christ is our Lord; He is the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even if we know the answer to your question, we still cannot answer you because we do not have the position to tell you what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must look to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To answer in this way is to honor the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, our practice in the church life is usually not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We often tell people what to do and what not to do; we even stir up arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is altogether wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our telling others what to do is an insult to the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to practice to honor and respect the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ephesians 5:22 says, Wives, be subject to your own husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A sister who keeps this word by submitting herself to her husband may ask him whether or not they should take their children to a certain place, allowing him to make the decision.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Concerning spiritual matters, her husband may turn to the Lord, but concerning such practical matters, he may unconsciously insult the Lord by making decisions on his own.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a brother has learned the lesson, he will tell his wife, Although I am the husband, I am not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to refer this matter to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We honor Him and respect Him as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Failing to honor Christ as the Head could be the reason that a husband and wife who pray together still may not know the Lord s will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On one hand, they pray to the Lord; on the other hand, they may not give the headship to the Lord, respecting the Lord as their Head.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They may still consider themselves as the head.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This may be the reason that the Lord has not answered many of our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If this is our case, we need to change our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a sister asks her husband something, he should not give his feeling or make any decision.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, he should say, I am not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let us look to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We give our honor and our respect to the Head, the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If this is our attitude, our prayer will probably be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The headship of Christ should not be merely a doctrine; it needs to be a daily practice.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to honor Christ s headship in our daily practice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Honoring Christ as the Unique Head</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>in and among the Churches and the Work</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to honor Christ as our Head in the church life also.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The elders in a local church should not consider themselves as the head.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Neither should the saints in the local church consider the elders as the head.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Among all the churches the saints should not consider an apostle as the head.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>An apostle is not a head.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have only one Head, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose one day a brother comes from another locality and tells us that he is the representative of the church in that locality and has come to make an arrangement with us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not accept such a one because, according to the truth, the way he speaks is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We do not have representatives in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Likewise, if a brother travels to another locality claiming to represent another brother, we need to tell him that according to the truth there is not such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to the New Testament, there is no organization in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There Being No Rank among the Churches</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the New Testament all the local churches are on the same level not one is higher than any other.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, our human mentality always thinks that certain churches are ranked higher than others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This concept is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In early times many churches considered the church in Jerusalem to be the head church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was difficult for the Lord to remove this wrong concept.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Regrettably, this concept damaged Jerusalem, for it was one reason that God sent Titus and the Roman army to destroy Jerusalem in A.D. 70.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God does not allow there to be any head other than Christ; even a head church is not allowed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not consider any church today to be the head church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All the churches are on the same level.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There are not first generation churches, second generation churches, and third generation churches.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All the churches are of one generation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is no lineage among the churches.</S>
