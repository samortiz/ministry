   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE MEANING OF BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING IN THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF GOD S AUTHORITY OVER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most people think that building enables us to coordinate together so that we are no longer separate individuals but a corporate Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The real meaning of building, however, is to build Christ into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Christ has been built into the believers, they become His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Ephesians 4:11-12 Paul says that God gave various gifts to the church for the building up of the Body of Christ, the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1 Corinthians 3 he refers to the building up of the Body as the building of God s habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Body and the habitation are the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul tells us to use gold, silver, and precious stones for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we build with wood, grass, and stubble, our work will be consumed vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>12-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 12 of chapter 3 shows that the building materials are gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Gold signifies the divine nature of God the Father; silver signifies the redemption of Christ, the Son; and precious stones signify the transforming work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shows that the material for the building is the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, the building is built with the Father s divine nature, the Son s redemption, and the Spirit s transforming work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This verse, however, does not say what we are building.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, brick, stone, or wood refer to the materials for building, but a home, a classroom, or an auditorium refers to the actual building.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the Bible, there are two aspects to God s building in the universe: one is a dwelling place, and the other is a city.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everything concerning the building is related either to the dwelling place or to the city.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whether God or man is building, there are only two aspects to the building the dwelling place and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Dwelling place, temple, and palace refer to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A temple is a dwelling place, and a palace is a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With the exception of the tower of Babel, every building spoken of in the Bible is either a dwelling place or a city.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today God is building a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church is God s dwelling place, God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When this building is accomplished, it will be a city the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to Ephesians 2:22, God is building a dwelling place; according to Hebrews 11:10, God is building a city with foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE BUILDING OF GOD S TEMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Old Testament the holy temple typifies God s dwelling place, and the holy city typifies the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the children of Israel entered into Canaan, from their point of view they obtained the blessing of a land flowing with milk and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From God s point of view, however, they were building a temple and a city for God 1 Kings 8:12-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Israelites took the holy temple and the holy city, Jerusalem, as their center.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the children of Israel arrived in Canaan, their work was to build the temple and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All of God s dealings with His people in the Old Testament were related to the temple and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, the psalmists often spoke of the holy temple and the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the central matter between God and His people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Satan, God s enemy, did everything he could to damage the relationship between God and His people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Satan did this by destroying the holy temple and the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After the destruction of the temple and the holy city, there was a recovery among the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The building needed to be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The holy temple and the holy city needed to be built.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This shows that the building up of the Body of Christ is the building up of God s temple on the one hand and the building up of God s city on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On one hand, the Body of Christ is God s house, God s dwelling place, and God s temple; on the other hand, the Body of Christ is the church and the bride of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Revelation 21 we see a city the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This holy city is the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, the church is a matter of the temple and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To build up the church is to build up God s temple and God s city.</S>
