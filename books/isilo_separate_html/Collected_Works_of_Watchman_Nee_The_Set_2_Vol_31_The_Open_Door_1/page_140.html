The condition is really good. Many people have been raised up to take responsibility for the work of prayer. There are many small prayer groups. Everyone brings more into the group, and the revival keeps spreading. The local sisters are responsible for the Saturday gospel meeting. Sometimes they ask us for help. God has raised up evangelists among them. It is marvelous the way sinners are saved. One very ordinary sentence causes people to repent and believe. God has used the sisters' daily conversation to bring others to Him and has worked through their testimonies. Sick people have been healed. Many sisters have seen their place of service in the house of God. They are all in one accord for the furtherance of the gospel. Some do individual work, while others do visitation work. Some spend more time in prayer. Some donate their money and their services for the Lord. Some invite friends for dinner. Some bring people to the gospel meetings. Viewing all of these, it really fills our hearts with praise to the Lord!</p><p>Everyone feels that the time is near. What we do today cannot make up for any loss in the past. This is why we must treasure the present all the more. It is as if God has placed the same heart in each one of us. Everyone is prepared to meet God. This condition could not have been brought about by anyone except God Himself. I really hope that I will not hinder His work of revival. We really need to continue to pray that He would work freely without human limitations. May all the glory be to Him!</p><p>Tso Fu-ru<br />May 10<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Sha-Di Region of Shao-Shin,<br />Chekiang Province</h2><p>I have been through San-Tai-Chiao, San-Cha-Dai, Tou-Peng, and Kan-Shan in the Sha-Di region during the past month. Everywhere I witnessed the Lord's work. What I did was merely receive His grace. Praise the Lord! The local church in Wan-An-Chiao of the southern part of Sha-Di in Shao-Shin has really been blessed by the Lord. The numbers continue to increase. There is no room in the meeting place. They have rented two bungalows in the neighboring locality of Dang-Shan-Wan. They had a conference on April 3-4. They invited me to take care of the speaking. Brother Fei Chang-bao preached the gospel. There were almost seven hundred people listening to the gospel. The atmosphere was good. Their ordinary meetings are very much according to the principles outlined in The Normal Christian Church Life. This shows that the Lord's anointing has been teaching them in all things.</p><p>When there is not a conference, the number of people who come to hear the messages is more than one hundred. Most are received in Wan-An-Chiao. After the conference in Dang-Shan-Wan, there was a conference on the sixteenth and seventeenth in the locality of Twelfth Dai. Brother Kao Jing-fu, Brother Kao Chi-luh, Brother Fei Chang-bao, and I were responsible for the messages. Approximately six hundred people attended the conference. By the grace of the Lord the audience was edified, and the speakers were edified even more. I have been home recently. In the beginning of May there will be a conference for a few days in Si-Shing. I was invited to be one of the speakers. May the Lord have the authority in me that I would be more useful in His hand.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Shan Kai-fen<br />April 20<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_139.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_141.html">Next</a> </body></html>
