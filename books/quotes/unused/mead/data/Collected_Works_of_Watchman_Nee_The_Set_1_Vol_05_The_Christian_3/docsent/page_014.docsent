   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>This is a new age.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul warned the saints before that it is untimely exaltation for one to reign at the present time 1 Cor 4:8-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At present, we should humble ourselves under the hand of the rulers Rom 13:1 and should wait until the Lord gives us the authority to reign Rom 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What we are waiting for is the coming of the new age.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The authority over the nations as mentioned here by the Lord is, of course, the same as that mentioned in Revelation 20:4.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Corinthians 6:2-3 also speaks of this time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What the Lord is telling us here is that not only will the martyrs reign, those who hold fast to the works of Christ will also have a share in the kingdom and will reign.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After reading the Lord's word here, it will become very apparent to us that not every Christian will reign in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those who will have authority over the nations are not all the saved Christians in Thyatira, nor are they the Christians who hold fast initially to the works of Christ, nor are they the Christians who have received initial commendations from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, it is the overcoming ones who hold fast until the end and who keep the Lord's works until He comes who will receive the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The saints should know now that they will not all enter the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even if they are to enter, they will not all receive the same position.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not be satisfied with eternal life alone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should strive forward and should pursue after the coming glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Is it not good that we can shine and be as the sun in the millennial kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"And he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces, as I also have received from My Father."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On that day, the Lord will reign over the nations with an iron rod in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the Lord Jesus' place anyway, but here we see His people sharing His place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here the Lord is clearly quoting the words of Psalm 2.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we compare this psalm with Psalm 110, we can see that at Christ's request, God will give to Him the nations as His inheritance and the end of the earth shall be His portion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, He will break up the nations with an iron rod and will crush them as vessels of pottery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although man's fortresses are strong now, and although those who oppose God and His Son Christ are adamant in their attitude, on that day they will all be broken to pieces by Christ, and like vessels of pottery they will not be able to withstand the iron rod.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This will happen in the future and will be Christ's position then.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, He promises His overcomers to share the same such position as He will have.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should pay attention to one thing here: the world is not being reformed gradually by the Lord's gospel and is not improving day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If it were, why will the Lord have to rule it with a rod of iron?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some people only read Psalm 2:7-8 and consider that the gospel of Christ will eventually win the victory, but we must remember that while victory is sure, it will not come about by the gospel but by authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The iron rod mentioned in Psalm 2:9, as shown by the Lord in Revelation, refers to His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In chapter nineteen, when we see Christ coming from the air, "out of His mouth proceeds a sharp sword, that with it He might smite the nations; and He will shepherd them with an iron rod; and He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty" v. 15 . This is not the gospel! This is the might of Christ! The nations will become the Lord's inheritance, and the end of the earth will become the Lord's field, not through the influence of the gospel but through the establishing and the execution of His kingdom with His authority and power at His coming on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The gospel does have its work to do, but God's goal in the gospel is merely to call out and to save a group of people in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible does not have the teaching of the whole world being reformed by the gospel and being turned into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually one wooden rod is already enough to rule over a flock, but the nations are not tame like sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why the Great Shepherd with His companions must have the iron rod before they can rule.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we read 19:15-21 again, we will see the attitude the nations will take when Christ comes again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They will gather their armies and will battle with the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, without the ruling of the iron rod, they will not submit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even in the millennium, other than the whole nation of Israel which will become righteous, not all the Gentile children who enter the millennium will necessarily be submitting to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When they enter into the millennium, although they will all be called the righteous and will be the kingdom of the sheep, still the children of the regenerated ones are not necessarily regenerated themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is why in Zechariah 14 God warns those who will not go up to Jerusalem to keep the Feast of the Tabernacle of their impending judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These passages show us that the heart of men even in the millennium will not necessarily be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, when we consider how at the end of the millennium Satan is released to deceive Gog and Magog to rebel against God, we realize that man's nature, except through regeneration, will never be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, in the millennium the Lord and His servants have to shepherd the nations with a rod of iron.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We know that a man of flesh has his strength and stubbornness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord compares this nature to the vessels of pottery.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although it is strong, it cannot withstand the iron rod of God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the iron rod strikes, these ones will be broken into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If they were of mud, they could still be remolded.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, they are vessels of pottery; once they are broken, they could never again be made whole.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This kind of breaking is the kindest work of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If this is not done, the public peace and order of the world will be affected.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our endurance will not have to last until eternity, and Christ's righteousness will not forever be cast aside.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the day comes, He will execute His righteous discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At that time, when His attitude changes, we will change with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This half of the promise speaks of things related to the Lord's kingdom.</S>
