   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Now we will see what these brothers gave us: They showed us how the blood of the Lord satisfies the righteousness of God; the assurance of salvation; how the weakest believer may be accepted in Christ, just as Christ was accepted; and how to believe in the Word of God as the foundation of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since church history began, there never was a period when the gospel was clearer than in their time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not only so, it was also they who showed us that the church cannot gain the entire world, that the church has a heavenly calling, and that the church has no worldly hope.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It was they who also opened up the prophecies for the first time, causing us to see that the return of the Lord is the hope of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was they who opened the book of Revelation and the book of Daniel and showed us the kingdom, the tribulation, the rapture, and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without them, we would know a very small percentage of future things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was also they who showed us what the law of sin is, what it is to be set free, what it is to be crucified with Christ, what it is to be raised with Christ, how to be identified with the Lord through faith, and how to be transformed daily by looking unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was they who showed us the sin of the denominations, the unity of the Body of Christ, and the unity of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was they who showed us the difference between Judaism and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant churches, this difference could not be readily seen, but they made us see it anew.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was also they who showed us the sin of the mediatorial class, how all the children of God are priests, and how all can serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was they who recovered for us the principle of meetings in 1 Corinthians 14, showing us that prophesying is not one man's business but the business of two or three, and that prophesying is not based upon ordination, but upon the gift of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we were to enumerate one by one what they recovered, we may as well say that in today's pure Protestant churches there is not one truth that they did not recover or recover more.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is no wonder that D. M. Panton said, "The movement of the brothers and its significance is far greater than the Reformation." W. H. Griffith Thomas said, "Among the children of God, it was they who were most able to rightly divide the word of truth.'' Henry Ironside said, "Whether among those who know the brothers or those who do not know the brothers, all those who know God have received help from the brothers directly or indirectly.''</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This movement was greater than the movement of the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here I would like to say that the work of Philadelphia is greater than the work of the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Philadelphia gives us the things which the Reformation did not give us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We thank the Lord that the problem of the church is solved by the movement of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The position of the children of God has almost been recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, both in quantity and in quality you can see that it is greater than the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet we must note that the movement of the brothers is not quite as famous as the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Reformation was brought about with sword and spear, while the movement of the brothers was brought about by preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the cause of the Reformation, many lost their lives in the wars in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Another reason the Reformation is famous was its relationship to politics.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many nations, through the Reformation, threw off the power of Rome politically.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Anything that is not related to politics is not easily known by men.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, the brothers saw two things: One is what we call the organized world, that is, the psychological world; the other is what the brothers called the world of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They left not only the psychological world, but also the world of Christianity, which is represented by the Protestant churches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That is why they were not even advertised in the Protestant churches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They have come out not only from the world of sin, but also from the world of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From their time, men knew that the church is the Body of Christ, that the children of God are one church, and that they should not be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Their emphasis was on the brothers and the real love for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus says that a church will appear whose name is Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now let us look at Revelation: "And to the messenger of the church in Philadelphia write'' 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Philadelphia is brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What does the Lord praise Philadelphia for?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He says it is brotherly love; the mediatorial position has been completely abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I will take this opportunity to say a few more words.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Christ there is neither male nor female.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Christ there are no sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are brothers, not sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now our sisters will ask, "Who are we?''</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are all brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are brothers because we all have the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today there are many men in the world, but they are not our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A man is a brother not because he is man, but because he has the life of Christ in him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since I also have the life of Christ in me, we are brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the Lord resurrected and was about to ascend to heaven, He said, "I ascend to My Father and your Father'' John 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In John 1 He is the only begotten Son of God; in John 20 He is God's firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In chapter one God had Him as the only Son; in chapter twenty His life is imparted to men; thus, He is the firstborn Son and we all are brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Through death and resurrection God's only begotten Son became the firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We can be brothers because we have received His life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because we have all received the life of Christ, we are all brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A man is a brother because he receives the life of Christ; a woman is a brother because she receives the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Both men and women all receive the same life; therefore, all are brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All the Epistles were written to brothers, not sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Individually speaking, there are sisters, but in Christ there are only brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because of that life, we have become the children teknia of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All the "sons and daughters'' in the New Testament should be translated as "children.''</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Besides 2 Corinthians 6:18, there is no mention of daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do you see?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In Christ everyone stands in the position of a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once when I was in Shanghai, there was a brother who was a mason.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I said to him, "Go and ask some brothers to come in.''</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He replied, "Do you want me to ask the male brothers or the female brothers?''</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This was a man taught of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We address sisters when we address individuals, but in Christ there is no distinction between male and female.</S>
