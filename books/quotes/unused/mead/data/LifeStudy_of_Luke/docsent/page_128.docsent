   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE FORTY-THREE THE MINISTRY OF THE MAN-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS HUMAN VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WITH HIS DIVINE ATTRIBUTES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FROM GALILEE TO JERUSALEM 21 Scripture Reading: Luke 19:1-27</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we shall consider 19:1-27.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This portion of Luke covers two matters: the saving of Zaccheus in Jericho vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1-10 and the Lord s teaching about faithfulness vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>11-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE SALVATION OF ZACCHEUS A Leading Sinner</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Luke 19:1 and 2 say, And He entered and was passing through Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And behold, there was a man whose name was called Zaccheus; and he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a chief tax collector, Zaccheus was a chief sinner, a leading sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He became rich through his sinfulness as a tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In his confession to the Lord related to restitution and clearing of the past, Zaccheus said to Him, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusations, I restore four times as much v. 8 . We may regard the words if I have taken anything as a euphemism, a nice way of referring to extortion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Tax collectors put a higher value on property or increased the tax of those unable to pay and then charged high interest.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was the way they extorted others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As Zaccheus was seeking to make restitution, he referred to his extortion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What Zaccheus did in restoring four times the amount he extorted was very honest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, he still referred to his acts of extortion in a euphemistic way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A man who had become rich by being sinful, Zaccheus now wanted to make full restitution in order to clear up his sinful past.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Seeking to See Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Luke 19:3 and 4 say, And he was seeking to see Jesus, who He is; and he could not because of the crowd, for he was small in stature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And he ran on ahead and climbed up in a sycamore tree that he might see Him, for He was about to pass through that way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although Zaccheus climbed up in the tree to see the Lord Jesus, we are told not that he saw the Lord but that the Lord saw him: And as He came to the place, Jesus looked up and said to him, Zaccheus, hurry and come down; for today I must stay in your house v. 5 . The seeing was not on Zaccheus side; it was on the Savior s side.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once again we see the Man-Savior s high standard of morality in saving sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nothing was done by the sinner; rather, everything was done by the Savior, even the seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verse 6 we are told that Zaccheus hurried and came down, and welcomed Him, rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Man-Savior Staying in Zaccheus House</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Zaccheus certainly was an isolated person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was despised to the uttermost by the Jewish community and was even more isolated than a leper.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Especially the Pharisees, the high ranking hypocrites in the Jewish religion, did not care for him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In their sight he was more unclean than someone with leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nevertheless, in front of a large crowd the Savior told Zaccheus, Today I must stay in your house.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What a great surprise that was to Zaccheus and to everyone in the crowd!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The entire city of Jericho must have been shaken by it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 7 says, And seeing it, they all grumbled, saying, He has gone in to lodge with a sinful man.</S>
