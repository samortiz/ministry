   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Shepherding the Flock of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we would drop the concept concerning rank, it would be easy for us to understand the matter of position.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If rank is gone, the position means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, I would say, strictly speaking, that the elders should not consider that they have any position.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They have no position.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Apostle Peter could not forget the Lord's teaching concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In his first Epistle Peter told the elders as a "fellow-elder" 5:1 not to lord it over the brothers and the sisters but to be a living example, a pattern v. 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the actual situation of a shepherd and a flock, the shepherd, strictly speaking, cannot be an example to the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The shepherd is a man and the flock is cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How can a man be an example to cattle?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, though, the flock as the church is a composition of men.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The saints are not cattle, but they are men just as the elders are men.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The elders are men, but they are also the shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They should not shepherd a flock of men as they would a flock of cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The elders have to shepherd the "man flock" by setting themselves up, the living men, as examples.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whatever the saints in the local church should do or live, the elders must do it and live it first.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then their doing and their living will be a living example.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the way to shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to this way, the elders do not have a rank nor do they have a position.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If they do have a position, their position is the same as all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In God's economy, the shepherd and the flock all are men and all of them should be the same because the shepherd should be an example.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the shepherds, the elders, are extraordinary, different people, they could never be examples to others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since they can be examples to others, they are the same as others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For instance, we cannot say that the king should be an example to the civilians.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We also cannot say that the governor of a state should be an example to the citizens of this state.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, Peter says as an elder that all the elders should be living examples of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No Control</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Also, according to the Lord's word in the Gospels and to Peter's words in his Epistle, the holy Word does not allow the elder to control at all.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus stressed this point very strongly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The leading ones should not be rulers, but slaves, servants, who serve and who do not control.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then Peter tells the elders not to lord it over the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church does not belong to the elders, but the church is God's flock.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>An elder is a shepherd and a servant to take care of the owner's flock, and the owner is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 1 Peter 5:3, Peter tells the elders not to lord it over the "allotments."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This Greek word means lots or portions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The churches are God's possession, allotted to the elders as their allotments, their portions, entrusted to them by God for their care.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is the Owner and the Master and the elders are His servants to serve Him and take care of His assignment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Master has assigned the local church to the elders who should take care of the flock, not by ruling but by serving as a slave, setting themselves up as living examples.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the New Testament teaching, there is no rank and no position for the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is also no controlling for the elders because they do not have any rank or any position.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They do not have any right to control.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The clear word of the New Testament does not allow or give any ground for the elders to take rank, position, or controlling power.</S>
