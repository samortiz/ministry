   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Abstinence from Foods</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Being the Teachings of Demons</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Timothy 4 says that there will be the teachings of demons that forbid marriage and command abstaining from foods vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>D. M. Panton has shed some clear light on this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He said that only by abstaining from marriage and foods can one s soul power be developed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must realize that we are not those who abstain from meat.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the last days there will be such things as abstinence from foods.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the teaching of demons; it is not the teaching of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some abstain from meat because they do not know the Christian principle of life through death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eating only vegetables means that one s life is maintained by the vegetable life alone and that he has no need of a Savior, no need of death, and no need of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must be clear about this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. Not Taking Blood</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second, there is one thing which Christians should not take blood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Taking of Blood Being Forbidden</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>in Three Dispensations</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Abstinence from blood is a consistent teaching throughout the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When God spoke to Noah in Genesis 9, He forbade men from taking the blood of the animals v. 4 . Taking blood was something forbidden by God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Leviticus 17:10-16 clearly and repeatedly says that man should not eat the blood of any beast.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God did not allow His people to eat animal blood.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whoever ate blood would be cut off by God; He would not recognize such a one as one of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the New Testament we find the record of the first council in Jerusalem in Acts 15, in which the church met to settle the great issue of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>James, Peter, Paul, Barnabas, and other apostles of the Lord decided that God s children should be free from the law, but at the same time that they should abstain from sacrifices offered to idols, from fornication, and from blood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Blood is something that bears a great significance, not only during the time of Noah and in Leviticus, but also at the time of the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the dispensation of the patriarchs, God forbade Noah from taking animal blood.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the dispensation of the law, God spoke through the mouth of Moses and forbade the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the dispensation of grace, God banned the same thing through the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This matter is forbidden in all three dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Blood is not to be taken in the dispensation of the patriarchs, the dispensation of the law, or the dispensation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Drinking Only the Blood of the Lord Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There must be a reason for this observance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Men of the past did not understand this, but one day God s Son came to the world and pronounced that He was the bread from heaven and that He came to be man s food.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many did not know what He meant.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He said that His flesh was true food and His blood was true drink.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord repeated over and over again in John 6 that His blood was the true drink and that a man must drink His blood before he can receive His life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He also said that unless a man drank His blood, he would not have life in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who drink His blood will be raised up in the last day and will receive life from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord repeated this many times.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a marvelous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All three of the basic dispensations in the Bible forbid the eating of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yet Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God, said, My blood is true drink v. 55 . He charged men to take His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do you see this?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God forbids us from eating the blood of animals, yet those who take the Lord s blood are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means that after one takes the Lord s blood, he cannot take any other kind of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is only one kind of blood which we can take.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In other words, God s ordinance regarding abstinence from blood tells us that there is only one redemption and one salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot have another redemption besides this one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We cannot have another salvation besides this one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only the blood of Jesus of Nazareth can be taken.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All other blood is forbidden.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord s blood signifies redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It also signifies salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rejecting other kinds of blood means that we reject other kinds of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I know of no other salvation except the salvation of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is only one kind of blood for me, not two.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Only one kind of blood can save me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I will not accept any other blood.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This may be a small thing to you, but it is one of our many crucial testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As Christians, we bear many testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Other religions may ask why we do not take animal blood.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have to tell them that we have already taken blood.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>By not taking other blood, we make a strong testimony before men.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We do not take other blood because we have taken one kind of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have taken this blood; therefore, we cannot drink any other blood.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The blood of Jesus of Nazareth is our only redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We can no longer accept any other redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We have already accepted the Lord s redemption, and we have rejected all other ways of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is why we do not take animal blood.</S>
