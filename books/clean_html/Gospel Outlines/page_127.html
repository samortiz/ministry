<h1 class="title">THE SALVATION OF THE EUNUCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Acts 8:26-39</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The eunuch was one that sought after God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>He was an official.</li>
	<li>He was a Gentile from a great distance.</li>
	<li>Though he was a high official and lived a great distance away, he was a man who sought after God. There are two proofs: (1) He came from a remote region in Africa to the temple in Jerusalem to worship God. (2) He read the Bible and was seeking for God in the Bible.</li>
	<li>He came to Jerusalem to seek for God. He sought after God in the temple, but he did not meet Him. Neither did he meet God by reading the letter of the Bible. This shows that the outward effort is in vain.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God allows men to find Him
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>All man&rsquo;s effort in seeking after God is in vain. It is only when God allows men to find Him that their seeking is not in vain.</li>
	<li>Though man&rsquo;s seeking after God is in vain, man&rsquo;s seeking heart is precious. God does not value man&rsquo;s effort, but he treasures man&rsquo;s heart. He will fulfill every heart that is seeking for Him.</li>
	<li>Although his effort of seeking after God was in vain, this official&rsquo;s seeking heart was fulfilled by God. When he was returning home in disappointment, having gained nothing, God allowed him to find Him. He thought that he could find God in the temple, but he never thought that he could find God in the wilderness. He thought that he could meet God in the letters of the Bible, but instead he met God through the mouth of a man without the Bible. Today many come to the chapel to seek for God and leave in disappointment. Yet on the way home they may meet a believer, and after talking with him, meet God. Many come to the letter of the Bible to find God, but cannot find Him. One day, through one of His own people, God speaks one or two words and their eyes are immediately opened to see Him.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The revelation of the gospel
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The eunuch read the Bible. When he was reading in Isaiah concerning Christ, he could not understand anything because he had no revelation.</li>
	<li>The revelation of the gospel is to unveil Jesus Christ to men. That day the eunuch happened to read that particular passage of the Bible unknowingly. His reading was of the Holy Spirit, because the passage touched his relationship with Christ. The Holy Spirit on the one hand moved him to read that passage while he was unoccupied, and on the other hand moved in Philip to explain it to him. After Philip had explained, his eyes were opened and he understood.</li>
	<li>The revelation of the gospel is the revelation of Christ. The gospel tells men that Jesus Christ is God who came to be a man, was crucified, and shed His blood for men.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to receive the gospel
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Believe the word of the gospel. When this official heard what Philip told him about Isaiah 53, he believed.</li>
	<li>Believe in the Son of God. To believe in the Son of God is to receive a living Savior.</li>
	<li>Be baptized into the Lord.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The result of receiving the gospel
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Our sins are forgiven. When the eunuch believed that the Lord was the Lamb of God bearing the sins of the world, his sins were then forgiven.</li>
	<li>We obtain the life of God. Since he received the Son of God, he obtained the life of God.</li>
	<li>We walk on the path of rejoicing and live a happy life. He who has not met God has an unhappy life. After being saved, the eunuch&rsquo;s life was changed and he went on his way rejoicing.</li>
	</ol></li>
