   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WE SHOULD HAVE CONFIDENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN SUBMITTING TO THE DELEGATED AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What a dangerous risk it is for God to set up authorities for Himself!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How much He suffers if the delegated authorities He has set up wrongly represent Him!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But God is confident in the authority that He establishes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is much easier for us to be confident in submitting to representative authorities than for God to be confident in setting them up.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since God is confident in handing over authority to man, should we not be confident in submitting to man?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should be confident in submitting to the authority which God is confident in establishing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If there is a mistake, it is not our mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is the mistake of the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord says that every person should be subject to the authorities over him Rom 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is more difficulty on God's part than on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When God trusts man, we can as well.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When God is confident about His trust, we should be even more so.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Luke 9:48 says, "Whoever receives this little child because of My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is no problem for the Lord to represent the Father, because the Father has entrusted everything to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For us to believe in Him is to believe in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But in the Lord's eyes even a child can represent the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord can entrust Himself to a child.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why He said that receiving a little child is to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Luke 10:16 the Lord sent out the disciples and said, "He who hears you hears Me, and he who rejects you rejects Me."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All of the disciples' words, charges, decisions, and opinions represented the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord was so confident that He entrusted all authority to the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whatever they said in the Lord's name, He acknowledged.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, rejecting the disciples was the same as rejecting the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord could entrust Himself to them with full peace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He did not say that they should be careful in their words or that they should not blunder in speaking when they went out.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord was not concerned at all with what would happen if they blundered.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord had the faith and the courage to hand over authority to the disciples with confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the Jews were not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They doubted and said, "How can this be?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How do I know that all you said is right?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need more considerations!"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They dared not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They were very afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose you are working as an executive in a corporation, and you send one out saying, "Do your best.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whatever you do I will acknowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When people listen to you, they are listening to me."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If this is the case, you would probably require him to send back a daily report of his work, lest there be any mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the Lord can entrust us to be His representatives.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What a big trust this is!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since the Lord trusts His deputy authority so much, we should trust such authority even more.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some may say, "What happens if the authority makes mistakes?"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If God dares to trust those who are entrusted as authorities, then we should dare to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whether or not the authority makes mistakes has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In other words, whether the deputy authority is right or wrong is a matter for which he has to be responsible directly before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who submit to authority need only to submit absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even if they make a mistake through submission, the Lord will not reckon that as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord will hold the deputy authority responsible for that sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To disobey is to rebel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For this the submitting one has to be responsible before God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For this reason there is no human element involved in submission.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we are only submitting to a person, the meaning of authority is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Moreover, since God has already set up His deputy authority, He must maintain this authority.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whether or not others are right is their business.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whether or not I am right is my business.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Everyone has to be responsible to the Lord for himself.</S>
