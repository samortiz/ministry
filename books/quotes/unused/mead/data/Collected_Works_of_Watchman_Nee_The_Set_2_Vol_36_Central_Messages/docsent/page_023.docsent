   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO CHRIST IS THE RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE LIFE Scripture Reading: John 11:25 WHAT HE DOES VERSUS WHAT HE IS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Chapter eleven of the Gospel of John shows us how the Lord Jesus gave life to a dead person; it shows us how the Lord Jesus resurrected a person from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord can resurrect man, but He did not say, "I will resurrect the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead, He said, "I am the resurrection."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After He said these words, He resurrected a man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both Martha and Mary were there on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To them, it would have been better for the Lord Jesus to say, "It does not matter that your brother has died; I can resurrect him."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We like to hear this kind of word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our desire and hope is that God will do something for us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We often pray, hope, and wait before God for a word concerning what He will do for us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the Lord does not want to show us what He will do; He wants to show us what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What He can do is based on what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Martha believed in the Lord's power.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She said to Jesus, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died" v. 21 . Martha believed in God's power, and she also believed in the Lord Jesus' power, but she did not see that the Lord Himself is the resurrection and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must see that everything God can do is included in what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The reason a man does not have God's power is that he does not know what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"He who comes forward to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him" Heb 11:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the power that God has is based upon what He "is."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In John 11:25 the Lord Jesus was not saying that He can preserve a man's life, but that He Himself is life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was not telling us of His ability to resurrect men, but of the fact that He Himself is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May God open our eyes to see who the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must see that in God's eyes, Christ is our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once we have this kind of understanding, it is possible to have genuine growth in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must realize that in God's eyes, there is not any other object; the only object is Christ Himself!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whether or not we grow spiritually depends on whether we have truly touched spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, do we just know the individual things that God has done, or do we know God Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John 11 does not say that the Lord Jesus resurrected Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead it says that the Lord Jesus was resurrection to Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brothers and sisters, do you see the difference?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord was resurrection to Lazarus, and then Lazarus was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord did not give resurrection as a thing to Lazarus; He became resurrection to Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In other words, what the Lord does is only the appearance; what He is is the reality of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are not saying that the Lord did not resurrect Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are saying that Lazarus resurrected because the Lord was resurrection to him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must remember that everything that God does in Christ is done in this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the Lord is something to me, that something comes into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First He "is," then He "has."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many Christians separate the Grace-giver from the grace given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One day we will find out that the Grace-giver is the very gift given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has not given us many things; He has only given us the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All spiritual things and all of God's gifts are but Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God does not give us something piece by piece.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God has given us Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day God will open our eyes to see that everything is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How wonderful it will be if we see this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In declaring who He is, the Lord said, "I am the resurrection and the life."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why His delaying did not cause a problem in the resurrection of Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In raising up Lazarus, the Lord was trying to lead men to the knowledge of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The resurrection of Lazarus was not the greatest thing; the greatest thing is to know that the Lord Jesus is the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many people believe that the Lord Jesus is the Life-giver.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But it is altogether different to believe that the Lord Himself is life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is not only the Life-giver; He is also the life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is the Life-giver, and He is the life which He gives.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is not only the Lord who resurrects; He is resurrection itself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Once you see this, you will see that everything in Christ is living.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God has only given Christ to man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We hope that at least a little light will shine on us so that we can know that the Lord is everything and know Him as such a Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is the Grace-giver, and He is also the grace given.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our Lord said, "I am the resurrection and the life."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Resurrection and life encompass the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is wonderful to know the resurrection and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Let us now see what life is.</S>
