   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first divine title given to the Spirit in the New Testament is the "Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the incarnation the Spirit of God was called the Holy Spirit Matt 1:18, 20; Luke 1:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Andrew Murray in his masterpiece, The Spirit of Christ, points out that the divine title, the Holy Spirit, is not used in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Psalm 51:11 and in Isaiah 63:10-11 the "Holy Spirit" should be translated "the Spirit of holiness."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was when the time came to prepare the way for Christ's coming and to prepare a human body for Him to initiate the New Testament dispensation, that the term "Holy Spirit" came into use Luke 1:15, 35 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Luke 1:35 gives us the first mention of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is introduced at the time when the Lord Jesus was conceived by a human mother.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is because something common is to be made holy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this same verse the One to be born is called "that holy thing."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Holy Spirit came into a human being to conceive something holy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the Holy Spirit came into us common human beings, we too could be made holy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>D. The Spirit Being Not Yet</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we come to a very puzzling but crucial point in the gradual revelation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In John 7:37-38 the Lord Jesus cried, "If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He who believes in Me, as the Scriptures said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then in verse 39 John explains that the Lord spoke this "concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>John does not say the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, or the Holy Spirit, but "the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He further says that when Jesus was crying out to the people, "the Spirit was not yet."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The King James Version says, "the Spirit was not yet given," but the word "given" is inserted; it is not in the Greek text.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit of God was in Genesis 1, and the Spirit of Jehovah came upon the prophets in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why, then, in John 7 was the Spirit "not yet"?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In chapter seven of John, the Lord Jesus was still in the flesh; He was not yet in glory, that is, not yet in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because He was not yet resurrected, the Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Of course, the Spirit of God existed from the very beginning Gen 1:1-2 , but the Spirit as the Spirit of Jesus Acts 16:7 , the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , and the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 , was "not yet" until the Lord was glorified in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After His resurrection, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This involves the matter of process.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Genesis 1:2 we have the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The only element in the Spirit of God is the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But after the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit became the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the Spirit of God was just the Spirit of God, the only element in the Spirit was the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But when the Spirit of God became the Spirit of Jesus, the essence of humanity was added.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>E. The Spirit of Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to Acts 16:6, Paul and his co-workers were "forbidden of the Holy Spirit to preach the Word in Asia."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But verse 7 says that the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them to go into Bithynia.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In these two verses first we have the Holy Spirit, then the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we study the context of verse 7, we shall see that Paul was suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For this reason, the Spirit of Jesus was with him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Spirit of Jesus has the elements of humanity, human living, and crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because Paul in Acts 16 was experiencing human suffering and was experiencing the death of Christ, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Lord, and the Holy Spirit at that juncture were the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of the incarnated One who lived on earth as a man and died on the cross.</S>
