   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SERVICE BEING THE MINISTERING OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The service we are talking about is certainly not the so-called "Sunday morning service" to which many Christians are accustomed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Neither is it just to perform some work such as cleaning the church meeting hall, although that can be part of serving.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The real service is our functioning in the church life in a way that ministers Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In preaching the gospel, offering a prayer, or giving a testimony in the meeting, you should have the view that you are serving Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A stewardess on an airplane serves people with refreshments.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Similarly, in the church we should be ones who serve people with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To minister Christ as life to others should be the purpose of all the things we do, whether we are cleaning, arranging, cooking, visiting, ministering the Word, singing, or praying.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the practical things in the church life are nothing but the channels, the means through which, by which, and in which we would minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If others cannot sense Christ in the kitchen while you are cooking, it is doubtful that they will sense Him in the meetings in a real way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To have Christ ministered in the meetings we need to exercise ourselves in such a way in doing all the practical things that Christ will be ministered in the practical things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every part of the service of the church must minister Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to learn to serve in the spirit, and we need to learn to do all the things in the service of the church in a way that ministers Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is our aim and purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE BASIS OF OUR SERVICE A. By the Growth in Life</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First we have the aspect of life, then the aspect of service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have the life matter settled first, then, based on that fact, we have the matter of service.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without life and the adequate growth in life, we cannot have the service.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The little children can do many things, but they cannot serve, because they simply do not have the adequate growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the foregoing lessons we have covered many aspects and practices of life that can help you to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must all rise up to serve according to our capacity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not excuse ourselves as being too young.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every believer should have a proper life of service.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>B. In the Body</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Christian service is a matter of life and in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is a matter in the Body and a matter of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You cannot serve the Lord as an individual Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To serve the Lord, you need to realize that the Lord's service is something in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every believer is a member of the Body, a part of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>An individual is not the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A member of the Body cannot function without the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The hand is good, quite useful, but if it is cut off from the body, it becomes not only dead, but also ugly, terrible, and even terrifying.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You may love to shake my hand, but if this hand were detached from the body, it would be terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today many Christians are detached, separated from the reality of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is as if they are disembodied members.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The members of the body are beautiful as long as they are attached where they belong in the body, but in any other place they are terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How sad it is that many Christians today are like ears that have been detached and put on the shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How could they serve the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How could we serve the Lord without being built up together as members of the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is impossible.</S>
