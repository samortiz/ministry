Watchman and Kuang Hsiung:</P><P>All the brothers and sisters in the meeting in Kung Ho City, Taishan have been blessed by God with peace. We moved our meeting to No. 26 Kung Ho City more than a month ago. Since moving, we have been blessed by God very much with opportunities to preach the gospel. But we still hope for more prayers.</P><P>There are about thirty sisters in the meeting, but there are only three brothers. One of them is Brother Ts'ai Chih Yun. He was baptized into the Lord two months ago. He is a doctor. His clinic is near the Church of Christ in China. He has had a good relationship with the preachers in the denominations, but he never would believe in the Lord. He received the book Bible Studies for Beginners (by Brother Nee) and after studying the Bible with this book, he got saved. He also knew that the Lord hated denominations. So he was not tempted by profits, nor was he afraid of taunts. He boldly became one who only belongs to Christ and entered into the name of our Lord Christ, worshipping God the Father in sincerity and in spirit. Now he speaks the gospel zealously and really testifies that the Holy Spirit is with him.</P><P>After I left the Baptist Church on June 29 of last year, thank the Lord, His grace has been sufficient for me. Because I have had blisters on the bottoms of my feet (people in Kwangchow call them Hong Kong feet), I could not go out on the street before December 25 of last year. Even though I am wearing shoes and socks to go out and preach to people, my blisters still have not gotten better! I hope the brothers and sisters in all the localities will pray for me.</P><P>After leaving the denomination, I had many questions I wanted to ask, but fortunately the sisters here gave me many of Brother Nee's books to read, so I received much light. Now I have written my questions (they are published in the answering letter). Please answer them for me. (If you two brothers are busy, please ask another brother to answer them.) May God the Father bless your spirits and bodies with strength and health!</P><P>Your little brother in the Lord,<br>T'ang Yen Min<br>May 15, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Answering Letter</H2><P>To the brother in the Lord, Yen Min:</P><P>I have read your letter. Brother Chang is in Tsinan now, and Brother Nee asked me to answer this for him. I will answer your three questions as follows:</P><P>Question: "There is a sister who fasts on the Lord's Day and does not eat pork on Fridays. Although we cannot argue with her about her doubts, can we exhort her?"</P><P>Answer: If this sister fasts on the Lord's Day because she has a burden in her spirit, do not exhort her to stop. You can exhort her to stop fasting if she does not have a burden and you can exhort her to stop abstaining from pork on Fridays, but you do not need to forbid her.</P><P>Question: "Some people believe that they are saved but that if they sin in the future, they still might perish eternally. Are these people weak in the faith, or are they completely unsaved?"</P><P>Answer: If these people have already believed and received the Lord Jesus as their Savior, they are already saved. They think that they could perish if they sin after being saved because they probably do not know the Bible well enough. We cannot say that they are not saved.</P><P>According to the Bible, once a person believes, he is eternally saved and cannot perish. The Lord Jesus said, "Him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out" (John 6:37). He also said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life" (v. 47). Once we believe, we are not only saved, but we also gain "eternal life." "Eternal life" is the life that lives to eternity. It is the life of God. It can never perish. So the Lord said again, "I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever" (10:28).</P><P>The verses used by some as the basis for perdition after salvation should not be interpreted in their way. Most of these verses refer to entering the kingdom, not to salvation and the receiving of eternal life. (Entering the kingdom and receiving eternal life are two different matters.)</P><P>Question: Is it all right for a brother who has already taken the table on the Lord's Day to go to another place in the evening and break bread with them there?</P><P>Answer: If the "other place" is a denomination, he is eating at the table of a denomination. According to the Bible he should not do that. (Please read Collection of Newsletters, Issue No. 5, for the answer concerning the Lord's table.) We had best exhort this kind of brother through the light of the Bible not to go to the denominations to eat the supper. But we cannot refuse him just because he has gone to the denominational supper also. I respectfully greet you.</P><P>Your brother in the Lord,<br>Witness Lee<br>May 22, 1934</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_054.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_056.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 25: Collection of Newsletters (1) &nbsp; pg 55</div><br></body></html>
