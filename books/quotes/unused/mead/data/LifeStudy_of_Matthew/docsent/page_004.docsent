   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE KING S ANTECEDENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND STATUS I. HIS GENEALOGY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Among the four Gospels only two, Matthew and Luke, have genealogies.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matthew tells us that Jesus is the proper descendant of the royal family, that He is the legal heir of the royal throne.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such a person surely needs a genealogy telling of His origin and descent.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Luke presents Jesus as a proper, normal man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To show Jesus as a proper man also requires a genealogy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Mark, Jesus is pictured as a bondslave, as one sold into slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A bondslave has no need of a genealogy; hence, Mark does not include one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John tells us that Jesus is God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With Him there was no beginning, no descent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is eternal, with no beginning of life nor end of life Heb 7:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the beginning was God!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For John to talk about His genealogy would be ridiculous.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With anybody else, no matter who he is or how many biographies people write about him, the genealogy will be exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But Jesus has two genealogies.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Later on we shall see how these genealogies eventually become one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once again we see that He is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In every aspect, He is too wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A. The Generation of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now we come to the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to realize who Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Who is Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may answer by saying that He is the Son of God, but this genealogy does not have such a term.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, it calls Him the son of David and the son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because Jesus is so wonderful, it is difficult to say who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Jesus is the mingling of God with man, the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the generation of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The generation of Jesus means that He is the mingling, the wonderful mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this generation we have the mingling of the divine Being with so many human beings, with all kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should no longer think that Matthew 1:1-17 is just a list of names.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The generation of Christ is composed of:</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Fathers</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These are the forefathers, the great persons.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All together they make up fourteen generations 1:2-6a .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Kings</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These are the kings, the royalty, who also make up fourteen generations 1:6b-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Civilians the Captured Ones</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>and the Recovered Ones</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The generation of Christ not only includes the highranking people, but also the civilians, the insignificant ones, like Mary and Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The poor people, the little people, are also included in the generation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ was ranked not only with the patriarchs and with the kings, but also with a group of civilians.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was not only of the great ones, of the royal ones, but also of the little ones.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From this picture of the generation of Christ, we can see that it includes all kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This generation includes both the called ones, like Abraham, and the ones carried away to captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this brief record we have the words carrying away v. 17 . Abraham was called out of Babel, the origin of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The generation of Christ includes not only the called ones, but also the backsliders.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Perhaps five years ago you were a called one, but today you are a backslider.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The generation of Christ includes you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This generation includes Jeconiah, a king who was dethroned and carried away to Babylon as a captive.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Have you ever been dethroned?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do not think you have not.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In your Christian life you sometimes have been dethroned.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once you were a king, but you lost your kingship and became a backslider.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our forefather Abraham came from Babylon; yet you went back, not willingly, but were carried back.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Praise the Lord that the generation of Christ includes even the fallen ones!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After captivity there was the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, we have another name, Zerubbabel, the name of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many captives returned with Zerubbabel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The generation of Christ includes all kinds of people: good ones, bad ones, called ones, fallen ones, and recovered ones.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If I were to ask you which kind you are, you may say that firstly you were a called one, then a fallen one, and finally a recovered one.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You were an Abraham, you became a Jeconiah, but today you are a Zerubbabel.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are all Zerubbabels.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We are the called ones, the fallen ones, and the recovered ones.</S>
