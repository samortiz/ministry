   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's perfect will is His ordained will; it exists from eternity to eternity and is executed in heaven without any hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's permissive will originates from God's foreknowledge and is based on God's perfect will; it passes through the world and eventually ends up in eternity.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, Ephesians 1:4-5 also tells us that God "chose us" in Christ and pre- destinated us "unto sonship" before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He chose men, but He predestinated them unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not only did God foreordain the Son to be the Christ, He also chose us in Christ and predestinated us unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second Timothy 1:9 says that God gave us grace "before the times of the ages."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Titus 1:2 says that God promised us eternal life "before the times of the ages."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He promised that we would participate in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These two verses tell us that in order to receive the sonship, God predestinated us unto grace and life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All of these things were purposed by God before the foundation of the world.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>from the Foundation of the World</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's plan was purposed before the foundation of the world, but the fulfillment of His plan is realized from the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God accomplishes His plan through time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How does God accomplish His plan?</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is within the span of time that God created all things and accomplished redemption through Christ, writing the names of the redeemed ones into the book of life, giving them eternal life, and through this, preparing His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's eternal will was purposed in the first eternity, that is, before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is God's perfect will.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God's eternal plan will be fulfilled in the second eternity.</S>
