[1]  The Producing and Building Up of the Church as the Totality of the Divine Sonship CONTENTS
[2]  The Producing and Building Up of the Church through the Death and Resurrection of Christ
[3]  God chose us, selected us, not in ourselves but in Christ.
[4]  Ephesians 1:5 says, Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.
[5]  Originally, Christ was the unique, only begotten Son of God v. 14, 18; 3:16; 1 John 4:9 , but now He is the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29; Heb 1:6 . Hebrews 2:10 says that God is leading many sons into glory, and verse 11 says that Christ, the firstborn Son, is not ashamed to call them brothers.
[6]  Rather, the church is the Body of Christ Eph 1:22b-23; 1 Cor 12:27; Col 1:18 , and it is the totality of the sonship of all God s children.
[7]  Immediately, Jesus told Peter, I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church v. 18 . It is as if the Lord was saying, Peter, you have seen the vision of Christ, but now I will reveal to you something further.
[8]  According to this teaching, when Christ came, He brought the kingdom with Him, but when the Jews rejected Christ, the kingdom was suspended and will remain suspended until Christ returns with the kingdom.
[9]  This is a picture of Christ as the living oyster coming into the world, the sea, being wounded by us, the sinners, and secreting His life over us in His resurrection to make us precious pearls for the building of the church.
[10]  In order for the church to be produced as the treasure and the pearl for the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose, Christ undertook four steps: He was crucified to pass through death, He resurrected, He ascended to the throne, and now He dwells within us.
[11]  Thus, Christ today is the crucified Christ, the resurrected Christ, the ascended Christ, and the indwelling Christ.
[12]  Ephesians 5:25-27 says, Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish.
[13]  Christ s death was necessary for the producing of the church, not merely because we, the chosen people of God, were involved with sins and the world and were troubled by Satan, self, the natural man, and ordinances, but because we needed to become the many grains.
[14]  The brothers of Christ are the church, and the church is constituted with the many brothers of Christ.
[15]  No doubt, we are still Christ s brothers, but it is only when we live in the resurrection life, denying our natural life, that we are in the church practically.
[16]  The death of Christ has abolished all negative things, and the resurrection of Christ has produced the many grains, the many brothers, and the many sons, who are the constituents of the church.
[17]  We care only for the living Christ with the living, real, and practical church life, which is produced and built up by Christ s death and resurrection.
[18]  God s purpose is to have the church, and Christ s death, resurrection, ascension, and indwelling are all for the producing and building up of the church.
[19]  Christ also judged the evil world, and He crucified our old man, our natural life, and our flesh John 12:31; Rom 6:6; Matt 16:24-25; Gal 6:14; 5:24 .
[20]  Because the Body of Christ is constituted with the many sons of God, the genuine church life is simply the totality of the divine sonship.
[21]  The divine sonship is the church life, because every member of the church is a child of God, born anew with God s divine life and nature.
[22]  These verses say, What is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come.
[23]  The surpassing power that God caused to operate in Christ also made Him Head over all things not merely for the church but to the church.
[24]  We may feel that Christ being in the heavens is only for Himself.
[25]  Our position is in the exaltation of Christ, and because we are attached to the exalted Christ, we are far above all the negative things.
[26]  Every preacher speaks of the death of Christ, and many also preach the resurrection of Christ, but it is difficult to find someone who preaches concerning the ascension of Christ.
[27]  The reason we do not function as members of the living Body of Christ is that we are short of the vision of Christ s ascension.
[28]  The crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ, the very Christ in the third heaven, has entered into our being to dwell there.
[29]  Romans 8:34 says that Christ is at the right hand of God, but verse 10 says, Christ is in you.
[30]  Today Christ is both the ascended Christ in the heavens and the indwelling Christ within us.
[31]  The church is produced and built up by the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and indwelling Christ.
[32]  We need to consider all the aspects of Christ s work in the way of experience, not in a mere doctrinal way.
[33]  We need to see how the death of Christ accomplished many things for the producing of the church, how His resurrection brought forth the constituents of the church, and how His ascension brought all the believers into the heavens and furnished, afforded, and equipped every member of the Body of Christ to be able to function.
[34]  First Thessalonians 5:23 says, The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[35]  Our Regenerated Spirit Indwelt by Christ Becoming Our New Person
[36]  Since the divine life has come into our spirit, our spirit is no longer merely an organ.
[37]  Before we were regenerated, our spirit was an organ for our soul, which was our person, but through regeneration our spirit has become our new person.
[38]  The part of our being that is buried with Christ is not our body or our spirit but our soul with our old person.
[39]  Now this Christ has come to indwell our being to be our life Col 3:4 , and by His indwelling He applies to us all that He accomplished through His death, resurrection, and ascension.
[40]  If we see the vision that the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ is dwelling in us, He will be not only the supplying Christ but also the killing Christ to us.
[41]  The New Testament shows us that Christ as the Word of God, who is God Himself, became flesh to be the Lamb of God John 1:1, 14, 29 .
[42]  As the Lamb of God, Christ went to the cross and suffered death in order to accomplish redemption for us.
[43]  Through His resurrection He produced us as His multiplication, as the many grains, the many brothers of Christ, and the sons of God, who are the constituents of Christ s Body 12:24; 20:17; Rom 8:29; Heb 2:11-12; Eph 1:22b-23 .
[44]  The Body of Christ is simply the constitution of Christ in all His members 1 Cor 12:12 .
[45]  Following His resurrection, Christ ascended to the heavens, and in His ascension He positioned us in the heavens and afforded, equipped, and furnished us with whatever we need for our function in the Body Eph 2:6; 4:7-8, 11-12 .
[46]  The crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ has become the indwelling Christ, who is now within us to apply Himself to our being for His work of transformation.
[47]  In this chapter we will consider the crucial transforming work of the indwelling Christ.
[48]  We cannot understand Christ thoroughly, but we do know that He is in us, and we know that He is rich and real to us whenever we say, O Lord Jesus!
