   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE DIVINE DISPENSING IN THE BOOK OF EPHESIANS THE DIVINE TRINITY BEING THE CONSTITUENT OF THE BOOK OF EPHESIANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians is a wonderful book on the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the entire Bible, Ephesians is the only book in which every chapter is structured with the Divine Trinity as its basic element.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, chapter one speaks about the Father's selection and predestination, the Son's redemption, and the Spirit's sealing and pledging.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the basic element of the structure of Ephesians 1.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Divine Trinity in Chapter One for the Accomplishment of God's Economy</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ephesians 1 reveals that the Father selected and predestinated us before the foundation of the world according to His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In time the Son redeemed us for accomplishing what the Father had planned, and after the Son accomplished redemption, the Spirit came to seal us and be a pledge to us for the application of what the Son accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, the Son accomplished all that the Father planned, and after the Son accomplished redemption, the Spirit applies all that the Son has accomplished to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the constitution of chapter one, which is on the accomplishment of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In other words, the accomplishment of God's redemption and salvation depends entirely on the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Divine Trinity in Chapter Two for Leading Us into the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In chapter two the Divine Trinity is not as clearly and distinctly referred to as in chapter one, but in 2:18 the Trinity is implied "For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This shows us that the Father as the source is the One who predestinates and plans.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How do we have access to the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, it is through the Son, who, by accomplishing redemption, became the means by which we have access unto the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second, to have access to the Father we need to be in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we have the means but not the leading, we still cannot reach the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, this verse points out concisely and accurately that we have access unto the Father through the Son, who accomplished redemption, and in the Spirit, who is the sealing and leading; that is, through the Son we have access in one Spirit unto the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a result we, the created, fallen, and redeemed human beings, have been brought together with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, we have been wrought into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE CHURCH THE CORPORATE EXPRESSION OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ephesians chapter one speaks a great deal concerning the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The central thought is that the Triune God has wrought Himself into us through His selection, predestination, redemption, sealing, and pledging.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Chapter two says that through the Son and in the Spirit we have access unto the Father, that is, we enter into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, chapter one reveals that God has come into us, while chapter two tells us that we have entered into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through this coming and going, the Triune God has wrought Himself into us and us into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, we have the economy of God, the dispensing of God, and the union of God with us, resulting in the producing of the Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church is the issue of God's coming into us and our going back to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through this coming and going the church as God's corporate expression is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a fundamental truth in the Lord's recovery: the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit has wrought Himself into us through the Father's predestination, the Son's redemption, and the Spirit's sealing and pledging.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since we were redeemed and have the Triune God in us, through the Son we have access in the Spirit unto the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through this coming and going, the Triune God has entered into us, and we have also entered into Him; the result is that a corporate expression the church, the Body of Christ is produced.</S>
