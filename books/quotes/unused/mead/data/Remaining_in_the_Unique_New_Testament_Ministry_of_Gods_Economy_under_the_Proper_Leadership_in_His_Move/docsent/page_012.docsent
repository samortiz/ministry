   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING RESTRICTED TO ONE PUBLICATION WORK FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF THE LORD S COMMISSION TO HIS RECOVERY Being Restricted in One Publication</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One thing that has caused the Lord s recovery trouble is the fact that we have different publications.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we mean business for the Lord s recovery, we must avoid any kind of involvement in problems.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we were on mainland China, only Brother Nee had a publication, and the Gospel Room belonged solely and uniquely to him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He asked me to help in the publication work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I did write some books, among which were a book on the genealogy of Christ, a translation of part of Pember s Earth s Earliest Ages, and some books on the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I never published anything by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I always mailed my manuscript to the Gospel Room, which was under Brother Nee and his helper.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was up to their discernment whether my manuscript should be published or not.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I liked to have my writings checked as to whether there might be some inaccuracy in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not a small matter to write a book that expounds the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I liked my material to pass through their checking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This helped and protected me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brother Yu, the eye specialist, translated some of the mystical books, but he did not publish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We only had one publication.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everything was published through Brother Nee s Gospel Room because the publication is really the trumpeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The sounding of our trumpet is not just in the verbal message but more in the publication.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I hate to see that some of the brothers would try to publish something by copying my points mixed with their spices and their color.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why do they need to put out some points from my writings in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brother Nee taught us concerning the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I received the basic knowledge from his teaching, but he never expounded on it very much; he simply gave a sketch.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was I who from 1936 began to expound upon the sketch given to me by Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After I published my exposition, Brother Nee admired it and told me personally that it was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I hope that some of you brothers would do much development and expounding of all the messages I give.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not merely speak some points, adding your own color and spices.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This changes the taste.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It damages my messages.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You must receive the ability to expound all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am not narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I would like to see that all of you will be great servants used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How wonderful that would be.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But I do not like to see that some would merely repeat what I have said, pretending that it is their work with their spices and color.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It bothers me that some brothers among us still put out publications.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to my truthful observation there is no new light or life supply there.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They may contain some biblical doctrines, but any point of life or light has been adopted from the publications of Living Stream Ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is nearly no item of life or light that has not been covered by our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Based upon this fact, what is the need for these brothers to put out their publications?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because all the publications are mine, it is hard for me to speak such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But I am forced to tell the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By putting out your own publication, you waste your time and money.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You waste the money given by the saints, and you waste their time in reading what you publish.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Where is the food, the life supply, and the real enlightenment in the other publications among us?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Be assured that there is definitely at least one major revelation in every Living Stream Ministry publication.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I was burdened to publish the Life-study Messages to stress the matter of life because this matter has been neglected, missed, and even lost to the uttermost in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In most of the commentaries and expositions there is not much of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even the term Life-study is a new term.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have used this term for thirty-two years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In 1954 and 1955 I finished a Life-study on the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This does not mean that I am so capable or so knowledgeable.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It all depends upon whether or not our sovereign Lord has given you this portion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even though I wrote some books in mainland China, I never dared to publish anything by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I do not like to have another sounding.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our sounding must be one, so we must be restricted in one publication.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>My intention in calling a writers conference was to encourage you to write something, but not in the way that came out.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This fellowship may preserve and protect us from doing things lawlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If some localities would have gone the proper way of the recovery, using all the materials of the ministry, their number would have increased greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some are wasting their time by writing and publishing their own material.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is not their portion.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I would like to see that many brothers had this portion with the riches of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This would be marvelous and wonderful, but this is our problem today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I advise all of you to take care of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You have to swallow up the dissension.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do not let dissension eat you up.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I hope this fellowship will render some help to all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Take these principles, pray before the Lord, and consider the real situation in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then you can make some adjustment of the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Fulfilling the Lord s Commission</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>to His Recovery</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord s commission is His recovery, and His recovery today is to recover Christ as life, to recover the church as our living, to recover the enjoyment of Christ as everything to us, and to recover all the significances of the church life for the purpose of not only preaching the gospel but also spreading the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I believe that this is the unique reason that He has given us nearly all the truths in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He has given us His truths for us to spread them not only to Christians but even to the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The entire globe is under darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Every human being on the earth needs to hear the truth, but our spreading of the precious truths we have received has been strongly limited.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>There have been many strong testimonies concerning people getting attracted and caught by the notes in the Recovery Version, but who has the burden to go out and spread these truths?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Some brothers who are with us do not use these truths when they teach and preach.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They teach and preach what they feel is good, yet they do not realize how poor their messages are.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Some brothers among us continually put out some publications.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I was honest to tell them that there was no light and nothing new in what they put out.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The points in our publications are full of life and light, but these brothers would not present them as they are.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I could not understand why they have to change the messages we publish to present something in their own style and in their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There are no new points of life or light in what they publish.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Any life or light in their material is altogether adopted from this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I have been observing this situation among us for years.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I would like to see whether some younger brothers among us would be raised up by the Lord to speak something.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If I could see this, I would praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>On the other hand, I have seen some who like to build up something around themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Lord has commissioned us with His recovery, and He has surely opened up the New Testament to reveal many dear and precious truths to us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>What the Lord needs is for thousands of His dear saints who love Him, who live to Him, and who know nothing but His recovery to take one way.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Regardless of whether the saints are from Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, England, Thailand, Indonesia, or the United States, we all bear the same burden, take the same way, and spread the same truths.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We dispense the truths embodied in the gold bar, the Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We have no other merchandise!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we would be like this, the entire earth will be taken!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It breaks my heart to see some practicing to have another ministry, using the material of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We all have to pray, Lord, rescue me from my ambition to be somebody in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We should only know the truths of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We only use one way by one accord, prayer, the Spirit, and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is what I believe the Lord is after, and this is what we all expect in the depths of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Everyone will feel happy about this.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When we go out, we do not go in a dissenting or ambitious way.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If you go out with your ambition to build yourself up and I go out with my ambition to build my ministry up, we are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The Lord has to go to others.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We all need to go out in one way like an army.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Then we will have the morale and the impact.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We do not need to do that much.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We just need to go out with a pure heart, without anything to ourselves but all things to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Just go out with all the truths and the Recovery Version to read to people.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>I assure you that you will catch someone every week.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>You do not need to preach your teaching or your kind of doctrine with your terminology.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We have to see what the Lord s recovery is.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The Lord s recovery has been commissioned with a big enterprise to spread the Lord s truths.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>He has given us the truths which we are holding.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>But we need the faithful, pure-hearted ones, who do not have any intention to live to themselves but to Him, to go out to spread these gold bar truths.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>There is no need for you to preach or teach in your way.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Open up the Recovery Version and read some of the notes with the hungry ones.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Actually, though, I do not care that much for the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>I care for the spreading of the truths so that they can get into the needy hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>If we spread these truths, we will become the faithful servants to serve food to the Lord s people at the appointed time Matt 24:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Then we will fulfill the commission of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This is where my heart is.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>I will die to this.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>I told the brothers in the Far East I will not stop until my entire being is exhausted by this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>I hope you all will say the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>If the Lord can gain ten thousand saints in the United States to go full-time with one kind of teaching, one kind of preaching, one kind of material, one kind of publication, one kind of way, and everything one kind, this will be our morale!</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>The wise way is that we all take the full-time way and speak the same thing, think the same thing, present the same thing, and teach the same thing, having the same essence, appearance and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Then we will have the morale, the impact, to defeat the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>This is what the Lord needs!</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Elders Training, Book 8: The Life-pulse of the Lord s Present Move, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>161-164, 123-127, Witness Lee</S>
