   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REASON THE HOLY SPIRIT INTERRUPTED PETER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Acts 10 shows us the first time the church preached the gospel to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church had been in Jerusalem for about eight or nine years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But the gospel had only reached the region between Samaria and Jerusalem; it had not reached the Gentile places yet.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Jews thought, "We are Christians, but we are also Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To be a Christian is to believe in Christ, to have our sins forgiven, to have God as our righteousness, and to have Jesus Christ as our Savior and Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But at the same time, we are also Jews; we cannot associate with the Gentiles."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the eyes of the Jews, the Gentiles are a filthy and unclean people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But in Christ there is no difference between Gentiles and Jews Eph 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a person wants to be a Jew, he cannot be a Christian believer at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If he wants to a Christian believer, he cannot be a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The believers at that time did not know this; therefore, they brought the Jewish element into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God first showed Peter that it was wrong for Christians to dissociate themselves from the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Peter, however, only went to the Gentile house reluctantly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Peter thought that if he went to a Gentile home, he had already done them a great favor.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He did not know that the Holy Spirit would grant a greater favor to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible says that while Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the word Acts 10:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Up until this time the thought had never occurred to Peter that the Holy Spirit would descend upon the Gentiles just as He descended on the Jews at Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Peter could not go on speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Holy Spirit was showing Peter that the grace God gave to the Gentiles was exactly the same as that which had been given to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Holy Spirit descended on the Jews as well as on the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the salvation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the church there is no difference between Jews and Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How is the church today?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Are there any distinctions between male and female, master and slave, educated and uneducated, rich and poor, Chinese and foreigners?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I thank God that we are neither the Chinese Christian Church nor the Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord says that in the new man there cannot be Greek and Jew, slave and free man, noble and lowly, rich and poor, respectable and despised Col 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the church we are all brothers and we are all members of the Body of Christ Matt 23:8; 1 Cor 12:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Kumming I said to some, "If you have the Chinese you do not have the church; if you have the church you cannot have the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is absolutely no such thing as a Chinese Church."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After the First World War, several British brothers went to Germany.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They were introduced as "British brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Right away they made a correction, saying, "We are not British brothers; we are brothers from Britain."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Several months ago I was holding some meetings in Kaifeng.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many important government officials were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Afterward, a group of people said, "We cannot go to an ordinary church because the people there do not dress well and the preaching is not that sophisticated."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One of the saved officials said, "We should build a big hall and invite a high-class preacher to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then the high-ranking personnel from the party, the administration, and the army can come."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I asked them, "What sign would you hang on the outside of the hall?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While they were considering, I said, "You could hang a sign with the words The Christian Church of the Officials.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They said that they could not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I said, "Why not?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That is what your words suggested."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I then spoke a very frank word to them: "Outside of the church, you are over the common people, among whom I am one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But in the church there is no difference between officials and common people."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is like what we see here today.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All those who are in Christ are brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is no difference in rank or position.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everyone who believes in the Lord receives the same redemption by the precious blood and the same life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If there is the church, there cannot be officials.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If there are officials, there cannot be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our church is not an anti-Western church; neither is it a special establishment for a special class of people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some have asked me whether it is proper to establish a women's church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If there is the church, there are no females.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If there are females, there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There cannot be a women's church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The church is established for all those who are redeemed by the precious blood of Christ and who have received the life of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thank God for interrupting Peter's speaking three times.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Through these interruptions we see what the Christian faith is and what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the Mount of Transfiguration, the Father interrupted Peter's speaking after a few sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Inside the house at Capernaum, Christ interrupted his speaking even before he began.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the house of Cornelius, Peter gave a long message, and then the Holy Spirit interrupted his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>These three interruptions by the Triune God are very much related to the salvation of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The content of the salvation of Christ and the church is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The law and the prophets cannot be brought into the picture.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The salvation of Christ and the church stands on the fact that Jesus the Nazarene is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Son of God is the only foundation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the church of Christ there is no difference among races and ranks.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The church includes all those who are redeemed by the precious blood of Christ and who have received the life of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If any one of these three items is missing, we lose the salvation of Christ and the church of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, God would not listen to man's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God wants man to listen to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God wants man to listen to the speaking of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
