   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE NEED OF ALL THE CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE IDENTICAL The word of the Lord to one church is the word spoken by the Spirit to all the churches Rev 2:1, 7 seven times The solution made at Jerusalem was the decree for all the churches to keep Acts 15:1-2, 13, 19-21, 22-23, 25-31; 16:4-5 The apostle s epistle to the Colossians was charged to be read by the Laodiceans, and the epistle to the Laodiceans to be read by the Colossians Col 4:16 The Gentile churches became imitators of the churches in Judea 1 Thes 2:14a</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The points listed above are not my teaching but the teaching of the Bible in the New Testament, the teaching of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My fellowship with you all is constituted with four things: 1 a lifelong study of the Bible for over sixty-one years; 2 a lifelong study of the biographies of spiritual giants that the Lord has raised up through all the centuries; 3 the history of the church including the raising up and the founders of different denominations, including the Orthodox church, the Catholic church, the Protestant the state churches, private churches and the free groups; 4 my observation of the situation in the Lord s recovery, in which I have been for over fifty-four years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I would eventually like to fellowship four things with you which have been on my heart for a long time: the home gatherings, the full-timers, the truth lessons, and the spreading of the gospel in the unique, harmonious way see Book 8 in this series .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without the fellowship in this book as a base, however, I would not like anyone to take my fellowship concerning these four things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>My fellowship on these matters is based on my fellowship in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I do not want to be imitated by anyone who is not according to this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you do not agree with any point of this fellowship, please stop copying anything I have done and will do in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I want to see the genuine, the proper, the up-to-date, and the most scriptural recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have dedicated my whole life for this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I feel charged by the Lord to make a clear situation in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord s up-to-date recovery has been somewhat polluted by different opinions and practices during the past fifteen years, which we never agreed with from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The only thing we exercised was toleration and patience with much hope and expectation that the ones who practice differently may have some improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are not practicing Brethrenism, to cut off people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That is not our way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We will not cut off anyone, but we have the full right and position to say something about our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you do not want to take one hundred percent of what I practice, please do not copy it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I entered into the recovery and was asked by Brother Nee, the leader in the Lord s recovery, to join the work, I spent much time to consider whether I should enter into the work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually I was clear that it was of the Lord, so I entered into the recovery, and participated in the work for the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From that day until now I have not had any change nor will I have any change.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since I came out of mainland China over thirty-seven years ago, I have never changed my tone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I did not change at all in my teaching, even though I have passed through many trials.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many of you who have been under my ministry for years can testify that nothing has ever changed my attitude, my standing, my practice, my way, and my teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let us all be faithful to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By the Lord s mercy and grace, I have the position to let you know my standing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you feel this is the way, please stay with us honestly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I do not want to see a repetition of degraded Christianity in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I feel very burdened that the Lord must have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I called for elders trainings in 1984 and 1985 in urgency and under much consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I called these gatherings, truthfully speaking, not for all of you but for some of you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In those two elders trainings every message was given for you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I also have called this elders training for certain dear brothers for whom I am greatly concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By your dissenting you may damage your future and damage the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 1959 in Taiwan I warned some dissenting ones that they had the freedom to take their way but that in so doing they would damage their future and be divided endlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whatever I said to them has become history.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They damaged their spiritual future, damaged many others and experienced endless divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We agree that there are only one God, one Spirit, one Lord, one church, one recovery, and one testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If this is the Lord s recovery, it is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Regardless of who we are, if we would not take this way, we have no other way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After those dissenting ones left the recovery, they were wandering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Consider objectively what other way there is for them to take.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Is the church more than one?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Is the testimony of the Lord more than one?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Is God more than one?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Is the Spirit more than one?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Is the Lord more than one?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some left the recovery as gentlemen because they felt they could not take this way and made it clear that they wanted to take another way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are gentlemen.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I respect them and their ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even these dear ones who left the recovery in a gentlemanly way had their spiritual future damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There has been no exception to this over the years.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once a married female has a divorce, her entire human life has been damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some people in America may remarry four or five times, but we know that in the eyes of God and even in the eyes of ethical persons, divorce is not the way of the proper human life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once a female gets married she is committed for her life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If she divorces her husband, her human life is damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is no other way for her to take.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In like manner, if you leave the recovery, no one will curse you, but you will damage the way of your spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You will have no way to go on according to God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In God s ordination, a woman should have only one husband.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord is our husband, and His way is our husband s way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If a woman does not take her husband s way, she complicates the way of her human life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is my word of love, advice, and warning.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the last chapter we saw from the holy Word that all the churches should be one in teaching, practice, thinking, speaking, essence, appearance, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There is no loophole for any argument on these points unless you do not believe the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All the Bible references for these points indicate that this is not my view, teaching, or opinion but simply my quotation from the divine Word.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I want to honor you with my honesty in telling you the truth according to God from His holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Bible is our common ground, and my burden is to present to you the points of the divine Word.</S>
