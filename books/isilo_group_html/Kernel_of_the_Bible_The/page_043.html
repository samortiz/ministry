<h1 class="title">ASPECTS OF WHAT CHRIST IS</h1>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s person is wonderful, profound, and mysterious. His Person has two aspects, the divine aspect and the human aspect. In theology the study of Christ&rsquo;s Person is known as Christology. Since the second century, Christian teachers have argued concerning the Person of Christ. Due to the different teachings and opinions, the argument regarding the Person of Christ has gone on and on, even until today. Therefore, we must be on the alert. If we follow a teaching regarding Christ&rsquo;s Person that is not according to the Bible, we shall be in difficulty. Do not be influenced by any teaching concerning Christ&rsquo;s Person that is not according to the Scriptures.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPOSSIBILITY<br />
OF UNDERSTANDING CHRIST FULLY</h2>
<p>I beg you to come back to the Bible and not try to analyze Christ or to understand Him according to your mentality. We simply cannot understand Him fully. In fact, we cannot even understand ourselves. Can you tell me where your mind is located? Furthermore, do you realize that you have two hearts, a physical heart and a psychological heart? You can locate your physical heart, but can you locate your psychological heart? Where is it? We all should answer, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; If you would know the Bible, you must learn to say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; The Bible reveals that we have a soul. Do you know where your soul is? And what about your spirit? Do you know where it is? We all have a spirit, a soul, a heart, a mind, an emotion, and a will, but we are not able to locate them. In addition to all this, and most mysterious of all, there is the matter of our physical life. Do you understand your physical life? Not even medical doctors know what life is. Thus, how could we expect to understand all there is of Christ when we cannot even understand ourselves?</p>
<p>The matter of eating also illustrates how limited our mind is. Do you know everything about the food you eat? If you did not eat until you adequately understood what you were eating, you would die of starvation. Day after day, we eat our food without trying to analyze it. I am not interested in understanding the food I eat. In my travels throughout the world, I have stayed in homes in many different countries in the Far East, Europe, South America, and the United States. Because my hosts have lovingly taken care of me, they served me the best food. As they served me, they have often attempted to explain the food to me. However, I said to myself, &ldquo;Please, simply serve me the food. Do not try to explain it. There is no room in my mind for all this information. Please stop talking and let me enjoy the meal. Because you love me, I know that you have prepared the best food for me. I am assured that you would never serve something that was bad for me. I prefer to enjoy my food ignorantly.&rdquo; Actually, the more you study, the less you will enjoy. But the less you study, the more food you will enjoy and the better you will digest it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>We may apply this matter in coming to the Bible. It is not sufficient just to study the Bible; we have to eat it. Jeremiah 15:16 says, &ldquo;Thy words were found, and I did eat them.&rdquo; In resisting the temptation of the devil, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God&rdquo; (Matt. 4:4). When you come to the breakfast table, do you study the food or do you eat it? No one would be so foolish as to study it. However, most Christians do not eat the Word of God when they open their Bibles; they merely study it. Too much study without eating may damage you; many have been damaged in this way.</p>
<p>One day I began to read the Gospel of John. I was puzzled by the first phrase, &ldquo;In the beginning,&rdquo; and I began to study it. I asked myself, &ldquo;The beginning? What does this mean? What kind of beginning is this?&rdquo; I stopped eating and began studying. I checked the marginal references, and then I consulted a concordance and a dictionary to find the meaning of the phrase, &ldquo;In the beginning.&rdquo; I simply was not able to understand this. Instead of eating the meat of the chicken, I studied the bones. But it was too much for my teeth to handle. Nevertheless, I went on to study further and to ask more questions concerning what the Word was and how the Word could be both with God and God Himself. It seemed to me that it was not logical to say that the Word both was God and was with God. I wondered if the Word and God were one or two. After many years, the Lord showed me that the way is not to study, but to eat. After having learned this way, I came again to John 1:1 and began to eat it. I prayed with this verse, saying, &ldquo;In the beginning, Amen! In the beginning was the Word. Amen! Oh, the beginning! Oh, the Word! And the Word was with God! Amen! And the Word was God! Hallelujah for the beginning! Hallelujah for the Word! Hallelujah for God!&rdquo; In this way, I had a rich breakfast.</p>
<p>If you are troubled over the matter that the Son is called the everlasting Father, I suggest that you eat Isaiah 9:6. Eat the verse by saying, &ldquo;For unto us! Amen! Oh, unto me, unto you, unto us! A child is born! Amen! Not taught, but born! Hallelujah, a Son is given! Not a teacher, but a Son! And the government shall be upon His shoulder! Amen! And His name! Hallelujah for His name! His name shall be called wonderful! Wonderful! Hallelujah! Oh, His name is counselor! What rich food this is! He is wonderful! He is the counselor! Praise Him, He is the mighty God! A child is the mighty God! His name is called the everlasting Father! Hallelujah, the Son is the Father!&rdquo; After you eat this verse, you will still not understand it fully, but you will be nourished.</p>
<p>Some say that they do not like pray-reading because it is too noisy. If you do not like the noise, exercise your table manners and eat quietly. However, those who take care of their manners usually do not enjoy eating very much. Nevertheless, even when you observe the proper table manners, eating is still superior to studying.</p>
<p>The principle here is not to trust in our limited mentality. The spiritual mysteries are always revealed to our spirit, not to our mind. As you are pray-reading the Word, open your spirit. Do not exercise your mentality&mdash;exercise your spirit. Then the Holy Spirit will shine into you and reveal the depth of the truth into your spirit. In this way, you will receive revelation instead of mere knowledge.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Kernel of the Bible &nbsp; pg 43</div><br></body></html>
