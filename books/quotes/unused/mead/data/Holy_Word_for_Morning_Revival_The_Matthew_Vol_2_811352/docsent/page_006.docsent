   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 6 DAY 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 9:9-13</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>9 And as Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man sitting at the tax office, called Matthew, and He said to him, Follow Me. And he rose and followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>10 And as He was reclining at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and reclined together with Jesus and His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>11 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to His disciples, Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>12 Now when He heard this, He said, Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>13 But go and learn what this means, "I desire mercy and not sacrifice," for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 9:9-17 we come to a very fine, sweet, and intimate portion of the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After the King decreed the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens and after He manifested His authority as the King in many situations, in 9:9-13 we see Him feasting with sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 9:9 we have the calling of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Matthew was also called Levi Mark 2:14; Luke 5:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was a tax collector who became an apostle by God's grace Matt 10:2-3; Acts 1:13, 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was the writer of this Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the record in 9:9 it seems that this was the first time the Lord met Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There must have been some attracting power with the Lord, either in His word or appearance, that caused Matthew to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After being saved, Matthew was so grateful to the Lord that he opened his house and prepared a feast for Him and His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, this section of the Word opens in such a sweet, intimate way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>While the Lord Jesus was enjoying the feast with all the tax collectors and sinners, the Pharisees criticized and condemned Him, and they asked the disciples why their teacher ate with such people v. 11 . This question indicates that the self-righteous Pharisees did not know the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They thought that God deals with man only according to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was a continuation of the rejection of the heavenly King, begun in verse 3, by the leaders of the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 12 we see the Lord's reply to the Pharisees' question: "Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In calling people to follow Him for the kingdom, the King of the heavenly kingdom ministered as a Physician, not as a Judge.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A judge's judgment is according to righteousness, whereas a physician's healing is according to mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those whom He made people of His heavenly kingdom were lepers 8:2-4 , paralytics 8:5-13; 9:2-8 , the fever-ridden 8:14-15 , the demon possessed 8:16, 28-32 , those ill with all kinds of diseases 8:16 , despised tax collectors, and sinners 9:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If He had visited these pitiful people as a Judge, all would have been condemned and rejected, and none would have been qualified, selected, and called to be the people of His heavenly kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, He came to minister as a Physician, to heal, recover, enliven, and save them that they might be reconstituted to be His new and heavenly citizens.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord's word here implies that the self-righteous Pharisees did not realize that they needed Him as a Physician.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They considered themselves strong; hence, blinded by their own self-righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The self-righteous Pharisees were confident they knew all things concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to humble them, the Lord told them to learn more v. 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Mercy is part of the grace that man receives from God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But self-righteous men do not like to receive mercy or grace from God; they prefer to give something to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is contrary to God's way in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Just as God desires to show mercy to pitiful sinners, so He wants us to show mercy in love to others Micah 6:6-8; Mark 12:33 .</S>
