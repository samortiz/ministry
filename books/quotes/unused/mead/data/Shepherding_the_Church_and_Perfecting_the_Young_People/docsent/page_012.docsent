   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Co-workers Not Replacing but Guiding Others</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, today the co-workers are not laboring in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It seems that they pick up all the responsibilities of a local church; hence, they cannot leave that church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In some places the co-workers replace not only the saints but also the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The elders only sign documents; they leave everything else to the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is no wonder that there is no increase in the churches and that the work cannot spread.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A small number of co-workers are doing all the work, and the saints who should have been employed are idle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must change our concept and then change our system.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must not replace others any longer; at most, we should only guide them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the saints are able to take care of things, we should leave the services completely in their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then we can oversee from a distance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way we will produce capable saints who function according to their ability, and every brother and sister will be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then we can delegate a suitable service to every saint according to his function.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some co-workers have worked for three to five years in a place, yet no elders have been raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The co-workers say that there are no qualified brothers in those localities.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is their concept.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must change our concept, and we must change our system.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To change our system does not mean that the co-workers should no longer serve; rather, the co-workers should do more to raise up useful saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then we will have results in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Changing Our Concept and Our System and Focusing on Large Cities</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some brothers have suggested that we take the co-workers out of all the localities, but this will not resolve our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must change our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without changing our concept and our system, we will always labor according to old concepts and old ways; we will replace others instead of leading them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, it is of little avail to remove the co-workers from the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, if our concept and our way of working are changed, even if the co-workers are not removed from the localities, we will have results.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After one year of serving, the number of the saints will double.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There will be no need to send a co-worker to propagate in the towns and villages.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a young co-worker is sent to the towns and villages for one year, at most he will gain fifty people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even though every saint is valuable before God, there is a difference in our function.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The work in the towns and villages will increase the number of local churches, but it will not necessarily increase the number of saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is best for us to labor in large cities and in schools.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A co-worker serving in hall three may gain a thousand new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is not an increase in the number of churches, but it is a large increase in the number of saints, and the capacity of these new saints may be greater than the capacity of new ones gained in the towns and villages.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Taipei is a large city with a large population.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To gain a hundred thousand saints, including twenty thousand students, would be quite substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This would be much more effective than gaining scattered believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Learning to Lead Others and Be Led</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Taipei is a large metropolis with many businesses and numerous universities.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should diligently work here.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For this reason, the co-workers do not necessarily have to be taken out of the churches, but they must change their concept and the way they work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then instead of replacing others, they will lead the saints and will be willing to be led by others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How good this would be!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is very easy to replace others, but it is not so easy to lead others to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all have the tendency of doing things by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Most cooks do not like other people in the kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all have this tendency: once we have a task, we prefer to do it by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the natural way of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It requires skill to be a chief with apprentices.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Eventually, the apprentices should also become chiefs, such that their teacher may even learn from them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The saints whom we perfect to function should surpass us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This requires skill.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the way that we have conducted the work in the States.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Initially, I took the lead, and a few others did the work with me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I was the chief, and they were apprentices.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Gradually, many have become chiefs, and I have become an apprentice.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have learned many things by observing them so that when I lead, the function of the saints can be developed even more.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In 1958 I went to the United States and lived there for an extended period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Initially, I hoped that some co-workers would go there to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, I eventually felt that it was better for none to go there, because they would not perfect the saints, and as a result, the work would not spread.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even the Taiwanese students have had little effect on the campuses there because they were not brought into function here in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is regrettable that the co-workers replaced the saints when they should have been leading them into service.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The co-workers must learn to bring other saints with them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When you observe a particular skill in a saint, you must let him serve, and you must be willing to be led by him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If he makes a mistake, you can provide further guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Only when we let others serve do we bring them into their function.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The slow development of our work has been mainly due to these reasons: we are inadequate in shepherding the saints, in entrusting the saints with the work, and in leading the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We always have only a small number of saints serving.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is wrong for the co-workers to expect the elders to listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Some have made this a requirement for their labor.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When a co-worker goes to a place, he should not only lead but also be led.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In this way all the saints can function.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our concept and our system must change, or else our situation will not improve.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The most important thing is to change our concept and our system.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The co-workers can continue to labor in the localities, but they should not keep everything in their hand; neither should they replace the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They should lead the saints into serving.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Eventually, all things will be in the hands of the saints for the producing of the talents.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the proper way to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A brother said that the Lord prepared many useful saints in Los Angeles, but this is not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The saints in Los Angeles have at most a junior high school education, but the saints in Taipei are mostly graduate students.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, the saints in Taipei have not developed their talents.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I am not joking, and neither am I being sarcastic.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There are many useful saints here, but they are not functioning, because they are not perfected, and most matters are kept in the hands of a small number of co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The co-workers must hand things over to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Then the co-workers can instruct and oversee the saints and let the saints do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In this way, many useful saints will be produced, and they will all participate in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The saints in Los Angeles do not practice the so-called baptismal interview.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In most cases we baptize the new ones immediately, and at least eighty percent of those who are baptized remain.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In contrast, we have baptized at least two thousand people here, but not even a hundred have remained in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Hence, we must thoroughly reconsider our concept and the way we do things.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is not sufficient to merely change our ways.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If we pull the co-workers out of the local churches, the churches will still be weak; moreover, the co-workers will have no place to work.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In large localities, such as Taipei, we still need the co-workers to assist the elders and the responsible ones in the districts for the spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If the co-workers are willing to assist the elders in one accord, two to three thousand new ones will be added in a year or two.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>But if the co-workers go to labor in a small town, they may not gain two thousand new ones, even after laboring for ten years.</S>
