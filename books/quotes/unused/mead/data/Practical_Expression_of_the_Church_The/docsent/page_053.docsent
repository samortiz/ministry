   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>APPLYING THE BLOOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One of the main principles in functioning is that we must never forget to apply the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is the cleansing blood, the prevailing blood, and the victorious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Regardless of how much we deal with sinful and worldly things, we still need the cleansing of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever we are going to function, we must immediately apply the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"Lord, cleanse me once more, regardless of whether I sense I am sinful or not.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Cleanse me with Your precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I praise You that where the sprinkling of the blood is, there is the anointing of the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Look into the type of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With any kind of service rendered to the Lord by the priest, there was always the sprinkling of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every time we come to the meetings, we must come under the application of the cleansing and prevailing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must declare to the whole universe that we are released, not because we are so pure, but because we are cleansed by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can say, "I am fully released, I am powerful and bold in the spirit, not because I am so right, but because I am under the prevailing blood."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do this, we will see that even this declaration is a release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We know the subtle one too well.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He has been our bad friend for years!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many times when you are burdened with something to share in the meeting, Satan comes in to damage.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Just before the meeting, at the dinner table, your dear wife offends you a little, and you say something.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even if you say nothing, you are offended within.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then on the way to the meeting, Satan points out how defeated you are.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He says, "Are you going to share something?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A person like you?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must realize that this is the evil, subtle accusation of the enemy to wreck our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we take it, either we will not share in the meeting or we will share without the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead, we must declare to the enemy Satan that we know his subtlety.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Yes, I am a failure, but praise the Lord, I have the prevailing blood!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not come to the meeting by my victory, but by the blood of Christ!"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This declaration will put Satan to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever we come to the meetings, we must apply the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Satan is so subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is always trying to damage, wreck, and spoil our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>So we need the cleansing of the blood all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>PRAY-READING THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The best way to have our spirits released is to pray-read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is because pray-reading the Word exercises our spirit and does not give us time to use our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The principles of pray-reading are to pray-read the Word in a quick way, with short phrases, praying something new and fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This keeps us from our mind and exercises our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We know that the words of the Bible are living and full of nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we are pray-reading the Word in this way, our spirit becomes nourished, quickened, and refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, by pray-reading the Word, our spirit is exercised and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those of us who have pray-read the Word can all testify that this is the best way to practice the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do not want to force anyone, but we want to help them to release their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to our experience, pray-reading the Word is the best way to release and exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because the function of the church requires a strong spirit, pray-reading the Word is most beneficial.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is the best way to strengthen our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By pray-reading the Word, we can accomplish many things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>With this one stone, we can kill many birds.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>So we do encourage others to pray-read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must practice all these things so that our spirit may be released for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we are going to have a proper and living church life, we must function with the release of our spirit.</S>
