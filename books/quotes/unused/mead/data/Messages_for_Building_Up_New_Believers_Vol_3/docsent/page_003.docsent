   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Four Kinds of Recreation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Next, there are four kinds of recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A Christian can find recreation in four things:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rest</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The best recreation for a Christian is rest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you are tired, you should take a rest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the Lord Jesus and His disciples became tired from their work, He told the disciples, Come by yourselves privately to a deserted place and rest a while Mark 6:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must realize that the Lord s rest was a kind of recreation to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He did not say to go and rest a while, but to go to a deserted place and rest a while.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Often a change in place, a solitary place in the hills or by a river, affords a person the necessary relief from his tiredness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the most common recreation for a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A Change in Work</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a person feels tired after doing the same work for too long, he can do something else after a while.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead of working eight hours at one task, he can spend one or two hours on something else.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps he sits down to work most of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He can give himself a break by working in a standing position once in a while.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps he works with his mind most of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He can divert himself by doing some physical work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As soon as he does this, his tiredness disappears.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are not after the kind of recreation that the world is after.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As long as we have a change in the things we do, we have a means to relieve our fatigue.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can rearrange our lives a little.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The principle of recreation is diversion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As long as we have a change in the kind of work we do, we have the necessary break we need.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hobbies</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the same time, the Christian life has room for some proper hobbies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some brothers like to take photographs.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Others like to keep birds, plant flowers, or paint.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These are legitimate hobbies within the bounds of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some like music; they may write some songs and play them on the piano.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some like calligraphy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All of these are proper forms of recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But no matter what kind of recreation it is, whether it be rest, a change in work, or a hobby, it has to be something that a person can pick up and drop at will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a person cannot drop an activity, something is wrong with it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is all right for a person to take photographs, study them, and learn a little about them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, we are against anything that controls a person s life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The recreation must be easy to pick up and easy to drop.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is all right for a young brother to play the violin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But if he cannot put it down, he has a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The trouble with many young believers is that they cannot put their recreation down.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When they find that they are bound by these things, they have to deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They have to sever them, or else they will not be able to go on properly as Christians; they will be enslaved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Recreation must be something that one can pick up freely and drop freely.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He must not be enslaved by it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is an underlying principle.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must remember that in order for something to be proper recreation, whether it be a hobby, a change in work, or rest, a person must not be bound by it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some young brothers like to collect stamps.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is nothing wrong with stamp-collecting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In fact, there are many benefits to such a hobby.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It can teach a person about the geography and history of all the countries in the world, but it is a problem when one becomes ensnared by it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Any recreation that affords proper diversion without putting one under its bondage is a lawful recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Parents must teach their children to have proper recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They must not drive their children to improper recreation by failing to provide them with the proper kind.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I have seen many strict parents who have ruined their children this way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Their homes are like institutions rather than homes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As a result, the children sneak away from home to engage in improper recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must be clear that children need recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We can go with or without entertainment, but our children must have some entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we deprive them of their right to play, they will be bored and restless at home, and they will sneak away to do things behind our back.</S>
