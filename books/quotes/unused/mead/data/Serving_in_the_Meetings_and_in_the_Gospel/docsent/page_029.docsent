   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE CENTRAL PURPOSE OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: John 3:3, 5-6, 16, 36; Acts 11:18; 13:46, 48; Rom 5:10, 17-18; 6:4; 1 Cor 4:15; Eph 2:5; Titus 3:5; James 1:18; 1 Pet 1:3, 23; 2:2; 1 John 1:1-3; 5:11-13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we contact unbelievers to bring them to Christ and help them to be saved, we must be very clear about the central point of the gospel, God s main purpose in saving people and bringing them to Himself in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have pointed out ten ways to contact people for the gospel, but regardless of which way we take, we must keep the goal in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The way is for the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The ten ways are not the goal; there is only one goal.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The goal of the gospel is life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to bring people to Christ because people need to have the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE CENTRAL POINT</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>OF GOD S SALVATION BEING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the entire Scriptures God s intention is to give Himself to people as life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What we humans need is the life of God, that is, God Himself as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to stress this very much, because in today s Christianity life is mostly neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, the gospel in Christianity is mostly along the line of peace, happiness, eternal blessings, justification, and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is hard to hear a message of the gospel on the central point of God s economy, which is life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We believe that the Lord will recover this matter today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever we bring someone to the Lord, we should help him or her to realize that the central point of God s salvation is life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why does a person need to be justified?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is because justification is for life; without justification we cannot receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why should a person be cleansed?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is because cleansing is for life; without cleansing, the divine life cannot be imparted into a person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why do we need God s redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is because we need life, and it is through redemption that we receive life from God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Neither justification, redemption, cleansing, holiness, nor sanctification is the goal; they are the process for the goal, which is life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Life is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not something merely in time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is of eternity because from eternity and for eternity God s intention is to impart Himself as life into man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After God s creation of man, God put man in front of the tree of life with the intention that man would receive Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to receive food day by day, whether or not we have been dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even if we never become dirty, we still have to receive food.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the same way, even if man had never fallen, he was still made as a vessel to receive God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the central intention of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christianity today, however, neglects the central aim and intention of God and pays its full attention to the mending aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Justification and redemption are the mending aspect; they are not the original intention of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am stressing this because from now on the gospel preaching of the church must be in a way that is different from the way of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The way of our preaching must be the recovery of the ancient way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God created man with the intention to put Himself into man as life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then man became fallen, and God came in to bring him back.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this bringing back, God did something to cleanse, redeem, and justify man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He even separated man because man had fallen into the world of Satan, into the devil s system.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This separation is sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, cleansing, redemption, justification, and sanctification are not the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The goal is life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Cleansing, redemption, justification, and sanctification are all for life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If man had never fallen, there would have been no need for cleansing, redemption, justification, and sanctification, but there would still have been the need for life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may illustrate God s intention with a soft drink bottle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The purpose of a soft drink bottle is to receive the soft drink and be filled with it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before the bottle is filled, however, a naughty boy may dirty and damage the bottle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now the owner has to recover it, clean it, and separate it from the trash.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, the recovering, cleaning, and separating are not the aim; they are merely the process.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After the bottle is recovered, there is still the need to fill it with the soft drink.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The aim and goal are to fill the bottle.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the gospel of God, the central matter is that man has to receive Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Man needs to have life through Christ, in Christ, and by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, we may have been impressed, even indoctrinated, by our background of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because of this, whenever we speak about the gospel, we forget about life and pay too much attention to justification, redemption, and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even worse, we may pay our attention to bringing people to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Going to heaven is the worst concept.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I cannot find a verse in the New Testament that tells us that the gospel is for people to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I challenge you to tell me which of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, and which chapter and verse, tell us that the gospel is for bringing people to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Let us forget about this background and come back to the New Testament to see the central point of the gospel.</S>
