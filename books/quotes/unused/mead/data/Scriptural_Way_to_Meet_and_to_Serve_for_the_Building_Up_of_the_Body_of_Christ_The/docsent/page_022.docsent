   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHANGES NEEDED IN TAKING THE SCRIPTURAL WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since the scriptural way to meet and to serve is opposite to the traditional way in which we have been for quite some time, to take the scriptural way we need to have some changes in our meeting and service.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Changing the Way of Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Consider what our situation would be if we all had a proper daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Early in the morning after rising, we should call on the name of the Lord and feed on two or three verses, not only reading and pray-reading them but dwelling upon them to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then throughout the whole day we should continually abide in the Lord, live the Lord, and walk and move according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever we meet anyone, we should speak the Lord to them through His Word, in season and out of season.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This practice will cause something to be continually accumulated within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We will become rich with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, we should let the word of Christ dwell in us richly, making its home in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If this is our living, then surely we will desire to meet, either with our family, our neighbors, in a small group meeting, or in a bigger meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It will be so easy for each one of us to spontaneously release something of Christ in any kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Everyone, young or old, the least or the greatest, brother or sister, will have something to say.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If this is the condition of our meetings, they will be filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They will be living, rich, uplifting, refreshing, enlivening, and releasing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This will change our meeting from the traditional way to the scriptural way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, it is not difficult to have such a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But even such an easy matter needs to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Changing our way of meeting may be compared to changing to a new language.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To speak is not difficult, but if we did not practice speaking from the first year of our life, waiting instead until we were fully grown, it would be very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After one is grown, for him to change to a new language is very hard.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For years all the saints have been speaking our old language.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we are changing to a new language, and many do not know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have the deep feeling that we must teach our brothers and sisters in the same way that a mother teaches her baby to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The saints among us have been in a certain practice, a habit, a custom, for years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we suddenly changed our ways, they could not endure it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The habit, the custom, we have practiced for so long has become a special taste to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we take away that for which we have a taste, some will not feel good about our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You must understand and care for the situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not neglect the needs of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You must be clear about this, and you must steadily take the scriptural way and endeavor to accomplish something.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the same time, do not neglect any needs or offend anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is not easy, but I know that it can be worked out.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the one hand, we endeavor to do everything we can to carry out what we have been charged to do, and on the other hand, we must do our best to take care of every fine point in our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then the Lord will have a free way to go on within a short period of time to build up a new habit in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Preaching the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>by Visiting People in Their Homes</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To take the scriptural way to meet and to serve, there is also the need to change our preaching of the gospel by taking up the way of visiting people in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From the beginning I had no intention to ask all the attendants in the meetings to go out to preach the gospel by visiting people in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I only expected that one-fourth of the meeting brothers and sisters would do this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If there are one hundred saints meeting together, it would be adequate for twenty-five to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This will bring in fifty or one hundred percent increase yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I heard that in some places, those who were hot in the matter of door-knocking encouraged everyone to go out in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not need to push this way, but we must endeavor to carry it out in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I believe that the Lord s mercy and His grace are with us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As we are endeavoring to carry this out, He will do something to get twenty-five percent of the man-power of the saints to pick up the burden to visit people by knocking on their doors and to make door-knocking a habit built up in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the past, we did not have such a habit built up in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, we did not have the adequate way to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After much study of the Bible, of church history, and of biographies, we have concluded that there is no other way for the gospel to be so prevailing, so effective, and so thorough as with door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the past year, I have received many letters giving reports concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They are very encouraging and exciting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One month ago, a cable came from Liberia, Africa, telling me that eighteen saints went out to knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After about twelve hours, they knocked on over two hundred doors and baptized one hundred forty-six people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Something similar happened in Ghana, Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A brother who went back to that country reported that not only was the door-knocking effective, but also the church meetings were very good.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many reports have said the same thing: wherever there was the practice of door-knocking, there was a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>One brother who had been in the church for over thirty years was formerly so silent and cold.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, recently he became excited and shouted that he was happy, not only because sinners were saved, but also because the saints had been revived.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many others have testified in a similar way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Favorable letters have come to me from every continent.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In Taipei, after only three terms of training of four months each, we have baptized thirty-eight thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Because we did not have enough workers to care for each one of them, we were only able to care for about six thousand of these new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Out of this number we now have over three thousand meeting together at least once a week, and over two thousand others meeting occasionally.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In such a short period of time, we gained six thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the summer training of 1987, we went out in Orange County to knock on people s doors.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The trainees baptized about thirty-seven hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Gradually, these newly baptized ones brought in another eight hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Out of this forty-five hundred, over seven hundred regularly meet once or more a week, and over another seven hundred meet occasionally.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In September of 1987, the Chinese-speaking saints were burdened to have a gospel festival in the San Gabriel Valley in California.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Through that festival, a little over one thousand new ones were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Out of this number, two hundred are regularly meeting with us now.</S>
