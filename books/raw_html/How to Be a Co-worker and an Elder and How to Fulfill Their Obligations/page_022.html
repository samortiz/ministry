<P>In 2 Timothy Paul also charged Timothy to cut straight the word of the truth (2:15), which means to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion, as a carpenter cutting wood perfectly straight without any crookedness. Today some Bible interpreters cut the word of Scripture crookedly. This is also an indication of the degradation of the church. For example, the Bible speaks of the spirit and the soul of man as two distinct parts (1Thes. 5:23; Heb. 4:12), yet some people distortedly say that the spirit and the soul are identical. Another example is that the Bible says that Christ became the Spirit in His resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45b), yet some insist to say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are separate Persons and therefore Christ is not the Spirit. This is not to cut straight the word of the truth.</P><P>Paul also said to "pursue...with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart" (2 Tim. 2:22). Not having a pure heart and not calling on the Lord also indicate the degradation of the church.</P><P>Finally, Paul said, "The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you" (4:22). If we do not experience the Lord's being with our spirit and therefore lose the presence of grace, that is the degradation of the church. We need to be careful about this. Our highest enjoyment and experience is that our Lord is with our spirit. The Lord, who is the Creator of heaven and earth, the sovereign Lord of all, is with our spirit. This is a tremendous thing. The Lord's being with us is not in our mind or our thoughts; He as the Spirit is with our spirit. Over thirty years ago I came to the United States with a specific burden, that is, to speak concerning the two spirits, the divine Spirit and our human spirit. In those days many American saints said that they never knew that man has a spirit. Thank God, we have been fighting here for thirty-four years, and now it is more common for Christians to refer to the human spirit. Recently, the Lord also has shown us that the secret of experiencing God's organic salvation lies in "the Spirit with our spirit" (Rom. 8:16). Today, Christ is the Spirit, and if we want to experience and enjoy Him, we must be in our spirit. I can testify that, according to my age, without the Spirit's being with my spirit, I could not bear the burden of the Lord's recovery and the churches. Some have advised me not to have so many activities, but I thank and praise the Lord that it is the Lord as the Spirit with me who enables me to have such activities. As soon as I rise from my bed, I say, "O Lord, I rise with You." The moment I touch the floor, I say, "O Lord, not only do I walk by You, but I walk with You. You are holding me while I am walking." If the Lord were not the Spirit but were far away in heaven, what would He have to do with me? Thank the Lord, today the Lord is the Spirit, and we can enjoy Him in the spirit. This is an exceedingly great blessing. To enjoy the Lord's Spirit being in our spirit is to have grace with us. When this is lost, the degradation of the church is present.</P>
