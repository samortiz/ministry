   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH IN GOD'S PLAN WITHOUT SIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we read Ephesians 5:25, we find the same meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this passage we need to notice three points:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, Christ gave Himself up for us because we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 5, which speaks of Christ dying for sinners, is in reference to redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ephesians 5, however, does not deal with the problem of sinners but with the issue of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The context of Ephesians 5 is not that Christ came to die for us because we were sinners, but that He gave Himself up for us because we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second, Christ gave Himself for us because He loves us, not because we have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to 1 Corinthians 15, Christ died for our sins, but Ephesians 5 says that Christ loved the church and gave Himself for it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He gave Himself because of love, not because of our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To die for sin is one thing, but to die for love is entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To die for sin deals with the problem of sin this is redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But Christ's giving Himself for us is a matter of love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sin is not involved in Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This aspect of His death is related to love and has nothing to do with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Third, Christ gave Himself for us in order to give Himself to us, without any question of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This verse may be translated, "Christ also loved the church and gave Himself to the church."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Adam imparted his bone to Eve; Christ has imparted Himself to us as well.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have Him within us because He died; He has already entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because He died, we now have His very life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He Himself has been imparted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us consider this for a moment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Is this not wonderful?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From God's point of view, the church has never sinned and has never been related to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is true that God knew that man fell and needed to be redeemed, but marvelously, along another line, He did not see sin at all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, there is a portion in us which has no need of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the portion which we have received from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It does not need to be redeemed because it transcends sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We obtained this portion, of course, after we were redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This portion is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Scriptures reveal how God has used many women to typify the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Genesis contains, in addition to the story of Eve, the story of Rebecca and Asenath.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rebecca's marriage to Isaac typifies the church being offered to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Asenath's marriage to Joseph and her bearing sons in Egypt typifies the church being chosen out of the world unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Exodus speaks of Zipporah being married to Moses in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This typifies the church in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Joshua speaks of Achsah, who after being married, asked for the upper springs and the lower springs.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This typifies the church receiving the inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ruth's marriage to Boaz typifies the redemption of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Abigail's marriage to David typifies the church enlisted as an army for warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Old Testament speaks of many women who typified the various aspects of the church; the church was chosen from the world, redeemed, taken through the wilderness, enlisted for warfare, given the inheritance, and offered to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All of these types in the Scriptures refer to the church, but of them all, the type in Genesis 2 is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no other type similar to it because Eve portrays the church as it really is in God's mind and the place it has in His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All the other types occur after man's fall; only the type of Eve precedes the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the other types involve the matter of moral responsibility; this one alone is free of it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Eve that God made came out of Adam, not out of a redeemed sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She was made before sin occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In like manner, the church comes out of Christ; it is not a matter of sinners receiving grace and being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eve came out of Adam and was wholly for Adam; even so, the church comes out of Christ and is wholly for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may consider that the church is composed of many people who have been saved people like Ruth Ruth was totally involved in sin, and Boaz came to redeem her.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But this is not the picture of the church which Genesis 2 gives to us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By the time of Ruth sin had already entered, but in Genesis 2 there was no problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the church which was in the beginning; it had no association with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Oh, this is a tremendous matter, and these are very meaningful words.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The church in God's forethought has no history of sin!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When people inquire concerning the history of our salvation, we always start with the fall, that is, how we committed sin and wandered in sin, how we were so evil and bad, and how we heard the gospel, believed on the Lord Jesus, and were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We always start with the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But in God's eyes, the church has never been touched by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The church is the part out of Christ which has never been touched by sin and known sin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>That which is completely without sin is called Eve, and that which is wholly out of Christ is called the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>That which is entirely from Christ and will be solely for Christ is Eve, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Eve typifies a corporate man made by God the church that is wholly of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The church is not a composition of human beings from every nation, race, and people.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Only that which comes out of Christ can be called the church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is not that many people believe in Jesus and become the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The church is the portion which is out of Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must see that the church is the vessel chosen by God to manifest His Son, Christ, and to achieve His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It has nothing to do with sin and has never touched sin.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must have our thoughts renewed and enter into the matter which God considers the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Many of God's children refer everything to the problem of sin and being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They are always thinking about how they were so sinful and how they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It seems that we are always looking from the perspective of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This matter is always with us, but God intends to turn our thinking completely around.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He wants us to have an entirely new view of the church; He wants us to see that she is not related to sin at all.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>From beginning to end, the church is out of God and for God and has never touched sin.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There is a portion in us which is out of Christ and which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This portion has never been and never can be related to sin; sin has no way to come into contact with it.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We can truly say that there is something in us which is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Oh, may we all enter into God's view of the church!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>From His viewpoint it appears that He has canceled all history of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When we give our praises to Him in eternity, it will not be necessary for us to mention what kind of sinners we have been.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God desires to bring us to a stage that all of the history succeeding Genesis 3 will pass away and only that which is of Christ will be brought to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is God's eternal purpose!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God desires to obtain a church, a corporate man, in whom everything is out of Christ and for Christ, a church in which there is no history of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Let us turn back to Genesis 2:18.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>"And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The creation of Eve was for the satisfaction of God's heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Because He had such a desire, He performed it.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We must note that the creation of Eve is recorded in Genesis 2, before the events in Genesis 3 came to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>There was no problem of moral responsibility between God and man because sin had not yet entered.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Man had no problem with God; therefore, all the events recorded in Genesis 2 were for the purpose of meeting the needs of God Himself, not to deal with the shortcomings of man.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>God's creation of Eve in Genesis 2 shows how God purposed to have His church from eternity to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The first thing in the sight of God was not man's fall but the plan which He purposed in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>God's plan in eternity was for man to exercise His authority and spoil all the work of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is God's purpose for the church, and it will all be fulfilled in the coming eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>God is after such a church to satisfy His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>After He made male and female, He entered into rest.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>God was satisfied because He obtained such a church.</S>
