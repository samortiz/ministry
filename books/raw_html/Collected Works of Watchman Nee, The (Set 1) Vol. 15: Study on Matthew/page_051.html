<P>The parable of the treasure. Since the Lord did not explain the treasure, we can find the explanation from other portions of the Scriptures. The treasures (or, storehouses) mentioned in 1 Chronicles 27:25 represent the glory of the kingdom of David. The treasure mentioned in Ecclesiastes represents the riches of the kingdom of Solomon. The glory of a kingdom lies in its treasures. Even during the period of theocracy (from Moses to the judges before Saul), the treasures also represented glory. When a kingdom is strong, the treasures are protected. But when a kingdom is weak, the treasures are captured. The field signifies the world. Why is the treasure hidden in the field? The glory of the kingdom of God has never been revealed on the earth. Furthermore, after the captivity of the Jews, God became the God of heaven. Man has not seen God's ruling of the universe. Even before the captivity, the glory of God's kingdom was hidden to men, with a few exceptions. From before the age of Moses, the kingdom of the heavens was always hidden until John the Baptist, who began to preach that the kingdom of the heavens was near. How long was the kingdom of the heavens hidden? From the creation of the world to the time of John (Matt. 13:35; 25:34). Who hid the glory of the kingdom of the heavens? God did (Prov. 25:2; Rom. 11:33—"depth" means "hiddenness").</P><P>Continuing the thought in the preceding section, the field is the world; otherwise, the Lord would have given another explanation. By this we know that the kingdom of the heavens will be related to the world. The kingdom of the heavens will appear on the earth (Zech. 14:5, 9; Psa. 8—a psalm of the kingdom, where verses 7-9 mention the whole earth). Its realm will be on the earth, but the part of the Lord's governing will be in the heavens, and the world will be destroyed after the kingdom. "Which a man found" refers to what the Lord did on the earth. When the world was in a time of confusion, there was a man crying in the wilderness, "The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near." The Lord also preached this message. Moreover, the teachings of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 5—7) and the power of the kingdom of the heavens (such as healing and miracles) all have been manifested. (Verse 44 does not imply the thought of seeking; it is merely a discovering.) The Lord discovered first; no other person discovered before Him. The "man" refers to Christ. The angels and the prophets could not reveal it (cf. Heb. 2:5-8). Afterward, the Lord hid it. The first half of this verse the Lord spoke in the past tense; from this point on, He used the present tense. From this we know that "hidden" and "found" were accomplished facts. But "hid" here and "sells" and "buys" in the last half of this verse are things to be carried out at the time of the Lord's speaking. Why was it hidden again? It is because of the Jews' rejection. From the middle of chapter eleven they began to reject, and in chapter twelve they carried out the rejection (see Matt. 11:20, 25). Therefore, the treasure is hidden. According to 13:41-44, this thing is now hidden. Afterward the Lord did not perform many miracles. (When He did, He did it for individuals.) The Lord Himself was also hidden (cf. John 8:59; 12:36; Luke 4:30). Why was He hidden? It was because something went wrong (that is, the Jews rejected Him) and because there was danger (Jer. 41:8); the children of Israel had evil intentions. The Lord hides Himself from the entire nation of the Jews, not from the individuals or disciples. The Lord forsook the entire nation of the Jews, yet He did not forsake individuals.</P><P>The Lord rejoices for the glory of the kingdom. (We may refer to Luke 10:17-18 and 21, the only place that records the Lord's rejoicing. The disciples went to preach the gospel and the power of the kingdom of the heavens; they rejoiced because the power of Hades was being cast into the bottomless pit—cf. Matt. 25:21, 23; Heb. 12:2). "In his joy goes" indicates that the Lord went to the cross in Jerusalem. This going is different from the going in verse 46. There it is to go out, to depart; here it is to go back, as in Matthew 5:24; 8:13; 9:6; 19:21; Mark 2:11; 6:38; 7:29; 10:21; John 3:8; 4:16; 6:21; 7:3. This proves that the place where the treasure is found is not in the house but in the field, that is, in the world. Therefore, He had to return to sell all that He had. This means that He had to pay the price and give up Himself. When the Lord came to the earth, He had forsaken a great part of His possessions (though not all), and on the cross He gave up even His life (see Acts 20:28; 2 Pet. 2:1; Rev. 5:9). The purpose of buying is for obtaining the treasure hidden in the field. However, the realm is the world (2 Pet. 2:1). Therefore, the unsaved also are bought. The Lord as the sin offering is for the believers; He is even the propitiation for the sins of the whole world (1 John 2:2). God has great expectations for the earth; therefore, He bought it. The kingdom in the future will be related to the earth—the kingdom will be on the earth (Rev. 11:15; Matt. 6:10) and the Lord's heart is also on the earth (Matt. 6:21). Hence, the Lord will come back to the earth to establish the kingdom of the heavens. In the Bible, when buying and selling are mentioned, sometimes neither the seller nor the cost is mentioned. The spiritual meaning cannot be too material.</P><P>Verses 45-46:Bible expositors have explained the parable of the pearl in the following ways. The first kind of interpretation, which began from the time of Luther and continues to this day, maintains that the pearl refers to Christ and the man represents the believers. But how can the believers buy Christ? Christ is the only Savior. How could He become a pearl of great value among the fine pearls? The second kind of interpretation is that the pearl refers to the choicest parts of the church, which are scattered among the churches. Men would forsake everything to seek for them in the churches. However, men do not need to sell all that they have in order to seek the truth. Both the rich and the poor can seek the truth. The third interpretation, which was given a hundred years ago, is that the pearl refers to the righteousness of God. The fourth interpretation is that the pearl refers to the church. This is partially correct, for the pearl does not refer to the substance of the church but to the parts of the church. Otherwise, the pearl and the church cannot be linked together.</P>
