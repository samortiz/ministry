   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>14.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not a New Convert</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 6 says, "Not a new convert, lest being blinded with pride he fall into the judgment of the Devil."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Greek word rendered blinded literally means beclouded with smoke.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Pride here is likened to smoke that beclouds the mind, making it blind, besotted with the self-conceit of pride.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One who is blinded with pride may fall into the judgment of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This judgment refers to that to which Satan was sentenced due to his pride in his high position Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>28:13-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Devil was judged because of his rebellion which came from pride.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Devil was proud, blind, and rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this, he received God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>15.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Having a Good Testimony from Those Outside</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 7 Paul concludes, "And he also must have a good testimony from those outside, that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the Devil."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>An elder must be right with himself, with his family, with the church, and with those outside the society.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And, according to the context, an elder must be right in intention, in motive, in character, in attitude, in words, and in deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To fall into the judgment of the Devil is due to the pride of the elder himself; to fall into the snare of the Devil is occasioned by the reproach of outsiders.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>An elder should be alert not to be proud on the one hand, and not to be reproachable on the other, that he may avoid the Devil's entanglement.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>DEACONS A. Qualifications of a Deacon</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In verse 8 Paul says, "Deacons must similarly be grave, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not seeking gain by base means."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Deacons are serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The overseers take care of the church; the deacons serve the church under the direction of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These are the only two offices in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Grave</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Deacons are to be grave.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This virtue inspires and invites honor and respect.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A person who is grave is neither loose nor light.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Not Double-tongued</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A serpent is double-tongued.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A deacon in a local church rendering service to all the saints may easily be double-tongued in contacting them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In that case, he practices the nature of the Devil and brings death into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today we often use the expression two-faced instead of double-tongued.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A two-faced person is hypocritical.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He may speak one way to a brother in his presence and another way about the brother in his absence.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Deacons should be neither double-tongued nor two-faced.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you do not have the Lord's leading to speak frankly to a brother about his situation, simply be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not say anything to please him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, you should not speak negatively about him behind his back.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The deacons should fulfill their duty without talking too much.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, there is a great temptation to talk excessively.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In their contact with the elders, the deacons may acquire information about certain matters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is tempting to pass on this information.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When a deacon behaves in this way, he becomes the information center of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The deacons should not be informers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Restricting the circulation of needless information will kill the germs of death in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Not Addicted to Much Wine</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Deacons should not be addicted to much wine.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Being addicted to much wine is a sign of being unable to control oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A deacon in the service of a local church must exercise self-control in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Not Seeking Gain by Base Means</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A deacon also should not seek gain by base means.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He should not seek gain from rendering service to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is seeking gain by base means see 6:5b .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A deacon, therefore, should not be fond of money.</S>
