   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Titus 3:7b says that the believers are "heirs according to the hope of eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this verse we see that the believers are not only sons but also heirs who are qualified to inherit the Father's estate Rom 4:14; 8:17; Gal 3:29; 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We were born of God John 1:12-13 with His eternal life John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This eternal life is for us not only to live and enjoy God in this age, but also to inherit all the riches of what He is to us in the coming age and in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Moreover, eternal life implies hope.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With temporal life there is no true hope, but with eternal life there is hope.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because eternal life is forever and cannot be terminated, it gives us hope.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, there is the hope of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's eternal life is our enjoyment today and our hope tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to realize that our being heirs is according to the hope of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eternal life is the divine life, the uncreated life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not only everlasting, lasting forever, with respect to time, but in its nature it is also eternal and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The eternal life of God is given to all believers in Christ 1 Tim 1:16 and is the main element of the divine grace given to us Rom 5:17, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This life has conquered death Acts 2:24 and will swallow up death 2 Cor 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eternal life and its consequent incorruption have been brought to light and made visible to men through the preaching of the gospel 2 Tim 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, eternal life is not only for us to partake of and enjoy today, but also for us to inherit Matt 19:29 in its full extent for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today's experience of eternal life qualifies us to inherit it in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Its enjoyment today is a foretaste; the full taste will be the inheritance of it in the coming age and in eternity, which is the hope of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the blessed hope revealed in Titus 2:13, which is composed of the freedom of the glory of full sonship, the redemption of our body Rom 8:21-25 , the salvation to be revealed in the last time 1 Pet 1:5 , and the living hope of the incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading inheritance reserved in heaven 1 Pet 1:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the full, spiritual, divine, and heavenly blessing and enjoyment of eternal life, both in the millennium and in the new heaven and new earth 2 Pet 1:11; 3:13; Rev 21:6-7 , referred to in 1 Tim 4:8.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to this hope, we become heirs of God to inherit all His riches for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the climax as the eternal goal of God's eternal salvation with His eternal life given to us by grace in Christ. d.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through Justification by the Grace of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The believers are heirs of God through justification by the grace of Christ Titus 3:7a .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be justified Rom 3:24; Gal 2:16 is to be approved by God according to His standard of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God can approve us in this way because our justification is based on the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Redemption is the basis of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the redemption of Christ is applied to us, we are justified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Titus 3:7a tells us that we are justified by the grace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The grace of Christ is not merely His unmerited favor.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The grace of Christ is actually Christ Himself as life and everything dispensed into us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This grace is the transmission of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This grace plays the most important role in the economy of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we received the grace of Christ, we were justified to become heirs of God. e. Through Regeneration in the Resurrection of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The believers have become heirs of God through regeneration in the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead" 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Regeneration, like redemption and justification, is an aspect of God's full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Redemption and justification solve our problem with God and reconcile us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Regeneration enlivens us with God's life and brings us into a relationship of life, an organic union, with God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, regeneration issues and results in a living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such regeneration takes place through the resurrection of Christ from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When Christ was resurrected, we, His believers, were all included in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, we were resurrected with Him Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In His resurrection He imparted the divine life into us and made us the same as He is in life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the basic factor of our regeneration to become heirs of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be regenerated is to receive another life, the divine life, in addition to the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We all received the human life from our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But because of God's choosing, the Spirit's sanctifying, and Christ's redeeming 1 Pet 1:2 , God begets us, regenerates us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As a result, we have a second birth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Through regeneration God the Father imparts the divine life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, the first birth was the birth of our human life, and the second birth, the birth of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We all have been born of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is what it means to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once a person has been born on earth, he has the right to enjoy an earthly inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the same principle, once a person has been born again by God with His Spirit, that one is born unto a living hope, and this living hope is the inheritance 1 Pet 1:4 of all the spiritual and heavenly blessings related to eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Daily we need to take possession of this inheritance and enjoy it.</S>
