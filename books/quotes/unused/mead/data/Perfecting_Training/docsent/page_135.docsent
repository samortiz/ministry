   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HISTORY OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why then in Romans 8:3-9 does Paul use the word flesh, but when he comes to verse 10, change the expression from flesh to the body?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is because in verse 10 Paul intends to imply the history of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Just to say the flesh is dead does not imply a history, but to say the body is dead implies a kind of history.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In like manner you would not say that the flesh is fallen, but you have to say that the body is fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To say that the body is fallen implies a history of the fall of man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There was a story of the fall of man, and this fall of man mainly happened to his body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the body s history.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So when Paul says the body is dead, he implies a history.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fall of man is a history of a corrupted body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE HISTORY OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now we come to the matter of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first thing that we have seen concerning the spirit is that it is our human spirit, not the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some would say that our spirit and our soul are the same thing, that they are synonymous terms.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even some versions of the Bible, including the King James Version, capitalize the S in spirit in verse 10, indicating that it refers to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But we have to see that this is altogether not logical.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How could the Holy Spirit be contrasted with our body?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to be very careful in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible was not so easily written; neither would it be so easy for us to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you were to change the word body to flesh and read the verse in this way: And if Christ is in you, though the flesh is dead because of sin, yet the Spirit is life because of righteousness, it might be okay.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To have a contrast between the Holy Spirit and our flesh is okay.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such a contrast can be seen in Galatians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In that chapter there is a contrast between the works of the flesh and the fruit of the Spirit, meaning the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But in Romans 8:10, it is not a contrast between God the Spirit and our body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Number two, you cannot say, If Christ is in you, the Spirit of God is life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit of God is life under any kind of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whether Christ is here or Christ is not here, the Spirit of God is life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But here Christ in you is a condition of whether or not the spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This must refer to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Number three, how could righteousness be applied to the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To say that the body is dead because of sin is okay.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But you should not say that the Holy Spirit is life because of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It must be that our spirit is life because of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to these points, you can see that the King James Version of the Bible is wrong in its translation of Romans 8:10.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Of course, according to the letters it is hard to decide whether the Spirit should be our spirit or the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The same Greek word, pneuma, may refer either to our spirit or to the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It all depends upon the context.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even as the phrase, the body is dead implies a history, so the phrase, the spirit is life also implies a history.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You have to realize that before you got saved your spirit was not life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Your spirit was dead or dormant or at least sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For sure your spirit by that time was not life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But then when you got saved not only did it become living, but it also became life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It became life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When Christ comes in, our spirit becomes life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The coming in of Christ is a condition to our spirit being life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Without Christ in our spirit, our spirit is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But with Christ in our spirit, our spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is conditional.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This condition has been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ is here.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Don t you have the assurance to say that Christ is in you?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I cannot deny that Christ is in me!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many times I tested and examined and searched this matter out, but the more I researched, the more Christ was in me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even we have to say that Christ is not in us just in an emotional way but factually and scientifically.</S>
