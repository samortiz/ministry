   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous message, we saw five aspects of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we want to go further to see eleven more aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever we speak concerning the Spirit, this involves the study of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In studying the divine Trinity, I would recommend chapters seven and eight of Elders Training Book3,The Way to Carry Out the Vision.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are two main points in the study of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One point refers to the one God, and the other point refers to the Three of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word triune means three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the one hand, God is one yet three.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the other hand, God is three yet one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may say that God is three in person but one in essence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the last message, we talked about the words element, substance, nature, and essence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Another word used in relation to the Trinity is hypostasis.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This anglicized Greek word is actually composed of two Greek words hupo meaning under or below and stasis meaning substantial support.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This word refers to the three substances of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the three hypostases, or substances, of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A Latin word used to equal hypostasis in the theological study of the Trinity was the word persona.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Persona is where we get the English word person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the study of the divine Trinity, Bible teachers say that God is three persons in one essence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Regarding the Three of the Triune God, theologians have used the Greek word hypostasis, the Latin word persona, and the English word person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These words refer to God being three.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Triune God is also one in essence.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Greek word ousia refers to the essence of the substance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A table made of wood has wood as its substance, and within this substance is the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Latin word for essence is essentia.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Triune God is three hypostases in one ousia.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is three persons in one essence.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The persons should not be confused, and the essence should not be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Three are one in essence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why we can say that when the Son comes, the Father comes, and when the Son and the Father are here, the Spirit is also here.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since one is here, all of the Three are here because in essence, They are one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to be careful, however, when we use the word person to describe the Three of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>W. Griffith Thomas, the founder of Dallas Theological Seminary, indicated that we may borrow a word like person to define the Trinity because our human language is inadequate, but if we press the term person too far, it will lead to tritheism.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is safer to say that God has three substances but only one essence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I hope that this discussion of these terms will help us in our understanding of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now we want to fellowship concerning more aspects of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>CHRIST BECOMING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>IN HIS RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to 1 Corinthians 15:45 the Spirit is the life-giving Spirit, and Christ became this life-giving Spirit in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The life-giving Spirit has the ability to give us life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Spirit is moving, working, and living in us to impart life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The life-giving Spirit is now working and moving in the being of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Spirit is the life-imparting Spirit, working to give life to our whole being.</S>
