In addition to all the above items, John, in his last writing, Revelation, tells us that even in the warfare for the kingdom of God, Christ is the Word of God speaking for God's purpose (Rev. 19:13).</P>	</ol></ol><P>I hope that we can all be brought into the reality of the outline for this message. By reading the outline, we can see that the revelation presented is new, high, and complicated.</P><P>The subject of this book is a Crystallization-study of the Gospel of John. We finished the Life-study of the entire Bible within twenty and a half years, beginning in 1974. Since the fall of 1994, we began to have another way in the study of the holy Word, which is more intrinsic. We call this intrinsic study a crystallization-study. (See the Crystallization-studies of Romans, James, and Song of Songs, published by Living Stream Ministry.) We desire to put all the crystals of the Bible together from every book.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>AN INTRODUCTORY WORD</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. TWO VIEWS CONCERNING CHRIST</H2><P>In this introductory word, we first need to see that there are two views concerning Christ in the four Gospels.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Physical View</H2><P>There is the physical view of Christ according to the synoptic Gospels&#151;Matthew, Mark, and Luke. They are called synoptic Gospels because they bear the same view.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Mystical View</H2><P>The second view is the mystical view, not the spiritual view, according to the Gospel of John. John among the four Gospels stands by itself, because all the other three Gospels are concerning Christ as a man. In Matthew we see Him as the King, in Mark as the Slave, and in Luke as the Man. The view in these Gospels is physical concerning Christ as a man, but John is concerning Christ as God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THREE PERIODS OF CHRIST</H2><P>This one person is of three periods. In order to understand this crystallization-study of John, we have to know the three periods of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Christ in the Flesh</H2><P>Christ, the very God in eternity past, became flesh and lived in the flesh for thirty-three and a half years from His incarnation to His death as seen in the four Gospels. This is the stage of incarnation (John 1:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Christ as the Spirit</H2><P>First, there is the Christ in the flesh, in incarnation. But in His resurrection He was transfigured to be the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). This is the stage of Christ as the Spirit (the pneumatic Christ) in Acts and twenty-one Epistles (from Romans to Jude), from the resurrection of Christ to the beginning of the degradation of the church in about A.D. 60, before the martyrdom of Paul, who wrote his Second Epistle to Timothy in about A.D. 67, with many points related to the degradation. This is the stage of inclusion. The pneumatic Christ is the all-inclusive Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Christ as the Seven Spirits</H2><P>First, Christ was in the flesh in incarnation; second, He became the Spirit in resurrection; and third, He is the seven Spirits (the sevenfold intensified Spirit) in Revelation, from the degradation of the church to eternity. This is the stage of intensification. These three stages, or periods, of Christ are the three "i's"&#151;incarnation, inclusion, and intensification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE RECORD OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H2><P>The Gospel of John is a record of Christ living as a physical person but having His being all the way mystical; hence, a mystical record. He is a man, yet He is a mystical man, a mysterious man.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>THE WORD OF GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG> (1)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE FIRST CRYSTAL IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H2><P>"In the beginning was the Word"&#151;this is the opening declaration of John (1:1). The Word of God, the first crystal in the Gospel of John, refers to Christ, the only begotten Son of God (v. 18), as the definition, explanation, and expression of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Great "I Am"</H2><P>John unveils Christ as the great "I Am," self-existing and ever-existing (Exo. 3:14-15; John 8:24, 28, 58). Everything other than Christ is vanity of vanities. Only He is the reality, the I Am, the One who is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Eternal, without Beginning or Ending</H2><P>Christ is the One who is eternal, without beginning or ending (Heb. 7:3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. JOHN 1 BEING THE INTRODUCTION<br>TO THE WHOLE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H2><P>John 1 is the introduction to the whole Gospel of John, and the main stress of this introduction is that Christ is the Word of God&#151;the definition, explanation, and expression of the mysterious and invisible God. It refers to Christ in the five greatest events in the history of the universe.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. In the Creation</H2><P>John 1 reveals Christ in the creation of all things in the beginning of time (v. 3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In the Incarnation</H2><P>Christ is also seen in the incarnation of the invisible God to be a visible man (John 1:14), partaking of man's flesh and blood (Heb. 2:14), for the redemption of the lost universe to bring in the New Testament age. The incarnated God has blood. Acts 20:28 says that God purchased the church with His own blood. God partook of man's flesh and blood for the redemption of the lost universe. The entire universe, including the heavens, was contaminated by Satan, an archangel created by God, in his rebellion against God. This first rebel caused the entire universe to become lost, so all things on earth and in the heavens needed to be redeemed by God (Col. 1:20). Without Christ's redemption, they could not have remained for so many years. The solar system is still going on due to Christ's redemption.</P><P>Christ redeemed the universe by becoming a man. The New Testament age began at the incarnation of Christ. It is significant that the entire world today uses one calendar, which counts the years from Christ's incarnation. Creation brought in a universe, but this universe became lost. Then God came to be a man by the name of Jesus with a human nature to redeem the lost universe back to a new age, the New Testament age, starting from the day Christ was born.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In Becoming the Lamb</H2><P>Christ is also revealed in His becoming the Lamb to take away the sin of the world (mankind) judicially for the New Testament (John 1:29, 36). This is the third great event in the history of the universe. When He was put to death on the cross, God considered Him the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. He became a man for the purpose of redeeming the lost universe, yet He still needed to take a further step to go to the cross to die, bearing the sins of mankind on the cross as the Lamb.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. In Becoming the Spirit</H2><P>John 1 first speaks of Christ as the Word. Then it reveals that this Word speaks for God through His creation. Then He speaks further for God through His incarnation and in His being the Lamb. The fourth great event in the history of the universe, through which Christ as the Word speaks, is His becoming the Spirit. John 1:32 says, "And John testified, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him." This is the Spirit descending as a dove upon the Lamb. Christ was the Lamb. Then He became the dove, the Spirit. Christ is revealed in John 1 in His becoming the Spirit for the transformation of God's redeemed people into stones (vv. 32-42) for the building of God's house (Bethel&#151;v. 51) organically for the New Testament.</P><P>We need to be not only redeemed but also transformed. If we were merely redeemed, we would still remain men. In order to become like God, we need transformation. The first step of transformation is to regenerate, to remake, us. Even though we were made in the image of God and after the likeness of God, we still do not have anything real of God in us until we are regenerated. We need to be regenerated to begin our transformation into stones for God's spiritual building, His house. The house of God, Bethel, first is the church, then the Body of Christ, and consummately the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. In Being the Heavenly Ladder</H2><P>Finally, Christ is referred to in His being the heavenly ladder to bring heaven to earth and join earth to heaven at Bethel, the house of God, from His coming back to eternity (John 1:51; Gen. 28:11-22). We can remember these five great historical events with five words: creation, incarnation, Lamb, Spirit, and ladder. John 1 begins with Christ as the Word and ends with Him as the ladder. Christ as the Word speaks through the creation, through the incarnation, through His becoming the Lamb, through His becoming the Spirit, and through His being the ladder. In order to have a ladder, there is the need of a base, and the base for Christ to be the heavenly ladder is the house of God, Bethel. The reality of Bethel is the church and then the Body of Christ and the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Christ as the Word of God Defining, Explaining,<br>and Expressing the Invisible God</H2><P>In all these five universal, historical events, Christ, the Word of God (as: 1. the Creator in creation; 2. the man in incarnation; 3. the Lamb in redemption; 4. the Spirit in transformation; 5. the ladder in joining earth to heaven), defines, explains, and expresses the invisible God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. In His Creation</H2><P>In His creation "the heavens are telling of the glory of God; and their expanse [firmament] is declaring the work of His hands. Day to day pours forth speech, and night to night reveals knowledge. There is no speech, nor are there words; their voice is not heard" (Psa. 19:1-3, NASB), and the invisible things of God, "both His eternal power and divine characteristics, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world" (Rom. 1:20). What is referred to in Acts 14:15-17 and 17:24-29 serves the same purpose of revealing Christ's creation speaking for God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. In His Incarnation</H2><P>In His incarnation Christ unveils that the Creator has become one of His creatures (Col. 1:15), bringing God into man, mingling divinity with humanity as one, and in His human living He expresses God in the divine attributes through His human virtues. This is the new language of the new culture in the Lord's recovery.</P><P>When Jesus was born, God was brought into man and mingled Himself with man. About two thousand years ago, there was a man who was the mingling of divinity and humanity. To be a Christian means to be a man of Christ. Christ is the mingling of divinity with humanity, and we, the men of Christ, are the same. We are also the mingling of divinity with humanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. In His Becoming the Lamb</H2><P>In His becoming the Lamb for the redemption of the lost world, Christ speaks to us how God accomplished His redemption judicially through His death as the procedure according to His righteousness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. In His Becoming the Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>In His becoming the Spirit for life-giving and transforming (1 Cor. 15:45), Christ speaks to us further how God carries out His economy organically by His divine life for His divine purpose according to His heart's desire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. In His Being the Heavenly Ladder</H2><P>Christ, in His being the heavenly ladder at Bethel, also speaks to us how God desires to have a house on the earth constituted with His redeemed and transformed elect, that He may bring heaven to earth and join earth to heaven, to make the two as one for eternity.</P><P>The Word of God is Christ in His creation, in His incarnation, in His becoming the Lamb, in His becoming the life-giving Spirit, and in His being the ladder. In these five greatest historical events, Christ speaks for God. In this sense, we may say that the creation is the Word, the incarnation is the Word, the Lamb is the Word, the Spirit is the Word, and the ladder is the Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>P.S. In the Warfare for God's Kingdom</H2><P>In addition to all the above items, John, in his last writing, Revelation, tells us that even in the warfare for the kingdom of God, Christ is the Word of God speaking for God's purpose (Rev. 19:13). When He comes to fight God's enemies for the kingdom, His name is called the Word of God. In His fighting He is God's speaking. Christ is the Word of God speaking for God's purpose.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE WORD OF GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman" start="3"><li>The intrinsic, central line of the five historical events in the introduction to the Gospel of John as the "trunk" is that:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>In the Word, who is Christ as the definition, explanation, and expression of God, is life&#151;John 1:4a.</li>	<li>The life in the Word is the light that speaks to the world by shining forth, as His coming to the world, what God is&#151;John 1:4b-11.</li>	<li>Whoever receives the shining light, which is Christ Himself, can have the divine life, carried forth by the light, that they may be born of God to be His children as the constituents of the house of God, Bethel&#151;John 1:12-13.</li>	<li>This ultimately consummates the New Jerusalem organically for the fulfillment of God's eternal economy revealed to us by the same writer, John&#151;Rev. 21:2.</li>	</ol><li>The Word, God, and the Spirit, the three cooperating and coordinating together in the speaking for God:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>God has the Word to speak for Him and He also has the Spirit to bring forth the Word. This is seen in the creation when Christ as the Word of God was creating by speaking (thus, the universe has been framed by the word of God&#151;Heb. 11:3), and the Spirit of God was brooding (Gen. 1:2).</li>	<li>In addition to the speaking of Christ as the Word in the five great historical events, Christ as the Word of God spoke for God by the prophets through His Spirit (1 Pet. 1:10-11). When a particular point concerning Christ was conceived in a God-seeking person as a prophet, the Spirit of Christ brought forth the speaking of it through the prophet as the instrument. This was the way of the prophecy concerning Christ by the prophets in the Old Testament (Luke 24:44). It was Christ as the Word of God, God Himself, and the speaking Spirit of God cooperating and coordinating in the speaking for God in the prophecies concerning Christ. This can be illustrated by Isaiah 7:14 concerning Christ being born of a virgin, Micah 5:2 concerning the birthplace of Christ, Daniel 9:26 concerning the time of the death of Christ, Malachi 4:2 concerning Christ's second appearing as the Sun of righteousness, etc.</li>	<li>In the New Testament Christ as the Word of God was incarnated to be a man (John 1:14) to express God, that is, to speak God. Hence, Hebrews 1:2 says that at the last of these days God has spoken to us in the Son. The sonship in God's New Testament economy is not only individual but also corporate. In the New Testament God speaks in Christ as His firstborn Son (Rom. 8:29), indicating that all the brothers of His firstborn Son as His many sons have to be the word of God speaking for God. They are not only the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, etc. (Eph. 4:11), but, even more, the sons of God, who are the members of His firstborn Son. They are much higher than the Old Testament prophets.</li>	<li>Christ as the Word of God in three forms:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>In the form of a person&#151;Christ Himself.</li>		<li>When He was prophesied by the prophets of the Old Testament and spoken by Christ with all His brothers as His members, it is the spoken word.</li>		<li>When the spoken word is written down, that which can constitute the Bible is the written word.</li>		</ol>	<li>When the word remains in us, it is the speaking of God. When it is spoken by us and received by others, it becomes spirit and life (John 6:63). When it remains in them, it is again the word, but when it is spoken forth by them through the Spirit (1 Cor. 7:40), it becomes spirit and life. In this way Christ being the Word of God implies Himself as the word in the form of a person, the spoken word, and the written word&#151;the Bible. All these define, explain, and express God as the revelation of God.</li>	</ol></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE INTRINSIC, CENTRAL LINE<br>OF THE FIVE HISTORICAL EVENTS<br>IN THE INTRODUCTION TO THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H2><P>The intrinsic, central line of the five historical events in the introduction to the Gospel of John is like the trunk of a big tree. The trunk grows or produces the branches. The "trunk" of John 1 is the creation, the incarnation, the Lamb, the Spirit, and the ladder. The word ladder is not in John 1 but in Genesis 28, which records Jacob's dream (vv. 11-19). In Genesis 28 Jacob saw a ladder set up on earth and reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. In John 1:51 the Lord Jesus told Nathanael that he would see the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man. This shows that Christ, as the Son of Man, with His humanity, is the ladder set up on the earth and leading to heaven, keeping heaven open to earth and joining earth to heaven for the house of God, Bethel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Life in the Word</H2><P>John 1:1 says that in the beginning, in eternity past, was the Word. Then verse 51, the last verse of John 1, says that the Son of Man will be the ladder, which Jacob saw in his dream. This refers to eternity future. This introduction of John 1 implies a wide span from eternity past to eternity future. This span, as we have seen, is with the five greatest events in the history of the universe, which are the trunk of John 1. On this great trunk, there is only one branch. This branch is in verse 4, which says that in Christ as the Word, through whom the creation was carried out, was life. This is a branch, altogether organic, a branch of life. In the Word, who is Christ as the definition, explanation, and expression of God, is life (John 1:4a). This is the intrinsic, central line of the five great historical events.</P><P>In Him, in this trunk, is life, and this life is the light of men, shining over men. This shining was His coming to visit people. Wherever He went, the light was shining over the people around Him, and that shining is God's speaking. The shining speaks for God. Most of the Jewish people rejected this shining (vv. 10-11), but a certain number received it. As many as received this light, this shining, the trunk (that is, the Word, Christ) would give them life to be the authority to become the children of God (vv. 12-13). This is not a small thing. Many today speak of human rights, but the real right is the authority Christ as the trunk gives us. On the day of our regeneration, we received the divine life as our authority to become the children of God. This is to become "Godkind," God's species.</P><P>We were of Adam, having nothing to do with God inwardly. We were only created by God in His image and after His likeness, but we had not received God's life into us. About four thousand years after His creation of man, Christ as the Word became flesh. In this wonderful Word, through whom the creation was carried out and through whom incarnation was accomplished, is life. This life is the light, and the light shines. If we receive His shining, He gives us the life authority to become Godkind. We are now both mankind and Godkind, God's species, the children of God. These children are the sons of God, and these sons of God are the brothers of God's firstborn Son (Rom. 8:29). Actually, the trunk is the firstborn Son, and we are the many brothers of this firstborn Son. He and we are the sons of God. He is Godkind, and we are the same. He is of God's species, and so are we.</P><P>Through these sons, God has a family, and this family is the house of God, which is the church. First Timothy 3:15 says that the church is the house, or the family, the household, of the living God. This house is the Body of Christ. To God it is a family and to Christ it is His Body, an organism. This Body of Christ will consummate the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem will be the consummation of the Body of Christ. In John there is such a line of life, implying light, to produce the many children of God, who are the many sons to be God's family and the many brothers to be Christ's members, to be His Body, which consummates in the New Jerusalem as the eternal expression and increase of the processed Triune God, with Christ as the ladder that brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven, making heaven and earth one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Life in the Word Being the Light of Man</H2><P>The intrinsic, central line of the five historical events in the introduction to the Gospel of John as the "trunk" is that, first, in the Word, who is Christ as the definition, explanation, and expression of God, is life (v. 4a). Then, the life in the Word is the light that speaks to the world by shining forth, as His coming to the world, what God is (vv. 4b-11). We have the definite, assured, affirmed revelation of what God is. We see God. The life as light is shining forth to reveal, to speak, to tell us, what God is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Receiving the Shining Light</H2><P>Whoever receives the shining light, which is Christ Himself, can have the divine life, carried forth by the light, that they may be born of God to be His children as the constituents of the house of God, Bethel (vv. 12-13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Consummating the New Jerusalem</H2><P>This trunk produces a branch. In this branch is life, and this life is the light shining over people. Whoever receives this light will have the authority to be the children of God. This ultimately consummates the New Jerusalem organically for the fulfillment of God's eternal economy revealed to us by the same writer, John (Rev. 21:2). The book of Revelation, written by John, is the consummation of his Gospel. What is revealed in his Gospel is the initiation of the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE WORD, GOD, AND THE SPIRIT<br>COOPERATING AND COORDINATING TOGETHER<br>IN THE SPEAKING FOR GOD</H2><P>The Word, God, and the Spirit cooperate and coordinate together in the speaking for God. Three-in-one speak together by cooperating and coordinating.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Word Speaking for God and<br>the Spirit Bringing Forth the Word</H2><P>God has the Word to speak for Him, and this Word is Christ. God has the only begotten Son as His speaking, the Word, to speak for Him and He also has the Spirit to bring forth the Word. When we speak the Word, the living Spirit goes along with our speaking. The Spirit accompanies the Word to bring the Word into people.</P><P>The coordination of the Word, God, and the Spirit is seen in the creation when Christ as the Word of God was creating by speaking (thus, the universe has been framed by the word of God&#151;Heb. 11:3), and the Spirit of God was brooding (Gen. 1:2). Christ was speaking, "Let there be light." Then there was light. When Christ spoke, the Spirit was brooding.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Christ as the Word of God Speaking for God by the Prophets through His Spirit</H2><P>In addition to the speaking of Christ as the Word in the five great historical events, Christ as the Word of God spoke for God by the prophets through His Spirit (1 Pet. 1:10-11). Christ as the Word of God speaks through the prophethood. When a particular point concerning Christ was conceived in a God-seeking person as a prophet, the Spirit of Christ brought forth the speaking of it through the prophet as the instrument. This was the way of the prophecy concerning Christ by the prophets in the Old Testament. In Luke 24:44 the Lord said, "All the things written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me must be fulfilled." The Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms are the three sections of the Old Testament. The Lord's word here indicates that the entire Old Testament is a revelation of Him and that He is its center and content.</P><P>In the Old Testament it was Christ as the Word of God, God Himself, and the speaking Spirit of God cooperating and coordinating in the speaking for God in the prophecies concerning Christ. This can be illustrated by Isaiah 7:14 concerning Christ being born of a virgin, Micah 5:2 concerning the birthplace of Christ, Daniel 9:26 concerning the time of the death of Christ, Malachi 4:2 concerning Christ's second appearing as the Sun of righteousness, etc. All these prophecies in the Old Testament are speaking Christ, and Christ is the totality of the Word of God. When the prophets speak Him, that means He speaks God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. God Having Spoken to Us in the Son</H2><P>In the New Testament Christ as the Word of God was incarnated to be a man (John 1:14) to express God, that is, to speak God. Hence, Hebrews 1:2 says that at the last of these days God has spoken to us in the Son. God speaks in both the prophethood and the sonship. The sonship in God's New Testament economy is not only individual but also corporate. God does not have only one son. He did have one Son, the Only Begotten, before the incarnation, but after resurrection, God has many sons. The Only Begotten became the firstborn Son of God, and in the same delivery in resurrection, we all were born, regenerated, to be sons of God (Rom. 8:29; 1 Pet. 1:3). Our big Brother is Christ. We are His followers, His members, His brothers. God's having many sons means that there should be "many speakings." A son of God should speak for God everywhere. When there are no people around, we can speak to the creation (see Mark 16:15). We can say, even to the animals, "My God is my Father, and my big Brother is Christ. He speaks for God. I am His brother, and I do the same thing."</P><P>John 15 reveals that Christ is the vine tree and that we are His branches. The branches of the vine tree bear fruit. Today our gospel preaching should be our fruit bearing. We should not try to gain a big crowd in our labor in the gospel. That is the way of Christianity. A big gospel campaign may attract many people, but eventually most of these people are not cared for and become lost. That kind of preaching is like bringing the water out of the well and pouring it on the earth in vain. Instead, we need to be a fruit bearing branch in the way of bearing fruit one by one through the vital groups. God created only one man, but today on the whole earth there are billions of men. This happened by the way of human birth, in a one-by-one way. This is the way to preach the gospel according to the God-ordained way. Christianity dropped God's way and took the way of a big speaker attracting large crowds. The issue of such work is vanity.</P><P>As the sons of God, we all need to be those who speak forth Christ. We need to speak to people in a new way with a new language. We may say, "Good morning, sir. I am a son of God, and I would like to speak to you about my God, who is my Father. John 1:12 says that as many as receive Christ, God will give them the authority to become the children of God." This is the right way to preach the gospel. Although the one to whom you are speaking may be too busy to talk at that time, you can make an appointment with him for a later time. All the sons in the divine sonship should speak Christ, and Christ speaks for God.</P><P>In the New Testament God speaks in Christ as His firstborn Son (Rom. 8:29), indicating that all the brothers of His firstborn Son as His many sons have to be the word of God speaking for God. They are not only the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, etc. (Eph. 4:11), but, even more, they are the sons of God, who are the members of His firstborn Son. They are much higher than the Old Testament prophets.</P><P>Today we New Testament believers are God's sons and His prophets. First Corinthians 14:1 says, "Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy." Verse 31 says, "For you can all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be encouraged." As long as you are a son of God, you are also a prophet. As a son you should speak, and as a prophet you should prophesy. You can all prophesy. We need to be prophets to our relatives, colleagues, and classmates. We should prophesy every day and be bubbling over with Christ all the time. Instead of talking to people about the political situation, we should speak something mystical to them. When we speak to someone, perhaps he will say that we are a mental case. But we can tell him, "I'm not a mental case; I'm a case of the son of God." We must learn to be "crazy" to speak for the Lord in this way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Christ as the Word of God in Three Forms</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. In the Form of a Person&#151;Christ Himself</H2><P>Christ is a person. This person is the Word, and we are His brothers. We must also be the word to those around us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Spoken Word</H2><P>When He was prophesied by the prophets of the Old Testament and spoken by Christ with all His brothers as His members, the sons of God, it is the spoken word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Written Word</H2><P>When the spoken word is written down, that which can constitute the Bible is the written word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Spoken Word Becoming Spirit and Life</H2><P>When the word remains in us, it is the speaking of God. When it is spoken by us and received by others, it becomes spirit and life (John 6:63). When it remains in them, it is again the word, but when it is spoken forth by them through the Spirit (1 Cor. 7:40), it becomes spirit and life. In this way Christ being the Word of God implies Himself as the word in the form of a person, the spoken word, and the written word&#151;the Bible. All these define, explain, and express God as the revelation of God.</P><P>Christ as the Word speaks for God through the creation, through the incarnation, through the Lamb, the Spirit, the ladder, and through the prophethood plus the sonship. We have a double status. We are prophets and sons of God. Both statuses qualify us to speak for God. When we speak, that is Christ speaking. Satan wants to prevent the believers from speaking for God. In the meetings of the church, all the saints should be the speakers. Our praising in the Lord's table meeting is also the Lord's speaking. Recently in the church in Anaheim, we had a Lord's table meeting that was full of high speaking. We praised the Lord in this way: "Lord, when we touch the loaf, we touch Your mystical Body organically. When we touch the cup, we touch Your redeeming blood judicially. We praise You that Your judicial redemption and organic salvation constitute us into Your Body, and this Body will consummate in the New Jerusalem." I have attended the Lord's table for over sixty years, but I never attended one as high as that one. We need to come out of our oldness and the traditions of Christianity. We need to drop our old concepts and our old, doctrinal language. We must learn the new language with the new vocabulary of the new culture of the Lord's present recovery. Then we will become living and refreshing, and others will be refreshed by us when we speak to them.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>God, as the second crystal in the writings of John, is unveiled as the fountain (source) of life:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Flowing out to dispense Himself with His divine life as the life element, the life supply (Christ as the tree of life), to meet the need of His elect and to be their pleasures and satisfaction (Rev. 22:1-2; cf.

GOD, AS THE SECOND CRYSTAL<br>IN THE WRITINGS OF JOHN, BEING UNVEILED<br>AS THE FOUNTAIN (SOURCE) OF LIFE</H2><P>In this message we come to the second crystal in the Gospel of John. The first crystal is the Word. In the beginning, that is, in eternity past, was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. God, as the second crystal in the writings of John, is unveiled as the fountain (source) of life. I am burdened to present a living, vivid picture of what God is and of how God is to us. In this message I want to stress that God our Father is a fountain. The fountain is the real source, this fountain emerges as a spring, and the spring gushes out a river. In 1977 I went with some other brothers to see the Holy Land. We went to the foothills of Lebanon where there was a fountain and a spring gushing out a river, the river Jordan. This is a good picture of our God.</P><P>Very rarely is God presented to people in this way. From now on we should present our God to others in this way in our gospel preaching, not by big congregations but by our speaking to individuals in our functioning as prophets and as sons of God. We should say to people, "Have you ever got to know that God is a fountain, Christ is a spring, and the Spirit is a river?" Many people would open up to us when we preach the gospel in this way. Because they have never heard such a thing, they will want to know more.</P><P>Hymns, #1151 speaks of our experience of God the Spirit as a river:</P><ol class="decimal"><li>Drink! A river pure and clear that's flowing from the throne;<br>Eat! The tree of life with fruits abundant, richly grown;<br>Look!

Flowing Out to Dispense Himself<br>with His Divine Life<br>as the Life Element, the Life Supply</H2><P>God is flowing out to dispense Himself with His divine life as the life element, the life supply (Christ as the tree of life), to meet the need of His elect and to be their pleasures and satisfaction (Rev. 22:1-2; cf. Psa. 36:8-9). For this purpose, when Christ died on the cross, not only blood, signifying redemption judicially, flowed forth but also water, signifying the water of life organically to be dispensed into God's elect (John 19:34). We are the Lord's elect. Praise Him that He chose us and then called us to receive Him, the flowing God as the fountain, with Christ as the element in the flow. What pleasure and what satisfaction!</P><P>Psalm 36:8 and 9 say, "They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. For with thee is the fountain of life; in thy light shall we see light." I picked up two words from these verses: satisfied and pleasures. A saved person should be satisfied with Christ and filled up with God's pleasures. God is the fountain of life for satisfaction with the divine pleasures. This is the way to study the Bible to get the intrinsic, central line of life. Fountain, pleasures, and satisfaction are seen in Psalm 36. Without these three words, this psalm is merely the dead letter, which is vanity of vanities, to us. But within this psalm, we can see God as a fountain flowing like a river to satisfy us and fill us up with His pleasures.</P><P>John 19:34 says that when Christ died on the cross, blood and water flowed out of Him. No other Gospel records this fact. John is a book of signs, just like the book of Revelation. Both blood and water are signs. Blood signifies redemption judicially, and water signifies life flowing organically to be dispensed into God's elect. As those who are God's elect, we are in the marvelous line of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. God's Flowing Out Being "Bright As Crystal"</H2><P>Whatever God flows out is "bright as crystal" (Rev. 22:1). The water of life is bright as crystal, having no dimness or opaqueness. When this water of life flows in us, it purifies us and makes us transparent as crystal. In the New Jerusalem, the jasper stone is clear as crystal (21:11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Lord's Calling with a Promise</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To the Thirsty and Water-seeking<br>Samaritan Woman</H2><P>To the thirsty and water-seeking Samaritan woman the Lord said that He has the living water, which is able to cause her to never thirst again (John 4:10, 14). What a promise and what a calling! This immoral Samaritan woman had many husbands. She was thirsty, so she came to draw water, and the Lord Jesus was sitting there, waiting for her to come. The Lord Jesus purposely detoured His way to go to Samaria to sit at the well of Jacob (vv. 3-8). This Savior is omniscient. He knew that this immoral woman was coming, so He sat there to wait for her. What a mercy! The Lord said, "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water gushing up into eternal life" (vv. 13-14). This water quenches not only our thirst but also the thirst of all those whom we contact.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Those Who Held the Feast of Tabernacles</H2><P>To those who held the Feast of Tabernacles, on the last day of their feast, He said, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" (John 7:37b-38). We must believe into the Lord Jesus. We must have such a union. We must be "plugged in." When the current of electricity flows into something that has been plugged in, it works. It is not sufficient merely to believe the Lord Jesus. We must believe into Him. We may have believed the Lord Jesus without having any connection with Him. This is why we need the preposition into. The Lord Jesus is like electricity, and we must be plugged into the current of this electricity. Then rivers of living water will flow out of our innermost being.</P><P>We lose our temper so easily because we are dry and unsatisfied. Sometimes when a person is very dry, I realize that I should not touch him. Otherwise, he may have an outburst of temper. When this is the case, I do my best to water him. Then he will not lose his temper, because he has been watered. There is a river of patience to deal with our quick temperament, which can cause us to lose our temper. On one occasion Brother Nee asked me, "What is patience?" When I could not give a satisfactory answer, he eventually told me, "Patience is Christ." Christ as the Spirit is a flowing river to us to become our patience. Also, it is hard for us not to be proud, but there is a river flowing to us to become our humility. The rivers of living water are the many flows of the different aspects of life originating from the one unique river of water of life (Rev. 22:1), which is God's Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Spring of the Water of Life</H2><P>In John's last book, Revelation, the Lord said to all people, "I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely" (21:6b). The fountain is the source; the spring comes up and emerges from the fountain; then it gushes out to be the flowing river.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Taking the Water of Life Freely</H2><P>The Lord as the Spirit calls with His bride, the transformed church, "Let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely" (Rev. 22:17b). This is a call with a strong promise.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Guiding Us to Springs of Waters of Life</H2><P>The Lord as the Lamb will "guide them [those who answer His call] to springs of waters of life" (Rev. 7:17b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The Sounding of This Calling with a Promise</H2><P>We all know that this calling with a promise from the Lord is still sounding today to everyone who lives on this earth. Hymns, #12 speaks of God as a flowing fountain. God flows first in the Son. Then He continues to flow as the Spirit to reach us and to dispense Himself as the life element with the tree of life to quench our thirst and to satisfy us. The water quenches; the tree satisfies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. GOD'S EXISTENCE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Self-existing and Ever-existing</H2><P>God is self-existing and ever-existing, without beginning and without end.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. From Eternity to Eternity</H2><P>Psalm 90:2 says that He is God from eternity to eternity. John 1 begins in verse 1 with eternity past and ends in verse 51 with eternity future.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. GOD'S PERSON</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. God Being Triune</H2><P>God is triune, three-one&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (John 14:16-17, 26; 15:26). Matthew 28:19 says clearly that we are to baptize people into the name (singular) of the Father and of the Son and of the Spirit. There are three Persons, seemingly, yet one name. The entire Bible openly and clearly reveals the Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Three Coinhering</H2><P>The three coinhere (John 14:10, 20). To coinhere is to exist in one another, to mutually indwell one another. Only the Triune God can be like this. He says clearly in John 14: "I am in the Father and the Father is in Me" (v. 10). The Father does the work in the Son's speaking. They are one, yet still there is the distinction between the Father and the Son.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Three Being Equal</H2><P>The three of the Godhead are equal. No one is higher or lower than the others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Aspect of the Essential Trinity</H2><P>According to Their essence, the three are one; thus, there is the aspect of the essential Trinity. The Son is the embodiment of the Father (Col. 2:9), and the Spirit is the reality of the Son (John 14:16-18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Son Being Called the Father</H2><P>A Son is given to us, yet His name is called the eternal Father (Isa. 9:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Son Becoming the Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>The Son as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). He was incarnated to be the flesh. He was the last Adam. That means that after Him, there would be no flesh. He was the ending, the closing, the concluding, of the flesh. This One in resurrection became the life-giving Spirit. Thus, this One, the Son, is the Father and eventually He is the Spirit. In 1934 Brother Nee gave a conference on the all-inclusive Christ. He said that Christ, the all-inclusive One, is the centrality and universality of God. He is the Son, yet He is the Father. He is the Son, yet He is the life-giving Spirit. Thus, He is the centrality and universality of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Lord Being the Spirit</H2><P>The Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17) and the Lord Spirit (v. 18). The Lord Spirit is a compound divine title like the Father God. He is both the Lord and the Spirit. They two are one in Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Evidence That the Father, the Son, and the Spirit Are Essentially One</H2><P>Such words in the Scripture are strong evidence that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are essentially one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Aspect of the Economical Trinity</H2><P>When we speak of the Triune God according to His economy, we are speaking of Him according to His moving and acting, not His essence. According to the economy, the three are three; thus, there is the aspect of the economical Trinity. The Father is the Originator, making the divine economy (Eph. 1:9-10; 3:9; 1 Tim. 1:4b); then the Son accomplishes the divine economy made by the Father (John 5:19; 8:28); and the Spirit applies to God's elect what the Son has accomplished (16:13). These are steps of one complete move. God the Father planned to do something; the Son accomplished the plan; and the Spirit applies to us what the Son has accomplished. They are still one in harmony in the economical Trinity (10:30; 17:21, 23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Father in Heaven, the Son on the Earth,<br>and the Spirit in the Air</H2><P>The Father spoke in heaven concerning the Son, the Son stood in the water on the earth, and the Spirit soared as the dove in the air (Matt. 3:16-17). The three of the Trinity here are in three locations. Christ the Son, after His baptism, was standing in the water, and the Father said, "This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight." Then the Spirit as a dove soaring in the air descended upon Him. The Father as the source must be in heaven, the Son in His incarnation as the course must be on the earth, and the Spirit as the flow must be soaring in the air.</P><P>This is different from the view of the Triune God in John 14. In John 10:30 the Lord said, "I and the Father are one." He did not say, "I am one with the Father." We can say that we are one with one another. But the Lord Jesus and the Father, They two, are one. In John there is the mystical view that the Father is in the Son and the Son is in the Father. No doubt, They two are also in the Spirit and the Spirit is in Them. This is essential.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Father Choosing, the Son Redeeming,<br>and the Spirit Sealing</H2><P>The Father chose the believers before the foundation of the world in eternity past, the Son redeemed them in time, and the Spirit seals them after they believe in the Son (Eph. 1:4, 6-7, 13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Evidence That the Father, the Son, and the Spirit<br>Are Economically Three</H2><P>Words like these in the Scripture are strong evidence that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are economically three. Thus, God's elect participate in what the Triune God has done and enjoy Their work with Themselves for their satisfaction. By God acting economically, we can participate in what He is and what He has worked out for our pleasure and satisfaction.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Order among the Three</H2><P>Although the three are equal, there is an order among Them. This is similar to our situation in the church. Although we are equal, there is also a proper order in the church. The Father is the Head (1 Cor. 11:3), and the Son subjects Himself to the Father (John 5:19, 30; 8:28; 1 Cor. 15:28). How marvelous it is that one of the three, who is the centrality and universality of the Triune God, subjects Himself to the Father, admitting that the Father is the Head. He is the Head's subordinate. Also, the Spirit testifies concerning the Son (John 15:26; 16:13-14). The Spirit never talks about Himself. He always talks about Christ, testifies of Christ, to glorify Christ.</P><P>Concerning the Triune God, the theology of today's Christianity is deformed. Actually, many believe that there are three Gods. This is tritheism, which is a great heresy. This is why we put out the booklet entitled What a Heresy&#151;Two Divine Fathers, Two Life-giving Spirits, and Three Gods! Such deformed theology has forced us to put the truth in writing through publications such as Affirmation and Critique. Through these writings, the Lord will vindicate His truth.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The composition of the Gospel of John and the constitution of the spiritual things recorded in this Gospel are based upon not only the Triune God but also the processed Triune God.</li><li>The processes that the Triune God has gone through:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Incarnation&#151;John 1:14:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To become flesh, to put on human nature by partaking of human blood and human flesh, to be a real man through human birth by a virgin&#151;Isa. 7:14.</li>		<li>To bring God into man, mingling God and man as one.</li>		<li>To court man according to His love (John 3:16), which He had from eternity toward man, by humbling Himself to lay aside His divine form and position to become in fashion as a man (Phil. 2:6-8) that He could have man engaged to Him in the church age (2 Cor. 11:2) and married to Him to be His wife at the beginning of the kingdom age (Rev. 19:7-9).</li>		<li>This was accomplished not only by the Son but also with the Father (John 8:16, 29) and through the Spirit (Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:18, 20); hence, He was called the Mighty God and the Eternal Father (Isa. 9:6), but lay in a manger as a human baby (Luke 2:7).</li>		</ol>	<li>Human living:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The God-incarnated Jesus lived on the earth as a man for thirty-three and a half years.</li>		<li>To experience all the trials and troubles in human living&#151;Heb. 4:15.</li>		<li>To manifest God's attributes (1 Tim. 3:16) in His human virtues in the flesh.</li>		<li>Going through temptations yet without sin, and having no sin, even though He was made sin&#151;Heb. 4:15; 2 Cor. 5:21.</li>		<li>Made perfect through sufferings&#151;Heb. 2:10.</li>		<li>Thus, He has qualified Himself to be the Redeemer and Savior of the men of sin.</li>		</ol>	<li>The all-terminating, all-redeeming, life-releasing, and new-man-creating death:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Christ as the embodiment of God and through the eternal Spirit (Heb. 9:14) passed through the death on the cross.</li>		<li>By, in, and through this death He terminated all the negative things in the whole universe:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Satan, the devil, the enemy of God&#151;Heb. 2:14.</li>			<li>Sin&#151;Rom. 8:3; John 1:29.</li>			<li>The flesh of fallen man&#151;Gal. 5:24.</li>			<li>The world, the cosmos, the evil system of Satan&#151;John 12:31.</li>			<li>The old creation, represented by the old man&#151;Rom. 6:6.</li>			<li>The separating ordinances of the law&#151;Eph. 2:15.</li>			</ol>		<li>Redeeming judicially fallen mankind and all things created by God&#151;Col. 1:20; Heb. 2:9.</li>		<li>Releasing organically His divine life held in His human shell as that of a grain of wheat&#151;John 12:24.</li>		<li>Through His death Christ creating in Himself as the sphere, as the realm, and as the element the Jews and the Gentiles into one new man&#151;Eph. 2:15.</li>		</ol>	<li>The life-dispensing, germinating, and washing resurrection:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>After He passed through the process of death, Christ entered into the process of resurrection.</li>		<li>By this resurrection He:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Was born to be the firstborn Son of God by the designation of His flesh through the Spirit of holiness&#151;Rom. 1:3-4; 8:29.</li>			<li>Became the life-giving Spirit&#151;1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>			<li>Regenerated all His believers chosen by God in eternity past&#151;1 Pet. 1:3:</li>				<ol class="none">				<li>1) Dispensing the divine life to the believers in Christ&#151;John 3:15.</li>				<li>2) Germinating all believers in Christ through regeneration&#151;John 3:5-6.</li>				<li>3) Washing away all the old things from the regenerated believers&#151;Titus 3:5.</li>				</ol>			</ol>		</ol>	</ol></ol><P>We have seen that the Triune God has been processed to flow as the fountain, the spring, and the river. Every process through which the Triune God passed was a "tunnel." The first process our Triune God went through was of nine months in a virgin's womb. Matthew 1:20 says that what was born in Mary was of the Holy Spirit. The divine God, the Divine Trinity, was born into a human virgin's womb and remained there for nine months. The second process was His human living, a long tunnel of thirty-three and a half years. The third process, His death by crucifixion, lasted six hours, from nine o'clock in the morning to three o'clock in the afternoon. For the first three hours He was persecuted by human rebels, and for the last three hours He was judged by God.</P><P>The next process was the resurrection, which was not as quick as most people think. By reading 1 Peter 3:18 with Romans 1:4, we can see that the resurrection was a designating process. Christ was originally the only begotten Son of God becoming a man. How could the only begotten Son of God be God's Firstborn? There was the need of a process. The only begotten Son of God was processed to be the firstborn Son of God. In this process He regenerated all the chosen people of God. First Peter 1:3 says that by His mercy, we believers in Christ all were regenerated through His resurrection. First Peter 3:18 says that when Christ died on the cross, on the one hand, He was crucified in His flesh, but on the other hand, He was made alive in the Spirit. God was acting to transfigure the man Jesus into the divine sonship. Acts 13:33 reveals that on the day of resurrection God the Father said, "You are My Son; today I have begotten You." This begetting was not a quick delivery. It was through the process of resurrection.</P><P>Many today do not see that God has been processed, because they are covered by their traditional veil. This is why Paul said we have to look unto Christ with an unveiled face (2 Cor. 3:18). The entire New Testament unveils to us that God went through the process of incarnation, the process of human living, the process of an all-inclusive death, and the process of a life-dispensing resurrection. What a mercy that the Lord has shown us all these wonderful truths! These are not the initial truths, but the consummated truths. The processed Triune God is a flowing God. His Trinity is for flowing. The Father as love is the fountain, the Son as grace is the spring, and the Spirit as the fellowship is the flowing river (2 Cor. 13:14). The Triune God is flowing as love, grace, and fellowship into us, His elect. God's elect are the destination of His flowing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE COMPOSITION OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H2><P>The composition of the Gospel of John and the constitution of the spiritual things recorded in this Gospel are based upon not only the Triune God but also the processed Triune God. There is a big difference between the Triune God and the processed Triune God. For God to enter into a human womb and remain there for nine months to be born as a man was not a small thing. He passed through human living for thirty-three and a half years and suffered the death of the cross. Then in resurrection the man Jesus Christ was designated into the divine sonship, became the life-giving Spirit, and regenerated His millions of believers. According to God's view, we were regenerated about two thousand years ago in the resurrection of Christ. In other words, we were regenerated before we were born. We believers were all born of God in one great delivery, which brought forth millions of regenerated people. The processes of the Triune God were a long procedure, even for the Almighty God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE PROCESSES THAT THE TRIUNE GOD<br>HAS GONE THROUGH</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Incarnation</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Become Flesh</H2><P>I worship God for His dear incarnation (John 1:14), which is so sweet and marvelous. God became flesh. Flesh is a negative term, not a positive one. God became a man who had become flesh. Genesis 6:3 says that God had no way to go on with man because man had become flesh. This forced God to destroy man by a great flood. God became a man, not before but after the fall. He became flesh, putting on human nature by partaking of human blood and human flesh to be a real man through human birth by a virgin (Isa. 7:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Bring God into Man</H2><P>The incarnation was to bring God into man, mingling God and man as one entity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. To Court Man according to His Love</H2><P>Christ was a "God-husband" courting a "man-female." He came as God, the universal male, to court man, the universal female. The term dating is too low. Courting is high. God came to be a man in order to be a high-standard Husband. The end of the Bible says that the New Jerusalem is the wife of the Lamb (Rev. 21:2, 9). Revelation 19 speaks of the wedding day of the Lamb for His marriage to the overcomers (vv. 7-9). John 3 says that Christ, as the One who marries the bride, is the Bridegroom. His regenerated ones are His bride to be His increase (vv. 29-30). This is what I call the biblical romance. In the Bible there is a universal romance, a romance concerning God courting man. John 3:16 reveals that God fell in love with the world. The world here means the worldly people. God fell in love with mankind. This love was the love which He had from eternity toward man. In eternity past God had a love toward man, so He became a man to court and to marry man.</P><P>He courted man by humbling Himself to lay aside His divine form and position to become in fashion as a man (Phil. 2:6-8), so that He could have man engaged to Him in the church age (2 Cor. 11:2) and married to Him to be His wife at the beginning of the kingdom age (Rev. 19:7-9). The book of Song of Songs reveals this divine romance. Solomon courted a country girl by laying aside the things of his kingship. If Solomon had gone to her as a king with a crown to court her, that would have frightened her, but he changed his form to that of a country man. In the same way, the Triune God laid aside His divine form in incarnation to become in fashion as a man in order to court man. This was so that He could have man engaged to Him.</P><P>The wedding has not yet come, so we are still in the time of engagement. My burden is to improve and strengthen our engagement with Christ. Paul said that he betrothed the believers as a virgin to Christ (2 Cor. 11:2). Betrothed means engaged. Eventually, the overcomers will have a wedding day with Christ of a thousand years. Then the marriage life with Christ for eternity in the new heaven and new earth will include all of God's chosen and redeemed people. In Revelation 19 the bride is revealed on the wedding day, and in Revelation 21 this bride becomes the wife of Christ for eternity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Accomplished by the Son, with the Father,<br>and through the Spirit</H2><P>This was accomplished not only by the Son but also with the Father (John 8:16, 29) and through the Spirit (Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:18, 20); hence, He was called the mighty God and the eternal Father (Isa. 9:6), but He was lying in a manger as a human baby (Luke 2:7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Human Living</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Living on the Earth as a Man</H2><P>The God-incarnated Jesus lived on the earth as a man for thirty-three and a half years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Experience Trials and Troubles</H2><P>He passed through human living to experience all the trials and troubles in human living (Heb. 4:15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. To Manifest God's Attributes</H2><P>He manifested God's attributes (1 Tim. 3:16) in His human virtues in the flesh. His human virtues were the expression of the divine attributes.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Going through Temptations</H2><P>The incarnated God went through temptations, yet without sin, and He had no sin even though He was made sin (Heb. 4:15; 2 Cor. 5:21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Made Perfect through Sufferings</H2><P>Hebrews 2:10 says that Christ was made perfect through sufferings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Qualified to Be the Redeemer and Savior</H2><P>Thus, He has qualified Himself to be the Redeemer and Savior of the men of sin. He has been tested and approved. He "graduated" from human living. That gave Him the qualification to be our Savior.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The All-terminating, All-redeeming,<br>Life-releasing, and New-man-creating Death</H2><P>Christ's death was all-terminating, all-redeeming, life-releasing, and new-man-creating. In His death He terminated all the old things and redeemed all of God's creation. He also released His divine life and created the new man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Passing through Death on the Cross</H2><P>Christ as the embodiment of God and through the eternal Spirit (Heb. 9:14) passed through the death on the cross. Because the One who passed through death was the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9), the Triune God was passing through the death on the cross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Terminating All the Negative Things<br>in the Whole Universe</H2><P>By, in, and through this death He terminated all the negative things in the whole universe. These negative things are Satan, the devil, the enemy of God (Heb. 2:14); sin (Rom. 8:3; John 1:29); the flesh of fallen man (Gal. 5:24); the world, the cosmos, the evil system of Satan (John 12:31); the old creation, represented by the old man (Rom. 6:6); and the separating ordinances of the law (Eph. 2:15). Not only the Jews but also all the nations have their ordinances. Ordinances are the forms or ways of living and worship, which create enmity and division. All the ordinances have been crucified on the cross. Christ has crossed out all the ordinances. In 1938 I was invited to visit a group of Japanese believers in Manchuria. When I visited them, I dropped my ordinances by taking off my shoes and kneeling down on the tatami to talk to them about Christ. To practice the proper church life, all ordinances should be repudiated and dropped.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Accomplishing Redemption</H2><P>In His death Christ redeemed judicially fallen mankind and all things created by God (Col. 1:20; Heb. 2:9). Colossians 1:20 reveals that all things created by God both in the heavens and on the earth needed to be reconciled to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Releasing His Divine Life</H2><P>Christ redeemed all things judicially, according to God's righteous requirement. Then He released organically His divine life held in His human shell as that of a grain of wheat (John 12:24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Creating the One New Man</H2><P>Through His death Christ created in Himself as the sphere, as the realm, and as the element the Jews and the Gentiles into one new man (Eph. 2:15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Life-dispensing, Germinating,<br>and Washing Resurrection</H2><P>The fourth process is the life-dispensing, germinating, and washing resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Process of Resurrection</H2><P>After He passed through the process of death, Christ entered into the process of resurrection. First Peter 3:18 tells us that when Christ was dying on the cross, He was crucified to death in His flesh, but not in His Spirit. His Spirit as His divinity did not die at the cross when His flesh died; rather, His Spirit as His divinity was made alive, enlivened, with new power of life, so that in this empowered Spirit as His divinity He made a proclamation to the fallen angels, proclaiming God's victory over Satan. When He was dying in the flesh on the cross, at the same time He was rising up in His Spirit. This was the beginning of His resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Accomplishments of Resurrection</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Born to Be the Firstborn Son of God</H2><P>By this resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God by the designation of His flesh through the Spirit of holiness (Rom. 1:3-4; 8:29).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Becoming the Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>Through the process of resurrection, Christ also became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). As the last Adam in the flesh, He was transfigured to be the life-giving Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Regenerating All His Believers</H2><P>In the process of resurrection He regenerated all His believers chosen by God in eternity past (1 Pet. 1:3) by dispensing the divine life to the believers in Christ (John 3:15), germinating all believers in Christ through regeneration (John 3:5-6), and washing away all the old things from the regenerated believers (Titus 3:5). Resurrection was a great process.</P><P>Titus 3:5 says that our God saved us through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Spirit. Note 4 of this verse in the Recovery Version says:</P><blockquote>The Greek word for regeneration is different from that for regenerated in 1 Pet. 1:23. The only other place this word is used is Matt. 19:28, where it is used for the restoration in the millennium (see note 1 there). Here it refers to a change from one state to another. Being born again is the commencing of this change. The washing of regeneration begins with our being born again and continues with the renewing of the Holy Spirit as the process of God's new creation, a process that makes us a new man. It is a kind of reconditioning, remaking, or remodeling, with life. Baptism (Rom. 6:3-5), the putting off of the old man, the putting on of the new man (Eph. 4:22, 24; Col. 3:9-11), and transformation by the renewing of the mind (Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23) are all related to this wonderful process. The washing of regeneration purges away all the things of the old nature of our old man, and the renewing of the Holy Spirit imparts something new&#151;the divine essence of the new man&#151;into our being. In this is a passing from our old state into a wholly new one, from the old creation into the status of a new creation. Hence, both the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit are working in us continually throughout our life until the completion of the new creation.</blockquote><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST&#151;<br>THE FURTHER REVELATION OF CHRIST<br>CONCERNING HIS ALL-INCLUSIVENESS<br>IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>In addition to the items in the Old Testament unveiling the all-unlimitedness of Christ in God's commission to Him, as God's anointed One, for the universe, for fallen man, and for God's kingdom.</li><li>In His perfect redemption through His death judicially and in His complete salvation by His life organically for the carrying out of God's eternal economy, He is:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>God, who is the source of all things and especially the source of the divine life that flows out for its dispensing into God's elect as their life and everything&#151;John 1:1, 14; 20:28; Rom. 9:5; Col. 2:9.</li>	<li>The Word of God that defines, explains, and expresses God, speaking and revealing God by the Spirit through the Scriptures, the prophets, and the apostles through the ages in many ways&#151;Rev. 19:13; Heb. 1:1-2a; 4:12; 2 Tim. 3:15-17; 1 Pet. 1:10-12; John 6:63.</li>	<li>The life contained in Himself as the Word of God (John 1:4a; 11:25; 14:6; 10:10b) to be the base of a believer's life.</li>	<li>The light of life (John 1:4b-12; 8:12; 9:5; 12:46) to bring the divine life to the world by shining (speaking) forth God that man may be born of God to be His children, making man God in His life and nature but not in His Godhead.</li>	<li>The flesh through His incarnation (John 1:14a), that is, a man fallen in sin, but Romans 8:3 tells us that Christ became the "flesh of sin" only in its "likeness," without its sin in reality. It was in the "likeness of the flesh of sin" that God had the way to condemn sin, that is, to annihilate sin, to abolish sin.</li>	<li>The tabernacle of God (John 1:14b), which refers to Jesus as a man in the flesh to be God's temporary dwelling place on the earth. God dwelt in Him as in the tabernacle (tent) in the wilderness, like the children of Israel had the tabernacle of God as God's dwelling place while they were wandering in the wilderness (Exo. 25:8-9).</li>	<li>The Lamb, the Spirit, the house (Bethel), and the heavenly ladder (John 1:29-51), which form a group of what Christ is, as the Word of God speaking for God, in the accomplishment of God's eternal economy:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Christ is the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world judicially (vv. 29, 36) to make whatever He did for God's economy legal according to the righteousness of God.</li>		<li>Christ firstly had the dove, signifying the Spirit of God, abiding upon Him (vv. 32-33), and subsequently in His resurrection He became, organically, the Spirit of God who gives life (1 Cor. 15:45b). As such a Spirit, He transforms God's redeemed people, who were made with clay, into stones (John 1:37-42).</li>		<li>It is for the building up of the house of God at Bethel (this house of God is the intrinsic and basic line of the Gospel of John concerning the church, the Body of Christ) that His redeemed people are transformed by the Spirit into stones organically (1 Pet. 2:5).</li>		<li>In Bethel, the house of God (the consummation of which is the New Jerusalem&#151;Rev. 21:2), Christ is the heavenly ladder that brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven as well (John 1:51).</li>		<li>In doing all these things for God's economy, Christ is the Messiah, the Christ of God (John 1:41).</li>		</ol>	<li>The temple of God (2:15-22), which Christ called His Father's house, firstly referring to Christ individually before His resurrection and then referring to Christ with His believers as His increase corporately after His resurrection to be God's permanent dwelling place in the spiritual world. This house of the Father is built by Christ and God with the believers as its constituents (14:2, 23).</li>	<li>The serpent lifted up on the cross (3:14), referring to Christ, who was crucified as the biting serpent for all the people bitten by the devil as the serpent, making them serpents (sinners). In His redemption God made Christ the replacement for the sinners, who are serpents in the eyes of God, to suffer God's judgment on the cross. In type the serpent, which signifies Christ as the replacement of God's people, is a bronze serpent, a serpent "in likeness" but not in reality. He "did not know sin" but was only "made sin" by God in its likeness (2 Cor. 5:21). Similarly, in incarnation Christ became "in the likeness of the flesh of sin," without the sin of the flesh (Rom. 8:3).</li>	<li>The eternal life (John 3:15, 16, 36). In this book, the Gospel of John, the eternal life is the basic factor of all that Christ is. Because He is the eternal life, the divine life, even God Himself, He can be what He is and is able to speak for God to carry out the full salvation of God organically for the accomplishment of God's eternal economy, which issues in the New Jerusalem.</li>	<li>The bride, produced by regeneration and taken by Christ as the Bridegroom, is the increase, the enlargement, of Christ, who gives the Spirit not by measure and, as the immeasurable One, gives eternal life (the unlimited life) to His believers (3:29-30, 34, 36).</li>	<li>The spring of living water (4:14) of which God is the fountain. Whoever drinks the living water that Christ gives shall never thirst. Verse 24 in the same chapter indicates that such drinkers are the true worshippers of God, indicating that the true worship of God is to drink of Him in Christ.</li>	</ol></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. IN ADDITION TO THE ITEMS OF CHRIST<br>UNVEILED IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</H2><P>The further revelation of Christ concerning His all-inclusiveness in the Gospel of John is in addition to the items in the Old Testament unveiling the all-unlimitedness of Christ in God's commission to Him, as God's anointed One, for the universe, for fallen man, and for God's kingdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. IN HIS PERFECT REDEMPTION<br>AND IN HIS COMPLETE SALVATION</H2><P>The New Testament unveils Christ in His perfect redemption through His death judicially and in His complete salvation by His life organically for the carrying out of God's eternal economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. God</H2><P>Christ is God, who is the source of all things and especially the source of the divine life that flows out for its dispensing into God's elect as their life and everything (John 1:1, 14; 20:28; Rom. 9:5). John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." Then verse 14 says that "the Word became flesh." The Word is Christ as the definition, explanation, and expression of God. In John 20:28 Thomas said to the resurrected Christ, "My Lord and my God!" The Gospel of John proves strongly that the man Jesus is the very God (1:1-2; 5:17-18; 10:30-33; 14:9-11).</P><P>Romans 9:5 says, "Whose are the fathers, and out of whom, as regards what is according to flesh, is the Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen." The Jehovah's Witnesses have a subtle, evil, and satanic way to distort this verse. We must be clear that Christ is God over all, which means that He is above all the created things, and He is blessed forever. The word blessed here means praised, well spoken of, with adoration of respect and desire. We adore God with our respect to Him and our desire for Him. We worship Him in this way. We desire to have Him, and we love Him. We have to speak well of Christ as God to tell the whole universe what He is. This is our blessing Him to praise Him with our adoration. Christ is our God above all things and is worthy to be praised with well-speaking of adoration, respect, and desire.</P><P>Colossians 2:9 says, "For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily." This verse reveals that in Christ the man dwells all the fullness of the Godhead. The word bodily points to the physical body that Christ put on in His humanity, indicating that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ as the One who has a human body. Before Christ's incarnation, the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him as the eternal Word, but not bodily. From the time that Christ became incarnate, clothed with a human body, the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in Him in a bodily way; and in His glorified body (Phil. 3:21) now and forever it dwells.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Word of God</H2><P>Christ is the Word of God that defines, explains, and expresses God, speaking and revealing God by the Spirit through the Scriptures, the prophets, and the apostles through the ages in many ways (Rev. 19:13; Heb. 1:1-2a; 4:12; 2 Tim. 3:15-17; 1 Pet. 1:10-12; John 6:63).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Life</H2><P>Christ is the life contained in Himself as the Word of God (John 1:4a; 11:25; 14:6; 10:10b) to be the base of a believer's life. Our regenerated life is based upon the very divine life in Christ as the Word. If we are going to enjoy Christ's life, we must come to the Word of Christ. We must pray His Word, say "Amen" to His Word, and sing "Hallelujah" to His Word.</P><P>We can be vitalized by singing the following song with an exercised spirit: "Now Christ is the life-giving Spirit./Now Christ is the Spirit today./Now Christ is the life-giving Spirit,/So turn to your spirit and say,/O Lord! Amen! O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!/O Lord! Amen! O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!" In one meeting in Elden Hall in 1965 I told the saints that we can all say four words. When I spoke this, I did not know what the four words were. Then I said that we can say, "O Lord! Amen! Hallelujah!" This is a simple way to touch the Lord by turning to our spirit. We have a spirit (1 Thes. 5:23), and the Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17) who dwells in our spirit. Therefore, we should turn ourselves from our mind to our spirit, from our thinking to praising.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Light of Life</H2><P>Christ is the light of life (John 1:4b-12; 8:12; 9:5; 12:46) to bring the divine life to the world by shining (speaking) forth God that man may be born of God to be His children, making man God in His life and nature but not in His Godhead. When we receive the shining of the light of life, this shining imparts the divine life into us. That divine life becomes our authority to be God's children (1:12-13), God's kind, God's species, God's family.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Flesh through His Incarnation</H2><P>Christ became the flesh through His incarnation (1:14a), that is, a man fallen in sin, but Romans 8:3 tells us that Christ became the "flesh of sin" only in its "likeness," without its sin in reality. It was in the "likeness of the flesh of sin" that God had the way to condemn sin, that is, to annihilate sin, to abolish sin. Christ became the flesh of sin only in its likeness, like the bronze serpent which Moses lifted up in the wilderness (John 3:14; Num. 21:4-9). This bronze serpent was a type of Christ, indicating that Christ was in the form of a serpent but without the serpentine nature and poison. In Numbers God told the children of Israel to lift up a bronze serpent on a pole. In this way God would condemn the real serpent; that is, He would condemn, annihilate, and take away sin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Tabernacle of God</H2><P>Christ is the tabernacle of God (John 1:14b), which refers to Jesus as a man in the flesh to be God's temporary dwelling place among men on the earth. God dwelt in Him as in the tabernacle (tent) in the wilderness, like the children of Israel had the tabernacle of God as God's dwelling place among them while they were wandering in the wilderness (Exo. 25:8-9). The tabernacle in the wilderness was a prefigure, a type, of Christ being the real tabernacle as God's temporary, movable dwelling place among men on the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Lamb, the Spirit, the House (Bethel),<br>and the Heavenly Ladder</H2><P>The Lamb, the Spirit, the house (Bethel), and the heavenly ladder (John 1:29-51) form a group of what Christ is, as the Word of God speaking for God, in the accomplishment of God's eternal economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Lamb of God</H2><P>Christ is the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world judicially (vv. 29, 36) to make whatever He did for God's economy legal according to the righteousness of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Spirit</H2><P>Christ firstly had the dove, signifying the Spirit of God, abiding upon Him (vv. 32-33), and subsequently in His resurrection He became, organically, the Spirit of God who gives life (1 Cor. 15:45b). As such a Spirit, He transforms God's redeemed people, who were made with clay, into stones (John 1:37-42).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The House (Bethel)</H2><P>It is for the building up of the house of God at Bethel (this house of God is the intrinsic and basic line of the Gospel of John concerning the church, the Body of Christ) that His redeemed people are transformed by the Spirit into stones organically. First Peter 2:4 and 5 say that Christ is a precious stone, a living stone, and we come to Him that we may also become living stones for the building up of God's house. Because of the fall, we became distorted clay. God's way is not to reform distorted ones, but to transform the clay into stones. The Lamb is for redemption. The Spirit is for transformation so that we can be stones for the building up of God's house, Bethel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Heavenly Ladder</H2><P>In Bethel, the house of God (the consummation of which is the New Jerusalem&#151;Rev. 21:2), Christ is the heavenly ladder that brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven as well (John 1:51). A ladder is a stairway by which people can ascend from the earth to something in the air. Christ as the Son of Man, in His humanity, is the ladder as the stairway, the way (14:6a), by which we can ascend from the earth to reach God (heaven&#151;v. 6b). Through Him we reach God. He as such a ladder brings God (heaven) to us and joins us to God (heaven).</P><P>A ladder needs a strong base to stand on. In Genesis 28:12 and 19 the heavenly ladder which Jacob saw took Bethel as its base. Bethel is God's house, God's dwelling place. Today in God's organic salvation, our regenerated spirit is God's dwelling place (Eph. 2:22), even the Holy of Holies of God (Heb. 4:16; 10:19), which Christ as our heavenly ladder takes as His base. Whenever we turn to our spirit, we sense Christ bringing God (heaven) to us and joining us to God (heaven). Thus, Christ as the heavenly ladder is the stairway to bring God to us and join us to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Messiah</H2><P>In doing all these things for God's economy, Christ is the Messiah, the Christ of God (John 1:41). The Messiah of God, the Christ of God, is the God-appointed and God-commissioned One to accomplish God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. The Temple of God</H2><P>As the temple of God, Christ is eternal and immovable (2:15-22). The temple of God, which Christ called His Father's house, firstly refers to Christ individually before His resurrection and then refers to Christ with His believers as His increase corporately after His resurrection to be God's permanent dwelling place in the spiritual world. This house of the Father is built by Christ and God with the believers as its constituents (14:2, 23). All the believers have been transformed to be stones, so they are now the constituents for the building up of God's eternal dwelling place. God's dwelling place is first the church, then the Body of Christ, and consummately the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. The Serpent Lifted Up on the Cross</H2><P>The serpent lifted up on the cross (John 3:14) refers to Christ, who was crucified as the biting serpent for all the people bitten by the devil as the serpent, making them serpents (sinners). In His redemption God made Christ the replacement for the sinners, who are serpents in the eyes of God, to suffer God's judgment on the cross. In type the serpent, which signifies Christ as the replacement of God's people, is a bronze serpent, a serpent "in likeness" but not in reality. He "did not know sin" but He was only "made sin" by God in its likeness (2 Cor. 5:21). Similarly, in incarnation Christ became "in the likeness of the flesh of sin," without the sin of the flesh (Rom. 8:3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. The Eternal Life</H2><P>Christ is the eternal life (John 3:15, 16, 36). In this book, the Gospel of John, the eternal life is the basic factor of all that Christ is. Because He is the eternal life, the divine life, even God Himself, He can be what He is and is able to speak for God to carry out the full salvation of God organically for the accomplishment of God's eternal economy, which issues in the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. The Bride</H2><P>The bride, produced by regeneration and taken by Christ as the Bridegroom, is the increase, the enlargement, of Christ. (Hence, the bride as the increase of Christ is also Christ Himself as 1 Corinthians 12:12 says that the Body of Christ is also Christ.) Christ gives the Spirit not by measure and, as the immeasurable One, gives eternal life (the unlimited life) to His believers (John 3:29-30, 34, 36). I have been speaking about Christ with His riches and all-inclusiveness for many years, but I never used this term&#151;the increasing Christ. Christ increases by regenerating the redeemed sinners, making them His bride, His wife. This bride is Christ's increase.</P><P>Adam and Eve are a type of Christ with His increase. Adam was a bachelor, a single man, but one day the Lord opened his side, took out a rib, and built that rib into Eve as a wife to match Adam (Gen. 2:20b-24). Eve was Adam's increase, and through his wife Adam has billions of descendants, who are also his increase. Every descendant of Adam is a part of Adam's increase. Adam is still increasing today, because the earth's population is continually increasing. All the upcoming new babes are parts of Adam's increase. Adam is a type of Christ (Rom. 5:14), and Eve is a type of the church as the bride of Christ (2 Cor. 11:2-3; Eph. 5:31-32). Not only the wife but also all the children are the increase of the husband. The increase of Christ today on this earth is immeasurable. Christ is still increasing.</P><P>In order for Christ to increase, we need to contact people individually to get them regenerated. We should not take the way of big speakers gathering big congregations in order to gain people. We have to contact people individually, one by one. Then gradually and steadily with the proper care, we as their parents should feed, nourish, and cherish them day by day through the vital groups. In this way Christ will increase continually. Each of us must be in a small group to produce new spiritual children.</P><P>John the Baptist said that he should decrease and that Christ should increase. We should all desire to see Christ increasing and ourselves decreasing. For this we need to speak the Lord's word. The real intrinsic significance of speaking the word of God is to spread God. When we speak the holy Word, the truth, the divine revelation, we spread God. Christ speaks God through us, His members, by defining God, explaining God, and eventually expressing God. To express God is to spread God. Christ is the One who speaks the words of God and who gives the Spirit not by measure (John 3:34). When someone receives His words, the Spirit follows to be the reality of what is spoken. Christ increases Himself by speaking God's word to spread God and by giving the Spirit of God to be the reality of what He spoke in order to dispense the eternal life into people, making them Godkind, the children of God, the species of God, the family of God, to be Christ's increase. This is how Christ becomes the increasing Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. The Spring of Living Water</H2><P>Christ is the spring of living water (John 4:14), of which God is the fountain. Whoever drinks the living water that Christ gives shall never thirst. Verse 24 in the same chapter indicates that such drinkers are the true worshippers of God, indicating that the true worship of God is to drink of Him in Christ to be Christ's increase.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST&#151;<br>THE FURTHER REVELATION OF CHRIST<br>CONCERNING HIS ALL-INCLUSIVENESS<br>IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>In His perfect redemption through His death judicially and in His complete salvation by His life organically for the carrying out of God's eternal economy, He is:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha" start="13">	<li>The Feast of the Passover&#151;John 6:4; 1 Cor. 5:7-8:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>It is the first feast of all the feasts ordained by God for His people (Lev. 23:5), typifying that Christ is the beginning of our enjoyment of Him that originates our spiritual life.</li>		<li>In this feast the main enjoyments are the Passover lamb with its blood for redeeming and its flesh for fighting and walking, and the unleavened bread, signifying a sinless living (Exo. 12:5-8).</li>		<li>In the enjoyment of Christ we must eat His flesh and drink His blood that we may have His eternal life (John 6:54) and eat Him as the heavenly bread that we may live forever (v. 58) through His word, which is spirit and life to us (v. 63).</li>		</ol>	<li>The Feast of Tabernacles&#151;John 7:2:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>John in his Gospel refers to us firstly the Feast of the Passover as the beginning of our enjoyment of Christ for the initiation of God's redemption judicially.</li>		<li>Then he also refers to us the Feast of Tabernacles, signifying the consummation of God's full salvation organically.</li>		<li>The Feast of Tabernacles, which is the last feast of all the feasts ordained by God for His people (Lev. 23:34, 39-43), is for Israel's enjoyment of the rich produce of the good land at its harvest time for their satisfaction.</li>		<li>Christ is our good land with all its produce for our enjoyment and satisfaction.</li>		<li>He cried out on the last day of the feast, saying, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.

These points are of three sections, and these three sections are mostly according to our participating in the Divine Trinity. The first section is from Christ being God (John 1:1) resulting in His being the spring of living water (4:14). Christ is God for the purpose of dispensing Himself into us as the flowing God issuing in the spring of the living water. This section is covered in John 1&#151; 4. John 1 unveils God (v. 1), the Word (vv. 1, 14), the life in the Word (v. 4a), the light of life that shines forth God (v. 4b), the flesh (v. 14a), the tabernacle (v. 14b) to be God's dwelling place among His elect, and a group of four items: the Lamb (v. 29), the Spirit (v. 32), the house, and the ladder (v. 51). The Lamb is for redemption. The Spirit is for life-giving and transforming. Then the transformed stones are built together into the house of God, the church of God and the Body of Christ, which consummate in the New Jerusalem as the real Bethel. The house of God is a base for Christ to be the ladder to join heaven and earth.</P><P>In John 2 Christ is the temple of God (vv. 19-21), built with Christ Himself and all His overcomers as the constituents. In John 3 He is the serpent (v. 14), the eternal life (vv. 15-16, 36), and the Bridegroom, the increasing Christ (vv. 29-30). In John 4 He is the spring of living water to quench our thirst, to satisfy us, make us happy, and be our pleasure (v. 14).</P><P>In the second section, the section of enjoyment, Christ is the Feast of Passover and the Feast of Tabernacles. After this section of feasting, He is the Shepherd to care for us outwardly (10:11, 14, 16) and the Comforter, the Paraclete, to comfort and cherish us inwardly (14:16-17). Eventually, this comforting Spirit becomes the Spirit of life breathed into all Christ's believers (20:22).</P><P>There are some other items of Christ in the vast field of the Gospel of John. Some of these "gleanings" are that Christ is the only begotten Son of God to declare and express God (1:18) and the Messiah, the Christ, anointed by God to carry out His commission (v. 41). He carries out God's commission by being the Lamb to redeem, the Spirit to dispense life and transform, the house, and the ladder.</P><P>Christ is also the Son of Man (v. 51). Jacob in his dream saw angels ascending and descending on a ladder (Gen. 28:12). When the Lord referred to that dream, He said the angels of God ascend and descend upon the Son of Man. The glory of the only begotten Son of God declares and expresses God in His divinity. However, to be the ladder that joins heaven and earth together requires humanity. This is the ministry of the Son of Man. Today, after His resurrection, Christ is still the Son of Man. Jesus told the high priest that he would see "the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven" (Matt. 26:64), and Stephen, when he was being persecuted, said, "I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God" (Acts 7:56). When John saw Christ as the High Priest caring for the lampstands, He was like the Son of Man (Rev. 1:13). For eternity the Lord Jesus will be the Son of Man. Many Christian teachers have seen that He became a God-man, but they have not seen that He also became the man-God, the God in humanity, the God who is the Son of Man. For eternity the Lord Jesus will be the universal, steady, and strong ladder bearing the burden of the heavens and the earth as the Son of Man.</P><P>Additional gleanings of Christ in the Gospel of John include grace (God enjoyed by us) and reality (God realized and gained by us). John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality. Verse 17 says that grace and reality came through Jesus Christ. Christ is also the Creator who can change death into life (water into wine) in chapter two. As the new wine, Christ is for our pleasure and our satisfaction to stir us up. The riches of Christ revealed in the Bible are inexhaustible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>M. The Feast of the Passover</H2><P>In His perfect redemption through His death judicially and in His complete salvation by His life organically for the carrying out of God's eternal economy, Christ is the Feast of the Passover (John 6:4; 1 Cor. 5:7-8). First Corinthians 5:7 says that Christ our Passover has been sacrificed. Christ is not only the Passover lamb but also the entire Passover. Then verse 8 says that today we are keeping the reality of the Feast of Unleavened Bread as the continuation of the Passover (Exo. 12:15-20). The feast is a time for the enjoyment of the banquet. The entire Christian life should be such a feast, such an enjoyment of Christ as our banquet, the rich supply of life. The feast is a table for eating. The Lord's table is a feast. Psalm 23:5 says that the Lord prepares a table, a feast, for us to enjoy in the presence of our enemies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The First Feast</H2><P>Leviticus 23 says that God ordained seven annual feasts for His elect. The first one was the Passover (v. 5), and the last one was the Feast of Tabernacles (v. 34). The Passover is the initiation, and the Feast of Tabernacles is the consummation of our enjoyment of Christ. The Passover, the first feast of all the feasts ordained by God for His people, typifies that Christ is the beginning of our enjoyment of Him that originates our spiritual life. The entire Christian life should be a feast. At other times we have said that the Christian life is a suffering life, but we suffer so that we can feast more. Our suffering helps us to enjoy the Lord. Eventually, our suffering becomes our feasting. This is why Psalm 23:5 says that the Lord has prepared a table before us in the presence of our enemies. Enemies indicates fighting and suffering, but the Lord makes our fighting a feasting and our suffering a table.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Main Enjoyments</H2><P>In this feast the main enjoyments are the Passover lamb with its blood for redeeming and its flesh for fighting and walking, and the unleavened bread, signifying a sinless living (Exo. 12:5-8). The flesh of the lamb is organic and the blood is judicial. The blood redeems us judicially and the flesh of the lamb is for God's elect to eat so that they can be nourished and strengthened to walk out of Egypt organically. Christ today is the Lamb with His blood for redemption and with Himself for strengthening and nourishing us so that we can walk on God's way out of Egypt. At the same time, we also eat Christ as the unleavened bread, signifying that we are living a sinless life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Partaking of Christ through His Word,<br>Which Is Spirit and Life to Us</H2><P>In the enjoyment of Christ we must eat His flesh and drink His blood that we may have His eternal life (John 6:54) and eat Him as the heavenly bread that we may live forever (v. 58) through His word, which is spirit and life to us (v. 63). In John 3 we saw that Christ as the Bridegroom, who is above all things (vv. 29-31), speaks the words of God to spread God. Following the spreading of God, He gives the Spirit without measure (v. 34). Then He gives the eternal life (v. 36). Thus, in chapter three, just as in chapter six, there are the word, the Spirit, and life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>N. The Feast of Tabernacles</H2><P>Christ is the Feast of Tabernacles (John 7:2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Passover Being the Initiation</H2><P>John in his Gospel refers to us firstly the Feast of the Passover as the beginning of our enjoyment of Christ for the initiation of God's redemption judicially.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Feast of Tabernacles<br>Being the Consummation</H2><P>Then he also refers to us the Feast of Tabernacles, signifying the consummation of God's full salvation organically. After the full harvest of their crops from the good land, the Jewish people observed the Feast of Tabernacles to worship God and enjoy what they had reaped (Deut. 16:13-15). Actually, their coming together was a real picture of blending. All of the people of Israel were required to go to Jerusalem three times a year for this blending. The last time was in the fall after the harvest to enjoy their produce from the harvest of the good land in their praise to God with adoration, to bless God and speak well of God.</P><P>God ordained the Feast of Tabernacles so that the children of Israel would remember how their fathers, while wandering in the wilderness, had lived in tents (Lev. 23:39-43), expecting to enter into the rest of the good land. Everyone had a tent, and God had a tabernacle among these tents, so the Feast of Tabernacles was a remembrance of God's story. This points to what the Lord said when He established His table. He told us to eat the bread and drink the wine in remembrance of Him (Luke 22:19-20). The Lord's table is a remembrance just as the Feast of Tabernacles was a remembrance.</P><P>This feast is a reminder that today people are still in the wilderness and need to enter into the rest of the New Jerusalem, which is the eternal tabernacle (Rev. 21:2-3). Although the New Jerusalem will be solidly built with gold, pearls, and precious stones, it will be called a tabernacle. The New Jerusalem is the tabernacle for the remembrance of how the overcomers, before the consummation of the New Jerusalem in the kingdom age, were still living in tents; they were not settled yet. When they enter into the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth, they will no longer be living in tents, but they will still call their eternal dwelling place the tabernacle in remembrance of what they experienced. When we enter into the New Jerusalem, we will have many eternal and joyful memories of what we experienced. The reality of the Feast of Tabernacles is a time of enjoyment in remembrance of how we experienced God and of how God lived with us. We lived in tents, and He lived in a tabernacle. Eventually, our Feast of Tabernacles will be the enjoyment of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. That will be the real consummation of all the harvest of our experience of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. For Israel's Enjoyment<br>of the Rich Produce of the Good Land</H2><P>The Feast of Tabernacles, which is the last feast of all the feasts ordained by God for His people (Lev. 23:34, 39-43), is for Israel's enjoyment of the rich produce of the good land at its harvest time for their satisfaction.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Christ Being Our Good Land</H2><P>Christ is our good land with all its produce for our enjoyment and satisfaction.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Crying Out on the Last Day of the Feast</H2><P>He cried out on the last day of the feast, saying, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" (John 7:37-38). The Feast of Tabernacles was just a type of Christ as the reality. That feast did not satisfy them, so on the last day the Lord cried out that whoever is thirsty, unsatisfied, should come to Him to drink for their real satisfaction.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The Call of the Spirit with the Bride</H2><P>This call is repeated by the Spirit with the bride for people to participate in the enjoyment of Christ in the New Jerusalem in John's last book, that is, the book of Revelation (22:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Real Satisfaction</H2><P>This indicates that the people who held the Feast of Tabernacles were not satisfied; the real satisfaction was to receive Christ and drink of Him that they would be not only satisfied but also overflowing with rivers of living water. This overflow of the riches is the expressed riches, the fullness. Originally all the riches were contained in God, but now they become our enjoyment to such an extent that they overflow to express the riches of our enjoyment of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. The Enjoyment for Satisfaction</H2><P>This is the enjoyment for satisfaction in drinking the river of water of life in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 22:1-2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. The New Jerusalem Being Called the Tabernacle</H2><P>Hence, the New Jerusalem is called the tabernacle, indicating that those who participate in the New Jerusalem are the real keepers of the Feast of Tabernacles for eternity with full enjoyment and satisfaction.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. The Thought of Remembrance</H2><P>The word Tabernacles in the title of the Feast of Tabernacles implies the thought of remembrance, that is, the Israelite keepers of the Feast of Tabernacles should remember that their forefathers dwelt in tents (tabernacles) in their wandering in the wilderness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. The New Jerusalem<br>Being Called the Tabernacle of God<br>for the Remembrance of the Overcomers</H2><P>Similarly, even the New Jerusalem is called the tabernacle of God (Rev. 21:2-3) for the remembrance of the overcomers, who dwelt also in tents, in the first stage of the New Jerusalem in the kingdom age.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>12. The New Jerusalem Being Consummated</H2><P>The New Jerusalem will be consummated firstly to be the firstfruits in the millennial kingdom as a reward to the overcomers and then consummated lastly to be in the new heaven and new earth as the full enjoyment of God's full salvation to all the perfected believers. This will be the real Feast of Tabernacles.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST&#151;<br>THE FURTHER REVELATION OF CHRIST<br>CONCERNING HIS ALL-INCLUSIVENESS<br>IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>In His perfect redemption through His death judicially and in His complete salvation by His life organically for the carrying out of God's eternal economy, He is:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha" start="15">	<li>The Shepherd, the door, the pasture, and the flock&#151;John 10:11, 14, 16, 7, 9:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Christ, with the commission He received of God to accomplish God's eternal economy, has to be the Shepherd of the flock of God, which is His Body that consummates the New Jerusalem.</li>		<li>To be such a Shepherd He has to be the door for the release of so many sheep of God's flock in Judaism.

Vanity, as described by Solomon in Ecclesiastes, and death, as explained by Paul in his Epistles, can never be the way for anyone to participate in the organism of the processed Triune God.</li>		<li>The reality is all that God is, which becomes the person of Christ. The way to participate in the divine and human constitution, which is the organic Body of Christ, is to enjoy all that the person of Christ is, which is His unsearchable riches (Eph. 3:8).</li>		<li>Life is the divine element of the person of Christ.

The first section in chapters one through four is on twelve items of what Christ is: God, the Word, life, light, the flesh, the tabernacle, the group of the Lamb, the Spirit, the house, and the ladder, the temple, the serpent, the eternal life, the Bridegroom, and the spring of living water. The second section in chapters six and seven is on Christ as our enjoyment, signified by the Feast of Passover and the Feast of Tabernacles. The third section in chapters eight through fourteen is a section of Christ's divine care. In His divine care for us, He is first the Shepherd and then the Comforter.</P><P>The Greek word for Comforter is Paracletos. It refers to one who is at your side to take care of you in every way. The word carries the sense of consoling and consolation. It is used in the Gospel of John (14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7) for the Spirit of reality as our Comforter within us, the One who takes care of our case and our affairs. It also refers to one who offers legal aid as an advocate. First John 2:1 says that if we sin, we have Christ as an Advocate (Paracletos) with the Father. In this sense we have Christ as a Lawyer, an Attorney, in the heavenly court to take care of our cases. Also, in our inner life we have innumerable needs which require His care as our Comforter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>O. The Shepherd, the Door, the Pasture,<br>and the Flock</H2><P>The Lord's shepherding, revealed in chapter ten, actually begins in chapters eight and nine. In chapter eight there is a woman caught in the act of adultery. In chapter nine there is a man blind from birth. This blind man was a sheep who was led out of the Judaism-fold. The sheep shepherded by Christ in chapter nine is a male, whereas the one in chapter eight is a female.</P><P>She was caught in the act of adultery by the hypocritical scribes and Pharisees (8:1-11). They brought her and set her in the midst of where the Lord was teaching in the temple. Then they asked the Lord, "In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. What then do you say?" (v. 5). At first the Lord would not answer. Instead, He stooped down and wrote with His finger on the ground. This was a sign done to humble and calm the self-righteous scribes and Pharisees. It might have been that the Lord was writing, "Who among you is without sin?" When they persisted in questioning Him, the Lord said to them, "He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her" (v. 7). After He said this, He stooped down and wrote on the ground again, and all the accusers of the woman left one by one, beginning with the older ones. Then the Lord stood up and said to the woman, "Has no one condemned you?" She said, "No one, Lord." And Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you" (vv. 10-11a). What a sweet word! According to the law, such a sinner should be stoned; but Christ, who came full of grace and truth, would not condemn her. Instead, He said, "Go, and from now on sin no more" (v. 11b).</P><P>If I were the woman, I might say, "Lord, thank You for Your forgiveness, but how can I sin no more?" This is why chapter eight goes on to show us how to be freed from sin. In this chapter the Lord told us three times that He is the great I Am who can set people free from sin. In verse 24 He said, "Unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins." Verse 28 says, "Jesus therefore said to them, When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am, and that I do nothing from Myself, but as My Father has taught Me, I speak these things." Then verse 58 says, "Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I am." Seemingly, the Lord was mistaken in grammar. He should have said, "Before Abraham came into being, I was." But with the Lord there is just one tense&#151;the present tense. With Him there is no element of time. He does not say, "I was." Instead, He says, "I am. I am forever. I am in eternity past. I am in eternity future." This great I Am not only will forgive you but also will set you free from sin. John 8:32 says, "And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free." Then verse 36 says, "If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed." As the I Am, the Lord is the One who is able to free us from sin.</P><P>In the age of grace, Christ is qualified to forgive and redeem judicially. He is also qualified to set us free from sin organically. This is the proper shepherding. In our vital groups, we need leaders who know how to shepherd sinners who need the forgiveness of sins and the setting free from sins. If all the saints practice this kind of shepherding, the vital groups will be flourishing. When the Lord Jesus was teaching in the temple in John 8, He was shepherding a lost sheep in sin who was shamefully caught by the hypocritical scribes and Pharisees. He shepherded her first by telling her that He did not condemn her. Then He shepherded her further to free her from sin.</P><P>In chapter nine there is the Lord's shepherding of a blind man in religion. After the Lord healed this man, the Pharisees said to him, "Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner." But he responded by saying, "Whether or not He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see" (vv. 24-25). The Lord shepherds us by forgiving our sins, setting us free from sin, and opening our eyes to see. If we are not certain about the divine things, that means we are still blind and need our eyes opened by the Lord.</P><P>The Lord Jesus revealed in chapter ten that He is the Shepherd, the door, and the pasture (vv. 11, 14, 16, 7, 9). The door is for people to go in and come out. When they come out, He is the pasture to them. That means He is a feast for the shepherded sheep. Christ was the door in the Old Testament age for His people to enter into God's economy by being kept in the custody of the law. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and their descendants such as David, Solomon, Isaiah, and Jeremiah entered into the fold of the law in a positive sense. Christ, the Messiah, was a door for the positive Old Testament saints to go into the God-prepared fold to be kept there until He, the Messiah, would come in the New Testament. In the Old Testament, Christ was the door to go in. In the New Testament, He is the door to come out. One of those who came out was the blind man healed by the Lord in John 9.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Shepherd of the Flock of God</H2><P>Christ, with the commission He received of God to accomplish God's eternal economy, has to be the Shepherd of the flock of God, which is His Body that consummates the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Door</H2><P>To be such a Shepherd He has to be the door for the release of so many sheep of God's flock in Judaism. He was also the door for the Old Testament saints such as Abraham (John 8:56) and even Moses to enter in through their expectation of the coming Messiah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Pasture</H2><P>Now after setting them free from the Judaistic fold, He feeds them with Himself as the rich pasture of life. This pasture equals the feasts in chapters six and seven.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Flock</H2><P>This is for them to be flocked together with God's other sheep (the Gentile believers) to be His one organic Body to arrive at the ultimate goal of God's economy&#151;the New Jerusalem. If we feast on Christ as the pasture, we like to be flocked together with others. The more we enjoy Christ, the more we like to fellowship with others. If we feed upon Christ as our pasture in the morning, enjoying Him as the feast, we will eagerly go to the meeting in the evening.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>P. The Resurrection and the Life</H2><P>John 10 is on shepherding, and John 11 shows that shepherding must be with resurrection life (v. 25). If we are natural, full of the natural view, natural philosophy, and natural logic, we cannot feed others. We will be dead, and that death will kill the meetings. If we are persons in resurrection, we are in life. Actually resurrection and life are one. They are "twin brothers." When we are in life, we become persons who shepherd others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Martha Counting on the Matter of Time</H2><P>At the death of Lazarus, his sister Martha counted on the matter of time, not on the person of Christ. She said to Him, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died" (John 11:21). That meant that Martha was asking the Lord why He had not come earlier. To her understanding, whether her brother would die or live was a matter of time. She did not see that Christ Himself, the person, is the resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Christ Being Resurrection All the Time</H2><P>Christ, as the embodiment of God, is the resurrection all the time, even before He was resurrected. Whether Lazarus died or lived, Christ is always the resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Exercise of Himself as Resurrection</H2><P>Not only was the resurrecting of Lazarus His exercise as the resurrection, but also all the miracles done by Him were the exercise of Himself as the resurrection. When He healed the blind man, that was His exercise of Himself as resurrection. A living person in resurrection has the light of life to see.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Overcoming Death and All the Things Belonging to Death</H2><P>Resurrection is mainly to overcome death and all the things belonging to death. Blindness, dumbness, deafness, and all kinds of sickness belong to death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Everything Christ Does in His Believers<br>Being the Exercise of Himself as Resurrection</H2><P>Before Martha came to Him, Christ was the resurrection when He did the many miracles of healing. Today with His believers everything He accomplishes is the exercise of Himself as the resurrection. Regenerating, sanctifying, renewing, transforming, conforming, and even glorifying are the exercise of Christ as the resurrection who is life eternal.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Q. The One Grain of Wheat</H2><P>Christ is the one grain of wheat (John 12:24) for death resulting in resurrection. This refers to Himself as the divine seed to produce many grains (the people who receive Him) to become His many members who constitute His organic Body which consummates in the New Jerusalem. If one grain of wheat remains whole, it is only one grain. But when it falls into the earth and dies, it will grow and bring forth many grains in resurrection. These many grains are to be ground and blended into flour to make a loaf, which signifies the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 10:17). Although we are the many grains, we do not like to be ground in order to be blended. But we need to be broken. Then we can be blended with others. We should not remain as whole grains. We have to be broken and ground into fine flour so that we can be blended with others for making a loaf. This loaf is the Body of Christ which consummates in the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>R. The Way, the Reality, and the Life</H2><P>In John 14:6 the Lord said that He is the way, the reality, and the life. In order to understand this verse, we must take care of its context. The context begins from chapter eight, which is concerning the Lord's shepherding. In His shepherding care for us, He is the way. Without Him there is no way for us to shepherd others. He is not only the way but also the reality. The way without the reality means vanity. The way needs the reality, and the reality needs the life. If it is a dead reality, it is still vanity. It must be a living reality. We need to experience Christ as the way, the reality, and the life for us to shepherd others.</P><P>Someone may come to us and say, "I hate to lose my temper, but I lose my temper all the time. What can I do?" We should help him to enjoy Christ by calling on His name and by opening up His Word to digest one or two verses by pray-reading them. In other words, we need to help him to be fed and satisfied with Christ. The very Christ who satisfies us is the way for us not to lose our temper. We need to shepherd people in this way in the vital groups. According to ethical logic, a person should learn how to be patient and endure to overcome his temper, but this does not work. We all need to exercise to take Christ as the way. Then He becomes our reality as our satisfaction, our pleasure. Then we have the life supply to live Him for the whole day.</P><P>John 14 through 16 is a long discourse of Christ on the night before His crucifixion. That discourse is concerning the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God, the constitution of the processed Triune God with His regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed people. To participate in this organism, the divine and human constitution, we need the way, the reality, and the life, all of which are the exercise of Christ as the eternal resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Way</H2><P>The way is Christ in resurrection to be our reality and life. Vanity, as described by Solomon in Ecclesiastes, and death, as explained by Paul in his Epistles, can never be the way for anyone to participate in the organism of the processed Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Reality</H2><P>The reality is all that God is, which becomes the person of Christ. The way to participate in the divine and human constitution, which is the organic Body of Christ, is to enjoy all that the person of Christ is, which is His unsearchable riches (Eph. 3:8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Life</H2><P>Life is the divine element of the person of Christ. If we have Christ, we possess the divine element, which is His divine constitution of all the attributes of what God is. In regeneration we have received this life, and in the growth of the divine life through sanctification, renewing, transformation, etc., we participate in the reality of Christ, which is the way for us to enter into the Body of Christ, which is the Father's house that consummates the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>S. The Comforter</H2><P>The Comforter refers first to Christ coming in the flesh to be the first Comforter (Paraclete) to take care of our cases and affairs. In His first stage He was the first Comforter; in His second stage He is the second Comforter. The first stage is Christ in the flesh, from His incarnation to His death, and the second stage is Christ as the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ. In the second stage Christ as the Spirit is our second Comforter both in us and in heaven before God the Father (John 14:16-17; 1 John 2:1).</P><P>In John 14 the Lord said that He would ask the Father to give us another Comforter, that is, the Spirit of reality. The Lord said that when the Spirit of reality came, He would be not only with us but also in us. Verse 20 says, "In that day [the day of resurrection] you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you." Christ is in the Father, and we are in Christ. This means that we are in the Father also by being in Christ. We and He are in the Father at the same time. Also, Christ is in us. Since Christ is in the Father, the Father is also in us with Christ. This is not merely union or mingling but an incorporation. The Triune God has been incorporated into us, and we have been incorporated into the Triune God. John 14:20 reveals three parties with three ins. This is a divine and mystical incorporation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>T. The All-inclusive Consummated Spirit</H2><P>Christ is now the all-inclusive consummated Spirit (John 20:22). In the Gospel of John, a book of the divine, mystical life in the divine, mystical realm, Christ is first the very God (1:1), and He eventually is consummated as the all-inclusive Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Consummated Spirit Being Christ's Breath</H2><P>In the evening on the day of resurrection, Christ came to the disciples, who were in a room with the doors shut (John 20:19). Then He breathed into them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit" (v. 22). The Spirit as breath was breathed into the disciples for their life. By breathing the Spirit into the disciples, the Lord imparted Himself into them as life and everything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>The consummated Spirit is the Holy Spirit of God processed through Christ's death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), who is the consummation of the earthly ministry of Christ and the ending of Christ's speaking from His incarnation, God becoming the flesh, to His transfiguration of the flesh, the last Adam becoming the life-giving Spirit. In the next message we will fellowship about the consummated Spirit in more detail.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Before the consummation of the Spirit, He was:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Spirit of God in God's creation&#151;Gen. 1:2.</li>	<li>The Spirit of Jehovah in God's contact with man&#151;Judg. 6:34; Isa. 61:1.</li>	<li>The Spirit of holiness in God's dealing with man&#151;Psa. 51:11; Isa. 63:10-11.</li>	</ol><li>Through the processes which the Triune God has completed, the Spirit of God as the processed Triune God has been consummated into the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit to be:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>"The Spirit," who was not yet before the resurrection of Christ (John 7:39), compounded with Christ's divinity, humanity, death with its effectiveness, and resurrection with its power to be the compound anointing ointment&#151;Exo. 30:23-25.</li>	<li>The consummated Spirit of the Triune God as the consummation of the Triune God.</li>	<li>The Spirit who has been consummated to be the consummation of the Triune God as the eternal Husband speaking with His bride, the Body of Christ, to be the eternal and universal couple&#151;Rev. 22:17.</li>	<li>The Spirit of life&#151;Rom. 8:2.</li>	<li>The Spirit of Christ, who is the Spirit of the Christ in resurrection&#151;the pneumatic Christ&#151;Rom. 8:9.</li>	<li>The indwelling Spirit, who dispenses the resurrection life to the believers' mortal body&#151;Rom. 8:11.</li>	<li>The Spirit of Jesus is the Spirit of the incarnated Savior who, as Jesus in humanity, passed through human living and death on the cross.

This new point is that the all-inclusive Christ who is everything to us is our Shepherd. He is not just everything to us; He is also taking care of us. His caring for us is of two aspects: the aspect of shepherding by the Shepherd and the aspect of comforting by the Comforter. These two aspects of Christ's taking care of us are of two stages. The shepherding is in His stage in the flesh. The second aspect of comforting is in the second stage of Christ as the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ.</P><P>In John 14 the Lord told us that He is in the Father and the Father is in Him (v. 10). They are coinhering. Then He said, "I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter" (v. 16). This indicates that He was the first Comforter. The first Comforter was not called the Comforter, but the Shepherd. The Shepherd supplies the necessities of the flock, but we need something more intrinsic, more organic, and more tender. We need an inward, organic comforting&#151;shepherding as in 1 Peter 2:25, which says that He is the Shepherd of our souls. This is the inward shepherding of the processed and consummated Triune God united, mingled, and incorporated with His regenerated and transformed elect.</P><P>In John 14 there are four ins showing this incorporation. Verse 17 says that the Spirit of reality as the Comforter will be in us. Then verse 20 reveals that the Son is in the Father, the believers are in the Son, and the Son is in the believers. These four ins show how intrinsic and organic our relationship with the processed Triune God is. Many Christians are not clear about this intrinsic, organic relationship between the processed Triune God and the transformed believers. Today is not the stage of Christ in the flesh. This is the stage of Christ as the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ. If He were still in the flesh, He could never be in us and we could never be in Him. For Him to be in us and for us to be in Him, He must be pneumatic; He must be the Spirit. We must see this great vision.</P><P>This union, mingling, and incorporation issue in three great things: the Father's house, the vine tree, and the new child. The first issue is the house of the Father in John 14. "In My Father's house are many abodes" (v. 2). Verse 23 says that the Son and the Father will come to His lover, who is indwelt by the Spirit, and make a mutual abode with him. This is the building. The second issue in John 15 is the organism of the Father, the great vine tree, which is Christ Himself (v. 1). We are His branches, His members, to bear fruit to express the Father (vv. 5, 8). The third issue in John 16 is the new child, who is the new man, brought forth by the travailing woman (vv. 21-22). The new man was created by Christ on the cross in Himself as the element (Eph. 2:15) and was born, brought forth, in resurrection to be a new babe. These three&#151;the Father's house, the universal vine, and the new child to consummate the new man&#151;refer to the church as the Body of Christ that consummates in the New Jerusalem for Him to take the base to be the heavenly ladder, not in divinity, but in humanity as the Son of Man.</P><P>He is the Son of Man at the right hand of God in ascension (Acts 7:56). During the church age He is trimming the lampstands as the Son of Man (Rev. 1:13). He will sit on the cloud as the Son of Man to reap His harvest at the end of this age (Rev. 14:14-16). He will return as the Son of Man in His second coming (Matt. 26:64). Finally, in eternity He will be the Son of Man as the heavenly ladder bringing heaven to earth and joining earth to heaven forever (John 1:51). Our Lord is divine, yet He has become the Son of Man. He is solid and strong in His humanity. He defeated Satan as a man (Heb. 2:14). God would not lower His rank to defeat Satan directly. Thus, He became the Son of Man in humanity, in the rank of a creature, to defeat another rebellious creature, Satan.</P><P>After the Lord's long discourse in John 14 through 16, which was His last speaking on earth, He had a concluding prayer in chapter seventeen. Chapters twelve through seventeen are on Christ's death unto glorification. He is the grain of wheat who needed to die (John 12:24). For Him to die was not bad but glorious, because His death as the grain of wheat was unto glorification in His resurrection. In verse 23 of John 12 He said, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified." Then in John 17 He prayed, "Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You" (v. 1). Death is unto resurrection, and resurrection means glorification. When Christ is resurrected, that means He is glorified. This is the issue of His death. If Christ had remained living, He could never have been glorified. He needed to go through the death which issued in His resurrection, that is, in His glorification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. BEFORE THE CONSUMMATION OF THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Now that we have covered the Word, God, and the all-inclusive Christ, we need to go on to see the consummated Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Spirit of God</H2><P>Before the consummation of the Spirit, He was the Spirit of God in God's creation (Gen. 1:2). In God's creation He was the Spirit of God brooding over the death waters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Spirit of Jehovah</H2><P>He was the Spirit of Jehovah in God's contact with man (Judg. 6:34; Isa. 61:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Spirit of Holiness</H2><P>He was the Spirit of holiness in God's dealing with man (Psa. 51:11; Isa. 63:10-11). First God created man, then God contacted man, and then God dealt with man as the Spirit of holiness. In the Old Testament the title the Holy Spirit was not used. The Holy Spirit was first used as a divine title in the New Testament in relation to the incarnation (Matt. 1:18, 20; Luke 1:35) to make man holy. He is the Holy Spirit to sanctify the One who was born through incarnation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE ALL-INCLUSIVE, LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</H2><P>Through the processes which the Triune God has completed, the Spirit of God as the processed Triune God has been consummated into the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit to be the following items.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Spirit, Who Was Not Yet</H2><P>He was consummated to be "the Spirit," who was not yet before the resurrection of Christ (John 7:39), compounded with Christ's divinity, humanity, death with its effectiveness, and resurrection with its power to be the compound anointing ointment (Exo. 30:23-25). The Spirit was not yet at the time of John 7:39 because He had not yet been consummated by the resurrection of Christ. Before the resurrection of Christ, that is, before Christ's glorification, the Spirit was not yet. The Spirit of God in the Old Testament was the Spirit with merely the divine element, but in resurrection He was compounded with the humanity of Christ, with His all-inclusive death and its effectiveness, and with His resurrection and its power, which repels all the negative things. He is now rich with all of these elements.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Consummated Spirit of the Triune God</H2><P>He is the consummated Spirit of the Triune God as the consummation of the Triune God. This means He is the totality of the consummated Triune God because He has gone through incarnation, human living, death on the cross, resurrection, and ascension.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Eternal Husband</H2><P>The Spirit who has been consummated to be the consummation of the Triune God is the eternal Husband speaking with His bride, the Body of Christ, to be the eternal and universal couple (Rev. 22:17). The consummation of the Triune God is a Husband. The Bridegroom is Christ (John 3:29) and the regenerated believers are the bride. Eventually, Christ will have a wedding, and that wedding day will last one thousand years in the kingdom age. The kingdom age will be a celebration of the wedding of Christ (Rev. 19:7-9) and the New Jerusalem will be the bride (Rev. 21:2). In Revelation 22:17 the Spirit is with the bride; therefore, the Spirit must be the Husband. This is a universal romance between the saving God and the saved believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Spirit of life</H2><P>The compounded Spirit is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Spirit of Christ</H2><P>He is also the Spirit of Christ, who is the Spirit of the Christ in resurrection&#151;the pneumatic Christ (Rom. 8:9). Romans 8 speaks of the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of God. These terms are interchangeably used. These are not three Spirits, but one Spirit in three aspects referring to the same person&#151;the pneumatic Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Indwelling Spirit</H2><P>The consummated Spirit is the indwelling Spirit who dispenses the resurrection life to the believers' mortal body (Rom. 8:11). If we allow the Spirit to indwell us, He will enliven and strengthen our weak and dying body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Spirit of Jesus</H2><P>The Spirit of Jesus is the Spirit of the incarnated Savior who, as Jesus in humanity, passed through human living and death on the cross. This indicates that in the Spirit of Jesus there is not only the divine element of God but also the human elements of His human living and His suffering of death (Acts 16:7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. The Spirit of Jesus Christ</H2><P>He is the Spirit of Jesus Christ, who ministers the bountiful supply to the believers. Philippians 1:19 reveals that we can be saved organically in our daily life by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Day by day we pass through trying circumstances and sufferings which can bring us down, but we have the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ to save, support, strengthen, hold, and establish us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. The Seven Spirits</H2><P>The consummated Spirit is the seven Spirits before the throne of God. He is the sevenfold intensified Spirit to meet the need of the believers in the degradation of the churches (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT<br>HAVING BEEN BREATHED INTO THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>The consummated Spirit as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God has been breathed into the believers in Christ (John 20:19-22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. As the Spirit of Life</H2><P>He was breathed into the believers as the Spirit of life, not the Spirit of power who was poured out in Acts 2 on the day of Pentecost. The breathing breath in John 20 is not the blowing wind in Acts 2.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. By the Resurrected Christ</H2><P>The resurrected Christ, the pneumatic Christ, was the Breather.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. On the Day of Resurrection</H2><P>The consummated Spirit is the divine breath, breathed by the pneumatic Christ into the believers on the day of His resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. As a Sign of Being Sent by Christ</H2><P>His breathing the consummated Spirit into us is a sign that He is going to send us (John 20:21). We are now receiving the breathing to be sent as sons of God and prophets to speak to our relatives, neighbors, and colleagues.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. As a Conclusion concerning God</H2><P>This is a conclusion concerning God, who was mentioned at the beginning (1:1) of John's Gospel on life. John 1:1 tells us that the Word was God. At the beginning He was God. At the conclusion He is the Spirit as the breath, breathed into all of us. Now He is the indwelling Spirit.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CONSUMMATION<br>OF THE COMPLETE SALVATION OF CHRIST</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The church, the Body of Christ, as the bride, the wife, of Christ is the consummation of His complete salvation by His ministry in three stages with the twenty all-inclusive items of what He is, from God to the life-giving Spirit:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>By the judicial redemption accomplished by Christ as the flesh in His incarnation.</li>	<li>By His organic salvation carried out by Him as the life-giving Spirit in His inclusion.</li>	<li>By the intensified work of His organic salvation by Him as the sevenfold intensified Spirit in His intensification.</li>	</ol><li>The bride, the wife, of Christ will be prepared in full by Him for His wedding as His pleasure and satisfaction at the opening of the kingdom age:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The kingdom age will be one thousand years as one wedding day to celebrate the exultant wedding of Christ.</li>	<li>This excellent consummation, the bride, the wife, of Christ, of His complete salvation will be the New Jerusalem in its initial consummation for the celebration of Christ's wedding for one thousand years.</li>	<li>It will be for Christ's eternal enjoyment in its ultimate consummation in the new heaven and new earth for eternity.</li>	</ol></ol><P>In this message I have a burden to give a concluding word to our fellowship concerning the all-inclusive Christ. In the Gospel of John, the all-inclusive Christ is unveiled in twenty items, from God (1:1) to the consummated Spirit of life (20:22). In His complete salvation, Christ is everything to us. This complete salvation includes His judicial redemption and His organic salvation with its intensified work. The consummation and outcome of this salvation show us where the Lord's heart is and what the Lord desires to have.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE CHURCH, THE BODY OF CHRIST,<br>AS THE BRIDE, THE WIFE, OF CHRIST</H2><P>The church, the Body of Christ, as the bride, the wife, of Christ is the consummation of His complete salvation by His ministry in three stages with the twenty all-inclusive items of what He is, from God to the life-giving Spirit. The parable of the pearl in Matthew 13:45-46 shows us what Christ desires to have: "Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking fine pearls; and finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it." The Lord surely loves sinners and He desires all men to be saved, but ultimately His desire is to have this pearl of great value spoken of in Matthew 13. This pearl is the church as the consummation of His complete salvation. Christ as the merchant seeking pearls found one pearl of great value and sold all that He had by going to the cross to purchase it. Acts 20:28 says that God purchased the church with His own blood. The desire of Christ in accomplishing redemption and carrying out His organic salvation is that He would gain not merely individuals but the church, which is the Body of Christ.</P><P>Ephesians 1 is a long chapter telling us how God operated in His Divine Trinity for His eternal purpose: The Father selected and predestinated us (vv. 4-5), the Son redeemed us (v. 7), and the Spirit seals us and becomes our pledge (vv. 13-14). Moreover, the Son, who is commissioned by the Triune God to carry out God's complete salvation, resurrected and ascended to the heavens to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (vv. 20-23).</P><P>The church, which is Christ's Body, is the pearl of great value which He desires to have. This is a great and critical matter. What does our God want? What does the very God whom we are seeking desire? We have to be careful. Otherwise, we will miss Him. What He wants is this great pearl by His ministry in three stages: the stage of incarnation, the stage of inclusion, and the stage of intensification. When we experience the all-inclusive items of what Christ is, we become a part of His increase, which is His Body, the church. This is the issue, the result, as the consummation of His complete salvation by His ministry with all that He is. We are seeking God, but if we do not carefully consider what He desires, we will miss Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. By His Judicial Redemption</H2><P>Christ works to gain His desire first by the judicial redemption accomplished by Him as the flesh in His incarnation (John 1:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. By His Organic Salvation</H2><P>Then Christ carries out His organic salvation by Himself as the life-giving Spirit in His stage of inclusion (1 Cor. 15:45b). He was God, and then He became the flesh. As the flesh, through His death and resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit includes all the elements of Christ's person and work. Divinity, humanity, Christ's death with its effectiveness, and His resurrection with its power are all included in the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. By the Intensified Work<br>of His Organic Salvation</H2><P>The intensified work of Christ's organic salvation is carried out by Him as the sevenfold intensified Spirit in His intensification (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6). Incarnation, inclusion, and intensification are the three stages of Christ for Him to consummate His complete salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE BRIDE, THE WIFE, OF CHRIST</H2><P>The bride, the wife, of Christ will be prepared in full by Him for His wedding as His pleasure and satisfaction at the opening of the kingdom age. The preparation of the bride is by Christ's redemption, organic salvation, and the intensified work of His organic salvation. Revelation 19 says the bride is prepared fully by being properly adorned. Christ is now adorning us to make us His bride. Christ's pleasure and satisfaction is His bride prepared, adorned, in full. Revelation 19:7-9 says, "Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready. And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints. And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they who are called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true words of God." This takes place at the opening of the kingdom age.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Wedding Day</H2><P>The kingdom age will be one thousand years as one wedding day to celebrate the exultant wedding of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The New Jerusalem in Its Initial Consummation</H2><P>This excellent consummation, the bride, the wife, of Christ, of His complete salvation will be the New Jerusalem in its initial consummation for the celebration of Christ's wedding for one thousand years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Its Ultimate Consummation</H2><P>The New Jerusalem will be for Christ's eternal enjoyment in its ultimate consummation in the new heaven and new earth for eternity.</P><P>I hope this clear word will really reach us and be received by us with full willingness. Then we will be blessed to be invited to participate in Christ's wedding as His bride, and eventually we will all be a part of the wife of Christ.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE GLORIFICATION OF CHRIST<br>BY GOD WITH HIS GLORY</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The Gospel of John, a full revelation of Christ as the Word of God defining God and revealing God, is composed of two sections:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The first section, from 1:1 to 12:19, unveils:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Christ's becoming flesh in His incarnation.</li>		<li>And His earthly living and ministry in His humanity.</li>		</ol>	<li>The second section, from 12:20 to 20:29, unveils:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Christ to be glorified by God with His glory.</li>		<li>And the issue of His glorification through death and resurrection, as the many grains produced by the one grain in 12:24.</li>		</ol>	</ol><li>The glory of God is God Himself expressed&#151;Acts 7:2.</li><li>God the Father has given His glory to the Son, and this glory is the sonship to express God in His fullness&#151;John 5:26.</li><li>The glory of the Father was concealed in the shell of His humanity, His flesh.</li><li>He glorified the Father by manifesting Him in His earthly living and ministry&#151;John 17:4.</li><li>The Son prayed that the Father would glorify His name, and the Father answered Him, "I have both glorified it and will glorify it again"&#151;John 12:28.</li><li>The Son has given the Father's glory to express the Father in His sonship to His believers (John 17:22), who are the many sons of God (Heb. 2:10) and share the same divine sonship with Him.</li><li>The Son, as the grain of wheat (John 12:24), expected that He would die (Luke 12:50) to have His shell of humanity broken that His divine glory might be released with His divine life to produce many grains, that is, many believers as His increase for the constituting of His Body for the glorification of the Father.</li><li>At His last entry into Jerusalem under the exaltation of the people of Israel, some Greeks came to exalt Him, but He told them that that was the hour for Him not to be exalted by man but to be glorified by the Father, that is, to die to have His divine glory and life released in His resurrection&#151;John 12:12, 20-24.</li><li>It is in the second section of this book from 12:20 to 20:29 that the Son was crucified to have His human shell broken and His divine glory and life released in His resurrection for the dispensing of His divine life to His believers with which they could glorify the Father also. This matter is referred to in 12:23, 28; 13:31, 32; 14:13; 15:8; 17:1, 5, 10, 22, 24.

THE GOSPEL OF JOHN<br>BEING COMPOSED OF TWO SECTIONS</H2><P>The Gospel of John, a full revelation of Christ as the Word of God defining and revealing God, is composed of two sections.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The First Section</H2><P>The first section is from 1:1 to 12:19. This section tells us what Christ is and what Christ would do. It reveals Christ's becoming flesh in His incarnation and His earthly living and ministry in His humanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Second Section</H2><P>The second section is from 12:20 to 20:29. It unveils that Christ is to be glorified by God with His glory and also unveils the issue of His glorification through death and resurrection, as the many grains produced by the one grain in 12:24. In this section the words glory, glorify, and glorified are used a number of times. Even in chapter one, unveiling Christ's incarnation, the glory of the only begotten Son of God is mentioned. John says, "We beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father" (v. 14). They saw His glory when He was transfigured on the mount (Matt. 17:1-2; 2 Pet. 1:16-18). His glory was concealed in His human shell, that is, His humanity. But on the mount, that concealed glory came out.</P><P>John was very strong to unveil the glorification of the incarnated Jesus, that is, the glorification of Christ by God with His glory. He was not self-glorified by His own exaltation, but He was glorified by God. In His being glorified, He as a grain of wheat passed through death unto resurrection, and that is glorification. His glorification was to produce us as many grains. He is the one grain; we are the many grains. A stalk of wheat with many grains is the produce of one grain being sown into the earth. The many grains are the totality, the aggregate, of that unique grain. When Christ was resurrected, He was glorified to produce us as His many grains to form and constitute His Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. GOD HIMSELF EXPRESSED</H2><P>The glory of God is God Himself expressed (Acts 7:2). Abraham was called by "the God of glory." God manifested Himself to Abraham in His glory, and Abraham saw the expressed God. The glory of God was the "motor," the motivating power, for Abraham to leave Chaldea and journey to the good land. When God appears in His glory, we are attracted, charmed, and captivated by Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE SONSHIP TO EXPRESS GOD IN HIS FULLNESS</H2><P>God the Father has given His glory to the Son, and this glory is the sonship to express God in His fullness (John 5:26). Fullness means the expressed riches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE GLORY OF THE FATHER<br>BEING CONCEALED IN HIS HUMANITY</H2><P>The glory of the Father was concealed in the shell of Christ's humanity, His flesh. Many who saw and heard Him despised Him and said, "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not His sisters here with us?" (Mark 6:3). Isaiah 53 says that He did not have any outward beauty for people to desire Him (v. 2). The Father's glory was concealed in His humanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. GLORIFYING THE FATHER</H2><P>He glorified the Father by manifesting Him in His earthly living and ministry (John 17:4). When we live to express God, to manifest God, that is our glorifying God. If we live God and speak God, both our living and ministry are God's glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE SON PRAYING THAT THE FATHER<br>WOULD GLORIFY HIS NAME</H2><P>The Son prayed that the Father would glorify His name, and the Father answered Him, "I have both glorified it and will glorify it again" (John 12:28).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE SON HAVING GIVEN THE FATHER'S GLORY<br>TO HIS BELIEVERS</H2><P>The Son has given the Father's glory to express the Father in His sonship to His believers (John 17:22), who are the many sons of God (Heb. 2:10) and share the same divine sonship with Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. DYING TO PRODUCE MANY GRAINS</H2><P>The Son, as the grain of wheat (John 12:24), expected that He would die (Luke 12:50) to have His shell of humanity broken that His divine glory might be released with His divine life to produce many grains, that is, many believers as His increase for the constituting of His Body for the glorification of the Father. In Luke 12:50 the Lord said, "But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!" His undergoing physical death was the baptism referred to here. He was pressed, constrained, in the shell of His humanity, and He longed to be put into death, which was a baptism to Him. This death broke His human shell so that His unlimited and infinite divine being with His divine life might be released from His flesh, which was His glorification in resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. THE HOUR FOR HIM TO BE GLORIFIED<br>BY THE FATHER</H2><P>At His last entry into Jerusalem under the exaltation of the people of Israel, some Greeks came to exalt Him, but He told them that that was the hour for Him not to be exalted by man but to be glorified by the Father, that is, to die to have His divine glory and life released in His resurrection (John 12:12, 20-24). John 12:23 says, "And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified." For Him to be glorified is for Him to be released from the shell of His humanity through death and resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>X. FOR THE DISPENSING OF HIS DIVINE LIFE<br>TO HIS BELIEVERS</H2><P>It is in the second section of this book from 12:20 to 20:29 that the Son was crucified to have His human shell broken and His divine glory and life released in His resurrection for the dispensing of His divine life to His believers with which they could glorify the Father also. This matter is referred to in 12:23, 28; 13:31, 32; 14:13; 15:8; 17:1, 5, 10, 22, 24. It is also referred to in 7:39 and 12:16.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XI. THE SON'S PRAYER TO GLORIFY THE FATHER</H2><P>The Son prayed to the Father, "Glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You" (John 17:1). The Father glorified the Son by putting Him to death and resurrecting Him. The Son's human shell was broken by death so that the concealed God could be released, glorified. The Father would thus be glorified in Him. Because the Son's human shell was broken, the Father was released for His glorification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XII. THE ISSUES OF THE GLORIFICATION OF CHRIST</H2><P>The Father's house in 14:2, the vine in 15:5, and the child in 16:21, which imply the Body of Christ, are all the issues of this glorification of Christ through His death unto resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIII. GOD BEING GLORIFIED IN CHRIST<br>AND IN THE CHURCH</H2><P>God is glorified in Christ and in the church in the church age (Eph. 3:21). If we are not a part of the church, we will miss this glorification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIV. EXPRESSING GOD IN OUR BEHAVIOR</H2><P>When the believers express God in their behavior, God is glorified (Matt. 5:16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XV. BEARING MUCH FRUIT</H2><P>When the believers as the branches bear much fruit, the Father is glorified (John 15:8). The more fruit we bear, the more God is glorified in our Christian work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVI. BEING GLORIFIED IN THE KINGDOM AGE</H2><P>The believers who suffer with Christ in this age will be glorified in the kingdom age, that is, will reign with Him as His co-kings (Rom. 8:17; 2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 20:4, 6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVII. PETER'S MARTYRDOM</H2><P>Peter was martyred so that God would be glorified (John 21:19). The Lord Jesus predicted this to Peter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVIII. THE GLORY OF THE NEW JERUSALEM</H2><P>Eventually, all of God's chosen people will participate in the glory of the New Jerusalem, that is, will be glorified with the glory of God for eternity (Rev. 21:11). We need to enjoy what Christ is and live Him. Eventually, we will be eternally glorified in His glorification.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE ELEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ORGANISM OF THE PROCESSED<br>AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD<br>AND<br>THE BELIEVERS' ONENESS INCORPORATED<br>WITH THE ONENESS OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The organism of the processed and consummated Triune God:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>John 14&#151;16 is a long discourse given by Christ to His disciples on the night before He was crucified concerning the issue of His glorification by the Father with His glory.</li>	<li>The issue is a divine and human constitution of the processed and consummated Triune God with His regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified elect as an organism of the processed and consummated Triune God&#151;14:7-20:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The Father is embodied in the Son, coinhering with the Son, and seen among the believers&#151;vv. 7-11.</li>		<li>The Son is realized as the Spirit to abide in the believers&#151;vv. 15-20.</li>		<li>In this constitution God the Father is the source, God the Son is the element, and God the Spirit is the essence, constituted with the believers as the constituents (Eph. 4:4-6).

This took place in the night when He was betrayed and arrested, before His crucifixion, which happened the next day. After His long discourse of mysterious speaking, He offered a prayer to God, saying, "Father,...glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You" (John 17:1). Then He went on to pray about the oneness of the believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE ORGANISM OF THE PROCESSED<br>AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>John 14 through 17 reveals the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God and the believers' oneness incorporated with the oneness of the Triune God. Two onenesses are incorporated into one. An organism, like a tree, is a frame to contain the inner life for the development of that inner life. The church, composed of God's called ones, is such a frame to contain the invisible God as life so that this life can be developed and expressed. Our human body is an organism containing our human life for the development and expression of that life. The Body of Christ is just like our human body. It is an organism to contain God, not the original God, but the processed and consummated God as life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Long Discourse<br>concerning the Issue of His Glorification</H2><P>John 14 through 16 is a long discourse given by Christ to His disciples on the night before He was crucified concerning the issue of His glorification by the Father with His glory. Without Christ's glorification, these three chapters could not exist.</P><P>In the New Testament, there are two major portions which speak of the Divine Trinity clearly and definitely. The first one is Matthew 28:19, where the Lord charged us to baptize people into the name (singular) of the Father and of the Son and of the Spirit. There is one name for the three of the Trinity. The second passage is in John 14. In Matthew, it is the Triune God in name. But in John 14, it is the Triune God in person.</P><P>In John 14:16-20 Jesus said that He would ask the Father to give the disciples another Comforter, who would be the Spirit of reality coming to be with them and in them. Then He said, "In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you" (v. 20). The speaking here is simple, but the content is very mysterious and excellent. The Lord's asking the Father to give the disciples another Comforter implies that He was the first Comforter. The two Comforters are one person in different stages. The first Comforter was Christ in the flesh in the stage of His incarnation. He comforted His disciples, but this comforting was outside of them. The Lord walked, lived, and ate together with the disciples. He was among them and with them, but He was not yet in them and they were not in Him. The Spirit was not yet at that time (John 7:39). In His resurrection He became the second Comforter in the stage of Christ as the life-giving Spirit, the stage of His inclusion. On the day of resurrection, Christ was glorified to be the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). As the life-giving Spirit He could be in the disciples and they could be in Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. A Divine and Human Constitution</H2><P>The issue of Christ's glorification is a divine and human constitution of the processed and consummated Triune God with His regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified elect as an organism of the processed and consummated Triune God (John 14:7-20). This kind of constitution is organic, with the divine life and the human life transformed with the divine life. These two lives are constituted together to become a divine and human constitution.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Father Embodied in the Son</H2><P>The Father is embodied in the Son, coinhering with the Son, and seen among the believers (vv. 7-11). The Son said that He was in the Father and the Father was in Him. This is not just coexisting but coinhering&#151;coexisting one within another mutually. The Christian life is actually a life of coinherence because we are in Christ and Christ is in us. We and He are coinhering.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Son Being Realized as the Spirit</H2><P>The Son is realized as the Spirit to abide in the believers (vv. 15-20). The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one and abide in us; therefore, we are "four-in-one," a divine and human constitution. The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is realized as the Spirit, and They are all in us. God and man are united, mingled, and incorporated.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Source, the Element, the Essence,<br>and the Constituents</H2><P>In this constitution God the Father is the source, God the Son is the element, and God the Spirit is the essence, constituted with the believers as the constituents (Eph. 4:4-6). Every substance has a source and an element, and every element has its essence. The essence is the intrinsic part of the element, the element is the reality of the substance, and the substance has a source. God is the source, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence. We the believers are just the constituents containing the source, the element, and the essence to be a divine and human constitution. This divine and human constitution is expressed as the Father's house in John 14, the Son's vine in John 15, and the Spirit's child in John 16.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Father's House</H2><P>The Father's house for His dwelling (John 14:2) refers to the divine family with the children born of God (1:12-13) and to Bethel (the house of God) as the place for the heavenly ladder to bring heaven to earth and join earth to heaven (1:51). The Father's house is also the temple of God as the house of God, which was Christ Himself before His resurrection and was enlarged with His believers through His resurrection (2:16-22). Furthermore, the Father's house is a mutual abode for the Triune God and the believers built up by the Father and the Son (14:23), consummating in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21). The Spirit indwells this abode with the Father and the Son for the mutual dwelling place of the Triune God and His transformed elect.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Son's Vine</H2><P>This constitution is also expressed as the Son's vine tree for His spreading to express the Father (John 15:1-16). The Father needs a dwelling place, a house, and the Son needs the spreading, which is an organic union of the Son as the tree with His believers as the branches (vv. 1-5). We are branches of the Triune God in the Son! A pine tree can be very tall, but a vine tree spreads along the earth. Years ago when I was in England, someone took me to see the Queen's vine. I told them that I had seen a bigger vine which spreads around the globe. That is not the Queen's vine but the King's vine. The Son is the vine and we are the branches to bear fruit for the glorification of the Father, that is, the expression, spreading, and multiplication of the Father as its source and Husbandman (vv. 1, 4-16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Spirit's Child</H2><P>The Father needs a house for His dwelling, the Son needs a vine for His spreading, and the Spirit needs a child for His moving (16:20-22). This child is the new babe growing up into the new man. The new man is Christ. He is all the members of the new man and in all the members (Col. 3:10-11).</P><P>This new child was created by Christ on the cross by abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances (Eph. 2:15). Christ abolished the ordinances of the law that separated people from one another. Through that He created the Jews and the Gentiles together into one new man. In one sense, the one new man was created; in another sense, he was born by the Spirit as a new child. His members were regenerated by the Father in Christ's resurrection to be God's children, who are the constituents of the house of God (1 Pet. 1:3; John 1:12-13). First Peter 1:3 says that we all were regenerated by God the Father through the resurrection of Christ.</P><P>The new child was also born by the Spirit in the believers' spirit (John 3:6b). God's elect are the suffering, delivering woman (16:20-21). On the one hand, we are the child born; on the other hand, we are the delivering woman. We are the mother and the child as well. This is a mystery. Furthermore, this child as the returning Christ left the disciples by His death. In John 16:22 the Lord told the disciples, "Therefore you also now have sorrow; but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and no one takes your joy away from you." That newborn child was Christ coming back. Thus, God's elect are the mother as well as the child, and the child is Christ. Now He is the new man (Col. 3:10-11). In the new man there is no room for any natural person. There is only room for Christ. He is all the members, and He is in all the members. This new man is put on by the believers through the renewing in the spirit of their mind (Eph. 4:23-24) and consummates the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE BELIEVERS' ONENESS INCORPORATED<br>WITH THE ONENESS OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>John 17 reveals the believers' oneness incorporated with the oneness of the Triune God. Our oneness, the oneness of the Body of Christ, is the oneness of the Triune God. The Triune God (the Father as the source, the Son as the element, and the Spirit as the essence) within us is our oneness. (Eph. 4:3-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Christ's Closing Prayer</H2><P>In the Gospel of John, chapter 17 is Christ's closing prayer to His discourse in chapters 14 through 16.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Indicating the Economical Trinity</H2><P>The Son lifting up His eyes to heaven to pray to the Father indicates the economical Trinity working together&#151;the Son praying on earth and the Father hearing in heaven (17:1a). One prayed and the Other listened. This is the economical Trinity not the essential Trinity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. For the Glorification of the Son</H2><P>Christ's prayer was for the glorification of the Son that the Father might be glorified as the Son has glorified the Father in His earthly living and ministry (vv. 1b, 4-5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Based upon the Oneness of the Believers</H2><P>This traffic of glorification, where the Son prayed asking the Father to glorify the Son that the Son may glorify the Father, is based on the believers' oneness (vv. 2-3, 6-23a). If we are not one, the Son cannot be glorified, and the Father cannot be glorified by the Son. When we are one, Christ is glorified. When Christ is glorified, God the Father is glorified in Christ the Son's glorification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. By the Father's Eternal Life</H2><P>The oneness of the believers is by the Father's eternal life conveyed in the Father's name and in the Father's word (vv. 2-3, 6-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. By the Father's Sanctifying Word</H2><P>Our oneness is also by the Father's sanctifying word as the truth&#151;the divine reality&#151;through the coinhering of the Triune God and the believers (vv. 13-21). The sanctifying God is in us and we are in the sanctifying God; therefore, we are spontaneously sanctified.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. By the Glory</H2><P>The oneness of the believers is also by the glory given to the believers by the Son through the coinhering of the Triune God incorporated with the believers. In John 17:22-23a the Son prayed to the Father, "And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one." The believers can be one as the three of the Trinity are one. The Father, the Son, and the disciples all coinhere. This is the glory. In this coinhering, Christ is glorified, and the Father is glorified in Christ's glorification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Incorporated with the Oneness<br>of the Economical Trinity</H2><P>Our oneness is incorporated with the oneness of the economical Trinity for the church life constituting the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Economically One in Harmony</H2><P>The Divine Trinity is economically one in harmony.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Father Giving His Glory to the Son</H2><P>The Father gives His glory to the Son that the Son may express Him in His nature, life, and attributes in the divine sonship for the Father's glorification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Son Giving the Divine Glory to His Believers</H2><P>The Son gives the divine glory in the divine sonship to His believers, who are the many sons of God sharing the divine sonship with Him. The Father gives His glory to His Son. The Son has the right to express God in the sonship. Such a right to glorify God in the sonship has been given to all the disciples of Christ because they are God's sons and have His sonship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Kept in the Father's Love</H2><P>Eventually, the incorporated oneness is kept in the Father's love through the coinhering of the Triune God with the believers in Christ for eternity as the New Jerusalem (vv. 23b-26).</P><P>John 17 shows us two kinds of oneness which are incorporated together through the coinhering of the Triune God with the believers in Christ. The believers in Christ are many and the Triune God is three; among the three there is no division but only harmony and oneness. Their oneness becomes the oneness of the believers in Christ, which becomes the oneness of the Body of Christ. The Body is the new man, and the new man is Christ. The new man came into being by being created by Christ on the cross and by being regenerated by the Father and born by the Spirit. We now need to put on this new man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. CRUCIAL POINTS IN JOHN 14 THROUGH 17</H2><P>Because the revelation in John 14 through 17 is so mysterious and complicated, I want to share some crucial points.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Triune God Being Essential and Economical</H2><P>John 14:16-20 unveils that the Triune God is both essential in His being and economical in His moving.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Distinctly Three</H2><P>Verses 16 and 17 say that the Son would ask the Father to give the disciples another Comforter&#151;the Spirit of reality&#151;indicating that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are distinctly three in Their move in the economical Trinity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Essentially One in Verses 17 and 18</H2><P>Verse 17 says that the Spirit of reality will come and verse 18 says that the Son will not leave the disciples as orphans but He is coming to them, indicating that the Spirit and the Son are essentially one in the essential Trinity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Essentially One in Verses 17 and 20</H2><P>Verse 17 says that the Spirit will be in the disciples and verse 20 says that the Son will be in the disciples, also indicating that the Spirit and the Son are essentially one in the essential Trinity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Coinhering with the Disciples Mutually</H2><P>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit coinhere with the disciples mutually, indicating that the Triune God and the disciples are not only united but also mingled and incorporated into one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Travailing Woman and the Child</H2><P>John 16:21 unveils that the travailing and delivering woman is the believers and that the child delivered is also the believers. This is a mystery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Child Delivered Being the New Man</H2><P>This child delivered eventually will be the new man, whose very constituting element is Christ being all the members of the new man and in all the members of the new man (Col. 3:10-11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Christ Being the New Delivered Child</H2><P>John 16:22 unveils that Christ is both the One who left the disciples in His death and the One who came back to the disciples as the new delivered child in His resurrection, and He will be all the members of the new man and in all of them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Conceiving of the New Man</H2><P>That the new man was created by Christ with Himself as the element on the cross (Eph. 2:15) should be considered the conceiving of the new man by Christ. Ephesians 2:15 reveals that Christ created in Himself, with Himself as the element, the Jews and the Gentiles into one new man. This creation should be considered the conceiving. A child cannot come into being without being conceived. What Christ had conceived was born by the Spirit through His death and resurrection (John 3:5). This is the regeneration by the Father to bring in millions of sons in His species (1 Pet. 1:3). Christ did not have any brothers before His death, but after His resurrection early in the morning He told Mary, "Go to My brothers" (John 20:17). It was on the day of resurrection that Christ began to have brothers because all the believers, His brothers, were regenerated by the Father through His resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Main Revelation</H2><P>The main revelation of all these indicates that God's desire and intention was to be united, mingled, and incorporated into one corporate New Jerusalem (Rev. 21). The New Jerusalem is the conclusion of the entire sixty-six books of the Bible. All the revelations and visions of the Scriptures consummate in the holy city. The New Jerusalem is the processed and consummated Triune God incorporated into one with His regenerated, transformed, and glorified elect. It is also a couple with the Husband and the bride, the wife. The Husband is the wife, and the wife is the Husband because they coinhere. This is God's eternal economy to incorporate Himself with His elect, to be one universal, divine, mystical incorporation, which is the New Jerusalem.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWELVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE KINGDOM OF GOD<br>AND<br>THE BLOOD AND WATER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The kingdom of God&#151;John 3:3, 5:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The kingdom of God is the reign of God.</li>	<li>This divine reign is a realm, not only of the divine dominion but also of the divine species, in which are all the divine things.</li>	<li>God became flesh to enter into the human species, and man becomes God in His life and nature, but not in His divine Godhead, to enter into His divine species.

THE KINGDOM OF GOD</H2><P>The revelation of the kingdom of God in John is based upon two verses in John 3. Verse 3 says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God." Then verse 5 says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." Verse 3 speaks of seeing the kingdom, and verse 5 speaks of entering into the kingdom. To see the kingdom we need to be born anew. To enter into the kingdom we need to be born of water and the Spirit. Water signifies the death of Christ, into which we all have been baptized, and the Spirit signifies resurrection.</P><P>The end of John 2 says that many believed in the Lord when they saw the miracles He did, but the Lord had no confidence in such people and could not commit Himself to them (vv. 23-25). Then chapter three begins with the word but. This word indicates that the case concerning Nicodemus in John 3 is different from the case of those who believed in the Lord because of the miracles He performed. The case in John 3 concerns life in regeneration.</P><P>It speaks of Nicodemus, a real seeker who came to the Lord in the night (v. 2). He came with much knowledge and many concepts because he was a teacher among the Jewish people. He considered Christ a teacher who had come from God. He might have thought that he needed better teachings to improve himself. But the Lord's answer unveiled to him that he needed to be born anew. Nicodemus responded by saying, "How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born, can he?" (v. 4). The Lord then told him that he needed a second birth, a new birth.</P><P>If we are not born anew, we do not have the capacity to see the kingdom of God. To be born anew is to be born of water, signifying the death of Christ, and of the Spirit, signifying Christ's resurrection. We need to die with Christ and be resurrected to be a new person of another, new species, new kind.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Reign of God</H2><P>The kingdom of God is the reign of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Divine Reign<br>Being a Realm of the Divine Species</H2><P>The kingdom of God is the reign of God. This divine reign is a realm, not only of the divine dominion but also of the divine species, in which are all the divine things. The vegetable kingdom is a realm of the vegetable species, and the animal kingdom is a realm of the animal species. In the same way, the kingdom of God is a realm of the divine species.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. God Entering into the Human Species<br>and Man Entering into the Divine Species</H2><P>God became flesh to enter into the human species, and man becomes God in His life and nature, but not in His divine Godhead, to enter into His divine species. In John 3 the kingdom of God refers more to the species of God than to the reign of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Entering into the Divine Realm<br>by Being Born of God</H2><P>For something to be in the animal species, it must be born of an animal. Also, to enter into the divine realm, the realm of the divine species, we need to be born of God to have the divine nature and life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Man Being Created in God's Kind</H2><P>That man was created in the image of God and after His likeness indicates that man was created in God's kind, in God's species. Genesis 1 says that each of the living things was created after its kind. But God created man, not after man's kind, but in God's image and after God's likeness to be God's kind.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Believers Born of God<br>Being More in God's Kind Than Adam Was</H2><P>The believers, who are born of God by regeneration to be His children in His life and nature but not in His Godhead (John 1:12-13), are more in God's kind than Adam was. Adam had only the outward appearance of God without the inward reality, the divine life. We have the reality of the divine life within us and we are being transformed and conformed to the Lord's image in our entire being. It is logical to say that all the children of God are in the divine realm of the divine species.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. God-men in the Divine Species</H2><P>Thus, in regeneration God begets gods. Man begets man. Goats beget goats. If goats do not beget goats, what do they beget? If God does not beget gods, what does He beget? If the children of God are not in God's kind, in God's species, in what kind are they? If they are not gods, what are they? We all who are born of God are gods. But for utterance, due to the theological misunderstanding, it is better to say that we are God-men in the divine species, that is, in the kingdom of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Constituents of the Body of Christ<br>and of the New Jerusalem</H2><P>These God-men, who are children born of God, not only constitute the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15; 1 Pet. 4:17; John 14:2) but also are the constituents with which the Body of Christ is built up, and the Body of Christ will consummate the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God and of Christ (1 Cor. 6:9; Eph. 5:5; 2 Pet. 1:11; Rev. 11:15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE BLOOD AND WATER</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Condition of Fallen Sinners</H2><P>We sinners became fallen and were then against God's righteousness and estranged from God's life (Gen. 3:24; Eph. 4:18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Need to Be Redeemed Judicially<br>and Saved Organically</H2><P>As sinners, we need to be redeemed judicially from God's condemnation according to the righteous requirement of His law (Gal. 3:13) and to be saved organically by His life from the death brought in by sin (2 Tim. 1:10; Rom. 5:10, 12, 17, 21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. God's Full Salvation</H2><P>God's full salvation for us is judicial according to His righteousness and organic through His life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Christ Being our Redeemer and Savior</H2><P>Christ, as the Redeemer and Savior of fallen man, redeems and saves us through His death and resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Blood and Water</H2><P>In His crucifixion, after He was pierced by a soldier, blood and water, two elements which are critical to human life, came out of Him (John 19:34).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Blood Being for God's Judicial Redemption</H2><P>The blood of Christ is for God's judicial redemption in His redeeming the believers (Eph. 1:7; 1 Pet. 1:18-19), forgiving the believers' sins (Heb. 9:22), and washing away the believers' sins (Heb. 1:3). The blood of Christ is also for God to justify the believers (Rom. 3:24; 5:9) and sanctify the believers positionally (Heb. 13:12; 10:29). This blood speaks something better for the New Testament believers before God (Heb. 12:24). By the blood of Christ, the Lamb, we can overcome Satan, the accuser of the believers (Rev. 12:11). Thus, it is the precious blood of Christ (1 Pet. 1:19).</P><P>It is also considered God's own blood, which is very dear to God and with which God has purchased and obtained the church as His flock. Acts 20:28 says that God secured, purchased, redeemed, the church with His own blood. If He were merely God, He could not have blood. God's own blood is the blood of the man Jesus Christ, who is the very God. God's purchasing the church with His own blood indicates the preciousness, the exceeding worth, of the church in the eyes of God. The church is dear to God, so we have to regard and respect the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Water Signifying the Divine Life<br>for God's Organic Salvation</H2><P>Water, signifying the divine life (see Message Three), is for God's organic salvation. The Lord promises to give the sinners the water of life (John 4:10, 14; Rev. 21:6).</P><P>Also, the Lord calls the sinners to come and drink His water of life (Rev. 22:17; John 7:37-38). The believers were regenerated by God with His divine life (1 Pet. 1:3). This divine life saves the believers (Rom. 5:10b). It dispositionally sanctifies (Rom. 6:19, 22), renews (Rom. 12:2b; Titus 3:5), transforms (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18), conforms (Rom. 8:29), and glorifies (Rom. 8:30) the believers. The believers reign in it (Rom. 5:17). We can be kings by this divine life. The believers also grow with it for the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:15-16). We all have to grow into the Head, Christ. Then out from Him we have something of the divine life to minister to the Body for its building up. This consummates the New Jerusalem, which is wholly supplied with the river of water of life and with the tree of life (Rev. 21:2; 22:1-2). The river of water of life signifies the Spirit of life, and the tree of life signifies Christ as the embodiment of the divine life. Both are for the supply of the New Jerusalem.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THIRTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE APOSTOLIC MINISTRY IN COOPERATION<br>WITH CHRIST'S HEAVENLY MINISTRY</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The Gospel of John has twenty-one chapters, but it actually ends with chapter twenty.

Its judicial section qualifies and positions the believers to carry out its organic section by the divine life of the processed and consummated Triune God. But today most Christians are just lingering in its judicial section and are satisfied with it, paying very little attention to its organic section and missing the critical point of the fulfillment of the eternal economy of God. The critical need of the Lord's recovery today is not to be held back by the satisfaction of its judicial section but to press forward to carry out its organic section so that there may be the possibility of accomplishing the eternal economy of God.</P><P>John 21 reveals the apostolic ministry in cooperation with Christ's heavenly ministry. After Christ ascended to the heavens, He began His heavenly ministry. In doing this He raised up a group of His followers as His apostles who could fully cooperate with Him. These apostles were commissioned by the ascended Christ to cooperate with Him to carry out God's New Testament economy. What He was doing in the heavens, the apostles did on earth to carry out His heavenly ministry.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. JOHN 21 BEING THE COMPLETION<br>AND CONSUMMATION OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H2><P>The Gospel of John has twenty-one chapters, but it actually ends with chapter twenty. The entire book covers the earthly ministry of Christ, beginning with His incarnation as the Word of God to become a man in the flesh (1:1-14) and ending with His resurrection as the last Adam to become the life-giving Spirit (ch. 20); hence, chapter twenty-one should be an appendix. Although it is correct to say this, it is more intrinsic to say that John 21 is the completion and consummation of the Gospel of John. Without chapter twenty-one, John is not completed. It consummates the entire Gospel of John by showing that Christ's heavenly ministry and the apostles' ministry on the earth cooperate together to carry out God's New Testament economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE GOOD SHEPHERD</H2><P>In John 10:10, 11, and 16 the Lord unveiled to the disciples that He was the good Shepherd who came that the sheep might have life abundantly and that He had other sheep (the Gentiles) which He must lead to join with them (the Jewish believers) to be one flock (one church) under one Shepherd.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. In His Earthly Ministry</H2><P>The Lord's shepherding was firstly in His earthly ministry (Matt. 9:36). The Lord saw the Israelites as sheep harassed by their leaders; they were cast away like sheep not having a shepherd. The Lord as the Shepherd of God's elect prayed, and God told His sent One to appoint twelve apostles that they might take care of the sheep of God (Matt. 10:1-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In His Heavenly Ministry</H2><P>The Lord's shepherding is secondly in His heavenly ministry (1 Pet. 5:4) to take care of the church of God, issuing in His Body. When He was on the earth, He was shepherding. After His resurrection and ascension to the heavens, He is still shepherding.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. COMMISSIONING PETER TO FEED HIS LAMBS<br>AND SHEPHERD HIS SHEEP</H2><P>When the Lord stayed with His disciples after His resurrection and before His ascension, in one of His appearings, He commissioned Peter to feed His lambs and shepherd His sheep in His absence, while He is in the heavens (John 21:15-17). Shepherding implies feeding, but it includes much more than feeding. To shepherd is to take all-inclusive tender care of the flock.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Incorporating the Apostolic Ministry<br>with Christ's Heavenly Ministry</H2><P>This is to incorporate the apostolic ministry with Christ's heavenly ministry to take care of God's flock, which is the church that issues in the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Words of the Apostle Paul<br>concerning Shepherding</H2><P>The following words of the apostle Paul confirm this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Elders' Shepherding the Church of God</H2><P>In Acts 20:28 Paul told the elders of Ephesus, "Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers to shepherd the church of God, which He obtained [or, purchased] through His own blood." Although Paul was on an urgent trip back to Jerusalem, while he was journeying he sent word for the elders in Ephesus to come to him. Then he gave them a long word recorded in Acts 20.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Fierce Wolves Not Sparing the Flock</H2><P>Paul said that "fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock" (Acts 20:29). The flock is the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Great Shepherd of the Sheep</H2><P>Paul said in Hebrews 13:20, "God...brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, in the blood of an eternal covenant." The eternal covenant is the covenant of the new testament to gain a flock, which is the church issuing in the Body and consummating the New Jerusalem. The eternal covenant of God is to consummate the New Jerusalem by the shepherding. God raised up our Lord from the dead to be the great Shepherd to consummate the New Jerusalem according to God's eternal covenant.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. PETER'S IMPRESSION WITH THE LORD'S COMMISSION TO FEED HIS LAMBS AND SHEPHERD HIS SHEEP</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Telling the Believers to Return to Christ<br>as the Shepherd and Overseer of Their Souls</H2><P>Peter was so impressed with this commission of the Lord that in his first book he told the believers that they were like sheep being led astray, but they had now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer (Christ) of their souls (1 Pet. 2:25). Christ's shepherding of His flock includes His caring for their outward things and also their inner being, their souls. He takes care of the things concerning their souls by overseeing their souls. Christ indwells us to be our life and everything, but He is also overseeing, observing, the condition and situation of our inner being. He shepherds us by caring for the welfare of our inner being and by exercising His oversight over the condition of our soul, our real person.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Exhorting the Elders<br>to Shepherd the Flock of God</H2><P>Peter exhorted the elders to shepherd the flock of God among them so that when the Chief Shepherd is manifested, they, the faithful elders, will receive the unfading crown of glory (1 Pet. 5:1-4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Heavenly Ministry of Christ<br>Being Mainly to Shepherd the Church of God</H2><P>Peter's word indicates that the heavenly ministry of Christ is mainly to shepherd the church of God as His flock which issues in His Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE MAIN PURPOSE AND GOAL<br>OF THE APOSTOLIC MINISTRY INCORPORATED<br>WITH CHRIST'S HEAVENLY MINISTRY</H2><P>The main purpose and goal of the apostolic ministry incorporated with Christ's heavenly ministry are to build up the Body of Christ which will consummate the New Jerusalem for the accomplishment of the eternal economy of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE SHEPHERDING OF GOD'S FLOCK<br>IN SONG OF SONGS</H2><P>This matter of shepherding God's flock for the main purpose and ultimate consummation of the eternal economy of God is even referred to in Song of Songs. In this book Christ shepherds His seeker and pursuer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Lord Pasturing His Flock<br>for Satisfaction and Rest</H2><P>In Song of Songs 1:7a the seeker says, "Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock [for satisfaction]?/Where do you make it lie down at noon [for rest]?"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Going Forth on the Footsteps of the Flock</H2><P>The Shepherd responds to the seeker by saying, "Go forth on the footsteps of the flock,/And pasture your young goats /By the shepherds' tents" (1:8b). Under the Lord as the Chief Shepherd there are many other shepherds. The many shepherds pasture their young by their tents, that is, where they live.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Pasturing His Flock among the Lilies</H2><P>Song of Songs 2:16 says, "My beloved is mine, and I am his;/He pastures his flock among the lilies [the seekers of Christ who live a life of trusting in God with a single heart]." The Lord is pasturing all His seekers as lilies, taking care of them, feeding them, and shepherding them that they may grow.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Shepherding Being Crucial<br>for the Growth in the Divine Life</H2><P>Song of Songs 6:3 says, "I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine;/He pastures his flock among the lilies." To shepherd the believers is very crucial for their growth in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. JOHN 21 BEING AN ADEQUATE<br>AND COMPLETE ENDING</H2><P>Without John 21, the Gospel of John does not have an adequate and complete ending.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TAKING THE SHEPHERDING WAY<br>TO PREACH THE GOSPEL AND REVIVE THE CHURCH</H2><P>When I first went to Taiwan, I thought nothing could be worked out there. At that time it was a desolate small island. One day the Lord told me to go along the railway from Taipei to visit the saints. After that visitation I was deeply impressed that Taiwan could be a very good field for the Lord's recovery. I picked up a burden and decided to begin the ministry there with a conference on August 1, 1949. About four or five hundred Christians from different denominations, who had escaped from mainland China to Taiwan, came on the first day of the conference. I said to them, "We are here to serve one kind of food&#151;Christ. Please be clear about this. If you want anything else, you are wasting your time in coming here." Most of them did not come back. Only the real seekers came.</P><P>We took down their names and began to shepherd them. We distributed their names to different brothers and sisters to go and visit them. From the beginning of the work in Taiwan we practiced shepherding. When we had a big gospel meeting, we could get about five to six hundred names. Then we distributed all the names for the proper care. Most people want to have genuine, proper visitors. When we visit people, we should be genuine in our care for them. They will sense that we are not vain people. This shepherding way of preaching the gospel by visiting people warms them up. The church life in Taiwan began with about three or four hundred believers, but after four years we had forty thousand. Most of the people were not saved directly by my ministry; they were saved by the proper shepherding, the proper care. We all have to learn this.</P><P>Before I went to Taiwan in 1949, I was in Chefoo. I spoke each Lord's Day, and during the week I and an older brother went to visit the new ones. We were warmly welcomed by every family. They would gather their household together when we came. Within a short time, there was a real revival in Chefoo. The gospel was preached everywhere, not just by myself but by all the saints.</P><P>I also made the decision to set up a kitchen in the meeting hall, and I invited groups of twenty or thirty saints to eat together for fellowship. Within a little over half a year, I had invited all the members of the church. At that time there were at least five to six hundred saints in the church in Chefoo. This kind of shepherding stirred up the entire church. I hope the elders would use the hall as a dining room and invite the saints to come for fellowship. An elder should contact at least one person every day for the purpose of shepherding. We should also invite people to our homes for a meal, not inviting the familiar ones but the new ones. The revival in Chefoo occurred because of this kind of shepherding.</P><P>Shepherding works. We should not desire to be giant speakers to make a name for ourselves. People may be attracted to come to listen to us, but who will take care of them afterward? The way of having large gospel campaigns does not work. In some places this has been tested out. We may have big gospel meetings with many people, but eventually not many of them are added to the church. Also, we should not use famous or well-known people to testify in our meetings. This will not save people to be added to the church. Even if someone is the president of the country, he should be in the meeting just as anyone else. The way that can save people effectively must be by small vital groups, and every one in this small vital group must be a shepherd. After a short time, the church will be revived. No other way is more prevailing than this shepherding way.</P><P>For the shepherding of the saints, there must be the healthy teaching in the vital groups. In 1 Timothy 3:2 Paul said that an elder should be apt to teach. Teaching here is similar to parents' teaching their children. An elder must be apt to render this kind of home teaching to the members of a local church. Then in 5:17 Paul said, "Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching." Double honor refers to material supply for the support of the faithful elders, especially those who labor to teach others.</P><P>In the vital groups, we must have something to teach others. We are the prophethood, the prophets speaking for God, and the sonship, the sons of God. Every son must be a speaker. Today God speaks in the Son (Heb. 1:2), not only the individual Son but the corporate son. As a son of God, we must learn to be a speaker. We can speak of the five great historical events in John 1: creation, incarnation, the Lamb, the Spirit, and the ladder. This will stir up people's interest. When we explain these things, they will be edified.</P><P>At another time we can speak of our Lord as the Son of Man, who as the ladder brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven. He is the Son of Man who has been lifted up on the cross, just as the bronze serpent was lifted up by Moses (John 3:14). As the Son of Man, He has ascended and is at the right hand of God (Acts 7:56). In Revelation, Christ is trimming all the lampstands as the Son of Man (1:13), and as the Son of Man, He will be sitting on a cloud to reap the harvest of the believers near the end of the great tribulation (14:14). He will return again as the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven (Matt. 26:64). Matthew 25:31 says that He will be the Son of Man sitting on His throne of glory to judge the nations. Eventually, in eternity He will be the Son of Man as the ladder of this universe (John 1:51). If we teach these things, we will stir up people. We have to learn to teach. We have to labor in the Word. If there is no labor, there will be no gain. We lovers and seekers of Christ should learn how to speak as prophets and sons of God.</P><P>I hope that we would pray, "Lord, I want to be revived. From today I want to be a shepherd. I want to go to feed people, to shepherd people, and to flock people together." In John 10 and 21 the Lord used three words concerning shepherding: feed, shepherd, and flock. He said, "Feed My lambs," and, "Shepherd My sheep" (21:15-16). He also said, "I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must lead them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one Shepherd" (10:16). The other sheep are the Gentile believers who would be joined together with the Jewish believers to be one flock. The Lord used the word flock here as a noun. I also like to use it as a verb. We should learn to feed, to shepherd, and to flock together. All the churches have to learn how to flock together so that they can be blent together. In the atmosphere of flocking, people are subdued, convinced, nourished, and stirred up by the Lord. All the nearby churches should be flocked together for the saints to be shepherded and stirred up. The elders and co-workers should take the lead to practice this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A CONCLUDING NOTE</H2><P>In view of the eternal economy of God, there is the tendency through the whole writing of John to have the church of God issuing in the Body of Christ for the accomplishment of God's eternal economy. Its judicial section qualifies and positions the believers to carry out its organic section by the divine life of the processed and consummated Triune God. But today most Christians are just lingering in its judicial section and are satisfied with it, paying very little attention to its organic section and missing the critical point of the fulfillment of the eternal economy of God. The critical need of the Lord's recovery today is not to be held back by the satisfaction of its judicial section but to press forward to carry out its organic section so that there may be the possibility of accomplishing the eternal economy of God.</P><P>This is my desire and my expectation. This is also my admonition. The only way for us to take is the way in the Lord's recovery. What I have presented in these messages shows us the proper way. We must rise up to seek after the Lord so that we can be the overcomers to bring forth the building up of the Body of Christ. Then the Lord will have a way to consummate this age and to bring in His kingdom to celebrate His wedding day for His pleasure and satisfaction. Eventually, this will consummate His eternal goal, the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FOURTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE KEY TO THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H1><P>I have studied the Gospel of John for many years, but in this crystallization-study I have seen something more intrinsic. This book, especially in chapters one through four and chapters six and seven on the two feasts of the Passover and of Tabernacles, portrays a flowing Triune God. The Triune God flows in the Divine Trinity in three stages. A better translation of John 4:14b reads this way: "The water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water gushing up [springing up] into eternal life." When the fountain springs up, that is the fountain emerging. Then a river flows. The Father is the fountain, the Son is the spring, and the Spirit is the river.</P><P>This flowing Triune God is "into eternal life." The Greek preposition translated as into is rich in meaning. Here it speaks of the destination. The eternal life is the destination of the flowing Triune God. A fountain is in us springing up as a river into a destination. This destination is the eternal life. The New Jerusalem is the totality of the divine, eternal life. The eternal life eventually will be the New Jerusalem. Thus, into eternal life means into the New Jerusalem. We must have something flowing into that divine New Jerusalem in order for us to arrive there. The entire Bible is needed to interpret John 4:14. The Father is the fountain as the source, the Son is the spring, the Spirit is the flowing river, and this flowing issues in the eternal life, which is the New Jerusalem. The Gospel of John opens by saying, "In the beginning was the Word" (1:1). The Word is for speaking, and speaking is the start of God's flowing. Speaking is flowing, spreading is flowing, and dispensing is also flowing. God flows through speaking, through spreading, through dispensing.</P><P>In order to understand the Gospel of John we must see its intrinsic revelation, which is that John reveals the Triune God. No other book in the Bible reveals the Triune God so much and so clearly and intrinsically as John, especially in chapter fourteen. Even in chapter one of John the Triune God is revealed. God has the Word to speak for Him, and He also has the Spirit to bring forth the Word. The Son is the Word, the Father is the source, and the Word speaks the source. That means He spreads the source, flows the source. Spreading implies dispensing, and dispensing implies imparting the Triune God in His Divine Trinity. This takes place through His becoming flesh (v. 14), becoming the Lamb (v. 29), and eventually becoming the life-giving Spirit signified by the dove (v. 32). This life-giving Spirit is for dispensing, for giving life, to transform the clay material into stones for building the house of God, Bethel (v. 42). The church as the Body of Christ is today's Bethel. Eventually, the totality of Bethel is the New Jerusalem, where the only begotten Son of God will be the Son of Man as the heavenly ladder with Bethel as the base (v. 51).</P><P>The Son of Man is typified by the heavenly ladder seen by Jacob in his dream. In John 1:51 the Lord Jesus said, "You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man." Such a story is recorded in Genesis 28 in Jacob's dream. Jacob saw a ladder set up on the earth, the top of it reached to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it (v. 12). The Lord Jesus said that as the Son of Man, He is this ladder. He is the only begotten Son of God who became the Son of Man. In His humanity, He becomes a joining ladder, to join heaven and earth into one. Heaven refers to God, and earth refers to man. As the ladder, Christ as the Son of Man joins God and man into one.</P><P>In eternity past He was the Word, but in eternity future He will be the ladder. The ladder is not flat. It is set up on the earth to reach the heavens as a stairway. Every ladder is a stairway for going up and coming down. This traffic is the fellowship. The ladder indicates traffic, fellowship. The love of the Father, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit are the reality of this ladder for going up and coming down. The Triune God is not flat. The Triune God is standing up to be a ladder. Without a ladder, there is no way to climb up higher. Christ as the ladder is the way in John 14:6. He is "the ladder way." How can we as earthly men be one with the heavenly Father? Christ is the way as the ladder. He is the stairway for us to be one with God.</P><P>The New Jerusalem is the totality of God joined with man and man mingled with God. The number that represents the New Jerusalem is twelve, signifying that God in His eternal administration is mingled with His creature, man. The Triune God is signified by the number three, and man is signified by the number four. Three times four is twelve. In the New Jerusalem, there are the twelve foundations, inscribed with the names of the twelve apostles (Rev. 21:14); the twelve gates which are twelve pearls, inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes (v. 12); and the twelve fruits of the tree of life (22:2). This shows that the New Jerusalem is the mingling of God and man. This mingling is through the Son of Man who was and still is the only begotten Son of God. This is all in John's writings, which include Revelation.</P><P>Eventually, the Triune God becomes the living water, which the Lord Jesus presented to the Samaritan woman in John 4. Jacob's well in John 4 is physical, but Jacob's dream is divine and mystical. In this divine, mystical realm there is a real fountain. This fountain is the Father. When this fountain emerges, or springs up, that is the Son. When the spring flows into a river, that is the Spirit. This is into, or for, the New Jerusalem. The first four chapters of John present the Triune God as the flowing water. In chapters six and seven there are two feasts. These two feasts are the issue of the flowing. We fallen men become hungry and thirsty. At the feast we have something to eat to satisfy our hunger and something to drink to quench our thirst. The food is Christ and the water is also Christ.</P><P>We need to see that the Triune God is flowing through the Father, the Son, and the Spirit into us. When we drink of this water, it becomes a fountain in us. We all should say, "The fountain is in me!" This fountain emerges as a spring, and the spring flows out as a river for the New Jerusalem. This is the key to open up the entire Gospel of John. This is the divine speaking, divine spreading, divine dispensing, of the Divine Trinity. The Father as the fountain, the Son as the spring, and the Spirit as the river flow into us. When He flows into us, He flows with us. He will flow us into the New Jerusalem to be the New Jerusalem. The preposition into also means "to become." Into the New Jerusalem means "to become the New Jerusalem." If we are not becoming the New Jerusalem, we can never be in the New Jerusalem. We have to be the New Jerusalem; then we can be in the New Jerusalem. This is the intrinsic significance of the Gospel of John and Revelation.</P><P>Question:John 4:14b mentions the fountain and the springing up, but where is the river, signifying the Spirit?</P><P>Answer:The springing up is the spring flowing. The river is implied in the flowing. Into here means issuing in, or to be, to become. The New Jerusalem will be there through the Triune God's flowing. In the beginning of the Bible, God was there. At the end of the Bible is the New Jerusalem. In the beginning, in eternity past, was the Word, who was God. In eternity future the Word becomes the New Jerusalem. This means that in the beginning was God, and at the end He becomes the New Jerusalem. Thus, the New Jerusalem is the issue of God's flowing in three stages: in the Father's stage, in the Son's stage, and in the Spirit's stage. All three stages are in us. We have the fountain, the spring, and the river within us at the same time. The fountain emerges, the spring gushes, and the gushing is the flowing as a river into the New Jerusalem.</P><P>First Corinthians 12:13 says, "We were all baptized into one body." This does not mean the Body is apart from us and that we have been put into the Body. It means we have been baptized into the Body. The baptism of the Spirit put us all together to be the Body. Into means "to be." We have been baptized to be the Body. Eventually, we will be the New Jerusalem, which is God mingled, blended, and incorporated with man. Now we can see that one half of a verse, John 4:14b, covers the entire Bible.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FIFTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE INTRINSIC SIGNIFICANCE OF JOHN 1 THROUGH 16</H1><P>God's intention in writing the Gospel of John is altogether intrinsic. We have to pray and look to the Lord very much that He would show us the intrinsic significance of John 1 through 16. The first four chapters unveil the flowing God in His divine processed Trinity. In John 4:14b the Lord said, "The water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water gushing up [springing up] into eternal life." God the Father is the fountain emerging in God the Son as a spring gushing up to be a river, signifying God the Spirit. The Triune God flows into eternal life, and the eternal life has its totality. Our human life also has its totality. A living person is the totality of the human life. The totality of the divine life is the New Jerusalem, which is the destination of the flowing Triune God.</P><P>Then John 6 and 7 reveal Christ as the Feast of Passover and the Feast of Tabernacles. These feasts are the enjoyment of the flowing, triune, processed God. Our enjoyment of such a flowing, triune, processed God brings us into the incorporation of the Triune God with us, His redeemed people. This incorporation is the Triune God as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit coinhering with us. They are in us, and we are in Them. As the second Comforter, Christ is the Spirit of reality who comes not only to be with us but also to be in us, the redeemed ones of God (John 14:17). Then the Son in whom we believe is in the Father and we are in Him and He is in us (v. 20). These four ins show the Triune God coinhering with us. This coinhering is a blending, a mingling, and an incorporation. The Triune God is incorporated with His redeemed and transformed people to be one entity.</P><P>The issue of this incorporation is the Father's house in John 14, the Son's vine in John 15, and the Spirit's new child to grow up as the new man in John 16. The house is for the Father, the vine is for the Son, and the new man is for the Spirit. The house is for the Father, as the source of the Divine Trinity, to rest and be satisfied. Without a house, we could not have rest; we would be homeless wanderers. Without rest, there is no satisfaction. The Father can rest and be satisfied because He has a house. The vine is for the Triune God in the Son to have an organism for His spreading and multiplication. The all-inclusive and all-extensive Triune God is unlimited. He wants to spread and be multiplied. The vine tree is for fruit-bearing, and fruit-bearing is for the spreading and multiplication of the vine tree. Furthermore, the Triune God needs a man. The Spirit is always for God's moving and acting to carry out His economy. This Spirit needs a man to carry out God's eternal purpose. This man was born as a new child, and this new child is growing. First Peter 2:2 says that as newborn babes we need to desire the milk of the word that we may grow into manhood to be a full-grown man for the fulfilling and carrying out of God's eternal economy which will be consummated in the New Jerusalem. Thus, the issue of the processed and consummated Triune God incorporated with His redeemed and transformed elect is the Father's house for God the Father's rest and satisfaction, the Son's vine as the organism of the Triune God in the Son for His spreading and multiplication, and the Spirit's new child to grow up to be the new man to carry out God's economy in the Spirit. This is the intrinsic view of the first sixteen chapters of John.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE SIXTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN INTRINSIC INTERPRETATION OF JOHN'S WRITINGS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE INCORPORATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br>WITH US, HIS REDEEMED PEOPLE</H2><P>We still need some further understanding concerning the incorporation of the Triune God with us, His redeemed people, seen in John 14:17b-20. Verse 17b shows that the Spirit of reality is in us, and verse 20 says that the Son is in the Father, we are in the Son, and the Son is in us. We have said that these four ins show the Triune God coinhering with us, and this coinhering is an incorporation.</P><P>We also need to see that the in in verse 17 is the consummation of the three ins in verse 20. The all-inclusive, compounded, life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. The word consummation means the totality. The life-giving Spirit is the totality of the Triune God. Therefore, His being in us equals the Triune God's being in us, and the Triune God's being in us is in verse 20. Christ is in the Father and we are in Christ, so we also are in the Father. Christ is in us and because He is in the Father, the Father is also in us. Christ is the centrality and universality of the Divine Trinity because He is the embodiment of the Father and He is realized as the Spirit. The Spirit of reality is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. His being in us equals the Triune God's being in us. Actually, there are only three ins, because the Spirit being in us is the totality of the three ins in verse 20. The Spirit enters into us as the reality of the Son, who is the embodiment of the Father. In other words, He enters into us as the totality of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A SKETCH OF JOHN 1 THROUGH 16</H2><P>Now I would like to give another short, simple sketch of the first sixteen chapters of John. The beginning of the Gospel of John unveils that God is the Word (1:1). This means that God speaks, and speaking means definition, explanation, and expression. Expression includes spreading and dispensing. The more someone speaks, the more he is spreading and dispensing himself into others. Speaking spreads and dispenses.</P><P>In the Word there is life and the life is the light (v. 4). Life is hidden but light expresses. The light shining equals the Word speaking for spreading and dispensing. Chapter one of John also mentions the Spirit (v. 32). The Spirit is for speaking and for shining, so the Spirit is the totality of God's spreading and dispensing. God's spreading and dispensing are through His being the Word and the light. The Word and the light added together equal the Spirit.</P><P>In John 6:63 the Lord said, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life." The Word and the Spirit give us life, and the light also gives us life by shining. The Word gives us life by speaking; the light gives us life by shining; and the Spirit gives us life by entering. The Word and the light come into us through the Spirit. This is the totality of God's spreading and dispensing. Thus, chapter one of John reveals that we receive life through the Word, the light, and the Spirit. When we receive the Word, the light, and the Spirit, we receive life, and this life is the authority for us to be the children of God (vv. 12-13). The threefold spreading and dispensing of the Word, the light, and the Spirit produces God's children, God's species, through the divine life.</P><P>John 1 also speaks of the Lamb (v. 29). Although the Word, the light, and the Spirit are sufficient for us to receive life to become God's children, God's species, the Lamb is needed because we are sinful. The Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world. We need Christ as the Lamb to take away our sin, which is the barrier that prevents Him from dispensing Himself into us as life. This life in us is the water (John 4:14). The water is life's flow. God Himself, through His being the Word, the light, and the Spirit, spreads and dispenses Himself into us to be our life, and this life is the flowing God, the living water. This covers the first four chapters of John.</P><P>The flowing of life brings us into the enjoyment of the Triune God, signified by two feasts in John 6 and 7: the Feast of Passover and the Feast of Tabernacles. The Feast of Passover is for eating the meat of the Passover lamb and the unleavened bread. The Feast of Tabernacles is for drinking. According to Hebrew history, there was a place at the temple where a spring was built which flowed continually. When the Lord Jesus stood and cried out on the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles, He stood in front of that spring, saying, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" (7:37-38). Our feasting enjoyment in a daily way includes eating and drinking. Without eating and drinking, we do not have any enjoyment. Whatever we eat and drink gets into us and is mingled and blended with our entire being.</P><P>This enjoyment issues in something. Physically speaking, a person's proper eating and drinking will result in him being a strong and healthy person. Whatever we eat and drink is mingled and incorporated with our being. In the divine and mystical realm, this incorporation is a divine and human constitution, the organism of the Triune God. This organism has three aspects: the house for the Father in John 14, the vine for the Son in John 15, the newborn babe for the Spirit in John 16. Our enjoyment of the processed and consummated Triune God has one issue in three aspects for the three of the Divine Trinity.</P><P>The house is for God's dwelling. Without a dwelling we would be wanderers with no rest and satisfaction. Furthermore, a home is the best place for someone to express himself. Also, a home with a household has children. The children of God are the fruit of the Triune God in the Son in John 15. The vine tree with its fruit is for spreading and multiplication. The children need to grow to maturity. The many children of God are the growing members of the one new man (Col. 3:10-11). This one new man is the Body of Christ. Through this man God's economy is carried out. This grown-up man can carry out a career to consummate the New Jerusalem.</P><P>John also wrote the book of Revelation, which begins with the shining lampstands (1:12) and ends with a call to drink the living water (22:17). The drinking's issue is the New Jerusalem. The writings of John cover the span from God to the New Jerusalem. Eventually, the triune, eternal God becomes the New Jerusalem incorporated with all of us. We do not enter into the New Jerusalem; we become the New Jerusalem. Our becoming is our entering in. This is the intrinsic interpretation of John's writings in his Gospel and Revelation.</P></body></html>
