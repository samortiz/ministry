<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SOUNDING OF THE SEVEN TRUMPETS<br>(Revelation 8:6â€”11:19)</H1><P>"And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to trumpet" (Rev. 8:6).</P><P>The seven angels are now ready to sound the trumpets.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE FIRST TRUMPET<br>(REVELATION 8:7)</H2><P>"And the first trumpeted, and there was hail and fire mingled with blood, and it was cast to the earth; and the third part of the earth was burned up, and the third part of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up." </P><P>God's judgment begins from afar. Progressively, it turns to man. God's judgment begins with the things outside of man, for God still hopes that man will repent.</P><P>This trumpet appears to cast fire on the earth, and one third of the trees on the earth are burned like wood. In the Old Testament, after the priests burned the sacrifices, the blood was poured out. Hence, both fire and blood are here. This fire will burn all the way into the abyss.</P><P>One third of the green grass and the trees are burned. This indicates that God will first destroy the beauty of nature.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SECOND TRUMPET<br>(REVELATION 8:8-9)</H2><P>"And the second angel trumpeted, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea; and the third part of the sea became blood, and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life died, and the third part of the ships were destroyed."</P><P>The calamity of this trumpet causes marine commerce to lose one third of its business. (Psalm 46:2 says, "...though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea.") This trumpet damages the sea.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE THIRD TRUMPET<br>(REVELATION 8:10-11)</H2><P>"And the third angel trumpeted, and a great star fell out of heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the springs of waters. And the name of the star is called Wormwood; and the third part of the waters became wormwood, and many of the men died from the waters because they were made bitter." </P><P>The first trumpet is with fire. The second trumpet is also with fire. The third trumpet is still with fire. God remembers the covenant which He made with Noah and will not judge the earth with water. "Wormwood" means bitter (Jer. 9:13-15; 23:14-15; Lam. 3:15). This trumpet damages the fresh water.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE FOURTH TRUMPET<br>(REVELATION 8:12)</H2><P>"And the fourth angel trumpeted, and the third part of the sun and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars were smitten, so that the third part of them would be darkened and the day would not appear for the third part of it, and the night likewise." </P><P>The light of the sun, the light of the moon, and the light of the stars are all dimmed. The heavenly bodies are all changed, and the world is darkened. However, God does not smite the entire sun, moon, or stars because He remembers His own word in Genesis 8:22. The calamities of the seals are general, while the calamities of the trumpets are specific and definite. Today the seals have been fulfilled or are being fulfilled, but the time of the trumpets has not yet come. Not one trumpet has sounded yet.</P><P>"And I saw, and I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to those who dwell on the earth because of the remaining trumpet sounds of the three angels who are about to trumpet!" (Rev. 8:13).</P><P>The seven seals are divided into four and three. The seven trumpets are also divided into four and three. The first four trumpets are merely calamities. The last three trumpets are trumpets of woes (9:12; 11:14). The first four trumpets are not directed specifically at man, but only touch man indirectly. The last three trumpets, however, touch man directly. The eagle is just an eagle and is not a sign, for even Balaam's donkey was able to speak. "Those who dwell on the earth" are different from those who are sojourners on the earth.</P>
