   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE AND MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have briefly considered five metaphors used by Paul in 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we need to consider what is the issue, the result, of the experience pictured by these metaphors.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The issue is constitution in life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have received the divine life, and God s intention is to work this life into our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we were regenerated, God wrought this life into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now God is seeking to spread His life from our spirit, the center of our being, into our soul and even into our body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may compare our spirit to the hub of a wheel, and our body to the rim.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has wrought His life into our spirit as the hub, and now He is spreading this life through the spokes of the soul to the rim of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then the entire wheel will be saturated and permeated with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is what it means to say that we are constituted of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Chapters two, three, and four of 2 Corinthians speak of such a constitution of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Throughout the centuries, the majority of believers have failed to see the matter of constitution of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This constitution of life is also the constitution of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not think that we only need the constitution of life and do not need the constitution of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every believer needs both the constitution of life and the constitution of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every believer has life, and every believer should share in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the reason we encourage all the saints to function in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To function is to carry out our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ministry is equal to service.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, to minister is to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may carry out our ministry by giving a testimony or by praying.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we testify and pray, we minister to those in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes a prayer renders more service than a testimony does.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not think that you have no ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Speaking, testifying, and praying are all aspects of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Ministry requires constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Just as our spiritual life needs a constitution, so our ministry also needs a constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, we cannot separate ministry, or function, from life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Life always functions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no such thing as a kind of life that does not function.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may use a fruit tree as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a fruit tree grows, it will blossom and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, if a fruit tree does not grow, it will not function.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If it does not grow, it will not blossom or bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may say that the blossoming and fruit-bearing of a fruit tree is its function, its ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do you know what fruit trees are doing as they are growing?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are functioning, ministering.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But apart from growth, fruit trees cannot minister.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Growth indicates life, and life needs to reach maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more we mature, the greater will be our measure of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The greater our measure of life is, the more we shall be able to function.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose a certain brother learns the Bible only in a doctrinal way without growing in life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What kind of function will he have?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His only function will be to teach the Bible in a theological way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He will not be able to function as a captive in Christ s procession or as His incense-bearer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, he will not be able to function by writing letters of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since he does not have the growth in life, he does not have the function that depends on life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This illustrates the crucial point that we cannot separate ministry from life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You should not say, I am not an apostle or an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since I am neither an apostle or an elder, my only need is for life; I do not need to have a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the contrary, you need to have both life and ministry, and in these three chapters both life and ministry are covered.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>CONSTITUTION AND TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In these chapters of 2 Corinthians, we see not only the matter of constitution but also the matter of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In 3:18 Paul clearly speaks of our being transformed into the same image from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Constitution is a matter of having a certain element transfused into us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We may use as an illustration the petrification of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How can wood be petrified?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Wood is petrified through a process of constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In this process certain mineral elements are deposited into the wood through the flowing of water.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This transfusing, this infusing, of mineral elements into the wood is constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Moreover, in the petrification of wood, the water carries away the old element and replaces it with a new element.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The petrification of wood illustrates the process of being constituted of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As the current of living water flows within us, it deposits the divine element into us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Furthermore, as the water flows through us and out of us, it carries away our wooden element.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Through the flowing of the water, the element of the divine minerals replaces the element of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The result is a metabolic constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>By metabolic we mean a process in which an old element is replaced by a new element.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we speak of constitution, we speak of the process of spiritual metabolism that affects us intrinsically by a divine life-replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What, then, is transformation?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Transformation denotes a change.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When wood is petrified, it undergoes a change as the old element is carried away and is replaced by a new element.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This change affects the wood inwardly, and it also affects its form outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, it is a matter of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The word transform includes the word form.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>For something to be transformed means that it changes from one form into another form.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, transformation implies a new kind of formation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Transformation is not only a matter of constitution; it is also a matter of building up a particular form.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In 3:18 this form is Christ s image.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In this verse Paul tells us that we are being transformed into the Lord s image.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>As Paul was writing these three chapters of 2 Corinthians, he had within him the thoughts of constitution and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If not, he would not have written these chapters in the way he did.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We cannot understand chapters two, three, and four of 2 Corinthians simply by reading them.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We can understand these chapters only after we have had a certain amount of spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The degree of our understanding depends on the extent of our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Our experience of these matters is not yet adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is why it is difficult for us to speak concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We must have experience in order to understand experiential things.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Only then shall we be able to present these things to others.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>RESPONDING TO THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Both constitution and transformation take place through the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>From the time we were regenerated, the divine dispensing has been going on within us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The rate of this dispensing, whether fast or slow, depends on our response.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In other words, it depends on our cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If we cooperate with the divine dispensing, it will go on swiftly and will work effectively.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But, sorry to say, after being regenerated, we have not responded fully to the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Nevertheless, we have responded to it to some extent, and we have cooperated with it at least a little.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In these three chapters of 2 Corinthians Paul is seeking to portray the dispensing of the divine element into our tripartite being.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This dispensing is to produce constitution and transformation so that we may have maturity in life and also a measure of ministry.</S>
