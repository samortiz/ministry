In this period of time He willingly presented Himself to the children of Israel for a thorough examination. Then He was crucified on the day of the Passover. This indicates that He was the real Passover Lamb; the lamb in Exodus 12 was a type.</p><p>As portrayed in Matthew 21:23-22:46, during His last visit to Jerusalem, the center of Judaism, Christ was surrounded by the chief priests, elders, Pharisees, Herodians, and Sadducees, along with a self-approved lawyer, all of whom endeavored to ensnare Him by asking puzzling and insidious questions. In responding to the chief priests and elders regarding His authority, He spoke three parables: the parable of the shifting of the birthright, the parable of the vineyard, and the parable of the wedding feast. After answering all their questions wisely, He asked them, &#8220;What do you think concerning the Christ?&#8221; This is the question of questions. The Pharisees replied that Christ was David&#8217;s son. Then the Lord said, &#8220;If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?&#8221; The question here is how a great-grandfather could call his great-grandson Lord. This was one question the Pharisees did not know how to answer. As God, in His divinity, Christ is the Lord of David; as a man, in His humanity, He is the Son of David.</p><p>After the Lord had been examined and tested by all His opposers, in His wisdom He muzzled their mouths. Eventually, in chapter twenty-three, He rebuked the Jewish religionists, first speaking against their hypocrisy (23:1-12), and then pronouncing an eightfold woe upon the scribes and Pharisees (vv. 13-36). This rebuke (vv. 1-36) affords us an accurate picture of today&#8217;s religion. The kingdom life must be the opposite of what is exposed in these verses. Only by the mercy and grace of the Lord can we escape the situation portrayed here.</p><p>In 23:37-39 the Lord forsook Jerusalem with its temple. As He was speaking a final word to Jerusalem, He was still like a loving hen, stretching out His wings to brood over the little ones, but they were not willing to be gathered under His wings. Here He made clear that He, the very glory of God, was leaving the nation of Israel and that they would not see Him until His coming again.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Holy Word for Morning Revival, The: Matthew, Vol. 4 (21:23-28:20) &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
