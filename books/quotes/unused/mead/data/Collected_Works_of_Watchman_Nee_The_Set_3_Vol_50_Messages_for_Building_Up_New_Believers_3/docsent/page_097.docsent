   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This city is built upon seven hills.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The woman is sitting upon these hills.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is only one city in the whole world which bears the name The City of Seven Hills Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Often great cities of the earth have more than one name.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, Canton is also known as "Sui," and Shanghai is known as "Hu."</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Religious Rome and the Political Rome</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is clear that this woman is Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the question is which Rome is she.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Is she the political Rome or the religious Rome?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are two different Romes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Is this woman the Rome of Catholicism or the imperial Rome?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We will find the answer to this after we consider the following explanations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Revelation 17:3-4 says, "He carried me away in spirit into a wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here are two things before us: One is a woman and the other is a beast.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The woman is sitting upon the beast with seven heads and ten horns.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The seven heads upon the beast are seven kings, and the ten horns are ten kings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The seven kings are the great kings, while the ten kings are the small kings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The two kinds of kings are different in the Greek text.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One is a big king, while the other is a small king.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Most Bible readers know that the beast is the Rome of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the beast is the imperial Rome, which includes seven kings and ten kings, the woman has to be the religious Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are only two Romes imperial Rome and religious Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One is the political Rome, whereas the other is the ecclesiastical Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The woman is sitting upon the beast, which means that the church is sitting upon the Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the beast is the Roman Empire, clearly the woman is the religious Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>While the Spirit of God shows us Rome's past, how is she today and how will she be in the future?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God's Word provides a clear answer to these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Purple and Scarlet</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Revelation 17:4 says, "The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Purple is the color of royalty.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The pope has always claimed to be the king.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At the same time, everyone who has ever visited Rome knows that scarlet is the color of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What are the cardinals called?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In Chinese they are known as the "Scarlet Robe" cardinals.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Their robes, inner garments, and even socks, are all scarlet in color.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The pope's carriage is scarlet as well.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Three-quarters of his guards are dressed in scarlet.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>His carpets are scarlet.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Wherever the pope travels, scarlet carpet is rolled out along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Rome is full of scarlet.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>On the one hand, the clothing is in purple.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>On the other hand, no other country has as much scarlet as Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Gilded with Gold, Precious Stone, and Pearls</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>"Gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is hard to find another place on earth that has as much gold and as many precious stones and pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The cathedrals in Rome, the idols in the cathedrals, and all the adornments and crowns of the pope are made of gold, precious stone, and pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>For example, the pope has a diamond, the Kruger Diamond, which is worth 833,000 British pounds.</S>
