   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God Promising to Let Man Have Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and Providing Man with Covering</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the divine economy in the fall of man, God also promised to let man have life and provided man with covering Gen 3:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The life here signifies God's eternal life, and the covering typifies God's coming redemption in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Realizing that they were sinful, Adam and Eve tried to cover their nakedness with aprons made of fig leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But God made them coats of skin and clothed them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God killed an animal, probably a lamb, and used the skin to make a covering for them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That was a type of His coming redemption in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the divine economy in Genesis 3, there were two promises and a provision.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God promised that one would come to destroy the serpent, and He promised to give the divine life to fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then He provided a covering to indicate that Christ would come to accomplish redemption to cover the fallen people so that they might be justified before God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a complete gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. The Issue of the Satanic Chaos</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Genesis 3:22-24 we see that there was an issue of the satanic chaos.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Fallen Man Being Driven Out</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>from the Garden of Eden</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In His restoration of creation, God purposely created a garden of pleasure, which was called the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Due to the fall, man was driven out of that garden.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was the first aspect of the issue of the satanic chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Entrance to the Tree of Life</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Being Closed to the Fallen Man</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The second aspect of this issue was that the entrance to the tree of life was closed to the fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The entrance would remain closed until Christ came to accomplish redemption and thus open again the way to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>IN THE FURTHER STEPS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>AND CONSUMMATION OF MAN'S FALL</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the further steps and consummation of man's fall, we see more aspects of the divine economy and the satanic chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The fall of man had at least four steps, and then it reached its consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A. The Divine Economy</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These firstlings typified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because God regarded Abel's offering, Abel was justified and accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to the divine economy, Abel was recovered and justified.</S>
