   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE THE EPISTLES TO THE SEVEN CHURCHES 1 Scripture Reading: Rev 2:1-17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 2 and 3 contain the seven epistles to the churches, which are the last epistles given by the Lord to His church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These seven epistles were written to seven churches in Asia; however, at that time there were more than seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why did the Lord write epistles to only these seven churches?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Bible students agree that these seven churches are representative of all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are a full picture of the condition of all the churches at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A PROPHECY OF THE FULL COURSE OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moreover, Revelation is a book of prophecy 22:7, 18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, what is mentioned in chapters two and three must also be in the nature of prophecy, and we must interpret the seven epistles as prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the four Gospels, the book of Acts, and the twenty-one Epistles there is no adequate prophecy concerning the course of the church on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If Revelation 2 and 3 were not a prophecy of the church, there would be a gap in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, this gap is filled by these two chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The picture of the seven churches in these two chapters is a prophecy of the full course of the church during the long period from the end of the time of the apostles to the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In addition, if we do not understand these two chapters in the way of prophecy, they are not as meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we realize these two chapters in the way of prophecy, we will obtain their proper meaning, and they will be very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we compare the record of these two chapters with the facts of church history, we will realize that they correspond to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These seven local churches in Asia represent not only the situation of all of the churches in Asia at that time but also the seven stages of the course of the church on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we look into these seven epistles from this point of view and under this light, we will realize how meaningful and helpful they are.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we talk about the practice of the church, we all need to know and understand the seven stages of the course of the church on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>About forty years ago in China, Brother Watchman Nee published twenty-four issues of a monthly paper entitled The Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Each issue contained many pages of meditations and exposition on the first three chapters of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was the first time that our eyes were opened by the Lord to see what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those twenty-four issues revolutionized the young people throughout all of Christianity in China.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>More than 10,000 copies of each issue were distributed throughout the country.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Following this, during World War II, Brother Nee conducted a study of Revelation 2 and 3 a second time in a wonderful way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I received much help from all of these writings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE CHURCH IN EPHESUS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 represent the progress of the church in seven stages.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first church, the church in Ephesus, represents the stage from the end of the time of the apostles to the time when the Roman Empire began to persecute Christianity 2:1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That was the short period during the latter part of the first century, the initial stage of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the early apostles had passed away by that time, and only John, the writer of this book, remained.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During this stage the church was still prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, although the church had not drifted far away from a proper condition, there was a hidden factor that became the source of her fall and degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She had left her first love toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There was nothing wrong outwardly; outwardly speaking, everything was all right and normal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Within, however, she had lost her first love v. 4 . The word first in Greek also means best.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first love which the church had lost was the best love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, the Lord rebuked this church and warned her that she must repent.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If she would not repent, she would suffer loss in two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First, the lampstand would be removed from Ephesus v. 5 . History tells us that in all the centuries since the lampstand in Ephesus was taken away, there has never been a genuine church there.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This prophetic word of warning truly has been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The second loss was that the believers would not be rewarded with the enjoyment of the tree of life in the Paradise of God v. 7 . The lampstand is a matter of light, and the tree of life is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we lose our first love toward the Lord, we will not have the enjoyment of life, and the light will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we do love the Lord, on the other hand, we will enjoy Him as life, and we will enjoy light as the issue of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Life is the light John 1:4 , but in order to enjoy this life we must love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may do many works for the Lord, and outwardly speaking we may have no problems with the Lord, but if we do not have the best, first, and fresh love to the Lord, we will not enjoy Him in a full way as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then we will lose the shining of light.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a warning to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we intend to practice the church life, we cannot merely do something in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must start from within by loving the Lord with the best love, the first love, and a fresh love.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then we will enjoy Him as the tree of life in the Paradise of God, and we will have the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The loss of the first love was the very source, the factor, of the degradation of the church.</S>
