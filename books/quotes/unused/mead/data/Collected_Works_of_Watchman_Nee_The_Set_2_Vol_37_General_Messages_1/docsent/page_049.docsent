   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE THE DIVIDING OF THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Heb 4:12-13 ONE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The dividing of the soul from the spirit is a very important thing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It has to do with the growth of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a Christian cannot tell the difference between the soul and the spirit, how can he seek after that which is spiritual?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He will often take soulish things for spiritual things, always live a life in the soul, and not seek after that which is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's Word mentions many times what the soul is like and what the spirit is like.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible mentions some people who grieve in the soul and some people who grieve in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It mentions some people who rejoice in the soul and some people who rejoice in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some draw the conclusion from these verses that the spirit must be the same as the soul because they have similar functions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, this is like saying that you are me since you can eat and I can eat.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since the soul and the spirit can be divided from each other, it is clear that the spirit is the spirit and the soul is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Genesis 2 shows us that when God created man, He breathed the breath of life into his nostrils.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When this breath of life came in contact with the human body, the soul was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 7 speaks of man becoming a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that the outstanding feature of man is his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The breath of life is the spirit of man; it came from God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The spirit has a God-consciousness; it responds to God's voice and is able to fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But after Adam fell, his spirit became dead towards God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thereafter, Adam's spirit as well as his descendants' spirit was dominated by the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the end, the spirit and the soul were mixed together.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the time man is saved, his spirit becomes alive to God once more.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet because of the long period of mixture with the soul, the spirit now needs God's word in order to be divided from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although the spirit and the soul are similar in function, they belong to two different realms.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They have two different sources.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You may be happy today, but your happiness may be from the soul or from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In both cases it is happiness, but there is a distinction between the places from which the happiness comes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You may be sad today, but your sadness may be from the soul or from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In both cases it is sadness, but there is a distinction between the places from which the sadness comes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God is concerned about the source from which a thing comes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, Abraham was about to beget a son.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At that time he was very old, and there did not seem to be much hope.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He waited for a long time without seeing God's promise being fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then his wife came up with a plan; she suggested that Abraham marry Hagar.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually Ishmael was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Fourteen years later God gave him Isaac through his wife Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we only read Genesis 15 17 and 21, we will not know what Isaac and Ishmael represent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Galatians 4, we find out what Isaac and Ishmael represent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul said that one was born according to promise, while the other was born according to flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do we see the distinction here?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man thinks that as long as one has a son, everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But God asks where the son comes from.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We think that as long as we have a son, be it an Isaac or an Ishmael, we will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But God's Word says that Ishmael represents the flesh, while Isaac represents the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Ishmael represents what man acquires through his own wisdom and strength, while Isaac represents what man receives from God and what is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then what does it mean to be soulish?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Being soulish is doing things by the self.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What does it mean to be spiritual?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Being spiritual is doing things by God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These are two entirely different things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A person can do things without waiting on God and without trusting in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is soulish and fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He can also speak and move only when God tells him to speak and move, looking to God, waiting on Him, and trusting in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is what it means to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to ask whether everything we do is done in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is a crucial question.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We often do the right things, yet something within us still condemns them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We condemn them not because they are bad but because they do not originate from God and are not the result of the operation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
