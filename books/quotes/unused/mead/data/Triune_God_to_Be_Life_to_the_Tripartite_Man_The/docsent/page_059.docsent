   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE BEQUESTS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST AS THE GOD-MAN, THE ACHIEVEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE CROSS OF CHRIST, AND CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AS THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ as the God-man, the achievement of His cross, and Christ as the life-giving Spirit are three bequests in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These have been bequeathed by Him to us through His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today Christ in resurrection is these three items.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We were chosen by God in eternity, and we were called by God in time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now through His choosing and calling, we have become believers and members of Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, who was processed through incarnation, death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Him we have divinity, the proper humanity, the cross accomplished by His all-inclusive death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is the life-giving Spirit and we are His members.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His divinity, humanity, all-inclusive death, and the riches of resurrection are all with us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These riches are the totality of what He is as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE WAY TO ENJOY CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have been joined to Christ 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our need is to enjoy what He is as the consummated Spirit, the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The way for us to enjoy Him is to bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In my youth as a devoted Christian, I spoke a lot about bearing the cross, but like most Christians, my understanding concerning bearing the cross was mainly that of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to see the real significance of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The cross is the centrality and universality of Christ's redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ in His redemptive work first brought us all with Him to the cross to terminate us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He terminated us with the whole old creation for the purpose of germinating us with Himself as the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His death was for His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ's death was not the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was the means to reach the goal of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His death was the termination of the old creation for the germination of the new creation in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is the life-giving Spirit within us in resurrection making us the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The turning point of His making the old creation into the new creation is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are going to live a life in the new creation, we must bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In other words, we must be under the termination of the cross all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The termination of the cross is a lifelong matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our crucifixion with Christ was accomplished once and for all at the cross, but the experience of His cross is lifelong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we experience the cross terminating us in a daily way, we are eventually led to live not an exchanged life but a grafted life.</S>
