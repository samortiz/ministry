   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPEAKING THE SAME THING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some have said that the Lord s recovery is a one-man show, that here there is room only for the ministry of Witness Lee, not for the ministry of anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is absolutely false.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is not my intention nor is it my practice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Lord s recovery I do not like to see one brother ministering all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, during the summer training in 1964 and 1965 I invited a certain brother to share with me in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually, he gave up the recovery; but we did not give him up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have also invited other brothers to participate in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our intention is to have a good number of brothers ministering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, all who share in the ministry need to minister the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I say that we all should minister the same thing, I mean that we should speak the same thing according to the way of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The four Gospels speak the same thing, but they speak the same thing from different angles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We cannot deny that there are differences between Matthew and Mark or between Luke and John.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Matthew wrote from the angle of the kingship; Mark, from the angle of service; Luke, from the angle of redemption through the proper humanity; and John, from the angle of Christ s deity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Gospels we have four biographies of one Person; one Person is viewed from different angles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I hope that many will be raised up to speak the same thing from different angles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This one thing is the recovery of Christ as life and everything to us for the building up of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some criticize the brothers by saying that they are nothing but tape recordings of Witness Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I hope that in the coming years many of the young people will speak of Christ for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have no intention of being the only one to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the contrary, I expect the Lord to raise up many more to carry on the unique ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all have a part in this ministry, which is one ministry with different functions, different angles, and different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You have your part and I have mine.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we have all the functions and aspects, we have the ministry of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some who have left the recovery accuse us of not accepting their ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But their ministry is a ministry of undermining and damaging the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How can we possibly accept the ministries of those whose intention has been to undermine the Lord s recovery and to overthrow the basic matters of life, including the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I say this not out of any personal feeling, but out of a concern for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have no personal enmity whatever toward these ones; however, I cannot accept their ministry, which tears down rather than builds up.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to be clear about the truth regarding the ministry, about the situation of today s Christianity, and about our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our practice is according to the truth in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are glad to see different brothers share various aspects or angles concerning Christ as life for the building up of the church in His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I recognize that I am very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nevertheless, by the Lord s mercy, I am doing what I should do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now I expect that others will minister the same thing from different angles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I certainly do not want anyone to copy me, and I do not want to be surrounded by yes men.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What an insult to say that the brothers are yes men !</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I repeat, many brothers need to stand up to minister concerning Christ for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How wonderful it would be if many did this!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE BLESSING OF SPEAKING THE SAME THING</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I was a young man, I loved the Bible very much, and I spent as much time as I could studying it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The last thing I did before going to sleep at night was read a portion of the Word, and the first thing I did upon waking in the morning was read another portion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For seven and a half years I was under the Brethren teachers, who taught me how to interpret the parables, prophecies, and types.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How I loved their teaching!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, I met Brother Nee, and through him I came to know life, the Spirit, Christ for my experience, the church, and the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All these things became truth to me and caused my entire Christian being to be revolutionized.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After a church had been raised up in northern China through my ministry, I visited Brother Nee in Shanghai and stayed with him for a period of months.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At the end of that time, he told me that he and the co-workers felt that I should come with my family to Shanghai and work there with them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From that time onward, my speaking was always in the line of Brother Nee s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I knew that he had been raised up by the Lord to bring in the recovery and that I had to be one with him in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, I preached whatever he preached, although not like a tape recorder.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I was absolutely one with him, and I spoke the same thing as he.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have no regrets about this because it has been the cause of great blessing to me and to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to be clear that we are not following a man nor imitating anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, we are ministering the same thing from different angles and in different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By doing this the riches are manifest; yet we have a glorious oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the one ministry, which encompasses many ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We all are ministering Christ as life and as everything for the building up of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the Lord s recovery, this is our commission, this is our burden, and this is our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How blessed we are to have a part in this ministry!</S>
