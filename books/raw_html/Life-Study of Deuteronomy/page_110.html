<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE CONCLUDING WORD</H2><P>In 30:11-20 we have Moses' concluding word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Commandment Which Moses<br>Was Commanding the Children of Israel<br>Not Being Too Difficult for Them,<br>nor Being Distant</H2><P>The commandment which Moses was commanding the children of Israel was not too difficult for them, nor was it distant (v. 11). It was not in heaven that they should say, "Who will ascend to heaven for us and bring it to us that we may hear it and do it?" (v. 12). Nor was it across the sea that they should say, "Who will go across the sea for us and bring it to us that we may hear it and do it?" (v. 13). But the commandment was very near to them, even in their mouth and in their heart, that they might do it (v. 14). As we have pointed out, in Romans 10:6-10 Paul relates the word spoken here to Christ for the New Testament believers to receive for salvation. This is our basis for saying that Christ is unveiled throughout the book of Deuteronomy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Moses Putting before the Children<br>of Israel Life and Good, and Death and Evil</H2><P>Moses put before the children of Israel life and good, and death and evil (v. 15). If they obeyed the commandment of Jehovah their God to love Him, walk in His ways, and keep His commandments, statutes, and judgments, they would live and multiply, and He would bless them in the land which they would enter and possess (v. 16). But if their heart turned and they did not listen, but rather they were drawn away in worship to other gods and served them, they would surely perish (vv. 17-18a). Their days would not be extended upon the land which they would possess over the Jordan (v. 18b). Moses called heaven and earth to witness against them: he had set before them life and death, blessing and curse (v. 19a). He exhorted them to choose life that they and their seed might live, in loving Jehovah their God by listening to His voice and holding fast to Him; for He was their life and the length of their days, that they might dwell upon the land which He swore to their fathers to give them (vv. 19b-20).</P><P>By considering the enactment of the covenant in Deuteronomy 29 and 30, we can see that what is on God's heart concerning His people is that they would cooperate with Him. To keep the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments&#151;this is just to cooperate with God. This is what God wants us to do. We need to say, "Lord, I stand with You. I take You, Your will, and Your word." However, we should not try to do this in ourselves and by ourselves. To do this is to insult the Lord. We should simply cooperate with Him by letting Him do everything. If we do this, we will become not the doers but the enjoyers. Then everything will be fulfilled.</P><P>Let us remember that, as we saw in the foregoing message, at the entry of the good land was a monument upon which God's requirements were written, demanding that we satisfy God's desire. When we admit that we are not able to fulfill these requirements, we should turn to the altar with the offerings, which signify Christ as our Substitute, and be enjoyers instead of doers. Then we will receive blessing upon blessing.</P>
