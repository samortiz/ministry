   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We should not think that we are wiser than God or that we can act beyond what the Bible reveals.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Even though the sickroom may sometimes feel like a sanctuary, and everyone who enters may be touched by the atmosphere, this is not God's ordained will and not God's best.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we act according to our emotion and ignore God's revelation, He can only allow us to walk as we please.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many believers say, "No matter what happens, I will commit myself to God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whether I get well, or whether I remain sick, I will let God make the decision for me, and I will let Him deal with me as He pleases."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But very often, we see these people resorting to medicine at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Is this what one does when he commits everything into God's hand?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In seeking after God's healing, they put the responsibility in God's hand, and in seeking after man's healing, they resort to medicine all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is too contradictory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fact is that many believers have lost their willpower through their prolonged period of bed rest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They can no longer hold onto God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Their submission is actually a kind of spiritual laziness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They desire to be healthy, but this desire will not cause God to do any work on them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many believers have become passively resigned to their illness for a long time; they have grown habitually sick and have no boldness to seek freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They would rather have others believe for them or have God give them faith and make them believe apart from their own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, unless their will is motivated, and unless they resist the devil and hold onto the Lord Jesus, the God-given faith will not come.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many patients do not have to be sick; they are sick because they do not have the strength to claim God's promises.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must realize that the spiritual blessings that we receive in sickness are far less than the spiritual blessings we gain in restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If, through trusting in God and consecrating ourselves to Him, we are healed, we should continue to live a holy life after our restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only this will maintain us in a healthy state.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By healing us in this way, the Lord gains our body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This joy is unspeakable.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yet this joy comes not because we are healed, but because we have a new relationship with our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have a new experience of Him and receive new contact and new life from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At such times, God is glorified much more than when a believer is sick.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, God's children should rise up and seek healing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First we should go before the Lord and listen to what He wants to speak to us through our sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Next we should walk with a single heart according to what He has revealed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Finally we should put our body wholeheartedly into His care and consecrate our body to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If there are elders of the church who can anoint with oil James 5:14-15 , we should invite them to come and let them follow the injunction of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Otherwise, we should remain in calmness and exercise our faith to hold onto God's promise Exo 15:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God will heal us.</S>
