   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to reach the standard, we also need to receive revelation 3:3, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A prophet is one who is full of light, one who sees what others do not see.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who are in darkness have nothing to say, but those who are in the light have a great deal to speak forth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever we see something by revelation, we automatically have something to talk about.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we would be today s sent ones and prophets, we must receive both grace and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By receiving grace and revelation, we shall spontaneously become burdened to contact others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One who gets into the Word daily and who prays consistently will have a burden to speak to others about what he has seen and experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the very least, he will have the desire to call someone on the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not think that the grace and revelation you receive will allow you to remain passive or inactive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No, the grace and revelation will burden you to go to others and to minister to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is to be an apostle and a prophet in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is useless for me or anyone else to charge you to be such a sent one and spokesman.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The only thing that avails is for you to get into the Word, pray, and receive grace and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever you are enlightened by the Lord, you will be eager to tell others what you have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The way to receive revelation is to get into the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I believe that Paul received revelation through his study of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because he spent so much time in the Word, revelation could come to him by means of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Pharisees, however, could not receive revelation from the Word because they were closed and disobedient.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul, however, was open.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the veils that covered him were taken away by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we come to the Word, we should ask the Lord to remove the veils from our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although we do not know what veils are still upon us, the Lord knows, and He is willing to remove them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to pray, Lord, I am coming to Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Take away anything that veils my sight, and make Your Word open to me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we pray in this manner, light will come in, and we shall receive revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we shall speak to others according to the light we have received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such a speaking, a speaking full of divine light, will greatly surprise the religious ones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Oh, the church people must be full of light, full of revelation!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>ASKING PROPER QUESTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In receiving revelation, we should not be concerned with minor things such as foot-washing, the method of baptism, or the size of the cup used at the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am troubled when saints question me regarding secondary matters, but neglect the matters of God s eternal purpose and God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once I visited a certain place where the people were supposed to be quite spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>During a fellowship meeting held for the purpose of answering questions, I was disappointed by the kind of questions that were asked.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I was asked questions about minor things, but no one asked me about significant things such as the difference between the mystery of Christ and the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The questions we ask indicate where we are and what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, many of the questions addressed to me by my little grandchildren are nonsensical.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I do not expect them to ask questions about profound subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to ask a high question, we need to have considerable knowledge and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we read chapter three of Ephesians, we need to ask question after question.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here are some questions we should ask: What is the stewardship of the grace?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What is the mystery of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What is a joint-heir?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What are the unsearchable riches of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What is the dispensation of the mystery?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is the difference between ages and generations?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is the purpose of the ages?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What does it mean to be strengthened into the inner man?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How can Christ make His home in our hearts?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we seek out the answers to questions like these, we shall receive revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After we receive light and revelation in answer to questions such as these, we shall have a great deal to share with others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We in the Lord s recovery must be speaking people, those who speak day by day because we have received revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more we see, the more we shall desire to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the reason that I always have something to speak in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Actually, the more I speak, the more there is to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we would be such speaking ones, we need to receive revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All the saints, not just the leading apostles, should receive revelation.</S>
