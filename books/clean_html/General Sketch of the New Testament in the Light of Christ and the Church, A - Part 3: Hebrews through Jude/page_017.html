<h2 class=head2>Being Careful Not to Form a Camp</h2><p>The camp is organized religion, which claims to be the people of God yet gives no room to Christ. Instead, it has only rituals, rules, orders, and other such matters. Originally Judaism was established by God, but later the ground given to God was lost, and no ground was given to Christ. Rather, the people turned it into a religion with rituals and regulations, producing a camp.<p>On the day of Pentecost the church was established. Originally it was something living, but gradually even within the church the ground for God and Christ was lost. In The Waning Authority of Christ in the Churches, A. W. Tozer wrote that according to his realization, Jesus Christ is “little more than a beloved symbol” among the churches of today and that no real ground is given to Christ. As a pastor in a large denomination in America, he observed that there is no room for Jesus Christ in the denominational churches. That was his full recognition that Christianity today is a camp, a religious organization.<p>The church originally was a living Body to contain Christ, and Christ had the full ground within the church, but gradually this ground was lost, and the church drifted first into Catholicism. During the time of Martin Luther, the Roman Catholic Church was one hundred percent a camp. When the Reformation began, many pure, seeking Christians left Catholicism; they went out of that camp. However, after not too long, even the reformed churches themselves gradually became many camps. On the one hand, we have to give up the camp, but on the other hand, we must be careful not to become another camp. If a group of people claim to belong to God but do not give any ground to Christ, they will form rituals, charters, creeds, rules, and regulations and give no ground to the Holy Spirit. Then they will become a camp. We must reject and forsake such a camp, and we must come out of it. We must not only reject organized Christianity; we have to reject any camp we ourselves may form. We should not try to form anything. Whatever we form, no matter how much it seems to be according to the pattern of the New Testament, is still a camp. If we are truly following the Lord, we must drop all these things. Then what we should do is minister Christ and give birth to Christ in so many persons.<h2 class=head1>THE SUBJECTIVE WORK OF THE GOD OF PEACE</h2><p>Chapter thirteen of Hebrews contains some final charges, after which verses 20 to 25 are a conclusion. Verses 20 and 21 say, “Now the God of peace, He who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, in the blood of an eternal covenant, perfect you in every good work for the doing of His will, doing in us that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.” In verse 21, Jesus Christ is the subjective Christ. Even this book, which deals with the truth, tells us that God must work within us subjectively through Jesus Christ. This conclusion impresses us that all the teachings within it are for the subjective work of God within us.
