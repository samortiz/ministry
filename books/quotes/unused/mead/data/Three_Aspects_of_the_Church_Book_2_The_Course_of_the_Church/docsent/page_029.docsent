   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Assistance from Roman Politics</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Roman politics was a frustration and trouble to the Jews but was a great help in the spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Roman politics aided the church in the following three points.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Peace and Unity</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is difficult to preach the gospel in a time of unrest.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Under the iron-fisted policies of the early Roman government, the apostles were in a large realm that was safe and peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because the regions around the Mediterranean were under one governing authority, travel was safe, and there were few murders.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The apostles went out to preach the gospel in safety in Asia, Rome, Spain, and Africa, because the entire Mediterranean region was under one government.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If this had not been the case if, for example, Judea had been its own little country the church would have had no way to spread into the rest of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without the Roman Empire the church could not have spread to Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It would have had great difficulty in spreading to the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church spread quickly in the region around the Mediterranean Sea because of Roman politics.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Easy Communication</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to facilitate the movement of military supplies, the Roman Empire cared not only for shipping on the Mediterranean Sea but also for land travel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Romans built many large, direct roads so that people could travel from Asia straight to Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These roads were a great convenience to travelers of that day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, the apostle Paul could make three long trips to and from foreign lands.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must credit this convenience to Roman politics.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Convenient Travel</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today a passport is necessary for international travel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the time of the apostles, however, the regions around the Mediterranean Sea all belonged to the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This made travel convenient and safe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Paul was defending himself before the Sanhedrin in Acts 22, he mentioned that he was a Roman citizen v. 25 ; the Roman commander was therefore obligated to take good care of him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This care was a convenience given to Paul by the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, Jewish religion, Greek culture, and Roman politics aided the church in a number of ways.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God did a preparatory work in these three areas even before the Holy Spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These three things are the aggregate of human culture.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Human culture became a tool to assist the church once it was established on the earth at the fullness of God s time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The assistance given to the church enabled its rapid spread to every place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Throughout church history, God has been controlling these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>HINDRANCES TO THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jewish religion, Greek culture, and Roman politics assisted the church, but they also hindered it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is difficult to calculate whether the help outweighed the hindrances.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I believe that the hindrances were greater than the assistance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may wonder why God would work in this way, but we must see that He expresses His wisdom in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hindrances from Jewish Religion Persecution</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even though the church was produced out of Judaism, the Jews were the first ones to persecute the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Mixture</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Satan used Judaism to persecute the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, since persecution did not destroy the church, he brought Judaism with its traditions and content into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This changed the nature of the church and caused it to become a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Much of the Holy Spirit s speaking in the New Testament Epistles deals with the problem of Judaism; Galatians, Philippians, and Hebrews are examples of such portions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Judaism hindered the church through persecution and mixture, killing and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church is still hindered by religion in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Religious concepts aid the church in many ways and help in the preaching of the gospel; however, the church is frequently persecuted by religion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When persecution is unsuccessful, Satan changes his tactics, bringing religious things into the church and bringing the church into religion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, religion both helps and hinders the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Religion brings persecution and opposition and then brings mixture and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many saints still have religious concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For example, there are concepts concerning which style of building is suitable for a meeting place; some think that a hall should be built with high ceilings and narrow windows and should not have too much light in order to give people a sense of solemnity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The religious mind also wants an organ and other furnishings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These are religious concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are not even aware how many religious concepts we hold.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, if someone has no religious concepts, it is difficult to speak to him about the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Nonetheless, the convenience afforded by religious concepts always becomes a problem to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Despite being saved, many brothers and sisters still have religious concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Those who opposed the Lord and the apostles were not atheists but Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Most of the problems in the early church did not come from the Gentiles but from the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In John 16:2 the Lord said, An hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This refers to the Jews persecution of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Church history illustrates this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Madame Guyon, John Bunyan, and Martin Luther all had problems that came from believers in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>These problems are not losses to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Problems are different from losses.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This demonstrates God s wisdom, because only in this way is the church preserved from being changed in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Initially it was proper to take advantage of man s religious concepts in the preaching of the gospel, but later the church needed to be freed from the influence of religious concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A particularly strong work of Satan in the early church was to invade the church with the religious, pious concepts of Judaism; Paul s troubles stemmed from this source.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The story is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Man s natural, religious concepts and pious thoughts are readily accepted because they are good.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, when religious piety is brought into the church, it is equivalent to bringing in the law of good and evil from Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The result is trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Religious concepts should be shut out of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The church is outwardly similar to religion, but the two have different natures.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The principle of Judaism is outward ordinances; the principle of the church is the inward leading of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Cathedrals and melodious singing invoke solemnity and reverential behavior, but such behavior is according to the natural human concept and is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, we can meet in the desert, not caring about the building or music, because the church is a matter of life and not of anything outward.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The persecution of the church by religion is not as bad as the mixture brought into the church by religion.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Even the killing of Christians by Jewish religion was not as bad as the mixture of Judaism with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The danger that religion brings into the church is found in Acts 15 and 21.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Even today we have natural, religious things in us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is difficult for some local churches to spread because the saints have deep religious concepts; this is the greatest hindrance to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The church should not fear persecution from religion but should fear mixture with religion.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The church is produced out of Christ, and its nature is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The church has been chosen out of the world; therefore, the church should not be mixed with the elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Throughout church history Satan s most devious work has been to invade the church with human things.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Roman Catholic Church came into being because elements of Judaism and Gentile religions were brought into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The rituals of Catholicism reflect Babylon the Great; this is Satan s scheme.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We cannot say that we have completely escaped this influence; it is the hidden poison within the church, although it is not so evident outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This word is not for others; we must apply it to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we hold on to things that are not of Christ and life but rather come from our natural piety, Satan will use us to do a work that endangers the church.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>At times even Paul was not clear, but God came in and spared the church from harm Acts 21:18-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Initially, religion benefits the church, but ultimately it is a great danger.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>However, God protects the church and leads it in the narrow way.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In principle, things such as religion, culture, and politics influence the church in a positive manner at first, but later they become hindrances.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The church is pure, and it should have no element that is not of Christ, for Christ, and Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Whatever does not match Christ is apart from Christ and does not belong to the church.</S>
