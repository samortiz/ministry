<h1 class="title">The New Jerusalem&mdash;the Eternal Mount Zion</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 14:1; 21:1-3, 16; Heb. 12:22;<br />
Eph. 4:16; Rev. 3:12</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The entire New Jerusalem is Zion, the Holy of Holies, the place where God is&mdash;Rev. 14:1-5; 21:16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Among the Old Testament types, there is God&rsquo;s holy city, Jerusalem, and within this city there is a high peak called Zion, on which the temple was built&mdash;Psa. 2:6; 125:1.</li>
	<li>Jerusalem typifies the church, and Zion typifies the overcomers in the church:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Zion is the high peak, the center, the uplifting, the strengthening, the enriching, and the reality of the church&mdash;20:2; 48:2, 11-12; 53:6a; 87:2.</li>
		<li>Zion is the highlight of Jerusalem, the beauty of the holy city&mdash;48:2; 50:2.</li>
		<li>The hill of Zion is absolutely open to the Lord and is absolutely possessed by Him&mdash;24:1, 3, 7-10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In the church age, the God-men who have been perfected and matured are Zion, the overcomers&mdash;Rev. 14:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church is the heavenly Jerusalem, and the overcomers are Zion as the high peak and the highlight&mdash;Heb. 12:22; Rev. 14:1.</li>
		<li>The church life is today&rsquo;s Jerusalem, and in the church there must be a group of overcomers; these overcomers are today&rsquo;s Zion.</li>
		<li>The overcomers are for the building up of the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rom. 12:4-5; Eph. 4:16; Rev. 3:12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In the new heaven and new earth, the entire New Jerusalem will become Zion&mdash;Rev. 21:1-2, 16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>All the unqualified saints eventually will be qualified to be Zion.</li>
		<li>The New Jerusalem, the eternal Zion, will be the Holy of Holies, the place where God is&mdash;vv. 16, 22; cf. Ezek. 48:35b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to build up Zion&mdash;Rev. 14:1; Eph. 4:16; Rev. 21:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Zion is the reality of the Body of Christ consummating in the New Jerusalem, and in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today we must endeavor to reach this high peak.</li>
	<li>The reality of the Body of Christ (Zion) is the corporate living of the perfected God-men, who are genuine men but live by the life of the processed and consummated Triune God, whose attributes are expressed through their virtues&mdash;Gal. 2:20; Phil. 3:10; 1:19-21a.</li>
	<li>The reality of the Body of Christ is a mingling living in the eternal union of the regenerated and transformed tripartite God-men with the Triune God in the resurrection life of Christ; this mingling living will consummate in the New Jerusalem&mdash;Eph. 4:16; Rev. 21:2.</li>
	<li>We should pay more attention to the Body of Christ than to the local churches&mdash;1 Cor. 12:12-13; 1:2; Rom. 12:4-5; 16:1, 4-5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The local churches are not God&rsquo;s goal but a procedure God takes to reach His goal.</li>
		<li>The local churches usher us into the reality of the Body of Christ.</li>
		<li>The highest peak of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery that can carry out God&rsquo;s economy is for God to produce not many local churches in a physical way but an organic Body to be His organism&mdash;1 Cor. 12:27; Eph. 4:16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Because of the lack of the reality of the Body of Christ, there is a desperate need of blending&mdash;1 Cor. 12:24-25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Blending is an organic building of God-men, who have been made God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead and who live the divine life by the life of the Triune God within them.</li>
		<li>Blending is for the building up of the universal Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem as the final goal of God&rsquo;s economy according to His good pleasure&mdash;Eph. 1:5; Rev. 4:11; 21:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Abraham offered Isaac on Mount Moriah, which is another name for Mount Zion; in our spiritual experience Mount Moriah eventually becomes Mount Zion&mdash;Gen. 22:1-2, 14; Heb. 11:17-19; 2 Chron. 3:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As believers in Christ, we are repeating the life and history of Abraham&mdash;Gal. 3:6-7, 9, 29; Rom. 4:12, 15-24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>At Beer-sheba Abraham planted a tamarisk tree and called upon the name of Jehovah, the Eternal God&mdash;Gen. 21:25-33:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The tamarisk tree signifies the tree of life experienced and expressed.</li>
			<li>The Eternal God is the secret, mysterious One, who is our eternal life.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The life at Beer-sheba produced a burnt offering (Isaac) that was offered to God on Mount Moriah&mdash; 22:1-18:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>After Isaac was offered, he was returned in resurrection for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose&mdash; vv. 16-19; Heb. 11:17-19; Rom. 4:17.</li>
			<li>Mount Moriah eventually became Mount Zion, the place where the temple was built&mdash;2 Chron. 3:1.</li>
			<li>Abraham was the first to worship God on Mount Zion, and eventually we will join him on the eternal Mount Zion, worshipping God.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Having been offered back to God by Abraham, Isaac was multiplied into the New Jerusalem&mdash;Gen. 22:16-18; Rom. 8:29; Rev. 21:2, 7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Abraham, a stranger and a sojourner, &ldquo;eagerly waited for the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God&rdquo;&mdash;Heb. 11:9-10, 13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The excellent and lovely New Jerusalem is the dear expectation of God&rsquo;s elect and the destination, the goal, of the heavenly pilgrims&mdash;vv. 13-16.</li>
		<li>Today we are sojourners, journeying on a rugged road toward our eternal goal&mdash;the New Jerusalem&mdash; 1 Pet. 1:1, 17; 2:11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Abraham&rsquo;s tent was a miniature of the New Jerusalem, the ultimate tent&mdash;Gen. 12:8; 13:3; Heb. 11:9; Rev. 21:2-3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The overcomers live in tents, looking forward to the New Jerusalem, the eternal tabernacle and the real feast of tabernacles&mdash;Lev. 23:39-43.</li>
		<li>The New Jerusalem will be a tabernacle for the remembrance of how the overcomers, before the consummation of the New Jerusalem in the kingdom age, lived in tents as they were journeying toward the New Jerusalem&mdash;the eternal Mount Zion.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
