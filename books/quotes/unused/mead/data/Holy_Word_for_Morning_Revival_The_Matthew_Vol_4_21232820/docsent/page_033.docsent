   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 20 DAY 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matt 5:10 Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>20 For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>6:33 But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rom 1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one who believes, both to Jew first and to Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>17 For the righteousness of God is revealed in it out of faith to faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Psalm 89:14 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Matthew 5:10, 20 and 6:33 reveal that righteousness is related to the kingdom and that the kingdom is built upon righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to be clear about this if we are to get into the depth of chapter twenty-seven.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Matthew 27 we see a contrast between man's unrighteousness and God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Praise God that man's unrighteousness turned into God's righteousness!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The basic way in which man's unrighteousness turned into God's righteousness was through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In all of human history there has not been a case in which man's unrighteousness has been as totally exposed as in the crucifixion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we all know, there is unrighteousness in the judicial branch of any earthly government.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But no earthly court has seen as much unrighteousness as was exposed in the case of the trial and crucifixion of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second, the Christ who exposed man's unrighteousness to the uttermost also bore all the unrighteousness He had exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is like housecleaning.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In cleaning a room the dust is first exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then it is swept into the dustpan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Likewise, on the day of the Passover, the Lord Jesus first exposed all the "dust," all of man's unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then He cleaned up the "dust" He had exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Oh, the very presence of the Lord Jesus exposed every particle of hidden "dust" in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself became the "dustpan," and all the "dust" was collected upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, after all man's unrighteousness had been exposed, it was borne by Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This made everything ready for the righteous God to come in to judge the unrighteous ones and all their unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This matter of righteousness is a crucial aspect of the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is very basic, for it is our ground and basis for being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through Christ our Substitute, we have already been judged according to righteousness on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, God must save us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nothing binds God as much as His righteousness Psa 89:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If God's righteousness could be taken away, His throne would be cast down.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can say, "Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even if God wants to change His mind, He cannot do it because He is a just God!"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How meaningful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Righteousness, or justice, is a judicial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Love, on the contrary, is a matter of the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whether God loves us or gives us up, He is not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He also would not be wrong in showing grace to us or in not showing grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Grace is a matter of God's wish.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But righteousness is a matter neither of emotion nor of wish, it is a judicial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A judicial matter is related to the execution of the law, to legislation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God's gospel is altogether a judicial matter, a matter of divine legislation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Of course, God's salvation is initiated by His love and accomplished through His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, however, it issues in His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our salvation has been sealed and confirmed by God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now not even God Himself can change our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is upon this righteousness that the kingdom of God is built.</S>
