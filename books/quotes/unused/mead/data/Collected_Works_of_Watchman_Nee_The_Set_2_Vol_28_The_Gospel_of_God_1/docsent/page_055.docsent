   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REPENTANCE BEING NECESSARY IN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>RECEIVING GOD'S SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When a farmer plants seed, can he sow it on a field without doing anything first to the ground?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Wheat grows very easily.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even for us to grow wheat, we have to plow the field and till the soil first.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the same way, there must first be the tilling work in God's salvation before the plants will grow in a deep way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, those who never feel that they have sinned will not be saved, and neither will those who never feel that they are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Perhaps after such a one hears the full gospel as we are preaching now, he would become clear concerning God's work in Christ and would gladly receive the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I dare not say that he has no repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Perhaps he has repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But the repentance is not deep.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is not much operation of the Holy Spirit in him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He does not see that he is a weak, filthy, and useless sinner before God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Such a one has to go through the experience of Romans 7 in his later years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is the experience of Romans 7?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is the make-up lesson for a Christian who has not repented.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a man has passed through repentance when he comes to God, there is no need for the experience of Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a man has not repented, and does not know that he is desolate before God, but receives the full gospel readily when he hears it, in his future experience, God still has to show him his desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is necessary for one to know himself, either from the beginning or somewhere along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God never allows a Christian not to know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, we can see the true meaning of repentance according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is a new concept of one's past.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Repentance sees oneself, in the same way that faith sees the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When one believes, he sees the work that the Lord Jesus has done for him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When he repents, he sees the deeds that he himself has done in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To see what one has done in the past is repentance; to see what the Lord Jesus has done on the cross is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we want to see what the Lord Jesus has done for us, we must first see what we have done ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Unless the thief who was crucified next to Jesus had said clearly with his own mouth that what he was suffering was what he deserved, he could not have said to the One crucified next to him, "Remember me when You come into Your kingdom" Luke 23:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If he were to curse the magistrates as agents of the imperialists, and if he had not seen that what he suffered was what he deserved, he would not have seen who the Lord was.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we do not see ourselves, we do not see the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we see ourselves, we see the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, we can see that repentance does not carry any element of our self, our work, or our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many people say that I do not believe in repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I believe in repentance with my whole heart.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But I believe in the biblical repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I do not believe in the mental repentance that some have had.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If it is a repentance according to the Bible, I will gladly believe, for it is real.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It gives us a new view and a new perception.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only in this way can we receive the Lord by faith in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE PLACE OF REPENTANCE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>BEING IN FAITH AND SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How then is man saved?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Gospel of John tells us clearly that it is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The books of Romans and Galatians also tell us clearly that it is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Galatians tells us that it is only by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the whole New Testament, there are only these three books that deal with the question of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All three books tell us that salvation is by faith only and is not of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Repentance does not come into consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What place then does repentance hold?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we read the Bible, we will find out that repentance is never detached from faith.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Repentance is never separated from faith.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This does not mean that one is saved by faith and repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Repentance is included in faith and is included in salvation already.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When a man believes in the Lord Jesus, the element of repentance is included there already.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If one says that he is saved, then his salvation includes repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Repentance is never detached from faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is always included in salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now, let us consider if repentance is a condition.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the New Testament, by the time of the book of Acts, the Holy Spirit had come and the full gospel was preached.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The book of Acts seems to show us that repentance is a condition for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many have misunderstood the matter because they have not seen the place of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>No doubt, the Old Testament speaks of the teaching of repentance also.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Jonah preached to the men of Nineveh that unless they repented, God would destroy them Jonah 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They repented, put on sackcloth, sat in ashes, and fasted.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This was for their past deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The putting on of the sackcloth and the sitting in ashes were not for future behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If they were for future acts, what did sackcloth and ashes have to do with it?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Repentance is to feel sorry for and to condemn one's past behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>One puts on sackcloth and sits in ashes because he realizes that he is wrong before God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Formerly, he thought he was living.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Now, he knows that he was dead.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, he mourns for his past wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This was what Jonah preached.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Before the gospel of the Lord Jesus came, we did not see salvation by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What we had then was only repentance for past deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Later, John the Baptist came.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He did not preach faith.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He only preached repentance, that is, a repentance for past actions and past wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In Matthew 3:8, he said one very good thing: "Produce then fruit worthy of your repentance."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He also said that "he who has two tunics, let him share with the one who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise" Luke 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have to realize that this is not repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Rather, this is the fruit of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Repentance is for the past, and the fruit of repentance is for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>At John's time, the complete gospel was not yet preached, and the light of the truth was not fully revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In order to lead men to God, he had to bring them to a different view of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Following this, the Lord Jesus Himself came.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Gospel of John is different from the other three Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The first three Gospels talk about what the Lord Jesus did in time.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The Gospel of John talks about what He does in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Every reader of the Bible knows that the Gospel of John does not talk about things in time.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Rather, it talks about things of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It begins with "the beginning" and ends with the receiving of eternal life 1:1; 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The first of the three books speaks of the Son of David, the Son of Abraham Matt 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It shows us the Christ in time.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>John tells us about the Christ in eternity 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The first three books are transitional.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Hence, they talk about repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>But why did the Lord talk about repentance also Matt 4:17 ?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>It was because the kingdom of the heavens had drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Because the kingdom has drawn near, we have to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>But in the Gospel of John, after the full gospel has been preached, there is no more mention of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In Acts, some verses also say that salvation must be by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Acts 16:31 says, "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household."</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>However, in a few places in Acts, repentance is mentioned by itself; there is no mention of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is why some believers misunderstand repentance as a condition for salvation.</S>
