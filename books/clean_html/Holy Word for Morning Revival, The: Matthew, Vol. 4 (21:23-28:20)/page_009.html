<p class="bold">WEEK 17 — DAY 1</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 24:1-5</h2><p>1 &nbsp;And Jesus came out <sup>1</sup>from the <sup>2</sup>temple and was going away, and His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the <sup>2</sup>temple.</p> <p>2 &nbsp;But He answered and said to them, Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, There shall by no means be left here a stone upon a stone, which shall not be <sup>1</sup>thrown down.</p> <p class="bold">3 &nbsp;And as He sat on the <sup>1</sup>Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, Tell us, <sup>2</sup>When will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your <sup>3</sup>coming and of the consummation of the age?</p> <p class="bold">4 &nbsp;And Jesus <sup>1</sup>answered and said to them, <sup>2</sup>See that no one leads you astray.</p> <p class="bold">5 &nbsp;For many will come in My name, saying, I am the Christ, and they will lead many astray.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>1<sup>1</sup> The Lord came out from the temple, indicating that He had left the temple. This was to fulfill His word in 23:38, concerning His leaving the temple to the rejecting Jews as their house of desolation. This was equivalent to God’s glory leaving the temple in the ancient time (Ezek. 10:18).</p><p>1<sup>2</sup> The entire precincts of the temple.</p><p>2<sup>1</sup> This was fulfilled in A.D. 70 when Titus and the Roman army destroyed Jerusalem.</p><p>3<sup>1</sup> To receive the vision of the Lord’s prophecy concerning this age, we need to climb the high mountain to enter into His presence.</p><p>3<sup>2</sup> The disciples’ question concerned three matters: (1) the time when “these things” would take place, including not only the destruction of the temple (v. 2) but also the things mentioned in 23:32-39; (2) the sign of Christ’s coming; and (3) the sign of the consummation of the age. The Lord’s word from 24:4—25:46 answered the disciples’ question concerning these three matters.</p><p>3<sup>3</sup> Gk. parousia, which means presence. Christ’s coming will be His presence with His people. This presence (parousia) will begin with the rapture of the man-child (Rev. 12:5) and the rapture of the firstfruits (Rev. 14:1-4) and will end with His appearing on the earth with the saints. During the period of His parousia there will be the great tribulation (v. 21; Rev. 9:1-21; 11:14; 16:1-21), which will begin with supernatural calamities (Rev. 6:12-17; 8:7-12); Christ’s descending to the air (Rev. 14:14); the rapture of the majority of the believers to the air (1 Thes. 4:15-17); the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10); and the marriage of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7-9). (See the chart “The Seventy Weeks and the Coming of Christ, with the Rapture of the Saints” at the end of the New Testament.)</p><p>4<sup>1</sup> The Lord’s answer has three sections: the first section (vv. 4-31) concerns the Jews, who are the chosen; the second (v. 32—25:30) concerns the church; and the third (25:31-46) concerns the Gentiles (the nations). The first section, concerning the Jews, should be interpreted literally, whereas the second section, concerning the church, should be interpreted spiritually, because it is spoken in parables for the reason given in 13:11-13. For instance, the winter in v. 20 is the actual winter, but the summer in v. 32 is a symbol signifying the time of restoration. The third section, concerning the Gentiles, also should be interpreted literally.</p><p>4<sup>2</sup> Some aspects of the prophecy in vv. 4-14 have been fulfilled, and some are in the process of being fulfilled. At the time of the great tribulation, which will be the consummation, the end, of this age, the prophecy will be fully fulfilled.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>Prophecy in the Bible is like a jigsaw puzzle.
