   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INSPIRATION AND EMOTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many believers do not know how to differentiate inspiration from emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Actually this is not difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Emotion always enters from outside of man, whereas inspiration is given by the Holy Spirit within man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, when a believer beholds the beauty of nature, a feeling within him spontaneously wells up.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He feels the beauty of the scenery and his own joy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Perhaps, when he sees a loved one, some kind of inconceivable feeling rises up within him as though a certain power is drawing him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is also emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Both the beautiful scenery and the loved one are outside the man; hence, the feelings which they produce simply belong to emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, inspiration is not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is influenced only by the Holy Spirit within man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only the Holy Spirit can inspire the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since the Holy Spirit lives within the spirit, inspiration must come from within.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It does not need to be stimulated by the beautiful scenery or a dear one; it can take place in the calmest environment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The emotion, on the contrary, becomes instantly dispirited when the outside stimulus is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, an emotional believer lives solely according to his environment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He must be stirred up and encouraged in order to go on; otherwise, he stops.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Inspiration does not require outside help.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In fact, when the emotion is influenced by the external environment, it is confused, resulting in a believer being unable to know which of the two he should follow.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A believer should be careful not to consider calmness and absence of stimulation as spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is far from the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should know that emotion can cause people not only to be excited but also to be depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the emotion urges us, we feel quite excited; when it impedes us, we feel very depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the same way that emotion excites, it also calms down.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Just as excitement belongs to emotion, so does calmness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A believer often commits many errors because he is under the influence of his emotion; but when he is awakened from the state he is in, he will suppress his feelings and consider this as being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He does not realize, however, that the stirring of his emotion at this point has produced a reaction opposite to excitement which spontaneously calms him down.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This calmness or quietness causes the believer to lose interest in much of God's work; he does not have much affection for many of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Gradually the believer's outer man is reluctant to work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The spirit, therefore, is imprisoned, and the life of the spirit cannot flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since he is no longer enthusiastic and has become extremely calm, he may think that he is walking according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What he does not know is that he is still walking according to his emotion, only this time it is according to another aspect of the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In reality, the believers who turn to this kind of emotional calmness are few.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The majority of them continue to be excited by their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because of their stimulation, they do many things which are beyond the bounds of the ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As they quiet down and recall their actions under the influence of this function of the emotion, they cannot help but laugh at themselves and consider themselves to have acted nonsensically.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is usually true of the things done according to the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In retrospect a believer often feels embarrassed and regrets his rudeness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is very pitiful when a believer is influenced by his emotion; his spirit is powerless to subject his emotion to death and deny its control.</S>
