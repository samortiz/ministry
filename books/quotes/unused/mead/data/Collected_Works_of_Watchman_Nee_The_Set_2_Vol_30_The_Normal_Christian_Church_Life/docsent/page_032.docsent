   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LOCAL CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now what is true of the universal Church is also true of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The universal Church comprises all those who have the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The local church comprises all those who, in a given locality, have the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Church of God and the churches of God do not differ in nature, but only in extent.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The former consists of all throughout the universe who are indwelt by the Spirit of God; the latter consists of all in one locality who are indwelt by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Anyone wishing to belong to a church in a given locality must answer two requirements he must be a child of God, and he must live in that particular locality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Membership in the Church of God is conditioned only by being a child of God, but membership in a church of God is conditioned, firstly, by being a child of God and, secondly, by living in a given locality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In nature the Church is indivisible as God Himself is indivisible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the division of the Church into churches is not a division in nature, life, or essence, but only in government, organization, and management.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because the earthly church is composed of a vast number of individuals, a measure of organization is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is a physical impossibility for all the people of God, scattered throughout the world, to live and meet in one place; and it is for that reason alone that the Church of God has been divided into churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must realize clearly that the nature of all the local churches is the same throughout the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not that the constituents of one local church are of one kind, and the constituents of another local church are of another kind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In nature there is no difference whatever.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The only difference is in the localities that determine their respective boundaries.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Church is indivisible; therefore, in nature the churches are indivisible too.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is only in outward sphere that there is any possibility of dividing them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Physical limitations make geographical divisions inevitable, but the spiritual oneness of believers overcomes all barriers of space.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Locality is the divinely-appointed ground for the division of the Church, because it is the only inevitable division.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every barrier between all believers in the world is avoidable, except this one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As long as believers remain in the flesh they cannot exist apart from their dwelling places; therefore, the churches which consist of such believers cannot but be restricted by their dwellings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Geographical distinctions are natural, not arbitrary, and it is simply because the physical limitations of the children of God make geographical divisions inevitable, that God has ordained that His Church be divided into churches on the ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such division is scriptural, and all other divisions are carnal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Any division of the children of God other than geographical implies not merely a division of sphere, but a division of nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Local division is the only division which does not touch the life of the Church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Most believers of today are so utterly blind to the scriptural basis of a church that if one asks another, "To what church do you belong?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first thought of the one questioned is of the specific line of teaching he approves of, or the group of people with whom he has special fellowship, or how his group of Christians is different from others, or perhaps the name that particular group bears, or the form of organization they have adopted in short, anything but the place in which he lives.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Few would answer that question with, "I belong to the church in Ephesus," or "I belong to the church in Shanghai," or "I belong to the church in Los Angeles."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is our being in Christ that separates us from the world, and it is our being in a given locality that separates us from other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is only because we reside in a different place from them that we belong to a different church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The only reason I do not belong to the same church as other believers is that I do not live in the same place as they do.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If I wish to be in the same church, then I must change my residence to the same place.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If, on the other hand, I wish to be in a different church from others in my locality, then the only solution to my problem is to move to a different locality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Difference of locality is the only justification for division among believers.</S>
