<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRACTICE OF PROPHESYING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>LEARNING, EXERCISING, AND PRACTICING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:1, 3, 4; Eph. 4:12, 16; 1 Cor. 12:7</H1><P>Today God's speaking is in the Son. In the Old Testament time God spoke through the prophets, but in the New Testament time God speaks in the Son (Heb. 1:2). This Son today is a corporate Son, the Head and the Body (1 Cor. 12:12). The corporate Son includes all of the New Testament speakers; hence, it is the totality of the New Testament speakers. The first speaker is the individual Son, and the speakers who follow are the members of the Son, the members of His Body. In Hebrews 1 Christ is presented as the firstborn Son of God (vv. 5-6). Then in Hebrews 2:10 God brings many sons into glory. These verses give us strong ground to say that God's speaking in the Son is not just in the individual Christ, but also in all the members of Christ. The Son in whom God speaks is the corporate Son, the firstborn Son with the many sons.</P><P>Christ is the Word of God (John 1:1). As the Word of God, He also makes us His word, His speaking. Every Christian should be a part of the word of God. God is speaking; He is also the Word. Today He speaks through us. As a part of His word, we should be speaking, expressing, and explaining Him all the time.</P><P>God has made us a part of His word, and when this word is spoken, it becomes the oracle. The church today should be God's word and should also become God's oracle. Christianity has been used by the enemy of God to take away the speaking of God from the majority of the members of the church. Thus, the speaking in the church is no longer a corporate oracle among the saints; it has become the job of certain professionals. These professionals dedicate their time to attend seminaries in order to obtain degrees. After graduation they get jobs as preachers. Eventually, a hierarchy is built up with the clergy and the laity. The clergy is the speaking class, and the laity is the nonspeaking class. In this way, Satan kills the functioning of the members of the Body of Christ. The professionals, the clergy, monopolize the right to speak among God's people, annulling the speaking function of all the rest of the members of the Body of Christ, and the Body of Christ is killed.</P><P>We left Christianity not only because of the denominations, the divisions, but also because the functioning of the members of the Body has been killed. Today we are standing as the Lord's recovery, yet we are surrounded by the background and environment of Christianity. This strong background and prevailing environment are very difficult to overcome. An item of this background and environment is the meeting with only one speaker. Even today some who are reading this message may still prefer to have big meetings with only one speaker.</P><P>In human society, nearly everything is carried out by speaking. Today many candidates are seeking the presidency of the United States. Their way of seeking to be elected is by speaking. They speak day after day in many different states. They realize that if they are defeated in their speaking, their candidacy will be annulled. Nearly everything in human society is done by speaking. An attorney's job is to speak both verbally and in writing. Whoever wins in speaking will win the case. The principle of advertising and the principle of the newspapers is speaking. During the time of the Reformation, many felt the need to spread their ideas through the printed word, through articles and papers.</P>
