   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 16 DAY 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 22:41-46</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>41 Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus questioned them,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>42 Saying, What do you think concerning the Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whose son is He?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They said to Him, David's.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>43 He said to them, How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>44 "The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies underneath Your feet"?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>45 If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>46 And 1 no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone from that day dare to question Him anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have seen that the last time the Lord Jesus came to Jerusalem He came not to work, but to present Himself to those who were to slaughter Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As portrayed in 21:23 22:46, during His last visit to Jerusalem, the center of Judaism, Christ was surrounded by the chief priests, elders, Pharisees, Herodians, and Sadducees, along with a lawyer, all of whom endeavored to ensnare Him by asking puzzling and insidious questions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, the chief priests, representing the authority of the Jewish religion, and the elders, representing the authority of the Jewish people, asked Him concerning His authority 21:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their question was according to their religious concept.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Second, the Pharisees, the fundamentalists, and the Herodians, who were zealous in politics, asked Him a question related to politics 22:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Third, the Sadducees, the modernists, questioned Him concerning fundamental belief vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>23-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Fourth, a self-approved lawyer asked Him a question concerning the law vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>34-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After answering all their questions wisely, He asked them a question concerning the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the question of questions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Their questions were related to religion, politics, belief, and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His question was concerning the Christ, who is the center of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They knew religion, politics, belief, and the law, but they paid no attention to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, He asked them, "What do you think concerning the Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This question of questions must be answered by everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Pharisees were asked this question by the Lord, they replied that Christ was David's son v. 42 . No doubt, according to the Scriptures, this answer was correct.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then the Lord said, " If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>43-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The question here is how a great-grandfather could call his great-grandson Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This was one question the Pharisees did not know how to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is God; in His divinity He is the Lord of David.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is also a man; in His humanity He is the Son of David.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Pharisees had only half the scriptural knowledge concerning Christ's person, i.e., that He was the Son of David according to His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They did not have the other half, i.e., that He was the Son of God according to His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not think that we can understand Christ adequately today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No, He is too wonderful and too far beyond our comprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not even fully understand ourselves, much less Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do you know where your spirit is, or where your soul is?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I was very young, I thought I knew myself thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the longer I have lived, the more I realize how little I know.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we cannot understand ourselves, how can we adequately understand Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jesus Christ is the Son and He is also called the Father Isa 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is one person with two natures and two lives.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, it is beyond our ability to understand this thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We simply believe whatever the Bible says and praise Him for being so wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to worship Him, take Him in, enjoy Him, and experience Him as the wonderful One.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
