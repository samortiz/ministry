   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE TWO CHRIST IN GOD'S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>VERSUS THE LAW IN MAN'S APPRECIATION 1 Scripture Reading: Psa 1:1-6; Rom 5:20; Gal 4:24-25; Rom 7:12, 14a; Psa 119:103, 105, 130; 2 Tim 3:16a; Exo 20:3-17; Psa 78:5; 119:88b; Rom 3:20b; 4:15b; 5:20b; 7:7b; Gal 3:23-24; Rom 3:19; Gal 3:21b; Rom 8:3a; 3:20a; Gal 3:11a, 12b; Psa 36:8; 1 Cor 3:6; John 4:10, 14; Rev 21:6; 22:1, 17b; John 7:38-39; Psa 73:1-7, 13-17, 23-26; Matt 5:10; Psa 1:5-6; Rom 2:12; Rom 10:4a; 6:14b</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous message, we gave an introductory word concerning the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we want to see the truth concerning Christ in God's economy versus the law in man's appreciation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. THE LAW IN MAN'S APPRECIATION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Psalm 1 is concerning the law in man's appreciation v. 2 . I hope that we will receive a clear view to see this Psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to see the truth concerning the law in its position, its nature, its content, its function, and its weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to fight the battle against the wrong teachings concerning the law which are not in the light of God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Among Christians there are two schools concerning the law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One school is positive and the other school is very negative.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The top person in the negative school related to the law is the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning the law, he was negative to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I want to point out some of the points he stressed in his teaching concerning the law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Romans and in Galatians, Paul stressed that no flesh, no fallen human being, can be justified before God by the works of the law Rom 3:20a; Gal 2:16; 3:11a .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To work to be justified by the law is to labor in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Romans 7 Paul told us that the law, instead of giving us life, becomes the killing instrument by which sin deceives and kills us v. 11 . Do we like something that kills us? David was wrong to exalt and appreciate something by which we can be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This shows us how negative Paul was in his view concerning the law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I want to raise up Paul's argument as my argument against the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some may say that Paul told us in Romans 7 that the law is holy, righteous, good v. 12 , and even spiritual v. 14a . But this is only in its nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In nature the law is holy, righteous, good, and spiritual, but we also need to see what Paul says concerning its position, its function, and its weakness.</S>
