Now He wants us to live by Him, having one life and one living with Him. I believe that we have all seen and heard this already. What we need is to look to the Lord that He may continue to grant us mercy and grace so that we would live according to what we have seen. It is not necessary to see this again or to seek some other method. We just need to live according to the vision we have seen.<p>First John 2:24 says, &#8220;As for you, that which you heard from the beginning, let it abide in you. If that which you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father.&#8221; We should appreciate the words abide and abides. If we let that which we heard from the beginning abide in us, we will abide in the Son and in the Father. This speaking is not of the earth but of the heavens. One cannot hear this kind of speaking among human beings on earth. This kind of speaking is from the heavens. It is amazing that we can abide in the Son and in the Father. The apostle John said, &#8220;Little children, abide in Him&#8221; (v. 28). This does not mean to abide for just one day or three days, but to abide until He comes.<p>To abide in the Lord is not just to stay in Him but to live and move in Him. Since we have heard this eternal mystery, from now on we should simply abide in the Lord, living and walking in Him. Do not ask how to abide in the Lord. Simply abide in the Lord. If you have been saved, then you have the Lord in you, and you will surely know how to abide in Him. Therefore, do not study. Simply abide in the Lord. We need to abide in Him until He comes.<h2 class=head1>A MYSTERIOUS FACT-THE LORD BEING IN US</h2><p>In God&#8217;s economy there is a great fact that we are often not conscious of and do not care much about. This fact is that when we repented and believed into the Lord, the Lord as the living Spirit entered into us in an imperceptible way. If you do not believe this, you can try an experiment. Try to say, &#8220;I do not feel that the Lord is abiding in me. I do not want Him, and I do not believe in Him anymore.&#8221; If you would try such an experiment, immediately you would discover that the Lord is in you. The more you would say, &#8220;I do not believe anymore,&#8221; the more the Lord would say, &#8220;You cannot do that. I have to remain here.&#8221; You may say, &#8220;I do not want Jesus anymore,&#8221; but He would say, &#8220;I want you.&#8221; If you would try this, you would realize that there is such a Person in you. The unbelievers do not have such a Person in them. How can we tell who are believers in Christ and who are not? We cannot judge merely by outward appearance. The believers have a mysterious person in them. This is truly a very mysterious matter.<p>There are millions of people throughout the world today who have believed in Jesus, yet none of them have seen the Lord Jesus with their eyes. In a sense, we have seen Him in spirit. Outwardly, however, none of us have seen Him. Nevertheless, within us is something that makes it impossible for us to stay away from Him. Even if we were to fall and become degraded to the extent that we appeared improper to others, this mysterious Person would still be in us. The more we say, &#8220;I do not believe in Him, I do not want Him, I do not care about Him, and I do not care for Him,&#8221; the tighter He will hold us within. This proves that something mysterious has happened in us-the wonderful One, the all-inclusive Lord Spirit, has entered into us.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
