<p class="bold">WEEK 2 — DAY 5</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 3:13-17</h2><p class="bold">13 &nbsp;Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him.</p><p>14 &nbsp;But John tried to prevent Him, saying, It is I who have need of being baptized by You, and You come to me?</p><p>15 &nbsp;But Jesus answered and said to him, Permit it for now, for it is fitting for us in this way to fulfill all <sup>1</sup>righteousness. Then he permitted Him.</p><p class="bold">16 &nbsp;And <sup>1</sup>having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the <sup>2</sup>Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon Him.</p><p class="bold">17 &nbsp;And behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, <sup>1</sup>This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>15<sup>1</sup> Righteousness is to be right by living, walking, and doing things in the way God has ordained.…To be baptized also is to fulfill righteousness before God, that is, to fulfill the requirement of God. The Lord Jesus came to John not as God but as a typical man, a real Israelite. Hence, He had to be baptized in order to keep this dispensational practice of God; otherwise, He would not have been right with God.<p>16<sup>1</sup> The Lord was baptized not only to fulfill all righteousness according to God’s ordination, but also to allow Himself to be put into death and resurrection that He might minister not in a natural way but in the way of resurrection. By being baptized, He was able to live and minister in resurrection even before His actual death and resurrection three and a half years later.</p><p>16<sup>2</sup> Before the Spirit of God descended and came upon Him, the Lord Jesus was born of the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35). This proves that at the time of His baptism He already had the Spirit of God within Him. The Spirit’s being within Him was for His birth. Now for His ministry the Spirit of God descended upon Him. This was the fulfillment of Isa. 61:1; 42:1; and Psa. 45:7, and was carried out to anoint the new King and introduce Him to His people.</p><p>17<sup>1</sup> The Spirit’s descending was the anointing of Christ, whereas the Father’s speaking was a testimony to Him as the beloved Son. This is a picture of the Divine Trinity: the Son rose up from the water, the Spirit descended upon the Son, and the Father spoke concerning the Son. This proves that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit exist simultaneously. This is for the accomplishing of God’s economy.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>We need to consider the significance of the phrase “from Galilee to the Jordan” [Matt. 3:13]. In the New Testament, Galilee, a despised region, signifies rejection. [Galilee]…was not rejected by God, but it was rejected by religion and culture.…Jordan signifies termination and germination. The children of Israel traveled through the wilderness for about forty years, and eventually they were all buried in the Jordan River.…But the Jordan also gave them a new beginning, for it…brought [them] out of the wilderness and into the good land, which is Christ.</p><p>The church life truly is wonderful, but not wonderful according to our concept.…The longer we stay in the church, the more we are terminated. At first, the experience of termination is bitter. But later it becomes sweet.…It is in this place of termination that we meet the King.…From the time I came into the church life, I have been brought to the Lord again and again. Day after day, the church life brings me to Christ, and it brings Christ the King to me.
