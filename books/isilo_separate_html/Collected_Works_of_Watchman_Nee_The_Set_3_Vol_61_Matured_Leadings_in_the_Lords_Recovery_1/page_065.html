Around Sar-Di by the city of Hangchow there are six to eight hundred brothers. The amount they handed over last year is only enough to supply the need of the one hundred brothers who migrated to Yi-Yang. When one migrates to a new place, he is starting everything afresh. He needs to have food and clothing before he can engage in farming. In over ten counties around Yi-Yang, the footsteps of the gospel have been planted by our brothers. Some churches have sprung up in a few areas already. They market the produce of the land, the livestock of their farm, and the fabric they produce from their own weaving. They coordinate together for the gospel while selling their products on the side. Shanghai is supporting Yi-Yang as well; more men are migrating there now. In the near future, some will move there from Nanchang. Perhaps in the future Nanchang will head up Yi-Yang.</p><p>We should never despise the wisdom of the simple villagers. Among the leading brothers in Yi-Yang, no one has graduated from high school; everyone has received only a primary education. However, they all have a burning heart for the Lord, and they all have handed themselves over. Generally speaking, all of them are full of wisdom. They have wisdom in their service. Their judgments are sound, and they are rich in experience. According to my observation, many so-called wise brothers in China cannot match them. Their judgments leave no room for criticism. One can only lower his head and worship the Lord, saying, "Lord, You are in our midst." If their judgments were not so wise, they would not have been so successful. They conduct business and do everything in an orderly fashion.</p><p>Now a few dozen brothers and sisters from Shanghai are getting ready to migrate to Yi-Yang. There are not just one or two people preaching the gospel there, but the whole church is working together in coordination on the basis of its consecration. The gospel is weak today among us because brothers and sisters have a selfish motive; they use the mammon they have in their hand for their own business with the view of making money for themselves. Their business is not for the gospel, and they have not handed themselves over. If no Christian lives for himself, and if everyone lives for the Lord and the gospel, the gospel will spread from province to province all over China.</p><h2 class="head2">The Principle of Selling</h2><p>Let me fellowship a little concerning the principle of selling our possessions. Suppose a brother has a piece of real estate. I hope that he can hand it over and sell it. Any real estate that is left in an unproductive state is useless. Moreover, real estate is not doing well today. It is better to sell it and use the proceeds to start a business that engages in a form of production. I hope the responsible brothers will make good and proper arrangements for this matter.</p><p>Suppose some brothers are sharing a business with unbelievers or family members. If they want to hand themselves over, they have to work hard to separate their assets from the assets of others. Be generous in splitting the assets. If one is in a joint venture with others, he can buy the others' shares and then sell it. In selling real estate, a person may not get the full price of the land, in which case we can help them to dispose of the land. We would rather take a loss than have our money locked in the land.</p><h2 class="head2">Possible Businesses That One Can Consider</h2><p>Hong Kong is rich because it is linked to Swatow. A great part of the investment in Hong Kong comes from Swatow. If we go into business at all, there are a few things we can consider. The first is cotton spinning. Some can try this. Starting a business this way helps Swatow indirectly. The capital is retained in Hong Kong and does not need to return to Swatow. Some can try this in Manila. The shipbuilding industry is in existence already. Presently, it is somewhat unprofitable. Some are doing it with a view to the future; they are waiting for better days to come. We have to carefully consider this matter. Should we wait, or should we sell such a business and come back to it later? We should have much fellowship and prayer before making any decision.</p><p>One brother is starting a very large fabric manufacturing company. Some time ago I heard that some brothers were starting a fabric company which both spins and weaves. I think that spinning is too much for us; it takes a considerable amount of capital to handle spinning and weaving together. But weaving is easier; it does not take much capital. We can hire brothers and sisters for the weaving work. A few of our brothers can dye; they are more skillful than others in this trade. If we manufacture our own dye, we can help many brothers and sisters from other places to learn the trade. Weaving is convenient; it can be done anywhere and at any time. A weaving machine costs approximately three hundred dollars. We can put one in the living room and two in the bedroom. This does not violate local ordinances, because it does not require an office. In this way, we can do our own dyeing and even sell our goods locally. Alternatively, we can form some kind of cooperative and sell our product together.</p><p>If the cost of traveling is not a problem, we can ask many out-of-town brothers and sisters to come to Hong Kong to learn such skills. We can recruit twenty people from Hangchow, Peking, Tsingtao, Foochow, and Swatow. In the beginning they can be apprentices. In a year or two, we can buy off the unbelievers' shares and work with brothers and sisters. In this way we will not need to be yoked with unbelievers. Tonight I am touching this matter in brief. There is not enough time. Perhaps we can have a more detailed discussion later. I hope that we all will understand the proper principle to exercise such matters before the Lord.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_064.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_066.html">Next</a> </body></html>
