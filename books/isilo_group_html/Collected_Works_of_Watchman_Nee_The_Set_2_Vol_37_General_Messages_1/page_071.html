In this chapter we want to go on to consider the meaning of the feeling of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHERLY LOVE</h2><p>First let us consider love. One amazing thing about love is that the Bible says, "We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers" (1 John 3:14). All those who have passed from death into life love one another. All those who are members in the Body love one another. This love is produced by life and is spontaneous. You do not have to ask a person in the meeting whether he is a Christian, and if he says yes, you do not have to ask whether Christians should love one another. In the same way, he does not have to say that he will start loving other Christians just because you have told him so. This is not the way God's children behave. Everyone who is genuinely born of God has God's life. Those who are saved by God spontaneously love their fellow members. Whether or not a person has been told to love another one, he will have a feeling of love for his brothers. It is true that we often have to remind others to love their brothers. But these reminders will not supply what they do not already have; it will only make them more zealous for what they have. If love is there, it is there. If it is not there, it is not there. Once we meet one of God's people, we spontaneously love him. We cannot explain, but within there is such a feeling; within there is such a love.</p><p>A brother had a son. When others asked him, "Now that you are a father, do you love your son?", he answered, "A week before I became a father, I kept wondering how I could love my son. But the minute my son was born, my heart spontaneously went out to him when I saw him, and I loved him." Love is an inner feeling; it is something produced from the inside, rather than something taught from the outside. Every child of God who is redeemed by the Lord's blood, who has received the Lord's life, and who is baptized into the Body of Christ spontaneously loves his fellow members. Many times we meet someone who genuinely belongs to the Lord. It does not matter whether he is from far away or from the same city or whether he is cultured or uncultured. It does not matter what nationality he has or what job he occupies. The minute we find out that he is a Christian, spontaneously there is a love for him. Love is a feeling of life. As long as we are in the Body, we will have this feeling.</p><h2 class="head1">NO DIVISION</h2><p>Those who have seen the Body of Christ have a feeling for the Body of Christ. Once they do anything sectarian or anything that divides God's children from one another, they feel uneasy inside. Since they love all those who belong to God, they cannot divide God's children from one another. In the Body, love is something spontaneous, while division is something unnatural. A man has two hands, and it would not matter how many things one hand said against the other hand, the two hands can never be separated from each other; it is impossible to divide the two. Some think that as long as they have left the sects, they know the Body of Christ. But in reality, leaving the sects does not necessarily mean that one has seen the Body of Christ. Those who have seen the Body of Christ will surely forsake the sects, but it does not follow that those who have left the sects have seen the Body of Christ. Many people have outwardly left a sect, but actually they build up another sect for themselves. Their leaving of a sect is only an attempt to accentuate their "distinctiveness"; they do not see that all the members are our brothers and are equally lovable. All sectarian spirits, all divisive attitudes, and all outward moves and inward thoughts that cause separations between God's children are proof of the lack of vision concerning the Body of Christ.</p><p>The Body of Christ will deliver us from the sects as well as from sectarianism. It will deliver us from ourselves as well as from individualism. Many people do not live according to the principle of the Body. Rather, they live according to the principle of individualism. This individualism can be found everywhere. In the prayer meetings, some can only pray by themselves; they cannot pray with others. Their bodies may be kneeling down with others, but in their feeling they are praying by themselves. They can only have others listening to their prayers; they cannot listen to the prayers of others. They do not respond to the prayers of others and cannot say amen to them. They do not join themselves to the feelings of others. They pray according to their way and leave others to pray according to their way. It seems as if their prayers are totally unrelated to the prayers of others. When they come to the meetings, they only care to speak their part. Then they have nothing more to do with the others; whatever prayer, burden, or feelings others may have seem to be totally unrelated to them. This is the principle of individualism; it is not the principle of the Body. Such ones do not see the Body, and they cannot work together with others before the Lord. Sometimes when three, five, ten, or twenty brothers are speaking together, you can sense that some of them can only speak about their own burden; they have no heart to speak or hear about the burdens of others. If you sit down with them for an hour or two, the only time they are alert is when they are talking about their own affairs. When the subject is about other people, they begin to wander around in their mind. If you talk to them afterwards, you will find that they did not hear a single thing that the others said. These small indications tell us whether or not a man has seen the Body of Christ.</p><p>Individualism can develop from one individual to a few individuals. In the church, sometimes we see three or five people, or eight or nine people being knitted together into a tight circle. Only the few within the circle are one with each other and can love each other. All the other brothers and sisters do not fit in. This proves that these ones have not seen the Body of Christ. There is only one Body of Christ; there cannot be several Bodies. If a man sees the Body of Christ, he cannot have any form of individualism; he cannot form parties and cannot have his little circles. If you see the Body of Christ, you will detect individualism as soon as it appears. You will sense that it is wrong, and spontaneously you will not dare to move in that direction. When you and a few others try to do something by yourselves, the Body-consciousness will tell you that you are not blended in with the other children of God. This Body-consciousness will not let you go; it will nag you, speak to you, rebuke you, hinder you, and tell you that you are wrong. This feeling of life will deliver you from all forms of divisions.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_070.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_072.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 37: General Messages (1) &nbsp; pg 71</div><br></body></html>
