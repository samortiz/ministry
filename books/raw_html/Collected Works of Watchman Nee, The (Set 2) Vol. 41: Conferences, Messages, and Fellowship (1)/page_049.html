<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY</h1><h1 class="title">THE CONDITIONS FOR RECEIVING<br />THE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT,<br />AND THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: November 18, 1935, evening<br />Place: Chuenchow</h1><h2 class="head1">THE CONDITIONS FOR RECEIVING<br />THE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>In order to receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, we have to fulfill certain conditions. First, we must not have any known or unsettled sins in our heart. Second, we have to be hungry in our spirit (Isa. 44:3). Third, we have to pray earnestly (Acts 1:14; 2:4; 4:31; 8:14-17).</p><h2 class="head1">THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR<br />BY THOSE WHO HAVE RECEIVED<br />THE OUTPOURING OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Those who have received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit have come into contact with the spiritual world. When a man who has never received the outpouring of the Spirit opens a door to the spiritual world, which had previously been unfamiliar to him, he will touch something beyond the physical realm. Some people have faith, but they are not willing to open their doors. When a man rejects and refuses to open his door, he will not receive anything from the spiritual world. The pursuit of the outpouring of the Spirit is like opening the doors and breaking down the walls. On the positive side, once the doors are open, there will be spiritual fellowship. On the negative side, there are dangers to opening to the spiritual world. This is like opening up a door to friends. On the one hand, a man's friends can come and go at will, but on the other hand, robbers can also come and go at will. We should not say that since the robbers can come and go, it would be better not to open the door at all. No, on the one hand, we have to open the door, but on the other hand, we have to be watchful all the time.</p><h2 class="head2">Testing the Spirit</h2><p>How can we be watchful and prevent the evil one from coming into us? First, after we receive the outpouring of the Spirit, we have to put the experience to a test. We cannot be careless in this matter. First Corinthians 12:3 and 1 John 4:3 tell us the way to apply the test. These verses are safeguards. We have to ask those who have received the outpouring of the "Spirit" whether Christ has come in the flesh. We can also ask them if Jesus is Lord. We should watch to see if the spirit that is upon them responds by retreating. If it retreats, it means that it is an evil spirit. But if the person can say, "Jesus is Lord," he has the Holy Spirit. We should not be satisfied with nine times out of ten. We have to apply this test every single time. My responsibility concerning this matter is finished. Now it is up to us to walk properly before the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">According to the Principle of 1 Corinthians 14</h2><p>The initial manifestation of the outpouring of the Spirit is often extraordinary. It will appear as if God is removing all restraints. He does this so that we can receive more from the Lord. The initial experience of outpouring is like passing through a gate. After we have passed the gate, we will have to calm down and live a normal life at home. There is no need to jump up and down or shout, and there is no need to seek for supernatural feelings or experience. From that point on, we do not need to apply the principle of Acts 2, but the principle of 1 Corinthians 14. The principle of 1 Corinthians 14 tells us that the outpouring of the Spirit in the meetings is for the edification of others instead of ourselves. This principle also tells us that the spirits of the prophets are subject to prophets (v. 32). We have to keep this principle. We have to learn to be in control of our spirit. First Corinthians 14 says that if there are tongues, only two or at most three should speak it, and they should take turns speaking it (v. 27). In Acts 2 all one hundred twenty people spoke because that was the first time the Spirit came down. Then the principle changed to that in 1 Corinthians 14.</p>
