<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we shall cover the last aspect of redemption, that is, reconciliation to God. Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, we not only have been forgiven, freed, washed, sanctified, and justified, but we also have been reconciled to God. The phrase &ldquo;reconciliation to God&rdquo; in Greek means to have a thorough change toward God. Because of the fall, man disobeyed God, offended God, and became an enemy of God. Therefore, man needs to have a thorough change toward God through Christ&rsquo;s redemption. Our having a thorough change toward God is our being reconciled to God. The Bible does not say that God is reconciled to us; it only says that we are reconciled to God. Because He never offended us, God does not need to be reconciled to us. It is we who offended Him; hence, we need to be reconciled to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE NEED FOR RECONCILIATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Man Being an Enemy of God</h2>
<p>Man needs to be reconciled to God because man is an enemy of God. Romans 5:10a says, &ldquo;For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son.&rdquo; This indicates that before man receives God&rsquo;s salvation, in God&rsquo;s eyes he is not only a sinner but also an enemy of God. Through the fall, man not only has fallen into sin, but he also has fallen under the authority of Satan (1 John 5:19). Hence, he has become a child of the devil (1 John 3:8a, 10), obeying the ruler of the authority of the air (Eph. 2:2). Being hostile to God, he has also become an enemy of God. Therefore, man needs not only to be forgiven by God but also to be reconciled to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Man Being at Enmity with God in His Mind</h2>
<p>Man needs to be reconciled to God also because he is at enmity with God in his mind. Colossians 1:21 says, &ldquo;And you, who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by evil works.&rdquo; Because of the fall, man not only is far off and alienated from God, but he also is at enmity with God in his mind by evil works. Furthermore, the mind of fallen man is set on the evil flesh. Such a mind is hated by God and it is enmity against God (Rom. 8:5, 7). Hence, man needs not only to repent unto God and be forgiven, but also to be reconciled to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Man Disapproving of Holding God<br />
in His Knowledge</h2>
<p>Man needs to be reconciled to God because he disapproves of holding God in his knowledge. Romans 1:28a says, &ldquo;And as they...did not approve of holding God in their full knowledge.&rdquo; Man is alienated from God to the extent that he disapproves of holding God in his knowledge. In Greek, this means that man does not think it good to have God in his knowledge. Therefore, it is not that man cannot know God; rather, it is that man disapproves of holding God in his knowledge&mdash;he does not think it good to have God in his knowledge. Man intentionally refuses to know God, purposely puts God aside, and deliberately rejects God. Therefore, man needs to be reconciled to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Man Hating and Blaspheming God</h2>
<p>Man needs to be reconciled to God because he hates God and blasphemes God. Romans 1:30 shows us that fallen man hates God. In 1 Timothy 1:13 Paul tells us that before he believed in the Lord he was one who blasphemed God. Hatred is the inward intention; blasphemy is the outward word and conduct. Man hates God in his inward mind and intent, and he blasphemes God in his outward words and behavior. First, man is at enmity with God in his heart, and, disapproving of God, he does not think it good to have God in his knowledge. Then he hates God in his heart and thus blasphemes God outwardly. Man therefore truly needs to be reconciled to God.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
