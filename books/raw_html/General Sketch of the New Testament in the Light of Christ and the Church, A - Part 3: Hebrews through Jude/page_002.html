<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST AS GOD AND MAN SUPERIOR TO THE ANGELS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 1—2</h1><p>In these messages we will continue to see a general sketch of the New Testament in the light of Christ and the church. As we have already pointed out, the entire New Testament reveals a universal man, which is composed of Christ as the Head and the church as the Body. The New Testament can be divided into three sections. The first section is composed of the first five books, from Matthew through Acts, showing us the history of this universal man. The second section comprises the twenty-one Epistles from Romans through Jude, giving us a full definition and explanation of this universal man. The last section is the book of Revelation, which shows us the ultimate consummation of this universal man. Thus, the entire New Testament deals with the universal man and the history, definition, and consummation of this man.<h2 class=head1>THE EIGHT SUPPLEMENTARY EPISTLES</h2><p>The first part of the second section includes the books from Romans through Philemon. These thirteen Epistles give us a full definition, a full picture, of the Body of this universal man. Then, the other eight Epistles, from Hebrews through Jude, serve as a supplement to this definition. These last eight Epistles comprise five items of supplement. The first item of the supplement is the book of Hebrews, which is an explanation of the difference between Christ and Judaism. The thirteen Epistles from Romans through Philemon do not address the problem of Judaism and the difference between Christ and Judaism. Therefore, a supplementary book is needed to clarify this matter. The second book, James, is a supplement dealing with the relationship between works and faith. The first thirteen Epistles stress the matter of faith. They do not give us a clear understanding about the relationship of works and faith, so again there is the need of a supplement. First and 2 Peter, as the third item of the supplement, deal with the government of God. Again, the first thirteen Epistles do not touch the matter of the divine government of God. Today in this universe there is the divine government of God. We must keep all the rules of this divine government. If we violate any one of them, we will suffer something. The fourth item of the supplement, the Epistles of John, deals with the fellowship in God’s divine family. The last item, Jude, deals with apostasy, the drifting away of the church from the right track of God’s economy.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST BEING SUPERIOR TO ALL THE ITEMS OF JUDAISM</h2><p>Hebrews, as the first item of the supplement, is a rich and high book dealing with the matter of Judaism. I have conducted a study of this book on at least three main occasions. I have spent many years in it, and I have found that it is a rich yet difficult book. It is not easy for its readers to understand.<h2 class=head2>Judaism Being Composed of Five Wonderful Items</h2><p>Before Christ was incarnated as a man, God gave the people of Israel a number of items, all comprising Judaism. In Judaism, the Jewish religion, there is first of all God Himself. Second there are the angels. Following these there are the leaders such as Moses and Joshua. Fourth, there is the priesthood with the priests, such as Aaron and his sons. The last item is the old covenant, including all the sacrifices, the offerings, the tabernacle, and the temple. Judaism is composed with these five items—God, the angels, the leaders, the priests, and the old covenant. If you take away these five items, Judaism will collapse. God is so good, and the angels are wonderful. We highly esteem Moses, Joshua, Aaron, and his sons the priests. We also consider the old covenant as something marvelous. Altogether, Judaism is very good, even wonderful, because in it we have God, the angels, the leaders, the priests, and the old covenant.
