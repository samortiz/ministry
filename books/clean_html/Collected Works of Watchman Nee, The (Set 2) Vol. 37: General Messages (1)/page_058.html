<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">GOD'S WILL AND MAN'S WISH</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 15:7</h1><p>God's children need to know God's will, and they should know His will. It is not right for us to be ignorant of His will. Our Lord said, "He who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness" (John 8:12). This means that those who follow the Lord will have light; they will see and they will know. In other words, if a man does not have light and if he does not see anything or know anything, it means that he is not following the Lord. We must be very careful before the Lord. Whenever we do not see, it means that there is a problem with our following the Lord.</p><p>However, the problem with some people is not that they do not want to do God's will but that they do not know God's will. The matter of knowing God's will is a big subject among God's children. Those who zealously seek after the Lord surely want to please Him and carry out His will in everything. In every move that they make, they ask whether it is God's will. This kind of desire and attitude is good and correct, but this is quite confusing to many people. On the one hand, they want to do God's will, but on the other hand, they do not know God's will. They feel guilty about everything they do, yet they feel equally guilty if they do not do anything. It seems as if God's will is so far away that they do not know how to obey it. For this reason, we want to consider the matter of understanding God's will.</p><p>It is true that God's will is objective and that it is on the throne. We must seek after it before we can understand. We often need to fast, pray, and wait in His presence a great deal before we can understand His will. In order to know His will, we must also drop our own will and deny the activity of the flesh. These are very important, but I will not speak about them now. I would like to briefly mention another aspect, which is the fact that God's will is revealed many times through man's wishes. Let us consider how man's wishes are related to God's will.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ACTIVE WISHING IN THE WILL</h2><p>John 15:7 says, "Ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you." The word "will" here in Greek means an active wishing in the will. According to this verse, when our will actively wishes something by asking, it shall be done for us. Some may ask, "What happens if this asking is not according to God's will?" They seem to be more careful than the Lord Jesus in His wording. They would rather say, "If it is according to God's will, and you ask by actively wishing, it shall be done for you." Yet our Lord said, "Ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you." In other words, the Lord trusts some people to wish according to God's will. This is why He can say, "Ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you."</p><p>Paul said the same thing in 1 Corinthians 10:27, "If any of the unbelievers invites you and you wish to go, eat everything that is set before you, asking no question for conscience' sake." It is interesting that Paul did not mention God's will here. He only mentioned man's wish.</p><p>Do the above two passages mean that man can act any way that he pleases? Does it mean that man can do anything that he wishes? No, these words are not for everyone; they are for Christians, those who are regenerated, who have the mind of Christ, who have been dealt with by the cross, who abide in the Lord, and in whom the Lord's word abides. Let us consider the subject under two separate points.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MIND OF CHRIST</h2><p>Paul said, "For who has known the mind of the Lord and will instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ" (1 Cor. 2:16). The will of God is objective, whereas the mind of Christ is subjective. The will of God is on the throne, whereas the mind of Christ is within us. The will of God is outside of us, whereas the mind of Christ is inside us, continually revealing His will to us. Once we are regenerated, God's life is clearly planted into us, and we have the mind of Christ. The minute we receive life, we receive the mind of Christ as well, which gives us new thoughts, new inclinations, and new wishes.</p><h2 class="head1">ABIDING IN CHRIST AND HIS WORD ABIDING IN US</h2><p>The Lord Jesus said, "If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you" (John 15:7). As a result of abiding in the Lord and His word abiding in us, whatever we will, that is, whatever we actively wish and whatever our will reaches for, we need only ask for, and it shall be done for us. The important thing, however, is the expression "if you abide in Me and My words abide in you." Only this kind of people have reliable wills, and only they will not have a problem with God's will.</p><p>If a man has life, if he abides in the Lord, and if His word abides in him, he will know what God wants and also what God does not want. In other words, he will not only be regenerated, but also be in constant fellowship with the Lord; he will only want what God wants. Here we immediately see the cross. There are those who have passed through the cross, who have been dealt with by the Lord; they abide in the Lord, and the Lord's word abides in them. The Lord's word is living in them. To these ones the Lord says, "Ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you." Therefore, the problem does not lie in God's will but in the kind of persons we are.</p><p>We can say that some Christians have reached the stage where God can trust them. They abide in the Lord and the Lord's words abide in them to the extent that the Lord trusts their will. He trusts that the wishes emanating from their will are according to God's will. This is why the Lord said, "Ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you."</p>
