There are records in both the Old Testament and the New Testament that show us where a believer's spirit and soul go after he dies
The Bible speaks of the third heaven and the holy city, New Jerusalem , but neither place is a heavenly mansion as most people think
The word that is translated as heavenly mansion in Hebrews 9:24 and 1 Peter 3:22 of the Chinese Union Version should be translated as heaven
When the believers die, their spirits and souls do not enter a heavenly mansion but rather go first to Paradise in Hades
A believer goes through three stages from the time that he is saved until the time that he enters the holy city
While the believer is alive, he neither goes up to heaven nor goes down to Hades but rather lives on the earth
Christianity, however, says that when a believer dies, his spirit and soul immediately go to a heavenly mansion
We must therefore study this matter in the Bible from Genesis in the Old Testament to Revelation in the New Testament
According to this word, the Old Testament saints admitted that their souls would go down to Hades at the time of their death
Although their souls would go to Hades, they would be resurrected one day and would therefore not be abandoned to Hades
Lazarus who was saved also went to Hades at his death, because it says that in Hades the rich man 'lifted up his eyes
We cannot say that Lazarus was in a heavenly mansion at that time because the rich man saw Lazarus in Abraham's bosom
In the Old Testament Genesis says that Jacob went to Sheol after his death and went to be with his fathers, one of whom was Abraham
There is also another section where Abraham is and where the spirits and souls of the saved ones go to be comforted after they die
Acts 2:31 says, 'He, seeing this beforehand, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was He abandoned to Hades'
Some people may ask, 'When Paul talked about departing and being with Christ, was he not talking about going to heaven?
Corinthians 5:8 says, 'We are of good courage then and are well pleased rather to be abroad from the body and at home with the Lord'
By this we can see that we are surely closer to the Lord when we are in the same realm as He is and in the same place as He is
Those saints who had come to Taipei at that time realized that they were living in their own place while Brother Lee was living in his
Although they and Brother Lee were living in the same city of Taipei, they were not living in the same place with Brother Lee
Many people say that since these verses mention the third heaven as well as Paradise, Paradise must be the third heaven
The Hebrew believers were previously in the Old Testament religion of Judaism and in a spiritual sense were at Mount Sinai
The word and after Mount Zion indicates that 'the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem' is the second item
The 'myriads of angels' is the third item, and 'the church of the firstborn, who have been enrolled in the heavens' is the fourth item
The verse says that they have been enrolled in the heavens; it does not say that the church went to the heavens
The fifth item is 'God, the Judge of all,' and the sixth item is 'the spirits of righteous men who have been made perfect'
It may appear to some that the spirits of the righteous men are included in Mount Zion, that is, in the heavens
Apparently this is true, but actually it is not, because the church is also listed here and is included in these eight items
There are eight items with regard to grace, but although these eight items are heavenly, this does not mean that they are in the heavens
Concerning grace, Paul listed items such as Mount Zion, the heavenly Jerusalem, the myriads of angels, the church, and so forth
Similarly, the blood sprinkled by the Lord Jesus is not in the heavens in a physical sense; only its efficacy has reached the heavens
In terms of their significance, these items are all heavenly, but physically speaking, they are not in the heavens
At the end of Acts 7 Stephen was martyred, and while he was being stoned, he said, 'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit'!
They think that since the Lord is in heaven, when He received Stephen's spirit He must have received it into heaven
The Lord Jesus undoubtedly received the spirit of Stephen, but we cannot arbitrarily say that He received it in the third heaven where He is
The question mark at the end of this phrase indicates that this is a question as well, meaning, 'Does the breath of the beasts go downward'?
Many people also refer to Ecclesiastes 127 which says And the dust returns to the earth as it was and the breath returns to God who gave it
Although they return to God, there are particular details in regard to how He arranges for them and where He puts them
We can also use the Old Testament saints as examples to illustrate that the spirits and souls of the dead believers went to Sheol
The spirit and soul of a person are the person himself, and a person's body is like his clothing, which is clearly shown in 2 Corinthians 5
We all love the apostle Paul, but if Paul's spirit and soul were here without his body, would we dare to shake hands with him?
Every dead person must wait until resurrection when his spirit and soul will be properly clothed with the body before he can come to God
The Old Testament explicitly says that when a person came to serve God in the Holy Place, he had to be properly dressed
He could not be naked or have any condition of death upon him , because death could not be brought into God's dwelling place
Once they are resurrected, their spirits and souls will be clothed with their bodies, and death will be swallowed up
Based upon this, they conclude that ever since the Lord's death and resurrection, the souls and spirits of dead believers also go to heaven
As a result, we found that not one of these verses clearly states that the souls and spirits of dead believers go to heaven
Some people may point out that Enoch and Elijah were taken by God and that they must have been taken to heaven where God dwells
From John 3:13 we can see that God did not put the spirits and souls of these two men in the place where He dwells
The Lord must have descended to Hades, because if He had not, it would have been unnecessary to say that He would not be abandoned to Hades
From the context we can see that the resurrection includes the spirit and soul coming out from Hades and the body coming out from the tomb
Only after the Lord Jesus resurrected could one say that a man had ascended to heaven, and that man was Jesus the Nazarene
Luke also calls this place Paradise, the place where the spirits and souls of the saved ones in past generations are resting
Scofield clearly emphasizes that after the Lord Jesus' resurrection and ascension, there was a change related to the Paradise of Hades
He even uses the Paradise mentioned in 2 Corinthians 12:4 to indicate that Paradise was moved to the third heaven
We have already seen in the previous message that 2 Corinthians 12 does not prove that Paradise is in the third heaven
Paradise is still in Hades and the spirits and souls of the Old Testament saints are still in the Paradise of Hades waiting for resurrection
Scofield says that when the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens, He brought with Him the saved souls and spirits of the Old Testament saints
On the day of Pentecost, Peter, having been inspired by the Holy Spirit, stood up and said, 'David did not ascend into the heavens'
David prophesied that when Christ resurrected and ascended to the heavens, He would sit on the right hand of God
We can read Hebrews 11:10, which says that Abraham waited for the city with foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God
Most Bible readers agree that what Abraham waited for was the city God had promised him-the heavenly New Jerusalem
In the previous message we saw that after their death the souls and spirits of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob went to Hades, not to heaven
Scofield believed is right, then in Hebrews, Abraham should have already been in the holy city, the Jerusalem in the heavens
Scofield said that when Christ resurrected and ascended, He transferred the spirits and souls of the Old Testament saints to the heavens
Hebrews 11:39 says, 'And these all, having obtained a good testimony through their faith, did not obtain the promise'
Verse 40 says, 'Because God has provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect'
On the other hand, the holy city New Jerusalem is not a place that we enter one by one but a place that we enter in a corporate way
We can say this because Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob have not resurrected, that is, their bodies are still in the tomb
It is only a temporary shelter for the spirits and souls of the saved ones after they die and before they enter into the New Jerusalem
According to God's ordination, the Old Testament saints and the New Testament saints are to enter into the New Jerusalem together
Until the day of resurrection arrives, the spirits and souls of the dead saints will be temporarily kept in Paradise
We can only say that we do not know because the New Testament does not clearly tell us this, and we do not want to assume too much
In the Old Testament during the Feast of the Firstfruits, God required the Israelites to offer a sheaf of the firstfruits of their produce
If the offering had been only one stalk, then this would have indicated that the Lord Jesus was going to be resurrected alone
Where God placed them after they resurrected is difficult to determine from the Word, and we dare not draw any conclusions
He cannot be one whose spirit and soul have been separated from the body and whose body has not yet been resurrected
Only on the day of resurrection, after His spirit and soul had put on His body again, did He ascend to heaven to meet God
If we meet God without being clothed with a transfigured body, that is, if we are not yet resurrected, we will be naked
Even if we were unclothed of this body of humiliation, we still would not be able to meet God because we would be naked
Only when we are clothed with that body-the resurrected, transfigured, and glorified body-will we no longer be naked
For a person who has been saved to go to God in the heavens and to be with God, he must be complete and without any problems
If you heard us come and immediately came out from your bathroom without putting on any clothes, we would run away in fright
The opening of the fifth seal is closely followed by the opening of the sixth seal and is very close to the end of this age
The souls of those who were slain include the Old Testament and New Testament martyrs, including Peter and Paul
It proves that the souls of the martyred saints are being comforted and are resting a little while in the bosom of Abraham
According to the Old Testament type, the altar was in the outer court, not in the Holy Place or in the Holy of Holies
The souls of the martyred saints are crying from underneath the altar, from the Paradise of Hades, which is underneath the earth
As long as he has believed in the Lord's saving precious blood, his spirit and soul will go to the Paradise in Hades when he dies
Only after these issues are resolved can a believer enter into God's dwelling place in completeness and without problems
There are the issues of the maturity in life and the receiving of either reward or punishment according to the Lord's judgment
He also needs to pass through the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ to decide whether he will receive reward or punishment
After going through all these processes and resolving all these issues, he will finally be a complete person before God
At that time all those who have been saved will finally receive what they believed in and hoped for throughout the generations
Before that day arrives, the dead saints are in an abnormal situation of having their spirits and souls separated from their bodies
They need to be temporarily placed in Paradise to rest and to wait for the resurrection and for their being clothed with a glorious body
In this message we need to see in principle what the distinctive features of the heavenly New Jerusalem and the Paradise in Hades are
Most Bible readers acknowledge that at the beginning of the Bible in the book of Genesis God prepared a dwelling place for man
The dwelling place God prepared for man in the beginning was called the garden of Eden, and the one at the end is called the New Jerusalem
The dwelling place at the end of the Bible-the New Jerusalem, which is mentioned at the beginning of Revelation 2-is also a paradise
The inward being of God will be the inward being of man, and God's glorious, outward appearance will be man's glorious appearance
In Revelation John saw in a vision One who was sitting on the throne in heaven who was like a jasper stone and a sardius stone in appearance
Even after receiving the life and nature of the pure gold within, we still may not have the image of the precious stones without
Even though we may be somewhat transformed into the image of Christ, that amount of transformation is not enough
We have the life and nature of the pure gold within, but we may be short of the glorious image of the precious stones without
In other words, this city is the dwelling place of God and all the saints, and it is also the issue of God's work in man throughout the ages
On the foundations of the wall of the city we can see the names of the twelve apostles, but we cannot see the twelve apostles themselves
In the Old Testament God's people were in the holy temple, but in the New Testament God's people are the holy temple
They all have the life of God in them, and in this life they are joined together to become the living dwelling place of God, a living city
What God has been doing throughout the ages is transforming the redeemed ones with His life to make them precious stones
When the new heaven, the new earth, and the New Jerusalem are manifested, it will not only be something glorious but also mysterious
Just as it is hard for us to comprehend pure gold that is transparent, it is also hard for us to comprehend this concept
The street of the New Jerusalem is pure gold, and the foundations of the wall as its expression are adorned with every precious stone
From that time on God began to work in man so that eventually the man of clay would have pure gold inwardly and the precious stone outwardly
On the day that the work of transformation is completely finished, the garden of Eden will have become the New Jerusalem
Rather, our concept should be to allow God to transform, build, and work Himself into us today so that we may become that city
It is God's working in us to the point that we have become mature and have been thoroughly dealt with to become pure gold and precious stone
Paul's body is still buried in the earth, but his spirit and soul have gone to a resting place, the Paradise in Hades
God puts them in Paradise that they may be at rest and may be comforted while waiting for Him to complete His unfinished work in them
These three places, which the Bible calls paradises, are the places God has prepared and is preparing for all the saved ones
When the spirits and souls of the saved ones leave their bodies, they go to a Paradise of rest and enjoy happiness and comfort there
When the fullness of time comes and all the work is accomplished, all the saved ones will go to God's eternal dwelling place
We must see that this New Jerusalem, the ultimate Paradise, is not for us to walk into or for us to be brought into by God
God will work continuously until the day we are matured and have been completely transformed by Him from glory to glory
Starting in the garden of Eden, the God of creation began to work in us to make us pure gold and precious stones
At that time we will not only be in the New Jerusalem, but we will also be able to say that we are the New Jerusalem
When the New Jerusalem is manifested, this dwelling place of God will be us, and we will be the dwelling place
God wants man to be transformed, to grow in life unto maturity, to let Christ be formed in him, and to be conformed into the Lord's image
We have been saved, our sins have been forgiven, and we have God's life, but we still must grow in life and become mature
As soon as the life of God gets into man, transformation begins to take place within him to gradually build him into the New Jerusalem
Hebrews 11:10 says, 'For he eagerly waited for the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God'
Hebrews 11 says that He has prepared a city, but Revelation 21 says that the city is 'prepared as a bride adorned for her husband'
Verse 3 continues saying that God will tabernacle with them and they will be His peoples and God Himself will be with them and be their God
These verses indicate that the 'dwelling place of God in spirit,' which is God's habitation, is being produced
Peter, the little stone, had to be built on Christ, the big stone, so that they could become the church, God's habitation
The Lord mentions that He is preparing a place, that He is coming again, and that He will bring us to the same place where He is
According to what the Bible shows us, the New Jerusalem is the ultimate issue of the work of God in all generations
They may ask, 'If we are going to be that city in the future, that is, the stones of that city, will we still be able to praise as stones?
We do not need to wait until the time of the new heaven and new earth to be God's habitation, because we are God's habitation today
Ephesians 2 also says that the apostles and we are being built together on Christ the cornerstone to become God's habitation
It is not necessary to wait until the new heaven and new earth for the mystery to be revealed, because it is here today
The ultimate issue of the work of God will be something of God mingled within man and also heaven mingled within man
The principle of God's work on those who have been saved is that He works Himself into them and also works heaven into them
One day we may be tempted, we may fall into the stratagems of Satan, and we may be brought to the slaughter as a lamb
When we wear worldly clothes, we often feel like we are dragging a pile of earth onto ourselves and are full of the taste of the earth
Again, do not be wrongly influenced by traditional Christianity, thinking that all saved people will 'go to heaven'
The Bible says that while Solomon was building the temple, neither the sound of a hammer nor of an ax nor of any iron tool was heard
Those sounds had been heard in the mountains when the people had been hewing out the stones during the time of King David
King Solomon then took the stones that David had prepared and arranged and laid them to build up the holy temple
When we do things, we are very polite, nobody touches anyone in the wrong way, and we get along with one another peacefully
Ephesians 2, 1 Peter 2, and Matthew 16 show us that today God is saving us and working on us to build us into God's habitation
The habitation that God is building today is the church, and the habitation in the future will be the New Jerusalem
The Lord Jesus said that He was going to prepare a place for us, and He also said that He would build the church upon Himself as the rock
Rather, the Lord has only one work-the church that He is building on the earth is the New Jerusalem that He is preparing in the heavens
That building is the spiritual house mentioned in 1 Peter 2 and also God's habitation mentioned in Ephesians 2
Ultimately, at the time of completion, it will be a holy city and a tabernacle, the mutual abode of God and man
One day we will all realize that the habitation or abode that God is building in every age is a union of three entities-Him, us, and heaven
The eternal abode that we will ultimately enter into is not something unrelated to us today or something completely objective to us
It is not a matter of entering in or going up but of allowing God to build us and work us into the New Jerusalem
In the past they thought that everything would be all right if they only believed in the precious blood of Jesus
They thought that as long as they were saved and were justified in His blood, they would definitely 'go to heaven'
The answer can be found in 1 Corinthians 3:9, which tells us that we are God's cultivated land, God's building
We have to allow the Spirit to work within us to touch our difficulties to hew our corners and sharp edges and to move and operate within us
If we do not allow Him to work within us and do not let Him build within us, we cannot have the growth and maturity in life
In order to be willing to let Him be everything to us, to work in us, and to build in us, we have to pay the price
The more we allow Him to work Himself into us, the more we will have the element of God and the element of heaven
When we submit to the Holy Spirit, allowing God to work Himself into us, we have the presence of God and the taste of heaven within us
The church is a miniature, similar to a fetus in a mother's womb, which is conceived as a miniature of a complete person
The church, which is something mystical, is a miniature, and when it is completed, it will be the New Jerusalem
A newborn child actually begins as a fetus in the mother's womb, and this fetus grows bit by bit until it is born
The bride having made herself ready means that the church has been completely built up and has grown unto maturity
Simply speaking, this parable reveals that when the Lord comes back, those who are ready will sit with Him at the wedding feast
These three matters-God's building in us, our growth in the Lord's life, and our getting ready before the Lord-are all linked together
When we were saved, He not only forgave our sins, but through His Spirit He entered into us with His life to be our life
When the Holy Spirit of God and the life of God entered into us, that was the beginning of God's building work in us
Because we may lack the proper nutrients or vitamins, the doctor must inject the nutrients or vitamins into us
Similarly, in order for God to build Himself into us and to enter into us, He needs to break our 'flesh'-our soul-life, our self
Our thoughts, views, preferences, choices, opinions, and decisions all represent our self and are all part of our self
If we allow God to break all these things, then God will have an opening in us, and then He will be able to inject Himself into us
Some people may say that they understand this doctrine well but that it is still very troublesome to them and unclear in their practice
Your views, insight, thoughts, opinions, preferences, choices, ideas, and decisions may be intact and altogether yours
Though you are saved and the Spirit of God and the life of God are in you, your thoughts and views do not have the element of God in them
Although we have the life of God and the Spirit of God in us, we may handle things as if we do not have God in us
Though we have God's life and God's Spirit dwelling within us, God may not have the ground in us when we make choices or decisions
When he is dealing with his children regarding the matter of marriage, he does not give any ground to God in his thoughts and views
During this time if he humbles himself and receives the piercing and moving of the Spirit Gods element will be built up in him more and more
One day the Spirit will pierce our view concerning our children's marriages and our plans for our career and our future
He will be like a doctor giving an injection, piercing our skin and flesh, so that we will have a sense of pain and feel mournful
Our thoughts and views toward our children's marriages will give more ground to God and have more of God's element
He still behaves and thinks according to his own insight and views and handles his children's marriages according to his own thinking
One day, if God has mercy on him and is gracious to him, God will stretch out His hand and raise up an environment to smite him
Matthew 25:4 shows us that the wise virgins not only carried their lamps but also prepared their vessels with oil
To put it more directly, his insight and views had to be broken so that God could come into his insight and views
At the same time, 25:10 also mentions the matter of being ready, telling us that those who are ready can enter into the feast with the Lord
Although the above passages do not mention the word maturity, they repeatedly mention the words watch and be ready
No other passages in the Bible show us more clearly the way for a Christian to become mature than Matthew 24 and 25
It is easy for Christians to tend to emphasize the teachings in the Gospel of John but to neglect those in the Gospels of Matthew and Mark
We often speak about these verses in the church meetings, but few of us pay attention to the teachings in the Gospels of Matthew and Mark
If we truly hope to be with the Lord and to abide with Him, we must know the condition we must be in and the stage that we must reach
The subject of these two portions is that we need to watch and be ready and that we need to wait for the Lord's coming and bring Him back
Although their status, position, career, and living are the same and both are saved, they differ in one aspect
All eight of them belong to the same parents, are in the same family, have the same life, and live the same kind of lives
He told them this because if they were not watchful or ready, there was a chance that they might be left behind
The Lord first gave us a clear message on the truth of being watchful and ready and then pointed out to us the way to be watchful and ready
While chapter twenty-four speaks about two women grinding, chapter twenty-five speaks about ten virgins preparing oil
The tree of life produces twelve fruits, and the wall of the city is 144 cubits high, which is the product of twelve times twelve
If we read the Bible carefully, we will find that the Bible often separates a group of twelve into groups of ten and two
In one case, while two of the apostles fought to sit on the Lord's right hand and left hand, the other ten were unhappy with them
The truth in Matthew 24 refers to the living believers, whereas the way in Matthew 25 refers to the believers who have died
He should be hidden, having little involvement or contact with the outside world, and he should be pure and sanctified
It is a pity that many saints have forsaken their status as virgins and do not take their lamps and shine as they should
In the parable of the virgins in Matthew 25 we clearly see that we who are Christians should have the status of a pure and simple virgin
Since our Lord is not in the world and the world does not want Him, we should not have a lingering love for the world
If we would consider our condition, we would realize that we not only are not up to where we should be but are far from it
In the Gospel of Matthew the Lord pointed out four aspects of the proper situation of a Christian-his status, condition, way, and living
Even if we do have these four aspects, we should not assume that we are qualified and mature enough to see the Lord
In the parable of the virgins the Lord deliberately said, 'And five of them were foolish and five were prudent
For the foolish, when they took their lamps, did not take oil with them; but the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps'
It was not that one group was genuinely saved while the other group was falsely saved, as some Bible expositors say
The Lord pointed out that what He was concerned about was not the matter of genuineness versus falseness but prudence versus foolishness
In the Bible the number twelve indicates eternal perfection, whereas the number ten indicates human perfection
The Lord divided up the ten virgins into two groups of five, indicating that they had been created and had God added to them
Since we have received the grace to have God, and since God is now living inside of us, we should bear some responsibility before God
It is not acceptable at all for us Christians who have gained God and have God inside of us to live loosely and sloppily
If a person is not saved and does not have God inside of him, although he may not be watchful, God may leave him alone
Since we have been saved, we must bear the responsibility to choose whether we will be prudent believers or foolish believers
The prudent virgins were truly prudent because they prepared oil in their vessels besides the oil in their lamps
When we are saved and receive the Lord as our Savior, we are regenerated, and the Spirit begins to live inside of us
Every saved Christian has the Spirit of the Lord and the life of the Lord inside and thus is a genuine virgin with oil in his lamp
After they are saved, they have to prepare themselves with the second portion of the Spirit, the infilling Spirit
Although we are Christians, our condition may not be very vital because we may not have enough of the infilling Spirit
In other words, we have been regenerated and we have the regenerating Spirit, but we are not filled with the Spirit
When the Spirit fills our entire being, that is, when we gain the infilling Spirit, we cannot help but become hot
When we preach the gospel and speak about the Lord Jesus to people, we will touch their feelings and will have the presence of the Spirit
Our thoughts, preferences, views, insight, inclinations, choices, and everything are occupied by Christ and filled with God
Ten dollars can buy you something valued at ten dollars, whereas ten thousand dollars can buy you something valued at ten thousand dollars
According to the speaking of Paul, everything that is in us or in our hearts that is other than Christ is the price that we must pay
When we look at our knowledge, prospects, material possessions, and family, we treasure them and hold on to them
To the lukewarm Laodiceans, the Lord spoke of buying three items-gold refined by fire, white garments, and eyesalve to anoint their eyes
Why does God want us to pursue the infilling of the Spirit after regenerating us, saving us, and giving us the Spirit?
Today the Triune God, who is Christ, the Spirit, and God, is already living in us, but do we give Him the ground in us?
Although the Spirit is in us, most of the time we do not give Him the authority and thus do not have the infilling of the Spirit
In a sense, we have 'parents' in our family, but most of the time we do not let them be the masters and do not respect their authority
If you do not study or work hard as a student, you are not doing what you are supposed to be doing and should feel ashamed of yourself
A wise person, no matter what kind of person he is, will behave according to the principle for the kind of person he is
To express Christ requires that we be filled with Christ, and to be filled with Christ requires that we be filled with the Spirit of Christ
Christians who do not live according to this principle do not behave like Christians and do not live up to the standard
In the parable of the ten virgins, the virgins' preparing oil in their vessels signifies our pursuing the infilling of the Spirit
By giving the Spirit the ground and allowing the Spirit to have the authority in us, we are preparing our vessels with the oil
It does not matter whether or not we like being human beings or whether or not we know how to live as human beings
As men we are told by God through the gospel that we must repent and believe in the Lord Jesus or else we will perish
We may give eight ten or even a hundred reasons in opposing Him but we will not have the amen and the peace in the deepest part of our being
No matter how many reasons we present to God, the inward 'amen' and the sense of peace will be withheld from us
Because his inner being is in disharmony with his outer being, he will not have the boldness to kneel before the Lord and to pray
Because of his hardness and his many reasons, the Spirit may be silent for a while since the Spirit does not contend with man
Whether or not we agree with God or whether or not we are submissive to Him, we can never change Him because the authority is in His hands
Having believed in Jesus, God wants us to mature, to pursue the infilling of the Spirit, and to prepare oil in our vessels
We cannot guarantee how many years we will live on the earth, whether it will be ten, twenty, sixty, or a hundred years
No matter how many years we will be alive on the earth, we must prepare our vessels with the oil within the limited time
In the Gospels the Lord repeatedly asked people to leave everything , to sell all that they had , and to deny the self to follow Him
He wants us to pour out everything in our inward being other than Himself so that our hearts can be empty for Him
Some people have the misunderstanding that the Lord wants us to leave and neglect our family husband wife business career and everything
For him to leave everything does not mean that he should no longer study but that the matter of studying should no longer occupy his heart
Rather, it means that all these things no longer have the ground in us because the ground in us has been given to Christ
We will do everything well and properly, yet our families will not have the ground in us because our ground will have been given to Christ
There was a brother whose clothing was very valuable, but his clothing did not occupy him and was not his world
At the same time, we must act according to the will of Christ to properly bear the responsibilities of the family
Some fifty years ago in a Western country, there was a group of saints who were pursuing the infilling of the Spirit
During that time in the West, the most fashionable way for a woman to arrange her hair was to set it very high, like a tower
During a meeting, the sister mentioned earlier came and, kneeling down, cried out loudly, 'Lord, why do You not answer my prayers?
If we bring all these questions before Him and give Him the authority and ground, we are paying the price to 'buy' Him
The difference between the foolish virgins and the prudent virgins does not concern their lamps but the contents of their vessels
Proverbs 20:27 clearly tells us, 'The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, / Searching all the innermost parts of the inner being'
Corinthians 4:7 says, 'But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us'
Verse 16 says, 'Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day'
The outer man is our natural man, our soul, whereas the inner man is our regenerated new man, our regenerated spirit
Verse 6 says that the ministers of the new covenant are made sufficient to be ministers of the Spirit through which man can have life
When the Spirit of God with His life entered into our deadened spirit, our spirit was made alive and became bright
When the Spirit of God with God's life enters into us, it is like a great, rich light entering into our spirit
Now this spirit shines and has been made bright and alive because the Spirit of God with God's life has entered into it
When we talk about our person, most of the time we are referring to what we think about, what we love, and how we make decisions
We have to say again that the central meaning and purpose of being a Christian is to allow God to mingle Himself with us
The beginning of our being matured in life is when God first mingles with us, that is, when His Spirit with His life enters into our spirit
The fact that our inner being has been made alive and bright is proof that God's Spirit with God's life has entered into us
Before we believed in the Lord and were regenerated, perhaps we did not feel wrong when we quarreled with our family
We did not feel that we were wrong when we did something wrong such as quarreling with others in our family and causing turmoil
Though we may be pricked and may have a sense of pain in our heart, we may still want to reason and quarrel with others
One day we may quarrel with our family outwardly, but inwardly we may be being pricked until we cannot bear it anymore
By this we know that we have been regenerated and that the Spirit of God with God's life has been mingled with our spirit
At the time the Lord Jesus spoke the parable of the ten virgins two thousand years ago, lamps shone because of the oil burning in them
We have seen that the lamp mentioned in Matthew 25 is our human spirit and that the oil that makes the lamp shine is the Spirit
We who are saved and regenerated have the Spirit in our spirit, that is, we have the oil in our lamps, and we have light
The ten virgins, both the prudent and the foolish, are exactly the same in this respect-they all have oil in their lamps
Revelation 21 tells us that the wall of the New Jerusalem is composed of precious stones, yet it is transparent
God is inside us, but because our outer man remains absolutely intact, it does not have any openings to allow God to come out
When there are openings and cracks in our being, not only inwardly but also outwardly, immediately the light shines out from within us
The Spirit of God, the life of God, and God Himself will fill us completely, and God and we will be mingled together completely
We are always in our soul, that is, in our mind, emotion, and will, but God in our spirit wants to come out into our mind, emotion, and will
If He cannot win the battle with us from the inside, then He has no other way but to send the angels to deal with us from the outside
Because God loves us, is merciful toward us, and wants us to be His glorious vessel, He has to break our iron walls
Our thoughts will be like His thoughts, our love will be like His love, and our decisions will be like His decisions
Corinthians 3:18 says that we 'are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit'
Whenever there is a struggle in our mind, emotion, or will, we have to drop all that is in our soul and pay the price to let the Lord win
Gradually, we become mature and the Spirit spreads from our spirit to our soul that we may have the oil in our vessel
In the parable of the ten virgins, the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps when the bridegroom came at midnight
Whether they were foolish or prudent, the first thing that they paid attention to after their resurrection was their spirit
Paul tells us in verse 17, 'And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom'
From that time onward His intention is that His Spirit which is His element would spread from our spirit to the various parts of our being
When He has completely worked Himself into every part of our being, then we will be mature in the spiritual life
From that time on, in order for the Spirit to work Himself into the various parts of our soul, we need to cooperate and pay the price
It is necessary because various parts of our soul have been fully occupied by all kinds of people, matters, and things
How can the Spirit work Himself into our emotion if we are not willing to give up what we desire in our emotion?
If we are not willing to surrender our own choices in our will, there is no way for the Spirit to be wrought into our will
The vessel of our emotion should be filled with the Holy Spirit, yet we allow other things to occupy our emotion
Even before the Spirit enters into our emotion, our emotion has already been filled up with so many other things
In order for the Spirit to spread from our spirit to our emotion, we have to pour out all that is occupying our emotion
Today the problem is not with the Spirit's infilling but that many things apart from the Lord are occupying us
From morning to evening, our emotion desires many things that, though they may not be evil, filthy, or sinful, are not the Lord Himself
The grape juice may be good because it contains ingredients such as water and sugar, yet the grape juice is not the air
The Lord is standing and knocking in our cold spirit longing to enter into our heart and our emotion yet our heart remains so hard and cold
The Spirit cannot fill us, and the Lord cannot spread into the three parts of our soul-our mind, emotion, and will
Our outer man which is our soul composed of three partsour mind emotion and willhas been filled with ourselves and the things of the world
The Spirit of the Lord in our spirit would like to spread outward, yet our soul has fenced Him off, restricting Him in every way
As we faced the people, matters, and things in our daily life day after day, we unconsciously turned away from the Lord
Our hearts did not love Him that much and turned away from Him, facing our children, studies, reputations, positions, and money instead
We have the Lord in us, and we have the Spirit of the Lord in us, but we and the Lord are often not in fellowship each day
At this time, our heart is open and the Spirit can spread out from our spirit into our emotion through our heart
The more we love the Lord, the more our heart will open to the Lord and the more the Spirit will enter into our emotion
If our heart turns away from the Lord, He will be bound in our spirit and will have no way to come out or spread out
Through the turning and opening of our heart to the Lord, we are able to behold the glory of the Lord face to face
The more we focus on Him and draw near to Him, the clearer and more glorious our reflection of His glory will be
The Lord through His Spirit will fill our being-our mind, emotion, and will-with His glory and with Himself as the Spirit
Consequently, whatever we think about, love, or choose will have the Lord's image because they will all have the Lord's element
Only when we are willing to pay the price and to lay down whatever the Lord wants us to lay down will our heart turn to the Lord
The phrase where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom means that the Spirit of the Lord Himself is freedom
Originally, we are men who are merely natural-not having the life of the Lord, the nature of the Lord, or the image of the Lord within us
Since the time of our regeneration and salvation, the Lord has been adding Himself into us, causing us to have His life and nature
When the Lord has fully worked His image into us and is fully expressed out from within us, then we will be mature in life
Suppose, however, that there is another person who was not born with a good nature, who has a bad temper, and who is not a nice person
Some may think that if a person who is outwardly bad gets saved by Gods Spirit and life he should endeavor to have good behavior and conduct
God saves us by causing His Spirit and life to expand and spread out from our spirit, our inner being, so that we are completely changed
Man's way is to outwardly improve and correct himself; God's way is to swallow us up and transform us from within
One day the younger one gets saved, and the Spirit of the Lord and the life of the Lord entered into his spirit
From the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the older brother honors his parents in his natural way
When the young brother got saved in the summer, his outward behavior at that time was not as good as his older brother's
At this time, the older brother's honoring is just his natural honoring, but the younger brother's honoring is different
Looking from the outside, our whole person is comprised of the activities of these three parts-the mind, emotion, and will
Of course, when we pray, we are in spirit, we have fellowship with the Lord, we feel the presence of the Lord, and we can touch the Lord
Right after we finish praying, our emotion is stirred up, and we become joyful or angry, sorrowful or delighted
It is because he allows the Lord's Spirit and the Lord's life to permeate from his spirit into his mind, emotion, and will
The conscience is in our spirit, our deepest part, and surrounding our conscience is our mind, emotion, and will
Among these four parts-conscience, mind, emotion, and will-one part is in the spirit and three parts are in the soul
Whether Gods Spirit and life within us can spread to our mind emotion and will depends upon whether our heart allows God to pass through it
When the heart is turned to the Lord, man is face to face with the Lord, and naturally, the veil is taken away
In a sense, the Lord is on the inside, we are on the outside, and the heart is between us, so that we and the Lord cannot be face to face
When our heart is turned away from the Lord then we are turned away from the Lord and spontaneously there is no communication with the Lord
We have to learn to turn within to our spirit to fellowship with the Lord so that we can be mingled with the Spirit
In 2 Corinthians 3 Paul says the Lord is the Spirit and that where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom
As long as they did not sin, did not hurt anyone, and went to the meeting on the Lord's Day, they seemed to have peace within
Whenever his heart turns to the Lord, the Lord as the Spirit enters into him, and when the Spirit enters, freedom also enters
If you have been saved, not only do you not have peace within when you are dancing, but you feel bad even after you go home
Your conscience condemns you, your emotion is not at peace, your will is not at ease, and your mind is bothered
When his mind thinks about the Lord, his emotion loves the Lord, and his will chooses the Lord, his conscience will approve of him
At this time the freedom that he experiences is real freedom-an inward freedom, a freedom full of joy and peace
The first is the Lord, the second is the Spirit, the third is freedom, the fourth is glory, and the fifth is image
To go from the first item to the last-from the Lord to the image of the Lord-we need to pass through the Spirit, freedom, and glory
In other words, to go from having only the Lord to having the Lord's image as well is the way for a Christian to mature in life
Originally, we did not have the Spirit of the Lord, the Lord Himself, in our being-neither in our spirit nor in our soul
From then on, this Lord Spirit has been in our spirit and has been trying to spread from our spirit to our soul
If the heart does not open the gate and allow the spirit to be released, the Spirit has no way to get into the soul
Although we have been saved, instead of being toward the Lord, our heart is often toward many things other than the Lord
If a man's heart is toward the Lord, he is face to face with the Lord, and he can fellowship with the Lord directly
If his heart is toward things other than the Lord and is turned away from the Lord there will be a veil a barrier between the Lord and him
If someone were to ask us whether or not the Lord has spread out from our spirit, we may not have anything to say
The reason is that our heart is often closed toward the Lord, and the Lord is detained in our spirit to the extent that He cannot come out
Although we have been saved and have the Lord in our spirit, the Lord cannot come out from our spirit to control our mind, emotion, and will
We are not able to mature in the Lord's life because the Lord's Spirit and life are not able to grow out from within our spirit
In order for us to grow in life, our heart must be open to the Lord, and our mind, emotion, and will must be opened to the Lord
Whenever we open to the Lord in our mind, the Lord's Spirit will gain the opportunity to enter into the different parts of our soul
Many times when we have a certain determination in our mind, emotion, and will, we simply have another feeling within us
Suppose that a sister goes to buy some clothing, sees some fashionable and fancy clothes, and wants to buy them
She feels that it is unsuitable for someone who loves the Lord to wear fashionable and fancy clothing of this kind
If this is the case the Lords Spirit will not be able to enter into her mind emotion and will and she will not have any freedom within her
The Lord's Spirit will have the opportunity to enter into her mind, emotion, and will, and she will have freedom within her
In the meetings they will not be able to pray to the extent that they will not even be able to say 'amen' when others pray
When he meets people on the way he will feel that they are lovely and when he lifts up his head to see the clouds he will find them pleasant
If several of us are sitting in a house, and if all the windows and doors are shut and the fan is broken, it will be very stuffy
If we open the doors and windows and repair the fan, then there will be a wind, and we will feel cool while sitting in the house
Christians who love to go to the movies and to go dancing may feel very comfortable when they see a movie or when they go to a dance
If we love the Lord more and allow the Lord to overcome more in us, we will be released, free, and clear inside
Although there may be persecution or difficult environments outwardly, our mind, emotion, and will certainly will be open and free
The Lord is in us, and if we let Him move freely in us and obey Him more, He will have the ground and will expand in us
If we were to ask him, he would tell us that his burdens, difficulties, and pain are by no means lighter than ours
The difference is that he always allows the Spirit to be free and endeavors to always keep his heart toward the Lord
In John 3:8, the Holy Spirit is likened to the wind, and everyone who is born of the Spirit is likened to the blowing wind
When they arrive at the theater, they have no peace, so they look around to see if there are any other brothers or sisters there
Because the Spirit is in us, we have freedom, our face is unveiled to the Lord, and we are face to face with Him
Eventually, we see the glory of the Lord, and from this glory to the ultimate glory, we are being transformed into the image of the Lord
It comes from glory, and this glory comes from freedom, freedom comes from the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Lord Himself
Whenever the Lord moves and acts He is the Spirit and whenever the Spirit comes out and enters into our mind emotion and will He is freedom
If day by day we love the Lord and give Him the opportunities, day by day the Lord will spread out from within us
Originally we had only the Lord within us, but through transformation we will have the image of the Lord within us
We can also call this a condition of having glory, freedom, release, the presence of the Lord, and the Lord's Spirit
When our mind is like His mind, our desires are like His desires, and our decisions are like His decisions, we will have His image
Christians always speak of loving the Lord, worshiping the Lord, obeying the Lord, and following the Lord, but where is the Lord?
On the one hand, electricity is in the air; on the other hand, it is in our room and we are able to contact it
Those who have experienced this know that God is Spirit, that the Lord is the Spirit, and that the Lord is in our spirit today
The fact that we can sense the Lord within us shows us that the Lord is the Spirit and that He contacts us in our spirit
He then said that prayer is the Christ who is indwelling us praying to the Christ who is sitting on the throne
When our parents lose their temper, we are unhappy with them, but when our parents are pleased with us, we honor them
The good that we do from ourselves can be likened to using our strength to rotate the blades of an electric fan
Because He is the Spirit, He can enter into man; because He is the Spirit, He cannot be limited and can be with man all the time
When we have freedom, there is nothing between us and the Lord, and the Lord and we can fellowship with one another
The freedom and glory within a Christian and the image expressed from a Christian are all the Holy Spirit Himself
When this Spirit is in us, we have freedom; when this Spirit is expressed from us, we have glory and the Lord's image
In all of our family life, church life, and contact and interaction with others, we must deny and reject our self and live in the Spirit
If we live in this way every day, rejecting our self and walking according to the Holy Spirit, we will be transformed day by day
Whenever we live by our self, the flesh is expressed, and whenever we live according to the Holy Spirit, the Lord is expressed
As we daily reject our self, care for the sense in our spirit, and walk according to the Spirit, we will be transformed day by day
The more we have the Lords image the more we will become mature and the more we become mature the more we will have the Spirit in our soul
When we become mature, not only will we have the Holy Spirit in our spirit, but even our person, our soul, will be full of the Holy Spirit
We will be fully transformed into the Lord's image, we will be mature in life, and we will be ready to be raptured to meet the Lord
Revelation 4:2b-3a says, 'Upon the throne there was One sitting; and He who was sitting was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance'
Corinthians 3:12 says, 'But if anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble'
From that time on, the Spirit desires to spread out from our spirit into every part of our being-our mind, emotion, and will
His speaking, opinions, feelings, and moods all have the image of the Lord, because the Lord is being expressed from within him
On the one hand, it rids us of what we should not have, and on the other hand, it recovers what we originally received that became degraded
He created for us a mind with the ability to think, an emotion with the ability to love, and a will with the ability to make decisions
The Lord Jesus' redemption on the cross takes away the sins and the world from within us and is recovering us so that we can be used by God
Based upon Christ's redemptive work, every day the cross takes away the sins and the world from within in us and recovers us
Bit by bit we are allowing the cross to take away the sins and the world from within us and at the same time to recover us back to God
Some have fallen into playing mah-jongg, others have fallen into going to the movies, but this person has fallen into losing his temper
If his wife, children, relatives, colleagues, or even the brothers and sisters displease him in the slightest bit, he loses his temper
He does not care whether this is pleasing to God or what God's will is-his entire person falls into his temper
The cross of Christ has saved them from their temper, addictions, and various kinds of wickedness and brought them back to God
A believer needs to have the golden element, then he needs the silver element, and third, he needs the precious stones
As he is gradually delivered from his lust, wickedness, addictions, and temper, the silver work of the cross will become apparent
At this stage he may still have his own thoughts and others may not be able to sense any flavor of the Lord in his speaking
Although his opinions are not wicked, and he does not aspire after the world, others cannot sense the Lord's presence in his expression
Our thoughts are not precious stone, our emotions are not precious stone, and our opinions are all the more not precious stone
Together with the pressing work of the outward environment the work of the Holy Spirit will work the Lords image as a precious stone into us
Although we have not experienced sufficient burning, sufficient pressing, and sufficient constituting, we are in this process
The Holy Spirit will bother us stir within us and at the same time will constitute us with Himself so that we will be knit together with Him
The Holy Spirit will bother us today, stir within us tomorrow, operate within us the day after, and burn within us a few days later
He will hit us on the left, press us on the right, and cause us to suffer from some illness or to encounter some other difficulty
One day, without knowing why, our dislike for this person will disappear, and when we see him, we will even think that he is nice and gentle
If we do not listen to these questions and this speaking inside of us an outward environment will come to hit us press us and deal with us
At the time of our salvation, we receive the gold inside of us but not the wall outside of us or the image of the Lord
