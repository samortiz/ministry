   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The opposite of this verse means that if anyone's name is recorded in the book of life, he must be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The judgment at the great white throne is according to certain principles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who perish, perish because of their evil deeds not because of their good deeds , and those who are saved, are saved because their names are written in the book of life not because of their good deeds either .</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Isaiah 65:17 says that God will create a new heaven and a new earth, but that which follows verse 17 concerns the millennial kingdom.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 17 says that God will create a new heaven and a new earth; this is a proclamation.</S>
