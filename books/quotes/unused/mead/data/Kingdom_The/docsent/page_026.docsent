   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE GROWING OF THE SEED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE KINGDOM Scripture Reading: Matt 5:1-2, 3, 8, 10, 20, 45a, 48; 6:10, 33; 7:16-18, 21-23; 19:7-8, 10; 1 Pet 3:4</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In chapter four of Matthew a group of people were attracted to the Lord Jesus, and in chapter five He brought them to a high mountain v. 1 . They had been following Him, but He still needed to get inside of them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The fact that He brought them to a high mountain is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we have important matters to consider, it is sometimes good to get away from everything, to go up to a mountain, where the level is higher.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is what the Lord did with His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There on the high mountain, He showed them the way He could get into them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE SOWING FOR THE SPREADING</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To sow a seed into the earth is easy because the earth has no will of its own.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It has no desires, no concepts, no thoughts, and no ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because the earth is lifeless, it is easy to sow a seed into it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, it is not easy for the Lord Jesus to sow Himself into us because we are not simple; in fact, we are very complicated, with two main problems.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first problem involves our spirit, the deepest part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The second problem concerns our heart, which surrounds our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we read the New Testament carefully, putting the pieces together like a jigsaw puzzle to give us a clear picture, we will see that the heart surrounds the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The spirit is at the center of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our heart is complicated, being composed of the mind the thinking organ, the emotions the loving organ, the will the deciding organ, and the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our spirit hidden within our heart is even called "the hidden man of the heart" 1 Pet 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For Christ to sow Himself into our being, He must first get into our spirit, and from there spread Himself into every part of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this way He will take full possession of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not only will He sow Himself into our spirit, but He will grow into our inward parts our mind, will, emotion, and conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then our whole inward being will be filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>POOR IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because our spirit is a problem, the Lord Jesus told us clearly that we need to be poor in spirit in order to follow Him and to allow Him to sow Himself into us Matt 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be poor in spirit simply means to be empty in spirit to have no preoccupations of any kind in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the Lord Jesus came to the Jewish people, their spirits were filled with many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They had the Holy Word, the temple, the altar, the holy rituals and forms, and the holy priesthood to care for the service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because of their association with these religious things, they thought they knew God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They felt they had been trained from their forefathers to know God, and they had inherited many traditions which were precious to them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Lord Jesus came to them, their spirit was filled with all the doctrines and traditions of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the things they treasured had filled them up so that nothing of the Lord Jesus could get into them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Likewise, a great many Christians today have their spirits filled and preoccupied.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although they may not know what the human spirit is, or even that they have a spirit, nevertheless their spirit is preoccupied.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today's Christians have both the Old and the New Testaments.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many know something about Genesis, Exodus, Psalms, Matthew, John, and Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They know something about justification by faith in Romans and the ten horns in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They know the Bible in the way of letters, but they have little revelation of the spiritual significance because they are filled up in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because they are already full, nothing more of the Lord Jesus can get into them; they are not poor in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To receive the Lord Jesus as the seed we must be poor, empty, and unoccupied in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Of course, to be poor in spirit does not mean we have a poor or weak spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all need to pray, "Lord, have mercy that I may be empty in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Lord, I do want to be poor in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sweep away all the worthless things that I may be unoccupied and empty, ready for You to come in."</S>
