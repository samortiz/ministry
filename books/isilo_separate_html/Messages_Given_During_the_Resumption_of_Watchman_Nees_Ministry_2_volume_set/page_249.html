Being Full of Emotion,<br>Yet Not Living by our Emotion</H2><P>The second thing is the emotion. All spiritual persons are people with strong emotions, but, at the same time, all spiritual persons are those who do not live by their emotions. On the one hand, those who are dull and have no feelings at all cannot be a spiritual person. On the other hand, although a man may have emotion, he cannot live by his emotion. Those of you who do not have emotion have to learn to have emotion; you have to learn to laugh and to weep. Those of you who have emotion have to learn not to live by your emotion. If your exercise turns you into a man of wood or stone, your exercise is not a spiritual one. I am afraid that some among us never wipe their sweat or their tears. Do not think that such a kind of person is spiritual. In church history, every spiritual person is full of emotion. However, on the one hand, we have to be full of emotion; on the other hand, we must not live by our emotion.</P><P>Some sisters are full of emotion. They are attached to children, old folks, and even to small cats and dogs. All year round they are busy. Today they go to this house, and tomorrow they go to another house. If they become attached to you, they will come to your house at least once or twice a week. A few of such ones may be one in their emotions, but they are not one in their minds. This kind of fellowship is the fellowship of the emotion; it is not the fellowship of the spirit. Where are you living today? In your contact with the brothers and sisters, have you dealt thoroughly with the elements of emotion? Perhaps the reason you are in darkness and are not transparent is that you are too much in your emotion. Before God, and in your contact with the believers, you have to learn to live in the spirit. We have to fellowship with the saints in the spirit. We need an emotion, but our emotion has to be broken, and it must be dealt with. It is not right to be without any emotion, and it is also wrong to live by the emotion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Being Strong, Yet Broken in the Will</H2><P>Moreover, our will needs to be dealt with. Some people's will is like the northern Chinese noodles: if you hold them up by one side, the other side flops, and if you hold them up by the other side, this side flops. If you hold them up by the middle, the two sides flop, and if you hold them up by the two sides, the middle flops. They are too weak. This is the way many people's will is. We have to realize that a man whose will is not firm cannot be spiritual. Only those who have a strong will, yet a broken will, can be spiritual, and only they can receive the light.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Keeping Oneself from Touching<br>Right and Wrong</H2><P>Another thing that makes us opaque is the matter of right and wrong. If we want to be delivered from darkness and be a transparent person, we have to keep ourselves from touching any right or wrong. The fruit of the knowledge of good and evil brings in sin, and sin brings in death. One cannot judge anything by its right and wrong. One cannot act according to right and wrong. You have to learn to judge and to act in your spirit. Many things cannot be determined on the ground of right and wrong. If you make judgments based on right and wrong, you yourself will also fall into the same entanglements, and you will end up being in darkness.</P><P>Today our problems are these four things: the mind, the emotion, the will, and the right and wrong. If we are delivered from these things, we will be a spiritual and transparent person. If we reject these things and learn to be a person living in our spirit, we will become a transparent person.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_248.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_250.html">Next</a> </body></html>
