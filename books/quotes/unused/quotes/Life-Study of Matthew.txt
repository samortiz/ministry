In the first section, the Old Testament, God spoke by the prophets, and in the second section, the New Testament, He spoke in the Son
Augustine once said that the New Testament is contained in the Old, and the Old Testament is expressed in the New
When many Christians come to the New Testament, they skip over the first part of chapter one of Matthew and start reading at verse 18
Although the New Testament is a short book, it begins with four biographies of one Person, four books telling us of the life of Christ
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John present different aspects of Christ because each writer was a different kind of person
Following the Acts, we have all the Epistles, which give a full definition of this wonderful, universal, great Man
The divine concept starts with Matthew and proceeds through John; the human thought starts with John and goes back to Matthew
Matthew tells us that Jesus is the proper descendant of the royal family, that He is the legal heir of the royal throne
With anybody else, no matter who he is or how many biographies people write about him, the genealogy will be exactly the same
In this generation we have the mingling of the divine Being with so many human beings, with all kinds of people
The generation of Christ not only includes the highranking people, but also the civilians, the insignificant ones, like Mary and Joseph
The generation of Christ includes all kinds of people: good ones, bad ones, called ones, fallen ones, and recovered ones
According to Jewish custom, a writer of a genealogy would never include a female name; he would include only the names of males
It seems that the divine record here would not mention the good ones, such as Sarah or Rebekah, but the bad ones
The record does not even give her name; it gives only her history in order to remind us of what kind of person she was
If we were to write a biography of Christ and there were no biographies of Him in the Bible, we would not dare to write it this way
We would hide all these impure grandmothers and give the names of the good grandmothers, such as Sarah and Rebekah
The Holy Spirit did not mention Sarah, Rebekah, and all the good ones; however, He purposely included these impure ones
One day the Holy Spirit, typified by Abraham's servant, will bring the spiritual, divine, heavenly Rebekah to her heavenly Isaac
He offered Himself unto death and was resurrected, now He is building God's temple, and in the future He will receive the Bride
The blessing which God promised to Abraham was the Spirit , and the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the Triune God
In the first ten and a half chapters of Genesis God tried to work with the created race, but He did not get through
God gave up the created and fallen race, and He called one, Abraham, out of that race to be the father of another race
Out of a place filled with rebellion and idolatry, a place where everyone was one with Satan, God called a man named Abraham
We would not even have a share in the short book of Galatians, because Galatians was written to the descendants of Abraham
Abraham was called out of Babel, the place of rebellion and idolatry, into the good land, which typifies Christ
The called ones, having been called by God out of the fallen race, put no trust in their own effort; they trust in God's work of grace
It is by faith in God's work of grace that God's called people are justified by Him and participate in Christ, their eternal portion
For Abraham to live and walk by faith meant that he had to reject himself to forget himself to set himself aside and to live by Someone else
If we compare Genesis 11:31 and 12:1 with Acts 7:2-3, we see that when God called Abraham in Ur of the Chaldees, he was very weak
We all must be Abrahams, those who forget their past, give up what they are and have, and put their trust in Christ, their good land
If so, then, as heirs of God's promise, as those who inherit the promise of the Spirit, we shall participate in Christ as God's blessing
At a certain time the Lord asked Abraham to offer Isaac, the one God had given according to His promise, for a burnt offering
Last month or last week you may have experienced Christ in a certain way, but today the Lord says, 'Consecrate that experience
To walk in the presence of the Lord by faith means that we do not hold on to anything, not even to the things given by God
Whatever we do on our own in the church life, even in the preaching of the gospel, will only produce an Ishmael
He waited until their natural energy had died out, until they had come to realize it was impossible for them to bring forth a child
He had to learn the lesson of not living by himself, the lesson of giving up his own effort and not doing anything by himself
We all must experience Christ in such a way; not by our doing, striving, or endeavoring, but simply by trusting in Him
Not all the children of Abraham of the flesh are the children of God; only in Isaac will God have His children
Although we are the race of Abraham today, are we walking in the way of Ishmael, or are we living in the way of Isaac?
If we would have Isaac, we must cast out Ishmael, stop our work, and place ourselves into the very working of God
Even before the twins were born, God had told the mother that the younger would be the first, and the elder would be second
Although he was a descendant of Abraham, according to his striving and his nature, he was altogether a descendant of the Devil
Positionally speaking, Jacob was a descendant of Abraham, but dispositionally speaking, he was a child of the Devil
There was a great deal of suffering in the life of Jacob, but this suffering came from his striving, not from God's election
What a mercy that we have been selected to be associated with Christ and to participate in Him as God's eternal blessing!
In order to fulfill God's desire, Levi forgot his parents, his brothers, and his children and only took care of God's desire
Our birthright is also composed of these three elements: the double portion of Christ, the priesthood, and the kingship
When the Lord Jesus returns, the overcoming saints will be with Him to be priests of God and co-kings of Christ
We have seen that Esau lost his birthright because he was profane and that Reuben lost his birthright because of his defilement
Because Judah gained the kingship portion of the birthright, he brought forth the kingly Christ , Christ the Victor
When this genealogy mentions Isaac and Jacob, it does not say 'and his brother'; only when it mentions Judah does it say 'and his brothers'
Judah and his eleven brothers became the fathers of the twelve tribes which formed the nation of Israel as God's chosen people for Christ
From the lives of all these persons, we can discover certain principles which govern our association with Christ
No matter what we are or where we came from, we can be included in the generation of Christ if we fulfill the principles
The fault was not on her side, but on the side of her father-in-law, Judah, who admitted that she was more righteous than he
Although Tamar may be held responsible to a certain extent, she was righteous, and she had a heart for the birthright
In the past, some young people in China were inspired by my preaching, believed in the Lord Jesus, and desired to be baptized
When they learned that their children were planning to be baptized, they gave them no opportunity to leave home
The significance of this for us today is that if we care for Christ and are seeking Him, any way we can truly gain Him is the right way
He put out his hand, and the midwife marked it with a scarlet thread, indicating that he would be the firstborn
Once they have entered the door, they will look back and see written on the inside, 'Chosen before the foundation of the world'
After we have turned to God and to God's people, we must be joined, built up, and involved with the proper person
If you would have a Salmon and a Boaz you must become involved with the proper believers with the proper leading ones in the leading tribes
We must turn to the Lord, and we must turn to the Lord's people; we must also take care of how we become involved with others
Boaz redeemed his kinsmans inheritance and married the mans widow hence he became a notable forefather of Christ a great associate of Christ
In other words, you should not only take care of your own enjoyment of Christ, but also others' enjoyment of Christ
Some brothers should take care of me, the poor Ruth, but they are selfish in the spiritual enjoyment of Christ
According to Deuteronomy 23:3, the Moabites were forbidden to enter the congregation of the Lord, even to the tenth generation
Not only was she accepted by the Lord, but she became a wonderful person who partook of the enjoyment of Christ
Although, as a Moabitess, Ruth was not allowed to enter the congregation of the Lord, she was seeking God and God's people
You may have been born of a poor origin and have a pitiful background, but do not be bothered or frustrated by that
The eighth day is the first day of the second week; hence, it signifies something new, something of resurrection
We who are chosen and saved are not people of the first week; we are those of the first day of the second week
In this genealogy, only of David does it say 'the king,' because it was through him that the kingdom with the kingship was brought in
If we would have the rich enjoyment of Christ, we shall often need to be the end of one situation and the beginning of another situation
In the church life, we need some Davids, some stronger ones to conclude certain situations and open up other situations
The Bible says that David did right in the eyes of the Lord all the days of his life, except for this one thing
After David committed murder and adultery, he was rebuked by the prophet Nathan, whom God sent purposely to condemn him
Solomon is the result not only of transgression and repentance, but of transgression, repentance, and God's forgiveness
The second was a spiritual marriage, the marriage of David's transgression and repentance with God's forgiveness
The church is always built up by this kind of person, Solomon, the issue of man's transgression and repentance plus God's forgiveness
As we have seen, the building up of God's temple comes from man's transgression and repentance plus God's forgiveness
No matter how hard you may try to do everything right in the eyes of the Lord, sooner or later something will happen
After this repentance, you will have another marriage, the marriage of your transgression and repentance with God's forgiveness
If we spend an hour or two praying over these verses and over the points covered in this message, we shall see something more
We shall be today's Boaz, Ruth, Obed, Jesse, David, and eventually today's Solomon, building up the house of God
The genealogy in Matthew says that the son of David was Solomon, and the genealogy in Luke says that the son of David was Nathan
One genealogy is the line of Mary, the wife's line; the other genealogy is the line of Joseph, the husband's line
Both Mary and Joseph were descendants of David, but they were from two families descended from the same grandfather
Under God's sovereignty Mary and Joseph, descendants of these two families, were betrothed and brought forth Christ
His relationship with Christ was indirect through his descendant Joseph's marriage to Mary, of whom Christ was born
Although Christ was not a direct descendant of Solomon, the Old Testament prophecies concerning Christ were nevertheless fulfilled
Christ needed the kingdom that belonged to the house of David because Christ had to be born as the heir of David's throne
If the whole kingdom had been dissolved, nothing would have remained to allow Christ to be born as David's royal heir
As far as you are concerned, which title has the better meaning-the kingdom of Israel or the kingdom of Judah?
After a certain time, the church was divided, not into two parts, but perhaps into more than two thousand parts
For this reason, none of the kings of the northern kingdom, the larger and more universal kingdom, is included in the genealogy of Christ
Compare this record with 1 Chronicles 3:11 and 12, which say, 'Joram his son, Ahaziah his son, Joash his son, Amaziah his son, Azariah'
Ahab was the king of the northern kingdom, and his wife Jezebel was a wicked woman who was fully related to idols
Exodus 20:5 says that anyone who forsakes God and worships idols corrupts himself and will suffer God's curse for three or four generations
Those who were carried away to Babylon as captives were indirectly related to Christ through their descendant Joseph's marriage with Mary
Jeconiah was not reckoned as a king in this genealogy because he was born during the captivity and was carried away as a captive
According to the prophecy of Jeremiah 22:28-30, none of Jeconiah's descendants would inherit the throne of David
Ezra 5:1 and 2 say that Zerubbabel was one of the leaders who returned to Jerusalem from the captivity at Babylon
Suppose none of the people of Israel had returned to Judah, and the time came for Christ to be born at Bethlehem
You may worship God and you may walk in the spirit in Babylon, but be assured that Christ could never be born into humanity through you
When the time came for the Lord Jesus to be born, some Israelites, descendants of the returned captives, were waiting in Judah
For His second coming, Christ also needs some of His captured people to return from their captivity to the proper church life
Jesus was born of Mary, not of Joseph, since it was prophesied that Christ would be the seed of a woman and born of a virgin
Now we need to examine the chart which shows that the generation of Christ begins from God and continues until it reaches Jesus
After David, it is divided into two lines, the first running from Nathan to Mary and the second from Solomon to Joseph
Eventually, in God's sovereignty, these two lines are brought together by the marriage of Mary to Joseph to bring forth Christ
Although the birth of Jesus fulfilled many prophecies in the Old Testament, He was not the descendant of Jeconiah
Luke mentions the name Jesus because Luke proves that the Lord came to be a man, not to be the Anointed One, the King, the Messiah
He was the one person used by God as a landmark both to conclude the section of the fathers and to begin the section of the kings
At the time of degradation, there was no person as a landmark to divide the generations as did Abraham and David
In Revelation 4:6 we have the four living creatures, and in Revelation 7:1 we have 'the four corners of the earth' and 'the four winds'
Jesus is the Triune God traveling through all the generations and coming forth as the mingling of divinity with humanity
Numbers 33:5-48 shows us that the children of Israel traveled through forty-two stations before they came into Canaan
According to the record of the Old Testament, the Israelites suffered all the way through these forty-two stations
These forty-two months will be the concluding part of the final seven years, the last week mentioned in Daniel 9:24-27
There are seventy weeks: the first seven weeks, then sixty-two weeks, and then the last week, each week representing seven years
The second half of these last seven years, a period of forty-two months, will be the great tribulation, and it will be awful
After all the generations of trials, temptations, and sufferings, Christ came as the forty-second generation to be our rest and satisfaction
If we read the history in Chronicles, we shall discover that the generations from Abraham to Christ were actually forty-five generations
We need to see that the record of Matthew is not a record according to history, but a record according to doctrine
The record of John, on the contrary, is according to history, for John wrote his Gospel according to the events of history
According to history, it was forty-five generations, but according to Matthew's doctrinal purpose, it was forty-two generations
Three generations were omitted because they were not qualified, and a fourth generation was disqualified and cut off
When Christ comes, light, life, salvation, satisfaction, healing, freedom, rest, comfort, peace, and joy all come with Him
By His sovereignty, God brought Joseph and Mary together in marriage to bring forth Christ to be the legal heir to the throne of David
Zerubbabel, a leader of the tribe of Judah and a descendant of the royal family, led the captives from Babylon to Jerusalem
If they had lived far away from each other, it would have been difficult for them to come together in marriage
Our surrender means little; it simply affords the opportunity for the Holy Spirit's power to come into us and accomplish something
Christ came not only to fulfill the law, but also to fulfill the promise that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent
When man fell, the poison of Satan was injected into his body, and the body was corrupted and became the flesh
The other verse is John 3:14: 'As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up'
The Lord told him that as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must He Himself be lifted up on the cross
As was the case with the brass serpent in the wilderness, there was no poison in Him because He was not born of a fallen man
Now we must clearly differentiate two points: Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit and He was born of a virgin
Through the virgin Mary as a means, He put on flesh and blood, the human nature, taking 'the likeness of the flesh,' 'the likeness of men'
You have heard that Jesus is God and that He took the form of a man, but not that He also took the form of a serpent
When you call on Jesus, the whole universe realizes that you are calling on Jehovah as your Savior, Jehovah as your salvation
In Matthew 18:20 Jesus said that whenever two or three are gathered together in His name, He will be with them
If you have some unseemly pictures or photos on your walls and you call on Jesus, He will be your King and say, 'Get rid of that'!
When no one else can control you-neither our parents, your husband, your wife, or your children-the King of kings will do something
The Christ in Matthew is the Savior-King and the King-Savior who sets up the kingdom of the heavens within us and over us
We have spent considerable time on the names of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and even on the names of Tamar and Rahab
Although the last part of Matthew 1 seems to deal with the birth of Christ, it actually deals with the names of Jesus and Emmanuel
He saves us from the evil power of Satan, from all our besetting sins in our daily life, and from every bondage and addiction
Whether you hate Jesus or love Him, whether you are for Him or against Him, you realize that the name of Jesus is a special name
We should not only say that we believe in the Lord Jesus, but also declare that we believe in the name of Jesus
Romans 6:3 says that many of us have been baptized into Christ Jesus, and Galatians 3:27 says, 'As many as were baptized into Christ'
When we believe in the name of Jesus and are put into the name of Jesus, we are placed into a living Person, that is, in the Holy Spirit
Help them to open up their being, their heart and their spirit, from deep within and to use their mouths to call upon the name of Jesus
If you help new believers to call on the name of Jesus in this way, the door will be open wide for the Spirit to enter in
After the Lord Jesus told us to pray in His name, He proceeded to say that the Spirit will come to dwell in us
Although we may meet for the purpose of having the life-study, we do not gather into the life-study, but into the name of Jesus
Whenever you come to a Christian meeting, you must realize that you are being gathered once again into the name
We can all testify that after every meeting we have had the sense deep within that we have entered further into the Lord
Preaching in the Lord's name must be done in the Spirit, for the Spirit is the Person of the Lord and the reality of His name
Through all the things that can be done in the name of Jesus, we see that whatever we do and whatever we are must be in the name of Jesus
His name is a sweet name, a rich name, a powerful name, a saving name, a healing name, a comforting name, and an available name
One night, as we were preaching on a street corner, a man about thirty years of age was very bold to scoff at the name of Jesus
When the man asked the brother who it was who hated Jesus, the brother answered, 'It is the Devil within you who hates Jesus'
We should also feel glorious whenever we speak to others about Jesus, but often we do not have a glorious feeling
The Pharisees warned Peter and John not to preach in the name of Jesus, not to do anything or say anything in His name
Jesus is the way and the truth, but when we experience Him as the way and the truth we say, 'This way and this truth are just God with me'
When we call on the name of Jesus, we receive the Spirit, who is the Person, the reality, and the realization of Jesus
We have all been under the influence of tradition, thinking that we must fast and pray before we can receive the Spirit
The enemy Satan with all his army will do everything He can to take over this land of Emmanuel that is to take over our spirit and our being
Luke also records that Jesus grew physically, that He became strong in His spirit, and that He found favor with God and man
Matthew 1 tells us that the Old Testament contained prophecies concerning Christ and that the people of God were waiting for His coming
Because the wise men were misled, they caused a serious problem and nearly caused the young child Jesus to be killed
If it had not been for the sovereignty of God, the young Jesus would have been killed as a result of their mistake
Many times you have the vision, but when you consider the matter in your mind, you are distracted and misled by your natural concept
If you had been a priest among those priests, would you not have gone with the wise men to see if Jesus had actually been born in Bethlehem?
They had knowledge and they could tell people that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem; yet, none of them went for themselves
The Bible does say that Christ will be born in Bethlehem, but it does not say where, on what street, or in which house
The living star led the wise men to the city of Bethlehem and also to the exact street and the house where the child was
Because He was burdened to see what people were doing in His Father's house, the temple, He stayed in Jerusalem after the feast
The wise men found the kingly child Jesus in Bethlehem, which Micah 5:2 tells us is 'little among the thousands of Judah'
Due to the vision that came through the star, the wise men paid their full respect to the kingly child, not caring about the place
It may be that these precious treasures offered by the magi provided for the Lord's trip from Judea to Egypt and from Egypt to Nazareth
Those who turn others to righteousness, who turn them from the wrong way to the right way, will shine like stars
Without the trouble that occurred after Jesus was found in Bethlehem, there would have been no occasion for Him to flee to Egypt
The mistake of the magi aroused the hatred and jealousy of King Herod, who was angered that a kingly child had been born
It means that when Jesus was born into the human race, He appeared in a way that was somewhat hidden, in a way that was not open or evident
Philip went to Nathanael and told him that he had met the Messiah and that He was the son of Joseph, a man of Nazareth
We should never make a display of ourselves; neither should we ever know others according to the outward appearance
In the lifestudy of Genesis we saw that the birthright included three items the double portion of the land the priesthood and the kingship
As a result, the double portion of the land went to Joseph, the priesthood, to Levi, and the kingship, to Judah
The main function of the priesthood is to bring the people to God, and the main function of the kingship is to bring God to the people
Through the priesthood you will be authorized and anointed, and then you will come out of God's presence to be a king
Through John's ministry of repentance and Jesus' ministry of imparting life, we have all been made priests and kings
After you bring others to God, immediately, in a sense, you will become Christ bringing God to them so that they may gain God
The wilderness here indicates that the new way of God's New Testament economy is contrary to religion and culture
John fulfilled his ministry by living in a way that was absolutely contrary to religion and culture and outside both of them
Verse 4 says Now John himself had his garment of camels hair and a leather girdle about his loins and his food was locusts and wild honey
His intention was to introduce God's New Testament economy, which is constituted solely of Christ and the Spirit of Life
When anyone conducted himself as a priest, everyone thought of him as a religious person, a person in religion
Of staying in the priestly building, he went out to the wilderness, to a wild place where there was neither religion nor culture
From the time of John the Baptist until today, a great many people have been brought back to God through the ministry of John
He left Jerusalem and went out to the wilderness where there was neither religion nor culture, but where everything was natural
John ministered there in the wilderness bringing others to God and introducing the King, the One who represents God, to them
When this King was introduced to people and they were truly brought back to God, the kingdom was present immediately
We must all be in the wilderness, in an environment that is 'wild,' not in an environment that is religious or cultured
For this reason, verse 5 says, 'Then Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the district of the Jordan went out to him'
We have seen that the place of recommendation was neither in the holy city nor in the holy temple, but in the wilderness
If you trace the history of the past few centuries, you will see that every prevailing revival took place in some kind of 'wilderness'
When John Wesley and George Whitefield were raised up as evangelists two centuries ago they mainly did their preaching on the street corners
At that time, the Church of England had regulations forbidding the expounding of the Holy Word outside the 'sanctuary'
Lord take us into the wilderness and show us how to be genuine priests to bring others to You and how to introduce You to them as their King
As we consider the Gospel of Matthew, we must be thoroughly and deeply impressed that we are now in the kingdom
We must look into this book from the angle of the kingdom, viewing every chapter and even every verse from the perspective of the kingdom
Although you may not feel that you are sinful, as long as you are not in the kingdom, you are a rebellious one
On the one hand, this priesthood brings us to God; on the other hand, it recommends the heavenly King who brings God to us
When the priesthood brings people to God and the kingship brings God to the people, there is the heavenly reign, the heavenly rule
They will maintain God's kingdom on earth so that the King may gain the people and that the people may gain the King
One day we heard the preaching of the gospel telling us to repent, to have a turn in our thinking, philosophy, and logic
The kingdom of the heavens, according to the context of the entire Gospel of Matthew, is different from the Messianic kingdom
If there had been no police force, government, or law courts to tell us what to do, we would have done whatever we liked
The kingdom of the heavens is the kingdom of God in the third heaven where He exercises His authority over everything created by Him
Even after his appearance, during his preaching, the kingdom of the heavens was still not there; it had only drawn near
At the time the Lord started His ministry and even at the time He sent His disciples to preach the kingdom of the heavens had still not come
In his message, John the Baptist told the people to repent for the kingdom of the heavens, which, at that time, was on the way
Today anyone who has a change in his philosophy and comes back to God will immediately be in the kingdom of the heavens
Many times the ruling of the King within us makes it unnecessary for us to be ruled by the policemen or by the law court
There is no doubt that as he grew from infancy to adulthood, to the age of thirty, he was continually immersed in the Holy Spirit
The fact that John turned many of the Israelites to the Lord indicates that the nation of Israel had turned away from God
Even those priests who served God in the temple by lighting the lamps and burning the incense had turned from God and were far away from Him
Both the Pharisees and the Sadducees were denounced by John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus as a brood of vipers
Can you believe that the children of Israel, the descendants of Abraham, the called one, could have become so evil?
Because the age had changed, it was no longer a matter of the natural birth, but of the second birth, the spiritual birth
Praise the Lord that on the day of our repentance we believed in the Lord Jesus, and God made us His living children
Through Johns word here we see that God was prepared to forsake this brood of vipers His chosen people of old and to pursue another people
The baptism in fire by the Lord, according to the judgment at the great white throne , will conclude the kingdom of the heavens
The fire in verse 11 must also denote the lake of fire, for it is a further explanation of the fire spoken of in the preceding verse
The fire that is spoken of in verses 10 through 12 refers in every case to the same fire, the fire of the lake of fire
John seemed to be saying to the Jewish leaders, 'You Pharisees and Sadducees may be able to deceive me, but you cannot deceive Him
Chaff here refers to the unrepentant Jews, whereas the tares in chapter thirteen refer to the nominal Christians
Whether they participate in the baptism in the Spirit or suffer the baptism in fire depends on whether or not they repent
According to the New Testament, to immerse someone in water firstly meant to bury him, and secondly it meant to raise him up
Those whom John terminated in baptism were to be resurrected, not in him, but in the One who was to come after him
To be brought into the presence of God is both wonderful and serious, for it means that we shall either be terminated or killed
The fact that John paved the way and straightened the paths means that His ministry dealt with the mind and the heart
It is not easy to see why Jesus came not from Bethlehem but from Galilee and not to Jerusalem but to the Jordan
We also need to see why He came to John who was a wild person not to the high priest who would have been a cultured and religious person
Do not try to come from a place of honor and warm welcome, but come from a place that is despised and rejected by religion and culture
Even if the president of a nation took the way of the church, he would also have to be one coming from Galilee to the Jordan
The children of Israel traveled through the wilderness for about forty years, and eventually they were all buried in the Jordan River
The Jordan terminated them, ended their history of wandering in the wilderness, and terminated the age of wandering
It was the Jordan that brought the children of Israel out of the wilderness and into the good land, which is Christ
In the church life our way today is the way from Galilee to the Jordan, the way from rejection to termination and resurrection
Sometimes the sisters say, 'Brother Lee, the church life is wonderful, but it is often difficult for us sisters
Those who have been in the church for ten years can testify that every part of their being has been terminated
Because they have not been terminated, some Christian teachers say that the kingdom has been suspended until some future time
After you have been terminated on the way from Galilee to the Jordan, both the King and the kingdom will be present
Of the four Gospels only John's does not give a record of the Lord being baptized, because he testifies that the Lord is God
Although every Christian likes to be sanctified, no one likes to be baptized in the sense of being terminated and buried
John did not understand very well, He wondered how Jesus could be baptized by him, and he thought that he should have been baptized by Jesus
Although he had been soaked in the Holy Spirit for more than thirty years, some natural element still remained
By being baptized He lived and ministered in resurrection even before His actual death and resurrection three and a half years later
In the eyes of God and according to the Lord's realization, He was put to death three and a half years before His crucifixion
Through baptism the Lord Jesus entered into the gateway of righteousness, and then He walked continually along the pathway of righteousness
While the descending of the Spirit was the anointing of Christ, the speaking of the Father was a testimony to Him as the beloved Son
Is a picture of the divine Trinity the Son went up from the water the Spirit descended upon the Son and the Father spoke concerning the Son
He did not go to the wilderness on His own; He was led there by the very Holy Spirit who had descended upon Him
After being baptized in water and anointed with the Spirit of God, Jesus, as a man, moved according to the leading of the Spirit
The newly anointed King was led by the Spirit to fast such a period of time that He might enter into His kingly ministry
Our relatives and in-laws, especially those of the older generation, are always concerned about how we shall make our living
A number of times my in-laws even sent their little daughter to sneak into our kitchen to see if we had food to eat
To this proposal the Lord replied, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God'
Many of us can testify that, when we first began to take the way of the church, our wives said, 'What about our future?
Realizing that this way is narrow, they were concerned about what would happen to their living if they went this way
On the one hand, we did not have very much physical food to eat, but on the other hand, we did feast on the rich Word
We shall be tested to show to the whole universe that our concern is not for physical food, but for spiritual food
During those days in the wilderness, Jesus was not concerned for His physical food, but for His spiritual food
Satan seemed to be saying, 'We heard the declaration made forty days ago by God the Father that You are the beloved Son
For Him to accomplish His ministry for the kingdom of the heavens, He had to defeat God's enemy, the Devil, Satan
He answered with the Word of the Scriptures, 'Man,' indicating that He stood in the position of man to deal with the enemy
The reason the evil spirits do not want anyone to believe that Christ is the Son of God is that anyone who does so will be saved
The newly anointed King confronted the enemy's temptation not by His own word, but by the word of the Scriptures, quoting Deuteronomy 8:3
In this temptation, all the words quoted from Deuteronomy by the Lord were logos, the constant word in the Scriptures
According to the human concept, any religion that does not have miracles is powerless; the most powerful religion is a religion of miracles
Satan brought the new King to the wing of the temple and tempted Him to leap down from it by saying that the angels would protect Him
Sometimes we are tested when there is a need to do something, and at other times we are tested when there is no need
Doesn't the Bible say that Jesus heals, that He is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and that we must pray for others?
Convinced that the Lord was with him, he asked the Lord to give him two hundred thousand dollars within a certain number of days
Everyone else must walk down from the wing of the temple but you a supernatural person one who is more powerful than others can leap down
The temptations of the subtle one always come in this way: firstly, in human living; secondly, in religion; and thirdly, in worldly glory
Luke 4:6 says that the kingdoms of the world and their glory were delivered unto the Devil; hence, to whomever he wills he gives them
Whenever you are tempted in this manner, you must realize that behind this temptation is the tempter seeking to gain your worship
Satan told the Lord Jesus that if He would worship him, he would give Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory
Suppose some brothers who came into the church life four years later than you become leaders and you feel that you have been passed by
If you complain about this, asking why they have been made leaders and you have not, this is a proof that you are seeking worldly glory
If they question why those three were appointed, this indicates that they are seeking vain glory, the glory of this age
If this desire for ambition and position can wedge even into the church life, then how much we need to be on guard in other things!
He is not only God's enemy outside God's kingdom, but also the adversary within God's kingdom, rebelling against God
The new King rebuked the Devil's presentation and defeated him by standing on the ground of man to worship and serve God only
The Devil's temptation of the first man, Adam, was a success; his temptation of the second man, Christ, was an absolute failure
Not only the King but also all the kingdom people must overcome the matters of their daily living, religious power, and worldly glory
Instead of caring for religious power, we should be weak, just as Jesus Christ was weak when He was arrested and crucified
Many devilish people challenged Paul, saying, 'If you are the true apostle of Christ, you must do something to prove it'
Due to the peoples rejection of John the Lord Jesus withdrew into Galilee to begin His ministry far away from the holy temple and holy city
According to the human concept, Jesus should have begun to minister from the holy temple in the holy city, Jerusalem
The old economy had resulted in an outward religion, an outward temple, an outward city, and an outward system of worship
Because Jerusalem had rejected the recommender of the new King, the Lord Jesus knew that He should not begin His ministry there
Even the King of the heavenly kingdom, the Son of God anointed with the Holy Spirit, moved according to the environmental indicators
According to history, as the anointed King, He should have gone to the capital, Jerusalem, for Jerusalem is the proper place for the King
He did not even go south to Hebron, the place where David was enthroned, nor to Beersheba, the place where Abraham lived
By considering the Lord's move after the imprisonment of John the Baptist, we must learn not to try to be supernaturally spiritual
Jesus did not move purely according to the spiritual leading, nor did He move according to past history or the natural concept
The other extreme is to pay too much attention to history and to the natural inclination and natural understanding
In John chapter three we see that the disciples of John the Baptist were in competition with the ministry of the new King
The new King began His ministry in Galilee, even at the Sea of Galilee, not in the holy city or in the holy temple
His forerunner ministered by the riverside, in the wilderness, but He began His ministry by the Sea of Galilee
John the Baptist ministered by the riverside because he was prepared to bury everyone who came to him in repentance
The four disciples mentioned in Matthew 4 had been terminated, germinated, and saved by the riverside of Jordan in John chapter one
When John declared that Christ was the Lamb of God, two of his disciples, Andrew and the Apostle John, followed the Lord Jesus
Eventually, as we have seen, both Andrew's brother, Peter, and John's brother, James, were also brought to the Lord and saved
Verse 16 says The people sitting in darkness saw a great light and to those sitting in a region and shadow of death to them light sprang up
Peter, Andrew, James, and John did not realize that they were in darkness as they were working there by the Sea of Galilee to make a living
Without knowing it, by going to the Sea of Galilee to earn a living, they entered into darkness and into the shadow of death
He came to the Sea of Galilee, and He is still coming to the Sea of Galilee today, walking about the seashore seeking to catch us
You were saved at the riverside by the Lamb of God, but you were called by the Sea of Galilee by the shining of a great light
Praise the Lord that so many of us have had the experiences at two places-by the riverside and by the seashore!
Peter Andrew James and John were attracted and captured at the seashore not by seeing what the Lord did but by realizing what the Lord was
Verse 17 says, 'From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near'
His forerunner's ministry began by the riverside and consisted of burying the religious ones and terminating their religion
Andrew, one of the two disciples of John the Baptist, had brought Peter to the Lord, in the place where John preached, prior to this
Eventually, Peter became the first great fisher for the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens on the day of Pentecost
Of following these two extremes, we should walk in the footsteps of the Lord Jesus who traveled, taught, preached, and healed
To understand the kingdom of the heavens we all must be unloaded of the traditional concepts we received from our background in Christianity
None of the teachings regarding the kingdom of the heavens received in our background was according to the pure Word
We have the full assurance that what we have seen in the Bible concerning the kingdom of the heavens is accurate
The kingdom people are those who perform righteous deeds and who have the proper attitude concerning material riches
Finally, in the last section of this constitution we see the ground, the base, of the daily life and work of the kingdom people
All these aspects of the kingdom people are covered in the seven sections of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens
Matthew 5:1 says, 'And seeing the crowds, He went up into the mountain; and when He sat down His disciples came to Him'
Throughout history, there has been a great debate concerning to whom this decree was given, to the Jews, the Gentiles, or the believers
According to our study, we have come to see that it was given neither to the Jews nor to the Gentiles but to the New Testament believers
There is no doubt that the disciples were the Jewish believers at the time the decree of the constitution was given
The English word blessed does not adequately translate the Greek word here for the Greek word conveys the meanings of both blessed and happy
We need to be poor, emptied, unloaded, in this part of our being so that we may realize and possess the kingdom of the heavens
Although the mind and spirit of the Greeks are loaded, according to my experience with them, it is rather easy for the Greeks to be unloaded
According to Matthew, there are three aspects concerning the kingdom of the heavens: the reality, the appearance, and the manifestation
According to the teaching of the four Gospels, there is a crucial difference between the kingdom of the heavens and the kingdom of God
Between eternity past and eternity future we have the paradise of Adam, the patriarchs, the nation of Israel, the church, and the millennium
Everything from the paradise of Adam to the New Jerusalem is included in the kingdom of God which extends from eternity to eternity
Although the kingdom of the heavens may be called the kingdom of God, the kingdom of God cannot be called the kingdom of the heavens
Although the kingdom of God was there already, John the Baptist said, 'Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near'
On the one hand, the kingdom of God was there; on the other hand, the kingdom of the heavens was not yet there
Immediately after receiving the heavenly King, we are in the church, where the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is
If we are overcomers, at His coming back the Lord will bring us into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
There are some very poor translations of verse 3, such as, 'Happy are the humble minded,' and 'Blessed are the humble in heart'
If we do not know our spirit, we are through with the kingdom of the heavens because the kingdom of the heavens is related to our spirit
As the Lord Jesus was speaking there on the mountain, He knew the actual situation of His audience, an audience composed of Galileans
If even such a woman of low class was filled with religious concepts, certainly the Galilean fishermen were filled also
During the time the Lord Jesus was on earth, all the people, whether they were Jews or Romans or Greeks, were filled up
The Jews were filled with their traditional religious concepts, with their scriptural knowledge, and with the teachings of the law
They knew about the altar the sacrifices the festivals the ordinances and the regulations all of which they considered outward blessings
When the Pharisees asked the Lord Jesus when the kingdom of God would come, He replied, 'Behold, the kingdom of God is among you'
The fact that they returned to the Sea of Galilee to fish and to mend the nets proves that they had been defeated
After winning the battle against Satan, the new King came to the Sea of Galilee, much to the surprise of Peter, Andrew, James, and John
As we saw in message twelve, the first time these four disciples were brought to the Lord, they saw Him as the Lamb of God
As soon as someone has repented, the proper preacher of the gospel will ask him to pray and to call on the name of the Lord
Now we must also see that whenever we say that the Lord Jesus is with our spirit, it means that the kingdom is with our spirit
It is to open up from the depths of our being and to be unloaded of all other things so that the Lord Jesus may be able to enter our spirit
Although you may have made an about-face in your life and you may now be standing face to face with the Lord, what about your spirit?
The Greeks may be filled with the philosophy of Plato, the Chinese with the teachings of Confucius, and the Jews with the teachings of Moses
You must open up from the depths of your being and cast out all the concepts, opinions, and thoughts that have been filling you
Now we should understand the meaning of verse 3: 'Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens'
We need to change the pronoun and say, 'Blessed are the poor in spirit, for ours is the kingdom of the heavens'
If, while we are under this rule, we look at the environment and the situation of today's world, we shall sigh and mourn
If we mourn according to God and His economy, we shall be comforted by being rewarded with the kingdom of the heavens
Revelation 11:15 says, 'The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever'
The human way is to obtain the land by fighting for it, but the way of the kingdom of the heavens is to gain it by being meek
In verse 6 the Lord said, 'Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied'
On the one hand, the kingdom of the heavens is ours; on the other hand, we shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens
We need to hunger and thirst for this righteousness, to seek after such righteousness, that we may enter into the kingdom of the heavens
If we hunger and thirst for righteousness, God will grant us to be satisfied with the very righteousness we seek
The righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees was rather low because it was the righteousness according to the law
By this one example we see that our righteousness must be on a higher level than the righteousness of the Pharisees
It is the surpassing righteousness, the righteousness on the highest plane, that can only be attained by Christ
To be righteous is to give one what he deserves, whereas to be merciful is to give someone better than he deserves
If you are always successful in your pursuit of holiness and perfection, you will have no sympathy toward others when they fail
To be righteous is to deal with ourselves, to be merciful is to deal with others, and to be pure in heart is to deal with God
We gain this reward by being strict, righteous, with ourselves, by being merciful toward others, and by being pure in heart toward God
To be pure in heart is to be single in purpose, to have the single goal of accomplishing God's will for God's glory
Our spirit is the organ to receive Christ , whereas our heart is the ground where Christ as the seed of life grows
As those born of Him, if we would be the peacemakers, we must behave in His divine life, according to His divine nature
Verse 10 says, 'Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens'
In verse 11 the new King said Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you and say every evil thing against you lying for My sake
In the constitution of the heavenly kingdom, the Lord Jesus firstly reveals the kind of people who live in the kingdom of the heavens
If you read these verses carefully, you will see that righteousness here is not merely a matter of outward behavior
If we are not poor in our spirit, we do not have the capacity for the King to come in to establish His kingdom within our being
If we do not have the heavenly kingdom established within us, we cannot realize how negative and pitiful the whole world is
If her heart and her interests are not for the Lord, and she does not care for the Lord's kingdom, her situation is pitiful
The merchants care only for money, the students care only for their education, and the working people care only for promotions and positions
If you are not yet meek with your wife, it reveals that you have not been possessed by the kingdom of the heavens
If you have been fully occupied within by the heavenly kingdom, you will mourn for your wife and be meek with her
The New Testament tells us that we do not fight against flesh and blood, but against the Devil, against the enemy of God
We need to be so meek that, even if a persecutor hits us on the right cheek, we would turn to him the left cheek
We must be right with our parents, our husband or wife, our children, our in-laws, our relatives, and our neighbors
Although we must be strict with ourselves in righteousness, we must learn to be merciful to others and not to place demands on them
Other brothers may be unhappy about being required to wash dishes; therefore, they may not clean them thoroughly
Sometimes a leader may warn a sloppy one about his dishwashing, saying, 'This is your first warning about the way you wash the dishes
When you are righteous, you must be absolutely righteous; and when you are merciful, you must be very merciful
According to the sequence of the blessings in Matthew 5, being pure in heart comes after the showing of mercy to others
If you are not righteous with yourself and merciful to others, you will find it difficult to be pure in heart toward God
In order to be pure in heart toward God, you must be strict in dealing with yourself and merciful in dealing with others
Throughout the years, we have learned the lesson of being strict with ourselves and of not making excuses for ourselves
All the sons of men fight against one another but the sons of God like their heavenly Father are peaceful and always make peace with others
If we stay in righteousness, we are in the kingdom because the kingdom is absolutely a matter of righteousness
The entire world, whether it is the political, religious, educational, commercial, or industrial world, is against Christ
If the kingdom people did not have the nature described in 5:3-12, they could not have any influence on the world
If we the kingdom people the church people are poor in our spirit the kingdom of the heavens will have room within the depths of our being
In verse 13 the Lord said, 'You are the salt of the earth,' and in verse 14 He said, 'You are the light of the world'
All individualistic spirituality is a cancer that absorbs into itself the nourishment intended for the whole Body
Cancer is not caused by germs; it is caused by cells in the body that separate from the body and care only for themselves
When we say that we are salt, it means that we exercise our influence over the earth created by God to keep it in its original condition
Any medical doctor can tell you that salt kills germs, eliminates rottenness, and preserves things in their original condition
Through its killing and preserving function, salt brings the earth back to its original condition or keeps it in its original condition
To the corrupted earth, the people of the kingdom of the heavens are the element that keeps the earth from being fully corrupted
The fact that Lot's wife became a pillar of salt is a strong warning to us not to lose the distinction between us and the world
Because we have lost our taste, we no longer have the salting ability and we cannot fulfill our salting function
If we are poor in spirit, mourning, meek, righteous, merciful, and pure in seeking God, we shall have a salting function
The kingdom mentioned in Matthew 5, 6, and 7 is that aspect of the church concerned with discipline and exercise
The church is the aspect of grace and life for the kingdom, and the kingdom is the aspect of discipline and exercise for the church
The Lord's word in these chapters regarding the kingdom actually refers to the exercise and discipline in the church
We know that this decree is for a corporate people, because the light is not an individual person, but a builded city
If the saints in the church in your locality are not built up, but are scattered, divided, and separated, there is no city there
As long as there is no city, there is no light, because the light is the city; the light is not an individual believer
The local church, which is the lampstand, is likened by the Lord to a builded city set on the top of a mountain
Verse 15 says, 'Neither do men light a lamp and place it under the bushel, but on the lampstand, and it shines to all who are in the house'
According to the context, the main point is that the shining of the light has two aspects: the outward aspect and the inward aspect
The light as a city on a mountain shines over the outsiders whereas the lighted lamp on the lampstand shines over those who are in the house
As the light on the mountain, the light cannot be hidden; and as the lamp on the lampstand, the light should not be hidden
The kingdom people as the lighted lamp should not be covered by the bushel, an item pertaining to eating, a matter which causes anxiety
In ancient times a bushel, as a measure for grain, was something related to eating and therefore related to the matter of making a living
The church also needs to exert another kind of influence, the influence of the inner shining that gets into people
The city on the mount signifies the shining from outside, and the lamp in the house signifies the shining from inside
The kingdom people, the hallelujah people, those not covered by the bushel, care only to talk about Christ and the church
Verse 16 says, 'Thus let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father Who is in the heavens'
The title Father proves that the disciples, who were the new King's audience, were regenerated children of God
The good works here are the behavior of the kingdom people through which men may see God and be brought to Him
Our whole being-our mind, spirit, heart, emotion, will, desire, and attitude-needs to be exercised for the kingdom life
Eventually, those who are qualified by having all these virtues will be not only persecuted for righteousness, but reproached for Christ
When the people are weak in fulfilling the law, there is the need for the prophets to come in to strengthen them to keep the law
No matter how angry you were with someone, as long as you did not murder, you would not be condemned by Moses' law
Christ's keeping of the law qualified Him to fulfill the requirement of the law through His substitutionary death on the cross
By the resurrection life within us we are able to be kept not only from murdering others but even from being angry with them or hating them
It says that in the beginning was the Word and the Word was God, and that the Word became flesh, full of grace and reality
Matthew gives us the highest requirements of the kingdom, requirements that can be fulfilled only by the divine life revealed in John
Now that the requirement has been so greatly uplifted, it is no longer the old law, but the new law of the kingdom of the heavens
After the millennial kingdom, the old heaven and old earth will pass away and the new heaven and new earth come in
The fulfillment of the law will last until the end of the millennium, at which time the heavens and the earth will pass away
What is covered by the prophets goes farther than the millennium, reaching into the new heaven and the new earth
Today we are not trying to keep the lower law; rather, we are keeping the uplifted, higher law through the highest life that is in us
In other words Christ seemed to be saying If you would be great in the kingdom of the heavens you must have the highest standard of morality
If your standard of morality does not reach the standard of the new law, you will be the least in the kingdom of the heavens'
Because the standard of the kingdom is higher than the standard of morality, we must do more than keep the standard of the old law
According to the standard of the kingdom of the heavens, we should not be angry with our brother or look at a woman to lust after her
The standard of the kingdom tells us to love our enemies, to pray for those who persecute us, and not to resist one who is evil
The crucial point that Christ is stressing in these verses is that the kingdom people must have the highest standard of morality
The surpassing righteousness is the condition of entering into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the millennium
To enter into the kingdom of the heavens means to live in its reality today and to participate in its manifestation in the future
Verse 21 says, 'You have heard that it was said to the ancients, You shall not murder, and whoever murders shall be liable to the judgment'
The law of the old dispensation deals with the act of murder, but the new law of the kingdom deals with anger, the motive of murder
These three kinds of judgment were mentioned by the new King, using figures of the Jewish background, because all His audience was Jewish
It was a deep and narrow valley near Jerusalem, the refuse-place of the city, where the bodies of criminals and all kinds of filth were cast
The altar spoken of in verse 23 was a piece of furniture in the outer court of the temple , on which all sacrifices and gifts were offered
The Roman quadrans spoken of in verse 26 is a small brass coin equal to a quarter of an assarion, which is equal to one cent
In both of these verses the Lord said, 'It is better for you that one of your members perish and not your whole body be cast into Gehenna'
Eventually he discovered that, although his hand had been cut off, there was still within him an inner hand desiring to gamble
As a saved one, if you are not serious in dealing with this kind of sin, you will some day be hurt by the second death
As we have seen, the three kinds of judgment spoken of in verse 22 all refer to the judgment of Christ at His judgment seat
The believers will be judged there, not for the matter of salvation or perdition, but for reward or punishment
The Lord's intention here is to make us sober so that we would put away not only the action, but also the motive of this kind of sin
In the New Testament economy, God deals with His people today, not according to the law, but according to faith
Although our contact with God is not based upon the principle of the law, we must still observe the uplifted commandments of the law
Based upon what you have said about not abolishing the commandments of the law, we tell you that you must keep the Sabbath'
In the Old Testament, the age of shadows, there was the need for the sacrifices, the feasts, and the keeping of the Sabbath
Because the commandment to keep the Sabbath is a ritual commandment, not a moral commandment, we are not obligated to keep it today
The law given on Mount Sinai thus became the principle according to which God dealt with the children of Israel
If you read these books, you will see that God deals with the believers in Christ not according to the law, but according to faith
To say that the principle of the law has been abolished does not mean that these commandments have been abolished
Because the Old Testament commandments regarding murder and adultery were not adequate, the Lord complemented them
The Lord complemented the old law concerning murder by saying that anyone who was angry with his brother would be liable to judgment
Never think that we are free to be loose, sloppy, or even immoral just because we are not saved through the keeping of the law
Although we may not kill our brother, if we even call him a fool or a rebel, we shall find ourselves in serious trouble
No matter how much you irritate, insult, or offend a stone, it will never react, because it does not have any temper
In order to live up to a moral standard higher than that of the old law, you must overcome your temper and your lusts
After we have been saved according to the principle of faith, we need to live a higher life, a life with the highest standard
Many are not warned that they will be caused much trouble by being angry and contemning or condemning others or by giving in to their lusts
A saved person will never perish, and no one who is lost will be qualified to appear before the judgment seat of Christ
We Christians, saved according to the principle of faith, will not be judged at the white throne spoken of in Revelation 20
Rather, we shall be judged at the judgment seat of Christ a thousand years before the judgment at the white throne
The judgment at the judgment seat of Christ will be for believers concerning whether they will be rewarded or punished
Were you ever told that you must live a life that never loses its temper or that does not look at a woman to lust?
The higher law, the law of the kingdom of the heavens, not only touches the outward acts, but also the inward motives
The Bible says clearly that after we have been saved according to the principle of faith we must fulfill all the requirements of the new law
The law is no longer the principle according to which we are saved, but it is a standard of morality that we are required to keep
The principle of the law has been abolished, but the morality required by the commandments of the law remains and has been uplifted
When some Christian teachers hear this, they may say, 'It is heresy to teach that saved ones will be burned in the fire'
Corinthians 3:15 says, 'If anyone's work shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss; but he shall be saved, yet so as through fire'
The believers are likened to earth which may grow vegetation approved by God or produce thorns and thistles that will be burned
The Bible reveals that we are saved for eternity, but that after we are saved, we need to overcome every sinful thing
Day and night we must stay with the Lord Jesus in our spirit, looking to Him, contacting Him, and trusting in Him
Romans 8:4 says that when we walk according to the spirit, we spontaneously fulfill all the righteous requirements of the law
We can tell others that the principle of the law is over, but that the commandments of the law remain and have been uplifted
Although we are not able to meet the standard of these higher requirements, we have the resurrection life in our spirit
When we walk according to the spirit, we spontaneously fulfill all the requirements of the law and have the highest standard of morality
In verses 21 through 30 the Lord covered two laws that were complemented, the law regarding murder and the law regarding adultery
The four laws in this section, the laws regarding divorce, swearing, resisting evil, and loving our enemies, have all been changed
You should not take advantage of this as an excuse to remarry simply because an act of fornication has been committed
Present yourself and the other party to the Lord, offering yourself on the altar as a burnt offering to the Lord for your coming marriage
The wife who tries to be clear-sighted concerning her husband will suffer, but the one who does not try to be clear-sighted will enjoy life
In verse 37 the Lord says, 'But let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no; for whatever is more than this is of the evil one'
The kingdom people's word needs to be simple and true: 'Yes, yes; No, no,' not convincing others with many words
Although we may not talk that much with others, it is easy for there to be excess talk between a husband and wife
The issue here is not whether your financial status allows you to give him your jacket; it is whether your temper allows you to do it
We are a spiritual people, even the kingdom people, but our temper is still hidden within us and needs to be exposed
All the kingdom people should be able to say, 'No matter how many unjust claims you place on me, my anger is not stirred up
In verse 42 the Lord says, 'To him who asks of you, give; and from him who wants to borrow from you, do not turn away'
To give and not turn away from the borrower proves that the kingdom people do not care for material riches and are not possessed by them
The Lord is not saying that we should lack discernment and behave in a foolish way regarding material possessions
Legally speaking, the old law is fair and righteous; for a good neighbor deserves our love and an enemy deserves our hatred
Verse 45 also says of the Father, 'He makes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust'
The kingdom people who observe the new law of the kingdom in its reality will be given a reward in the manifestation of the kingdom
The demand of the new law of the kingdom is much higher than the requirement of the law of the old dispensation
The kingdom of the heavens is the highest demand, and the divine life of the Father is the highest supply to meet that demand
The Lord's word was intended to touch our being, our natural choice, and to expose what we are and where we are
Misunderstanding these verses, many Christians have taken them as instructions concerning their outward behavior
We have the kingdom life within us, and we can fulfill these laws, not in ourselves, but by the Father's life and nature
Whether or not we shall be justified, saved, and accepted by God depends on the principle of faith, not the principle of the law
Through His substitutionary death, He released His resurrection life into us, and we now have this resurrection life in our spirit
Because we are able to live by this resurrection life, we have the strength, ability, and capacity to have the highest standard of morality
As we walk according to the spirit , we fulfill the righteous requirements of the law, fulfilling even more than the law requires
At the end of Matthew 5 the Lord Jesus said, 'You, therefore, shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect'
Because we are His children possessing His life and nature, there is no need for us to imitate Him or copy Him
All the requirements of the law of the kingdom of the heavens reveal how much this divine life and nature can do for us
Whenever we do this, we live by our Father's life and nature; then spontaneously we fulfill the righteous requirements of the law
God sent His Son to keep the law and to die for us that we may walk in the spirit to fulfill the righteous requirement of the law
Romans 8:16 reveals how our spirit is formed: 'The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God'
We are not God's creatures trying to copy and imitate Him; we are the Father's children living the Father's life
It was by the coming of the Spirit of God into our spirit to regenerate us and to make our spirit the very habitation of God Himself
Wait for a certain number of years, and you will see that all these naughty little ones will be perfect as their heavenly Father is perfect
Now we can understand why in Matthew chapter five the Lord refers to us as the children of God or the sons of God
He was not giving a word to unbelievers, to those who were merely God's creatures; He was giving a word to the sons of God
Wait for another period of time, and you will see that many of us will have become perfect as the Father is perfect
Since the life-giving Spirit had not yet entered into them, how can we say that those disciples were regenerated?
One day Christ accomplished the work of redemption on the cross, and one day the life-giving Spirit was formed
In God's eyes it is difficult to determine when these things took place, for in God's economy they are eternal
In this message we come to the fourth section of the Kings decree on the mountain 6118 concerning the righteous deeds of the kingdom people
In these verses, all the new laws of the kingdom of the heavens dig out and expose our temper, lust, and natural being
The kingdom people as children of the heavenly Father must live in the presence of the Father and care for the Father's presence
As long as people have an opportunity to make a public display of their righteous deeds, they are glad to perform them
If you consider your own experience, you will realize that perhaps nine times out of ten your functioning has been before men
If possible, do everything in secret, not giving any opportunity to your self or yielding any ground to your flesh
Although the Lord speaks about the matter of reward , the important thing here is not the reward, but the growth in life
Those whose self has been cut off and whose flesh has been dealt with may sometimes speak concerning their deeds
If you pray every day without telling others or letting them know about it, it means that you are healthy and that you are growing
If you want to grow and be healthy in the spiritual life, you must slay the self in the doing of righteous deeds
We may have seen the things done by God, but none of us has ever seen Him, for He is always hidden, always secret
When the worldly ones donate a hundred dollars, they advertise it, making it appear that they have given a much greater amount
When we Christians give a hundred dollars, it is better that we only let others know that we have given a dime
The biographies of many saints reveal that they did certain things in secret things that often were not made known until after they had died
Some people used to place their donations in the offering plate in such a way as to draw attention to themselves
If the one who had given the most had been listed last, he probably would not have given as much in the future
In verse 4 the King said, 'So that your alms may be in secret; and your Father Who sees in secret shall repay you'
Verse 7 says And in praying do not repeat empty words as the nations do for they suppose that they will be heard through their much speaking
Verse 8 says, 'Therefore do not be like them, for God your Father knows what things you have need of before you ask Him'
The reason for this difference is that the prayer here in Matthew is not related to life; it is related to the kingdom
Let Your name be sanctified' is mainly related to the Father, 'let Your kingdom come' to the Son, and 'let Your will be done' to the Spirit
The kingdom people must pray for this until the earth is fully recovered for God's will in the coming kingdom age
The kingdom people should not live on what they have stored; rather, by faith they should live on the Father's daily supply
They should ask the Father to forgive their debts, their failures, and their trespasses, as they forgive their debtors to maintain peace
Verse 12 indicates that in this fighting prayer we must admit and confess that we have shortcomings, mistakes, and wrongdoings
They should ask the Father not to bring them into trial, but to deliver them from the evil one, Satan, the Devil
Of having such an attitude, pray that the Father would not bring you into trial, but that He would deliver you from the evil one
To fast is not to refrain from eating; it is being unable to eat because of being desperately burdened to pray for certain things
To give alms is to give what we have the right to possess, whereas to fast is to give up what we have the right to enjoy
In this message we come to the fifth section of the King's decree, 6:19-34, which concerns the dealing of the kingdom people with riches
In verses 19 and 20 the King decrees that the kingdom people should not lay up for themselves treasures on earth, but treasures in heaven
To lay up treasures in heaven is to give material things to the poor and to care for the needy saints and for the Lord's servants
Verse 24 says No one can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will hold to one and despise the other
Mammon, standing in opposition to God, indicates that wealth or riches is the opponent of God, robbing God's people of their service to Him
Apparently, in this section of the constitution, the Lord is speaking about the dealing of the kingdom people with material riches
No one would be able to fulfill the requirements of the kingdom of the heavens without having the Father's life and nature
It would be unreasonable for this constitution to decree that, every morning, dogs should observe morning watch by flying in the air
The constitution given by the Lord Jesus on the mount was for the sons of God, and it was based upon the life and nature of the Father
Just as the dog life cannot fly, so the human life cannot fulfill the requirements of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens
Anxiety is not of the divine life, but of the human life, just as barking is of the dog life, not of the bird life
Our human life is a life of anxiety, whereas God's life is a life of enjoyment, rest, comfort, and satisfaction
If you read Matthew 5, 6, 7, 13, 24, and 25 and John 14 through 17, you will see that the style of the Lord's speaking is extraordinary
Should we forget about working and simply be birds in the air, enjoying life and taking advantage of the labor of others'?
Are You saying that we should not do anything, that we should simply enjoy the air, the sunshine, the soil, and the water'?
In ancient times, the children of Israel had to labor by tilling the ground, sowing the seed, watering, and harvesting
If they had no anxiety, they could be generous, willing to give to others and put their material things into the hand of the Lord
The worldly ones study for the sake of their anxiety; you should not study for anxiety, but to fulfill your duty
As we are fulfilling our duty, we should not do anything for the sake of our anxiety, because we have a divine life that knows no anxiety
Concerning morality, we have the life and nature of our Father within us to enable us to fulfill the highest moral requirements
The only kind of person who grows in life is one who is diligent, yet who does not use his surplus for his anxiety
In verse 32 the Lord says, 'For all these things the nations are seeking; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things'
The kingdom people have the divine life of their heavenly Father as their strength to keep the new law of the kingdom
They also have their heavenly Father to care for their material needs, so that they need not be anxious about them
The Fathers kingdom is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today and the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the coming age
The Father's righteousness is the righteousness by keeping the new law of the kingdom, as mentioned in 5:20 and 6:1
Apparently, the Lord's intention in 7:1-12 is to cover the principles according to which the kingdom people deal with others
In the two previous chapters, the Lord has dug out our temper, our lusts, our inner being, the self, the flesh, and our anxiety
The kingdom people, living in a humble spirit under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, always judge themselves, not others
Verse 2 says, 'For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged; and with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you'
Do not try to determine how spiritual others are, how much growth they have, or what is their condition in life
The reason they could not help others was that the others were under their measurement, judgment, and criticism
Afterwards some of my children, whose eyes were so clear about the situation, said to me, 'Daddy, don't you know how poor this person is?
In verse 3 the Lord says, 'And why do you look at the splinter in your brother's eye, but do not consider the log in your own eye'?
Verse 5 says, 'Hypocrite, first remove the log from your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the splinter from your brother's eye'
Many times the young people have gone out to tell others about the church or about certain spiritual things they have experienced
If you take care of others, you will not share everything with everybody, and there are some to whom you will not give your testimony
Rather, you will be wise in dealing with them, considering what the 'dogs' can take or what the 'hogs' can understand
If you are excited and care only for yourself and not for others, you will get into trouble or even cause trouble
In the past some of our young people have gone to other meetings, and, caring only for their zeal, they spoke out unwisely
Verse 12 says All things therefore whatever you wish that men would do to you so also you do to them for this is the law and the prophets
Verses 7 and 8 say, 'Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you
We, the kingdom people, must approach it seriously, never doing it in a light or loose way or merely according to our feeling
Because Matthew is a book on the kingdom, no doubt the 'good things' in verse 11 are the things of the kingdom
Eventually, we shall receive the guidance to deal with people according to the kingdom and according to the Spirit
How much we all need to find a proper and profitable way to contact others, whether unbelievers, saints, or the churches
To ask is to pray in a common way, to seek is to supplicate in a specific way, and to knock is to reach the door in the closest way
The matter of asking and receiving in verse 8 is good for the kingdom people's prayer concerning their keeping of the new law of the kingdom
They are well able to fulfill the new law of the kingdom and live in its reality that they may enter into its manifestation
No human father would give his children a stone for a loaf or a serpent for a fish, but would always give them good gifts
Now we come to verse 12, the conclusion to the section on the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others
The new law of the kingdom does not contradict the law and the prophets; rather, it fulfills them and even complements them
We need to keep in mind that the constitution of any people is always according to the life and nature of that people
The first section of the constitution, the section concerning the nature of the kingdom people, is therefore very basic
The second section covers the influence of the kingdom people upon the world, and the third deals with the law of the kingdom of the heavens
In 7112 the constitution reveals the attitude we should have toward others how we should deal with them and how we should take care of them
One thing remains to be covered: the fact that the kingdom people are on earth doing the will of God our Father
In the last section there is no dealing with anger, lust, the natural being, the self, the flesh, anxiety, or our attitude toward others
In the last section of the constitution there is no anger, lust, self, flesh, anxiety, nor any word about our attitude toward others
Those in Christianity can use rock music or other worldly methods in their services, but we cannot, because our way is constricted
In your fellowship you talk about everything from the archangel Michael, to Martin Luther, to all the brothers and sisters in the church
In verse 13 the Lord said, 'For the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it'
In 1 Corinthians 3:10 Paul says that he has laid the foundation, which is Christ, and that others are building upon it
Paul also seems to be saying, 'If your work is of wood, hay, and stubble, it will be burned by fire, and you will not receive a reward'
Verse 14 says, 'For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted which leads to life, and few are those who find it'
Verse 15 says, 'Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but within are ravenous wolves'
To enter into the kingdom of the heavens we need to do two things: call on the Lord and do the will of the heavenly Father
Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens,' but those who call on the Lord and do the will of the heavenly Father
In this last section of the constitution, it is no longer a negative matter of dealing with our temper, lust, self, flesh, and anxiety
We are not here merely to overcome our temper, our lusts, our self, and our flesh, and to be kind and sympathetic to others
In the teachings of the worldly philosophers, there is neither the divine life and divine nature nor the divine way
In the last section of the constitution it is not only a matter of life, but also a matter of the will of the Father
You did them in yourself, in your own desire, and according to your own intention, not according to the will of My Father'
We see from the Lord's word here that certain works may be done in the Lord's name, and yet not be done according to the will of God
We have talked a great deal about going to the campuses but are we going there to do a certain work or to do the will of our heavenly Father
Although you may run faster than others, your running will not be recognized if you run outside the lines of your lane
If you are running according to the divine nature and within the constricted lines the divine nature will indicate Yes you are right go on
If you are not running according to the divine nature or if you step outside the lines, the divine nature will say, 'Don't go this way'
There is no need for anyone to tell you what to do, for the regulating, constricting, divine nature is within you
Because a runner in a race can see the lines, he needs no one to tell him whether or not he is inside the boundaries
We have the constricting lines within us, the lines of the divine life and the divine nature, and we can tell where we are
All those who are the kingdom people, all those who have been regenerated by the Father, have His life and nature within them
The rock here does not refer to Christ, but to His wise word, the word that reveals the will of His Father who is in the heavens
The kingdom people's living and work must be founded on the word of the new King for the accomplishment of the will of the heavenly Father
The rain is of God descending from the heavens the rivers are of man coming from the earth and the winds are of Satan blowing from the air
If we live and work according to our human concepts and natural ways, our living and work will be founded on sinking sand
The house built on the sand which falls is like the building work of wood, hay, and stubble, which will be burned by the testing fire
When the rain, the rivers, and the winds test the house built upon the sand, the house, not having a solid foundation, will fall
Christ, as the new King of the kingdom of the heavens, spoke with authority in decreeing the new law of the kingdom
In the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens there are four verses that tell us how we can enter into the kingdom of the heavens
The first is Matthew 5:3, which says, 'Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens'
The second says, 'Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens'
If we would be in the reality of the kingdom today, we need to be poor in our spirit and to be persecuted for the sake of righteousness
If you are loose, too free, and careless about righteousness, you are immediately separated from the reality of the kingdom
Righteousness not only keeps us in the reality of the kingdom, but also brings us into the manifestation of the kingdom
It is righteousness and the doing of the Father's will that will usher us into the manifestation of the kingdom
By being poor in our spirit, we are ushered into the reality of the kingdom, and through righteousness we are kept in this reality
By the surpassing righteousness and the doing the will of the Father, we shall enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
The order of the four instances recorded in Matthew 8:2-16 differs from that in Mark 1:29-2:1 and Luke 4:38-41; 5:12-14; and 7:1-10
The order of Matthew's record, proving that Christ is the King of the kingdom of the heavens, is according to doctrine
The order of Luke's record, revealing that Jesus is the proper man to be man's Savior, is according to morality
The order of John's record, testifying that Christ is the Son of God and even God Himself, is also somewhat according to history
The coming down of the King from the mountain signifies that the heavenly King has come down from the heavens to the earth
Verse 2 says, 'And behold, a leper approached and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me'
The diseases healed in the cases recorded in Matthew 8 are significant, for every disease signifies a specific spiritual sickness
The first class of people saved by the kingly Savior to be the people of the kingdom is represented by a leper
Now the kingly Savior comes to save men from their rebellion and cleanse them from their leprosy that they may become His kingdom people
The leper in verses 2 through 4 represents the Jews, whereas the centurion in verses 5 through 13 represents the Gentiles
The believing Jews are saved by His direct touch , whereas the believing Gentiles are saved through faith in His word
The Gentile centurion recognized the authority of the kingly Savior and realized healing authority was in His word
He believed not only in the kingly Savior, but also in His word, asking Him not to go personally but only to send His word
The reference to the kingdom of the heavens in verse 11 refers to the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
It will be in the manifestation of the kingdom that the overcoming Gentile believers will feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
The outer darkness will be the darkness outside the bright glory in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
Peter's mother-in-law represents the Jews at the end of this age who will be saved by receiving the kingly Savior
At that time, during the great tribulation, in the eyes of God the Jews will be in a fever , hot in things other than God
The kingly Savior, after the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, will come back to this remnant of Jews that they might be saved
The temperature of the Jews today is very high in their fervency for politics, industry, agriculture, and warfare
The casting out of demons and the healing of the sick in this age are just a foretaste of the extensive power of the coming age
In verse 16 after the Lord had healed Peters motherinlaw when evening had come He healed many who were demonpossessed and all who were ill
In saying this, this disciple, who was not a scribe, overly considered the cost of following the King of the heavenly kingdom
To the disciple who had been warned by this case not to follow the Lord in a light or loose way, the Lord gave a word of encouragement
The Lord's word encouraged him to forget about all the preparations he was making, to leave the dead to bury the dead, and to follow Him
If you do not expect any material enjoyment and if you will leave the dead duties to the dead, you can go on to follow Him
The Lord and His disciples were in a boat, and 'a great tempest arose in the sea, so that the boat was covered by the waves'
When the disciples, fearing that they would perish, roused the Lord from sleep , He said, 'Why are you fearful, you of little faith'?
The King rebuked the winds and the sea because in the wind are the fallen angels of Satan , and in the sea are the demons
As soon as the King commanded the fallen angels and evil demons to stop, they immediately obeyed, and there was a great calm
Verse 27 says, 'And the men marveled, saying, What kind of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey Him'?
It was not the winds and the sea, but the fallen angels above the winds and the demons under the sea that obey the King's authority
He had no hole, no roost, no place to lay His head; however, He had supernatural authority over the natural environment
When the two possessed by demons met the Lord Jesus, the demons cried out, saying, 'What have we to do with You, Son of God?
The King called Himself the Son of Man but the demons called Him the Son of God tempting Him to deviate from His standing as the Son of Man
The words 'before the time' imply that God has appointed a time for the demons to be tormented and that the demons knew that time
The demons not wanting to be tormented before the time entreated the Lord Jesus saying If You cast us out send us into the herd of hogs
They came out and went into the hogs; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the precipice into the sea and died in the waters'
The Lord's intention in permitting the demons to go into the hogs was not to damage the occupation of those who fed them
Verse 2 says, 'And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Have courage, child, your sins are forgiven'
The men who had brought the paralytic to the Lord Jesus had uncovered the roof where the Lord was and had broken it up
As God He not only has authority over the natural environment and over demons He also has the full authority to forgive people of their sins
Verses 4 and 5 say, 'And Jesus, knowing their inward reasonings, said, Why are you thinking evil things in your hearts?
The Greek word rendered 'inward reasonings' also means cogitations, thoughts, evil surmisings with strong feeling or passion
For Him to say Your sins are forgiven was easier than to say Rise and walk because no one knows whether or not ones sins are forgiven
Only this kingly Savior, who had been authorized by God and who would die to redeem sinners, had such authority
The paralytic's rising and going proved that he was healed, and his being healed proved that his sins were forgiven
For Jesus, the Lord, to be vindicated as the heavenly King, there is the need for Him to show His followers His authority
Christ as the heavenly King has the full authority to deal with all of these, and all of these are subdued under His authority
He will be the Savior of the repentant Jews, and He will also be the One who will restore the entire earth in the millennium
If we would follow this heavenly King, we must not expect any material enjoyment, and we also need to ignore the dead obligations and duties
When Peter and Andrew were called, they were casting a net into the sea; and when James and John were called, they were mending their nets
As the Lord Jesus was passing by the customs office, where the tax collectors were, He saw Matthew and called him, and Matthew followed Him
There must have been some attracting power with the Lord, either in His word or appearance, that caused Matthew to follow Him
As the writer of this Gospel, Matthew purposely did not say that it was his house and that it was he who had made a great feast for the Lord
Verse 10 says that 'many tax collectors and sinners came and reclined at the table together with Jesus and His disciples'
How we must worship the Lord that even a person of such a low rank as Matthew, under God's mercy and by His grace, could become an apostle!
After being saved, Matthew was so grateful to the Lord that he opened his house and prepared a feast for Him and His disciples
Verse 11 says, 'And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to His disciples, Why does your teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners'?
The Lord took the opportunity given Him by the Pharisees' question to give a very sweet revelation of Himself as the Physician
In verse 12 we see the Lord's reply to the Pharisees' question: 'Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill'
In calling people to follow Him for the kingdom, the King of the heavenly kingdom ministered as a physician, not as a judge
The judgment of the judge is according to righteousness, whereas the healing of the physician is according to mercy and grace
The Lord's word here implies that the self-righteous Pharisees did not recognize their need of Him as a physician
They considered themselves strong; hence, blinded by their own self-righteousness, they did not know that they were ill
Self-righteous men do not like to receive mercy or grace from God; they prefer to offer sacrifice to God, to give something to God
The Pharisees were proud of their knowledge of the Scriptures, and they thought that they knew the Bible very well
Here the Lord Jesus told them to go and learn something, to learn the meaning of the word, 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice'
The Lord seemed to be telling the Pharisees, 'You Pharisees are self-righteous, and you condemn these people without mercy
Without the environment portrayed in these verses, the Lord Jesus would not have had the opportunity to reveal Himself as the Physician
If we have this vision, we shall have faith in Him and trust Him whenever we are sick physically, spiritually, or mentally
The Lord took advantage of the Pharisees' expression of their religious concept to reveal Himself as the Physician
As a book of doctrine, Matthew presents us another case in 9:14-17: the case of fasting without the Bridegroom
Verse 14 says, 'Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast'?
Verses 10 through 13 record the Lord's dealing with the question of the Pharisees, who were in the old religion
After a short time, his disciples formed a new religion to frustrate men from enjoying Christ, just as the Pharisees in the old religion did
John the Baptist's ministry was to introduce men to Christ that Christ might become their Redeemer, their life, and their all
Some of his disciples drifted away from his goal, Christ, to some of John's practices and turned those practices into a religion
Both the disciples of John, the new-timers of religion, and the Pharisees, the old-timers of religion, fasted much, yet without Christ
Meanwhile, they condemned the disciples of Christ who did not fast, but had Christ with them and lived in His presence
To have a religion is to worship God, to serve God, and to do certain things to please God, yet without Christ
In verse 14 we have the old religion, the religion of the Pharisees, and the new religion, the religion of the disciples of John
No matter whether the way is old or new, it is a religion as long as it does not have Christ and the Spirit in it
In verse 15 the Lord Jesus said to them, 'Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them?
The Bridegroom was taken away from the sons of the bridechamber when the kingly Savior was taken up from the disciples into heaven
The living and walk of His followers should be regulated and directed only by His Person and His presence, not by any doctrine
A patch of unshrunk cloth put on an old garment pulls away from the garment by its shrinking strength, thus making the tear worse
The old garment in verse 16 signifies man's good behavior, good deeds, and religious practices by his old natural life
By fasting you are actually cutting a piece of unshrunk cloth and using it to patch the holes in your garments'
Of saying this directly, the Lord Jesus indicated to the disciples of John that they did not have a perfect garment
After His death and resurrection, He was made the finished garment for us to put on so that we may attend His wedding
Why did the Lord Jesus, after telling us that He is the Bridegroom, go on to speak of the new cloth, the new garment?
To enjoy the Lord's presence we need certain qualifications; we need to be in a certain condition, in a certain situation
What we are by birth what we are naturally whatever we can do and whatever we have do not qualify us to be in the presence of the Bridegroom
The father undoubtedly loved him deeply, but the son's condition was utterly unfit for the presence of the father
The father immediately told his servant to take the best robe and to put it on him, thus making him fit for his presence
We must remember the context of these verses in Matthew 9: the Lord Jesus was eating with tax collectors and sinners
When the prodigal son was clothed with the best robe, he could immediately stand in the presence of his honored father
We as sinners and 'tax collectors' need to be clothed in a new garment that we may be worthy of the Bridegroom's presence
By being crucified, buried, and resurrected, Christ was made a life-giving pneuma, a life-giving breath, the living air
To baptize people into the name means to baptize them into the Spirit, who is Christ as the all-inclusive pneuma
Christ became incarnated, He lived on earth, He was crucified and accomplished redemption, and He was resurrected
To enjoy Him as the Bridegroom in the kingdom feast, they need Him as their new garment outwardly and their new wine inwardly
He is our qualification and our satisfaction, the provision for our outward need and the provision for all our inward hunger and thirst
Some indeed have received the new wine, but they have attempted to take the new wine back and pour it into an old wineskin
If the charismatic movement were the genuine new wine filled with the fermenting power, it would burst that old Catholic wineskin
The Greek word for 'fresh' is kainos, which means new in nature, quality, or form; unaccustomed, unused; hence, fresh
The kingdom people are built into the church , and the church is expressed through the local churches in which they live
Never consider the church a religion; the church is a corporate entity full of Christ, because the church is Christ enlarged
Christ is not only our new garment and new wine, but, being increased, He is also our new wineskin to contain the wine
He is our outward qualification He is our inward satisfaction and He is in a corporate way the church the Body capable of holding the wine
He is the Bridegroom, the new garment, the new wine, and also the corporate vessel to contain what we enjoy of Him
We have always considered Christ as the Head; we have considered little, if at all, that Christ is also the Body
The Christ in you is one with the Christ in me, and the Christ in us is one with the Christ in all other Christians
We must also realize that the wineskin is not only the container of the wine, but also the means for us to drink the wine
Many of us can testify that whenever we come into a church meeting, we discover that it is truly the place where we can drink Christ
We need Christ as the new garment, we need Christ as the new wine, and we also need Christ in a corporate way as the new wineskin
Even if all the babes came together, they could still be in religion because they do not have Christ as their content
If the older ones are filled with Christ and saturated with Him, they are the church, no matter how old they may be
The modernists are trying to take the unshrunk cloth of the Lord's human living and use it to patch the holes in their behavior
They believe that Christ is God, that Christ is their Redeemer, that Christ died on the cross for their sins, and that He was resurrected
In Matthew 9 Christ is revealed as the Physician, the Bridegroom, and even as the unshrunk cloth, the new wine, and the new wineskin
In order for Christ to be revealed to us, there must be a certain environment, and that environment always comes out of Christ's ministry
In order for Him to be revealed as the lovely items found in chapter nine, there was the need for the continuation of His ministry
Christ would not just tell us that He is the Physician, the Bridegroom, the new cloth, the new wine, and the new wineskin
Because a great crowd followed Him, He was able to deliver the decree of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens
One day Christ led His disciples to Caesarea Philippi and asked them, 'Who do men say that the Son of Man is'?
It reveals that Christ is the Son of David, the Son of Abraham, and the issue of a marriage that unites the two lines of David's descendants
Christ is the Son of David, the Son of Abraham, the seed of the woman, Jehovah the Savior, and Emmanuel, God with us
In chapter three this King is recommended and anointed, and in chapter four He is tested, qualified, and approved
After giving the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, He continued His ministry, doing some signs with a dispensational significance
These miracles signify that He came with salvation firstly to the Jews and then turned from the Jews to the Gentiles
These signs also signify that after the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, Christ will bring His salvation back to the Jews
Through His ministry, the Lord gained a sinner, a tax collector named Matthew, who prepared a great feast for the Lord and His disciples
We would never know that our heavenly King is the Physician, the Bridegroom, the new cloth, the new wine, and the new wineskin'
The daughter of the ruler of the synagogue represents the Jews, and the woman with the hemorrhage represents the Gentiles
The woman here and the centurion in 8:5-10, both representing the Gentiles, came to contact the Lord in the same way, with faith
According to Numbers 15:38-40, Israelite males had to wear a blue fringe on their garments, a ribbon in the color of blue
When the sick woman touched the fringe of His garment, the power of His virtue went to her, and she was healed
The healing of the woman with the hemorrhage indicates that the Lord was met and caught by the Gentiles as He was journeying to the Jews
For twelve years the woman suffered from the issue of blood, and for twelve years the girl was growing in order to die
Verse 25 says, 'But when the crowd was put out, He entered and took hold of her hand, and the girl was raised up'
After the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus will reach the house of Israel, and all the dead Jews will be healed
As the Lord Jesus passed by, 'Two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, Have mercy on us, Son of David'
The two blind men were healed in the house by the Lord's direct touch , as were both the daughter of the ruler and Peter's mother-in-law
Dumbness by demon possession signifies the inability to speak for God and praise God due to the worship of dumb idols
The speaking of a dumb man signifies the recovery of the speaking and praising ability by being filled with the Lord in the spirit
Isaiah 35:5 and 6 say, 'Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped
Before such a revival, so many Christians are blind, unable to see God or the things of God, and dumb, unable to speak a word for God
If those in the denominations today are asked to give a prayer many are unable to do so and they will reply This is not my job my profession
The continuation of the King's ministry in chapter nine brought forth another situation that enabled Him to reveal Himself
We see once again that in order to have Christ revealed to us, we must have the ministry to bring forth a certain environment
The great feast attended by tax collectors and sinners was an excellent opportunity for the Lord to reveal Himself as the Physician
Although the leaders of the nation of Israel rejected the heavenly King, there was still a good number among the people that needed reaping
The King of the heavenly kingdom considered Himself not only the Shepherd of the sheep, but also the Lord of the harvest
In verse 38 the Lord told us to beseech the Lord of the harvest that He may thrust out workers into His harvest
From now on, whenever you sense the need for workers, you must firstly pray to the Lord of the harvest, saying, 'Lord, here is Your harvest
To pray like this means that we have seen a vision that our Christ, the kingly One, the Shepherd, is the Lord of the harvest
Of inviting me, this brother should have prayed, 'Lord, the church in my locality is the harvest of the heavenly King
The twelve disciples prayed for the Lord of the harvest to send out reapers, and the Lord answered their prayer by sending them out
Look at your eyes, ears, nostrils, lips, shoulders, arms, hands, legs, and feet: your body is arranged in pairs
In verse 3 Matthew specifically designates himself as the tax collector, remembering his salvation, perhaps with gratitude
Cananaean' comes from the Hebrew kanna, zealous, referring to a Galilean sect known as the Zealots, not to the land of Canaan
The twelve apostles were sent to the house of Israel and were charged not to go to the nations nor to the Samaritans
The twelve apostles , as workers worthy of their food, did not need to bring their living necessities with them
It is not an insignificant matter to be sent by the Lord, for as sent ones, we become the Lord's representatives
We thank the Lord for His ministry, for the continuation of His ministry, and especially for the spread of His ministry
The Lord's word reveals that the whole world is under the usurping hand of the enemy and thus opposes God's economy
Verse 17 says, 'But beware of men; for they will deliver you up to Sanhedrins, and in their synagogues they will scourge you'
It is very significant that the Lord exposed the Sanhedrin and the synagogues as being opposed to God's economy
Although the Jews went there to learn the Word of God, those in the synagogues persecuted the apostles of the heavenly King
If the ancient Sanhedrin and synagogues opposed the King's sent ones, then how about the system of today's religion?
At that time, the wolves spoken of in verse 16 were those in the Sanhedrins and in the synagogues mentioned in verse 17
Saul of Tarsus studied at the feet of Gamaliel, a great Bible teacher, 'a teacher of the law, honored by all the people'
No matter how much certain ones are for God, they are in a system, an organization, which is against God's economy
In Matthew 10 the Lord indicated that there were wolves in the synagogues, and in Revelation He spoke of the synagogue of Satan
Suppose you were among those Jews sent out by the heavenly King and you heard that those in the Sanhedrin and in the synagogues were wolves
Although they could quote verses and worship God according to the Scriptures, the Lord Jesus did not consider them as sheep, but as wolves
At the time of Matthew 10, there was a complicated situation among the children of Israel, for the sheep and the wolves were mixed together
If we read these chapters carefully, we shall see that the gathering of the sheep is the reaping of the harvest
When the sheep desired to go with the undershepherds sent by the Shepherd, the wolves would rise up and say, 'What!
The Lord said that, as sheep in the midst of wolves, His sent ones must be prudent as serpents and guileless as doves
Verse 18 says, 'And you shall be brought before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations'
The Lord indicated that God's kingdom would be opposed not only by the Jewish religious world but also by the Gentile secular world
The intention of the heavenly King is to establish His kingdom on earth within the territory of religion and politics
The King's authority deals with the unclean spirits and diseases; the Father's Spirit deals with the opposers' persecution
We should learn to face persecution not in ourselves, but learn to turn to our spirit and trust the indwelling Spirit
We must face opposition and confront attack, not in ourselves, but by turning to our spirit where the Spirit of God dwells
In verse 22 the Lord continued, 'And you will be hated by all because of My name; but he who endures to the end, he shall be saved'
After the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, He will send His apostles to preach the gospel of the kingdom to the Jews again
It was changed in contempt by the Jews to Baalzebel, which means lord of the dunghill, and used for the ruler of the demons
The Pharisees, the leading ones of the Jewish religion, reviled the heavenly King by saying that He cast out demons by the ruler of demons
In verses 26 and 27 the King told His sent ones not to fear the persecutors, but rather to speak in the light and to preach on the housetops
Such a person will be put into the outer darkness and will not participate in the manifestation of the kingdom
Because the heavenly King is establishing His kingdom on earth, warfare between these two kingdoms is inevitable
The fighting instigated by the usurping Satan against the heavenly King's called ones is waged even in their household
The heavenly called ones are attacked in their homes by their kindred who remain under the evil one's usurping hand
Whenever her husband invited his colleagues from work to dinner, the wife was very happy and prepared the best food
He asked them to take their cross and follow after Him, that is, to take the will of God by putting themselves aside
Verse 39 says, 'He who finds his soul-life shall lose it, and he who loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it'
To receive the King's sent ones means to receive the King Himself, because the sent ones are identified with the King
The King is still spreading His ministry today, and we are His sent ones with the authority, the peace, the Spirit, and the identification
A righteous man is one who seeks after righteousness, who does righteousness, and who is persecuted for righteousness for the kingdom
If you receive the prophet, you will receive the word of God; and if you receive the righteous man, you will receive his righteousness
The record of chapter ten indicates that both the King's ministry and the enlargement of His ministry by the twelve apostles were rejected
John was rejected, the Lord Jesus was rejected, and according to His charge to the twelve apostles, their ministry also was to be rejected
John's imprisonment was arranged sovereignly of the Lord to terminate his ministry, which was the ministry of recommendation
The questions John's disciples asked the Lord might have given the Lord's apostles a negative impression of John
After testifying boldly for Christ in the wilderness, John the Baptist became weak when he had been imprisoned for a time
Compared to the Old Testament prophets, John was greater; but compared to the New Testament people, he was smaller
John was in a transitory period, greater than those who preceded him, but smaller than those who were to come after him
All the prophets prior to John prophesied only that Christ was coming, but John testified that Christ had come
Although John saw the incarnated Christ and introduced Him to people, he did not have the resurrected Christ indwelling him
Although John the Baptist was close to Christ, he was not as close to Him as we are, for we have Christ within us
Even the smallest among us is able to give a strong testimony on being justified by faith both objectively and subjectively
When John the Baptist was conceived, it was said that he would go before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah
Verse 12 says, 'And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence, and violent men seize it'
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the Pharisees had been violently frustrating people from entering the kingdom of the heavens
The word of Christ concerning His forerunner John the Baptist was deeply related to Himself and the heavenly kingdom
Christ and John the Baptist played the flute to preach the gospel of the kingdom but the Judaizers did not dance for the joy of salvation
John and Christ sang 'a dirge' to preach repentance, but the Judaizers 'did not beat the breast' for the grief of sin
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a wine drinker, a friend of tax collectors and sinners
Christ is not only the Savior, but also the friend of sinners, sympathizing with their problems and sensing their griefs
The kingdom people are the children of wisdom, who justify Christ and His deeds and follow Him as their wisdom
Verse 20 says, 'Then He began to reproach the cities in which most of His works of power took place, because they did not repent'
The Lord proceeded, Woe to you, Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum, because, in a general way, they had all rejected Him
He also said of Capernaum, 'It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you'
The Lord was the first party, the cities were the second party, and the Father, who was with Him, was the third party
As the Lord was rebuking Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum, the Father might have asked Him, 'Are you happy about this'?
If your parents and relatives would be one with you regarding the Lord's recovery, you would be excited and praise the Lord
The Lord's recovery is not a common Christian work; it is the gathering of the Lord's remnant to recover God's kingdom in the church life
Concerning the Son, only the Father has such knowledge; and concerning the Father, only the Son has such knowledge
No doubt the evil one is not willing to let people know the things of the Father, the Son, and the Lord's recovery
He submitted Himself fully to the will of His Father, not wanting to do anything for Himself nor expecting to gain something for Himself
If instead of resisting we submit to the will of the Father testifying that the opposition is of the Father we shall have rest in our souls
If he had realized that his imprisonment was due to the Father's will, he would have been at rest, even in prison
Christ, the heavenly King, always submitted to the Father's will, taking God's will as His portion and not resisting anything
He seemed to be saying, 'You people are keeping the Sabbath, yet you are still laboring and striving to keep the law
He knew that His disciples were hungry and that, because it was the Sabbath, it was difficult to find something to eat
You have called us to come to You for rest; but we are hungry, and there seems to be no way for us to get anything to eat
Should the disciples suffer hunger and keep the Sabbath or should they forget the Sabbath and find something to eat to satisfy their hunger
The Lord took the lead to bring His hungry disciples into the grain fields where they all found something to eat
Verse 2 says, 'But the Pharisees seeing it said to Him, Behold, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath'
According to their meager knowledge, they cared for the ritual of keeping the Sabbath, not for the hunger of the people
The Lord answered, 'Have you not read,' pointing out to them another aspect in the Scriptures that justified Him and His disciples
They ate something, the showbread in the temple, which according to the Levitical regulations they should not have eaten
Now the real David and His followers were also rejected and took action to eat, seemingly against the sabbatical regulation
King David and his followers were rejected by the people, and the real David and His followers were rejected also
Neither David and his followers nor Christ and His followers had anything to eat, but there was the place where there was something to eat
The Lord brought to the attention of the Pharisees another case in the Scriptures to prove to them how little they really knew the Bible
In this case, a case concerning the priests, it was a change from the temple to a Person who is greater than the temple
In the first case it was the king breaking the Levitical regulation in the second case it was the priests breaking the sabbatical regulation
Apparently the priests were profaning the Sabbath, but actually they were not profaning the Sabbath, because they were in the temple
In verse 8 the Lord indicated a third change, a right-asserting change from the Sabbath to the Lord of the Sabbath
By stretching out his hand, the man took the Lord's life-giving word, and his withered hand was restored by the life in this word
Of reading Matthew as a book of stories or merely as a book of doctrine, we must get into the depths of this book
He cares only for His headship and for the members of His Body Therefore we must conclude that the Lord cares only for Christ and the church
The Lord also cares for His members, including any member of His Body who is sick, weak, or in a difficult situation
On the Sabbath the twelve apostles were satisfied and at rest, and on the Sabbath the man with the withered hand was also at rest
According to their understanding, the Lord Jesus had to be destroyed, and they took counsel together for this very purpose
Verse 19, also a quotation from Isaiah, says, 'He shall not strive nor cry out, nor shall anyone hear His voice in the streets'
The reason for the rejection and the cause for the Lord's needing to hide was the breaking of the religious regulations
The less we care for religious regulations and the more we care for Christ and His Body, the more intense the opposition will be
Even those who had become bruised reeds He would not break, and those who had become smoking flax He would not quench
Among His followers and believers today, many have become bruised reeds that can no longer give a musical song
Although He was a little man, the enemy of God knew that He was the One who would defeat him and establish the kingdom of the heavens
The enemy knows that this is the Lord's recovery and that the recovery will defeat him and establish the kingdom of the heavens
He showed them that the way to rest is to break the regulations of religion and to care for the Head and for the members of the Body
Now we must see that in order for the kingdom of the heavens to be established there is the need of a spiritual battle of spiritual fighting
Although we have covered many things, we have not yet seen that the establishment of the kingdom requires spiritual fighting
Matthew selected another historical fact to point out the fighting that was going on as the King was establishing the heavenly kingdom
What the Lord did in verse 22 in healing a man possessed by a demon was a fact of history and could not be concealed
Verse 22 says Then there was brought to Him one possessed by a demon blind and dumb and He healed him so that the dumb man spoke and saw
A blind and dumb man signifies one who has no sight to see God and spiritual things; thus he is unable to praise God and speak for God
The miracle performed in healing the blind and dumb person amazed the crowds, and they said, 'Is this not the Son of David'?
According to verse 24, they said, 'This man does not cast out the demons except by Beelzebub, ruler of the demons'
It was changed in contempt by the Jews to Baalzebel, which means the lord of the dunghill, and was used for the ruler of the demons
In the eyes of the ancient Jews, Beelzebub referred to Satan as the king of the demons and as the king of the dirty flies on the dunghill
His ministry produced a situation that enabled Him to reveal something that we would otherwise be unable to see
He has his authority and his angels , who are his subordinates as principalities, powers, and rulers of the darkness of this world
Satan's kingdom is the old kingdom, but the heavenly King is about to establish a new kingdom, the kingdom of the heavens
By the Lords word here we see that the battle fought for the kingdom is not fought by just a man himself but by a man with the Spirit of God
In verse 28 the Lord said that He cast out demons by the Spirit of God and that this is the coming of the kingdom of God
The Lord used the opportunity afforded Him by the accusation of the Pharisees to reveal the secret of spiritual fighting
In those chapters we see the rest and the breaking of the regulations for the Head and for the members of the Body
There are two kingdoms on earth: one is the kingdom of darkness, and the other is the kingdom of the heavens in the light
In verse 30 the Lord says, 'He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who is not gathering with Me is scattering'
The good man out of the good treasure brings forth good things, and the evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things'
An idle word is a non-working word, an inoperative word, having no positive function, useless, unprofitable, unfruitful, and barren
In verse 37 the Lord concludes, 'For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be convicted'
Because the Pharisees could not argue with the Lord Jesus, they changed the subject seemingly from the negative side to the positive side
Verse 38 says, 'Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered Him, saying, Teacher, we want to see a sign from you'
The Pharisees seemed to be saying, 'We want you to show us a sign, and you call us an evil and adulterous generation
The heart of the earth' is called the lower parts of the earth and Hades , where the Lord went after His death
Hades, equal to Sheol in the Old Testament, has two sections: the section of torment and the section of comfort
The Greek word rendered 'greater' in verses 41 and 42 is pleion, meaning more in quantity and quality; hence, greater
According to doctrine, Christ must first die and be resurrected; then He builds the church and speaks the word of wisdom
If we had been there and had heard these words, we certainly would have considered them serious, weighty, and filled with significance
If the Pharisees had taken in the Lord's word, they would have repented and believed after the Lord was crucified, buried, and resurrected
He gave them the signs of Jonah and of Solomon, indicating that He was about to die, to be buried, and to be resurrected
The Lord's word concerning Jonah and Solomon also indicated that from that time onward He would not do any miracles for the Jewish people
Verse 43 says, 'Now when the unclean spirit goes out from a man, it passes through waterless places, seeking rest, and does not find it'
Since the demon cannot find rest in dry places, it returns into the man's body it originally possessed and makes its home there
They will only sweep away the dirt and add good things to beautify themselves, but will not receive Christ to fill them
Near the end of this age, they will be seven times more possessed by demons, and their state will become worse than ever
Whether or not the nation of Israel exists does not depend upon the endeavor of the Jews; it depends upon God's mercy
Whoever does the will of His Father is His brother for helping, His sister for sympathizing, and His mother for tenderly loving
From this point onward, Jesus' relationship with people is not based upon the natural birth, but upon the spiritual birth
In other words, at the end of chapter twelve, the Lord indicated strongly that He had given up the entire race of Israel
Now we are not only His brothers and sisters; we are one spirit with Him, one body in Him, and one new man in Him
Whatever is recorded in the Gospel of Matthew is according to the kingdom and according to the history of the kingdom
Lang a teacher among the Brethren also saw this matter to some degree but he did not see it as accurately and clearly as Govett and Panton
If you do not differentiate between these two things, you will not be able to understand this book concerning the kingdom of the heavens
We have pointed out that the reality of the kingdom was revealed not in the administrative region, but in the region of living
The Lord Jesus deliberately went to these places to speak of the reality, the appearance, and the manifestation of the kingdom
In chapters five, six, and seven there is no falsehood; everything is pure, genuine, heavenly, spiritual, and, to a certain extent, divine
We see the attitude of the kingdom people toward material wealth and the fact that they have no anxiety regarding riches
Finally, we see the principle of the kingdom people in dealing with others and the ground of their living and work
The situation in chapter thirteen, the chapter concerned with the appearance of the kingdom, is altogether different
Today's Christendom exactly matches the portrait in Matthew 13 of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens
None of these things is found in chapters five, six, and seven, where everything is real, pure, spiritual, and heavenly
At the end of chapter twelve, the heavenly King, having been fully rejected by the Jewish leaders, made a break with them
On that day He went out of the house, signifying the house of Israel, to the sea, signifying the Gentile world
He had declared that He no longer had anything to do with His natural relatives but that He had turned to the believing Gentiles
The boat, which was in the sea but not of the sea, signifies the church, which is in the world but not of the world
If you do, then you must leave the house and not stand on the seashore, but get into the boat close to the Lord
The church is neither the house of Israel nor the sea of the Gentiles; rather, it is the boat of the believers
Because we have the way to allegorize the Scriptures, we know the significance of the house, the sea, and the boat
The one who does not have is the opposing and rejecting Jew, from whom what the heavenly King has spoken and done will be taken away
If certain Christian teachers and leaders were to hear a message like this, they would condemn it, criticize it, and reject it
We must learn the first lesson given in the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens: 'Blessed are the poor in spirit'
Three things are interrelated: the word of the kingdom, the sons of the kingdom, and Christ Himself as the life within the seed
Because many Christian workers have not seen this, they still think that the church is built up by work and labor
The kingdom of the heavens is brought into being not by teaching or by working but by sowing Christ as the living word of life into humanity
We would like to hear about this, not about some seed falling on the wayside, rocky places, thorns, and good soil
To those who are poor in spirit and pure in heart this parable is much more profound than the teaching of Moses and all the Psalms
If you leave the seeds on a pedestal appreciating them looking at them and treasuring them that will be the most effective way to stop them
The sower is Christ, and the seed is also Christ, Christ in the word sown into us to make us the sons of the kingdom
In the past we have pointed out that our heart is not the receiving organ, but the loving organ, and that our receiving organ is our spirit
The Lord Jesus does not mention anything about the spirit; but He does say that the heart is the place where the seed is sown
The birds signify the evil one, Satan, who came and snatched away the word of the kingdom sown in the hardened heart
Because the wayside, part of the soil for farming, was so close to the traffic, it became hardened by the traffic
Education, commerce, politics, science, business, and other kinds of worldly traffic go back and forth within their mind, emotion, and will
There has been so much traffic in their heart that their heart has been hardened, just like the wayside in the Lord's parable
We thank the Lord that, in His mercy, when the gospel was preached to us, we were poor in spirit and pure in heart
The sun with its scorching heat signifies affliction or persecution , which dries up the seed that is not rooted
The things signified by the rocks correspond to what is covered by the complemented laws in the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens
Sooner or later, all these rocks will be exposed because the word that has been sown into you will not be able to be rooted in you
When the affliction and persecutions come, you will be dried up like a plant without root that withers under the scorching heat of the sun
As long as you are either the wayside, the soil with hidden rocks, or the soil with thorns, the kingdom cannot grow in you
Verse 8 says, 'And others fell on the good earth and gave fruit, some indeed a hundredfold, and some sixty, and some thirty'
Such a heart gives every inch of its ground to receive the word that the word may grow, bear fruit, and produce even a hundredfold
How many have no worldly traffic, no hidden sins, flesh, lusts, or self, and no anxiety or deceitfulness of money?
Although we may be surrounded with Christians, we rarely find one who is truly poor in spirit and pure in heart
We might have had too much traffic, but the Lord saved us from the wayside and placed us in the center of the farmland
In the last message we saw that the good earth is the people according to the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens
The sower sows the seed, the seed grows and multiplies, and eventually the multiplication of the seed becomes the constituent of the kingdom
It was from that time, after the church was founded, that the tares, the false believers, were sown amidst the true believers, the wheat
These words were not spoken by the Lord in the first parable because at that time the kingdom of the heavens had not yet come
It was when the Lords slaves were sleeping not watching that the Lords enemy the Devil came and sowed false believers amidst the true ones
The vineyard was fenced, limited only to the Jews; whereas the field is worldwide, unlimited, open to all peoples
The sons of the evil one are the false believers, believers only in name, who do not have the divine life in them
The church is not to tolerate the false believers, but both the false and the true are allowed to grow together in the world
The Lord told His slaves not to separate the wheat from the tares, but to allow them both to grow together until the harvest
In the past centuries the Catholic Church has made the serious mistake of trying to uproot those who were considered tares
The wheat, the righteous, will be brought together into the King's barn, the kingdom of their Father, to shine forth as the sun
In Galatians 2:4 and 2 Corinthians 11:26 Paul mentioned false brethren, saying that he was damaged by the false brethren
The judgment upon the tares will be so serious because they have been confusing, frustrating, and damaging God's economy
They also say that the Lord Jesus was not the Redeemer, that His death was that of a martyr, and that His death was not for redemption
At the consummation of this age, the angels will bind the tares into bundles and cast them into the lake of fire
While the Lord's slaves were sleeping, the enemy, the evil one, Satan, came in to sow another seed, the seed of the tares
The book of Acts indicates that certain false ones who had not received Christ into them as their life came in apparently as real ones
In the early part of the fourth century Constantine the Great made Christianity the state religion of the Roman Empire
She taught us the stories of the Bible; however, at that time, although she was for Christianity, she herself definitely had not been saved
Among both the Methodists and the Presbyterians, modernistic missionaries taught the people that the Bible was a book of fairy tales
The third aspect of the kingdom, the manifestation, is in the heavenly part, the upper part, of the millennium
The kingdom of the Son is the kingdom of the Messiah, and the kingdom of the Father is the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
They are real Christians, but the growth of the seed is choked by the thorns so that it does not bring forth fruit
They are poor in spirit pure in heart have all their temper lust self and flesh dealt with have no anxiety and are not deceived by money
What we have seen is absolutely not according to human thought; it is a word according to the divine revelation
Christ has come and has sown the seed, but the enemy has also come in and has done things to cause complications
There are four classes of people: the normal believers, the abnormal believers, the false believers, and the worldly people
Rather we want to be real and normal believers real sons of the kingdom who live according to the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens
As the parable of the tares reveals, the constituents of the kingdom are the sons of the kingdom, who have the divine life within them
Because of these false ones among the constituents, the kingdom in its outward appearance has become Christendom
Formerly it was purely the kingdom of God, but now it has become Christendom with both real believers and false ones
The kingdom of the heavens is not as large as Christendom, for the kingdom is smaller than Christendom and seems to be within it
We have the parable of the sower, who sows the seed to bring forth the constituents of the kingdom of the heavens
The church, according to its heavenly and spiritual nature, should be like the mustard, sojourning on the earth
In keeping with this principle, a mustard must be according to a mustard, and a tree must be according to a tree
In His economy God intends that His children be like wheat or mustard, the smaller and the more tender, the better
We should not be rooted deeply into the earth for a long period of time, for the Lord's intention is that we be sojourners on earth
The birds refer to the evil one and to evil persons, evil matters, and evil things-in short to all evil pertaining to the evil one
Christendom has become a big tree producing no fruit, but having become a lodging place for so many evil things
The church, as the practical kingdom of the heavens, with Christ-the unleavened fine flour-as its content, must be the unleavened bread
The meal offering was not only for the satisfaction of God's priests, but also for the satisfaction of God Himself
When the Lord appeared to Abraham, Abraham told Sarah, his wife, to prepare a full meal with three measures of fine flour
After the papal system had been established, the many pagan practices which had been brought in were confirmed by that system
Consider the charismatic movement which has been brought into Catholicism and even mixed with the worship of Mary
The Catholic Church says that Christ is mysterious, spiritual, and abstract and that people need pictures of Him in order to apprehend Him
Is to bring the heavenly standard down to the earthly level, to bring the gospel to secular society in a worldly way
We must be careful not to take anything other than Christ for God's purpose, because anything other than He is leaven
We can easily become his prey because in our human nature is the desire to make it easy for people to experience spiritual things
The pure and sanctified way to preach the gospel and to bring people to Christ is prayer and the ministry of the Word
In building up the church and spreading the Lord's testimony, the only way is to pray and to minister the pure Word
We must pray until our preaching is in the power of the Spirit, and we must pray until our testimony is filled with the riches of Christ
Not until the hungry and seeking ones come into the Lord's recovery can they find the pure food for their spiritual satisfaction
Many of us can testify that we were hungry for years, but that once we came into the church, we were satisfied
Verse 34 says, 'All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the crowds, and apart from a parable He spoke nothing to them'
They are uttered by the heavenly King, but uttered in a mysterious way in order to make them still a secret from the people
How mysterious it is that the produce of God's farm becomes gold, silver, and precious stones, the materials for God's building
In the first four parables in Matthew we have the life growing, and in the next parable we have the treasure hidden in the field
Gold is the material of the city proper, and precious stones and pearl are the two other building materials for the city of God
The treasure hidden in the field must consist of gold or precious stones, the materials for the building of the church and the New Jerusalem
Based upon the same principle, the sea also signifies the Gentile world, for the Gentiles are the people corrupted by Satan
Ephesians 5:27 says that Christ will present to Himself a glorious church without spot, wrinkle, or any such thing
Speaking of man, Psalm 8:6 says, 'Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet'
The following verses reveal that man has dominion over the beasts of the field, the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea
Revelation 11:15 says, 'The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever'
Christ first found the treasure when He came out to minister, declaring, 'Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near'
He went to the cross to buy not only the treasure, but also the field, and He thereby redeemed the earth created by God
Christ went to the cross to redeem the God-created earth because within the earth there was the kingdom, the treasure
We have pointed out that, according to Revelation 21, the New Jerusalem is built with precious stones and pearls
The fact that these terms are used interchangeably means that the church is equal to the kingdom and the kingdom to the church
As the kingdom we have nothing to do with the Satan-corrupted world, but we are related to the God-created earth and Christ-redeemed earth
God's will must be done on the God-created earth, and God's kingdom must be established on the Christ-redeemed earth
In the New Jerusalem the treasure will no longer be hidden in the field, but built upon the surface of the field
If you have this vision, you will see that even among us today the kingdom and the church are built up together
In every home you see the proper humanity, and immediately you sense that there is no more sea, only the renewed earth
We are not on the earth in a subdued way, but in a reigning way, for we are on the earth as the heavenly kingdom
If among us there is no gossip or criticism, but Christ, the church, and transformation, this is a sign that we are the new earth
The first time the number seven is mentioned in the Bible, it is composed of the six days of creation plus one day, the Sabbath, for rest
The first four parables are all related to foodstuff, but the fifth and sixth parables are related to transformation for building
Although a wafer or even hard bread may be ruined by water poured upon it, this is not true of either precious stones or pearls
It is also a vision of the practical situation of today's Christianity with respect to the church and the kingdom
In Catholic countries like Italy and Brazil it is difficult to find one genuine Christian among many so-called Christians
Although we are not yet completely satisfied, we can say that the churches in the Lord's recovery are like pearls
Some teachers say that the kingdom is related to Israel, but maybe no one says that the pearl is related to the church
We need to apply the parables of the treasure and the pearl not only in a doctrinal way or a dispensational way, but also in a practical way
The Lord spoke not only the four parables for Christendom, but two parables for the genuine and proper church life
Verse 47 says, 'Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a net cast into the sea and gathering of every kind'
The sea into which this net is cast signifies the Gentile world, and 'every kind' signifies all the nations, all the Gentiles
If this is true, then the Lord Jesus would have not been so wise, for He would have used two parables for the same thing
If the seven parables in Matthew 13 covered only the church, then there would be no parable to cover the nations
The normal, real Christians, the overcomers, will be transferred into the manifestation of the kingdom to be co-kings with Christ
Because Antichrist will persecute the Jews and the Christians, an angel will be sent forth to proclaim the eternal gospel
The eternal gospel will command the people to fear God because Antichrist will be leading them to persecute and to kill God's people
According to Matthew 25, the King will judge the nations according to the way they have treated His little brothers
The goats will be cast into eternal fire, but the sheep will be transferred to the millennium to be the citizens on the earth
After the church has been called out of the sea, what remains in the sea is the nations who will be living in the Gentile world
The good ones will be transferred to the millennial kingdom, which has been prepared for them from the foundation of the world
Formerly he was a scholar of the Old Testament dispensation, but now he has been discipled into the kingdom of the heavens
In giving this parable the Lord was expecting that some of His listeners would be scribes not all fishermen like Peter John James and Andrew
Peter, you will be good for the day of Pentecost, good for throwing the net and catching a large number of people
Throughout the centuries, these two parables have not been properly and thoroughly understood, nor have they been correctly applied
Following that, there has been war signified by the red horse, famine signified by the black horse, and death signified by the pale horse
In God's eyes these overcomers are likened to the treasure hidden in the field and to the pearl out of the sea
Many saints in the Lord's recovery can testify that they are not merely wheat, but something more solid, valuable, and precious
After you are reduced, constricted, and transformed, you have the assurance that you are more precious to the Lord
If we examine Christian history, we shall find those who belong in the categories of the treasure and the pearl
As an illustration of the genuine believers, the Lord uses the example of wheat grown from seed sown in the field
The building of New Jerusalem is mainly of the pearl gates and the precious stones which form the wall and its foundations
In order to understand the treasure and the pearl in Matthew 13, we must consider the church and the kingdom in Matthew 16
If you pray over these two chapters, you will spontaneously see that the treasure is the kingdom and that the pearl is the church
We may try to do certain things, but we are restricted from doing them by a mysterious, invisible, inward control
At this point we need to refer to 1 Corinthians 3, where Paul admonishes us to take heed how we build upon the foundation of Christ
Look at Christianity: wood, hay, and stubble are everywhere; but where is the gold, and where is the precious stone?
In the Lord's recovery the quantity is small, but the quality is higher and more solid, because here we have the treasure and the pearl
In today's Christendom the Lord can find a great deal of wheat and a small amount of meal, even in the Catholic Church
Because we are in the kingdom and under the reigning, we cannot do many of the things that other Christians are free to do
At the beginning of His ministry, He decreed, in chapters five, six, and seven, the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens
In addition, He is the greater temple, and we are the priests serving, worshipping, and ministering within Him
He is the Prophet, telling us what to do, guiding us, and leading us, and also the wonderful King, our beloved Solomon, within us
Although as a result of His ministry Christ was unveiled in such a way, His ministry resulted in complete rejection
He forsook the natural, fleshly relationship with the Jews and denied His natural relationships with His kindred
Because the mystery of the kingdom was delivered in parables only those who loved Him followed Him and were one with Him could understand it
Peter, Andrew, James, and John, and all of the other disciples knew that the Lord was the Physician, the Bridegroom, and the Shepherd
He is wonderful, and the kingdom is marvelous; but we need to know how we can get into this kingdom and follow Him
If we are honest and faithful to Him, we must be on this way following the Christ who has been rejected by this age
At the beginning of this pathway, there is nothing but rejection; however, at the end of it there is glory, the manifestation of the kingdom
The religious leaders rejected Christ to the uttermost because they were fully occupied, possessed, and veiled by their religion
If you follow religion, you will remain in Jerusalem, and if you follow your natural knowledge, you will be in Galilee
Because Jerusalem was filled with religious concepts and Galilee was filled with natural knowledge, the Lord went to the desert
In Jerusalem there is religion and in Galilee there is natural knowledge, but in the desert there is the presence of Christ
When Paul was Saul of Tarsus, he knew Christ according to the flesh; he thought that Jesus was merely a little Nazarene
Eventually we, who are not supposed to have scholars among us, printed articles in the newspaper that the opposers are not able to answer
As we follow the Lord in His recovery, we should not know people according to the flesh or estimate them according to the flesh
In the church life in the Lord's recovery we do not care for the outward appearance; we care only for the spirit within, where Christ is
The heavenly King could no longer remain there, and His gracious works of power could no longer be enjoyed by them
He departed from them to the desert where there was no culture, no religion, and, as we shall now see, no politics
According to Matthew's presentation, after the rejection by religion and natural knowledge, there is the rejection by politics
In 12:24 the Jewish religious leaders, representing the entire nation of the Jews, rejected the heavenly King to the uttermost
Now in chapter fourteen, Matthew in his doctrinal arrangement unveils to us how Gentile politics treated the King's forerunner
Up to this point Matthew has given a full picture of how the Jews Galileans and Gentiles rejected the ministry of the kingdom of the heavens
The religionists, those with natural knowledge, and the politicians did not hold a conference for the purpose of rejecting the Lord Jesus
You will see the rottenness and darkness in Roman politics, which was the leading political system on earth at the time
When He heard of the execution of John the Baptist, 'He departed from there in a boat to a desert place privately'
Due to the rejection by all the religious, cultured, political peoples, the heavenly King left them for a desert place
It was not that the King came to their cities to visit them, but that they left their cultured cities to follow Him in the desert
Through all the centuries, the true followers of Christ have left cultured spheres to follow their heavenly King outside the cultured world
In this message we come to 14:14-21, the record of the Lord's miraculous feeding of the crowd in the wilderness
He might have been the one to suggest that the Lord send the crowds away into the villages to buy food for themselves
The Lord's word in verse 16, therefore, is significant: 'They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat'
When he told the man who collected the half-shekel tax for the temple that his Master paid the tax, he was stopped by the Lord
When the Lord Jesus told them to give the crowd something to eat the disciples said We have nothing here except five loaves and two fishes
You may be familiar with the story of this miracle, but you may still lack the revelation or the light it contains
Whatever we have of the Lord we need to bring to the Lord that it might become a great blessing to many others
Verse 20 says, 'And they all ate and were satisfied; and they took up what was over and above of the fragments, twelve baskets full'
Rather, it will be used by the Lord to bless others abundantly, even with a surplus, to testify that this is the Lord's marvelous doing
The heavenly King knew this and would do something miraculously to impress them with their real need and His provision for that need
Do not worry about your needs or be anxious concerning them, for the Lord takes care of them, even at the end of the day in a desert place
Simply offer what you are and what you have into His hand, let Him break the offering, and let the broken offering feed the hungry ones
The miracle here indicates that as the rejected King, Christ has the adequate, sufficient, rich life supply for His followers
He not only takes care of our physical and material needs; He also affords the life supply to satisfy our hunger
Eventually, we did not care about the material supply, but about the life supply to satisfy our spiritual hunger
He takes care of our physical needs and renders the rich life supply, even with an overflow, to meet our spiritual need
As we follow the Lord on the pathway to glory, we first experience rejection, and then we suffer the lack of our daily necessities
The storm in chapter fourteen indicates that on the pathway where we follow the rejected King there will always be troubles
If on our pathway there is no rejection shortage of daily necessities or storm it is an indication that we are not actually on the pathway
He did this not in the desert, but on the mountain, leaving all the people, even His disciples, that He might contact the Father alone
When He compelled the disciples to step into the boat and to go before Him, He foresaw that a storm was coming
What a marvelous picture this is of the high mountain, the troubling waves and contrary winds, and the little boat on the sea!
In order to trust in the Lord, we must look to Him in the heavens where He sits with authority and intercedes for us
The first watch was the evening watch; the second, the midnight watch; the third, the cock-crowing watch; and the fourth, the morning watch
To have faith does not mean that we are able to do things; neither does it mean that we make up our mind to go in a certain direction
Verse 30 says of Peter: 'But seeing the strong wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me'!
Peter came down from the boat and walked on the waves by faith in the Lord's word ; however, when he saw the strong wind, his faith vanished
When Peter cried out for help, 'Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him and said to him, You of little faith, why did you doubt'?
Even if we cannot see the Lord or feel that He is with us, we may be assured that He is on the mountain interceding for us
Some of you cautious ones need to stir up a little trouble, then cry out to the Lord to be saved, and get into His presence
After the Lord had caused the wind to cease, 'those who were in the boat worshipped Him, saying, Truly You are the Son of God'
After Jesus and the disciples came to Gennesaret, the people of that place brought to the Lord all who were ill
Verse 36 says And they besought Him that they might only touch the fringe of His garment and as many as touched were made thoroughly well
According to Numbers 15, the fringe of the garment signifies the virtue of God's people who walk according to His regulations
In typology, the fruit of the tree of life represents the Lord's divine life, and the leaves represent the Lord's human deeds
The fruit, the Lord's divine life, is for nourishing us, and the leaves, the Lord's human deeds, are for the healing of others
When we have the proper church life with the Lord's presence today, there is among us the uplifted humanity of Jesus
If we, the church people, have the proper church life and live by Christ, we shall live out His uplifted humanity
If the church people live out the uplifted humanity of Christ, this will cause a healing power to flow into them
As we follow the Lord on the pathway to glory, we experience rejection, the lack of necessities, and the storm on the sea
The elders spoken of in verse 2 were not the elders of the people, but the people of ancient times, those of bygone generations
Some of the opposers have said that we should return to the so-called historic church and follow the traditional practices
Recently, a group of so-called fundamental Christians even published an article appealing to Christians to return to the historic church
Verse 3 says, 'And He answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition'?
In many ways both the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant denominations make void the word of God because of their traditions
In verse 4 the Lord continued For God said Honor your father and mother and he who speaks evil of father or mother let him die the death
Fallen human nature, however, always attempts to ignore the parents, that is, to rebel against God's government
The Lord as the heavenly King, in order to bring man back to God's government, emphasized that man should honor his parents
Men are still making void God's word by means of their tradition, and we are being accused today of not keeping the traditions
Recently, one of our opposers twisted 1 Thessalonians 5:23, a verse that speaks of the three parts of man- the spirit and soul and body
In Christendom many still insist on the traditions, and in the so-called churches these traditions are very prevailing
The 'church' we are accused of damaging is not actually the church; rather, it is the traditional church, the denominations, the sects
The Lord Jesus and His followers were accused by the traditionalists, and today we are accused by the religionists
In answering those who accused His disciples, the Lord seemed to say, 'You Pharisees accuse My disciples of breaking your traditions
You need to see that you have broken God's commandment by holding to your tradition, and you continue to break it'
In this way the Lord brought them back to the pure Word, telling them what was the commandment of God and what was man's tradition
In the Bible we find something more than what is included in the creeds, for the Bible speaks of the seven Spirits
Isaiah has well prophesied concerning you, saying, This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far away from Me'
Some claim that because Christ is in the heavens, He cannot actually dwell in us but He is merely represented in us by the Holy Spirit
When the Spirit comes from the source, it does not mean He leaves the source, but that the source comes with Him
How can they experience Him subjectively if they do not believe that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit?
Because we say this according to the Bible, we are again accused of making ourselves God and of teaching evolution into God
It is an insignificant matter whether our hands are dirty; it is the condition of our inward parts that is important
Those who follow the traditions may honor the Lord outwardly with their lips, but their heart is far away from God
In verse 13 the Lord said, 'And He answered and said, Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up'
Verse 14 says, 'Leave them alone; they are blind leaders of the blind; and if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit'
In the recovery genuine help has been rendered to assist you to experience Christ in a subjective way and to enjoy Him
They suffered rejection, experienced the lack of necessities, faced the stormy sea, and were accused by the traditionalists and religionists
In chapter fifteen, immediately after the dispute regarding the washing of hands, there is a record of feeding on Jesus
Perhaps in your reading of chapter fifteen you have not found the way to connect verses 1 through 20 with verses 21 through 28
His purpose was to show that what the Lord wants is not the washing of hands, but the eating of Him, the taking in of Him as food
In order to be cleansed from within, something must get into us, and the only way this can take place is by eating
In the church life we are not being washed outwardly; on the contrary, we are being cleansed and purified inwardly
As we pray in this way, we spontaneously eat the Lord Jesus, and He comes into us both as the nourishing food and as the cleansing element
Due to the rejection of the religious Jews, the opportunity to contact the heavenly King came to the Gentiles, even to a weak Gentile woman
The disciples were troubled by the crying out of the Canaanite woman, and they asked the Lord to send her away
Peter could have said to the Lord Lord if You have come to the lost sheep of the house of Israel what are You doing here in Tyre and Sidon
Although the Lord was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, at the time of 15:21-28 He was in a Gentile region
In verse 26 the Lord answered the Canaanite woman: 'It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs'
The Canaanite woman considered Him the Lord, a divine Person, and the Son of David, a royal descendant, great and high to reign
The reason the Lord Jesus did not do something right away was that He wanted to take this opportunity to teach His disciples
The holy land of Israel was the table on which Christ, the heavenly bread, came as a portion to the children of Israel
They threw Him off the table to the ground, the Gentile country, so that He became broken crumbs as a portion to the Gentiles
Verse 28 says, 'Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, your faith is great; let it be done to you as you desire
We can praise the Lord that we are dogs, because the very bread of life from the heavens is now where the dogs are
Even in the barren desert the Lord was able to feed His followers and satisfy them, no matter how many there were
The disciples experienced this before, in 14:15-21; however, it seems that they had not learned the lesson of faith
Whatever we offer to the Lord, however little it is, will be multiplied by His blessing hand to meet the need of a great multitude
When we eat bread, we may not realize that we are also eating leaven, for leaven is hidden in the bread and thus is invisible
Eating is the way to partake of Christ , and eating causes Gentile dogs to become children of God, even proper men
We must beware of eating leaven , especially the religious leaven hidden within religious people, such as the Pharisees and the Sadducees
Christ was the bread, and with the religious people, both the ancient fundamentalists and modernists, there was leaven
In chapter fifteen we see the bread available not only for Gentile dogs, but also for the men in the wilderness
In chapter sixteen the Lord warned His disciples and seemed to be saying to them, 'Take care regarding your eating
By the end of chapter fifteen, the disciples were helped to realize that the Lord Jesus had come to be bread to the children of God
God is endeavoring to put Christ into His people, and the enemy is working to put in leaven as God's children are taking in Christ
Even some of the dear saints in the Lord's recovery may wonder what is wrong with having a soloist in the meeting
Matthew 16:1 says, 'And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and tempting Him asked Him to show them a sign out of heaven'
Suppose Antichrist appeared and set up his image in front of you, and the false prophet was able to make this image speak to you
The religionists, the Pharisees and Sadducees, came to the Lord Jesus and asked Him to show them a sign from heaven
Verse 4 says, 'An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah
In speaking of the sign of Jonah, the Lord seemed to be saying, 'You Pharisees and Sadducees do not need miracles
You need to discern that this generation is evil and to believe in Me and take Me into you as the crucified and resurrected One
At this juncture the Lord brought in the matter of leaven, saying, 'Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees'
We should not believe in any miracle that does not have in it the essence of Christ's crucifixion and resurrection
When some come to a meeting, they care only for speaking in tongues, no matter whether or not the tongues are real and genuine
They have no heart for the pure bread, for the pure sign with the essence of Christ's crucifixion and resurrection
In 16:13-20 we come to a section of the Gospel of Matthew concerned with the revelation of Christ and the church
Before we consider the details of this section, we need to consider the connection between it and the foregoing section, verses 1-12
It was also here that the church was revealed and mentioned for the first time as the means of bringing in the kingdom of the heavens
Only after the Lord had brought the disciples to Caesarea Philippi did He begin to ask them questions regarding who He was
The connection is that if we are still under the influence of religious leaven, we shall never be clear about Christ or the church
If there is still leaven within you, you will be under a veil, and your eyes will not be able to see Christ and the church
Now we can see the reason Matthew placed the first part of chapter sixteen immediately after his account of the corporate eating
Although you knew nothing of Christ, you were familiar with Santa Claus, Christmas stockings, and trees decorated with colored lights
We need to leave the religious center and go far to the north, to the region of Caesarea Philippi, where the sky is clear
As you know, the charismatic movement has penetrated the Catholic Church and has even been mixed with the worship of Mary
The fact that they investigate us but not the Catholic Church exposes their evil intention, which is to suppress us and to terminate us
Verse 14 says, 'And they said, Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets'
After the Lord asked His disciples to say who they thought He was Simon Peter answered and said You are the Christ the Son of the living God
The Father's revelation concerning Christ is just the first half of the great mystery, which is Christ and the church
Christendom, composed of the apostate Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant denominations, is not the Lord's building of His church
The words 'this rock' refer not only to Christ, but also to this revelation of Christ, which Peter received from the Father
Roman Catholicism claims that the rock in verse 18 refers to Peter, whereas most fundamental Christians say that it refers to Christ
It is not an insignificant matter that the church is built both upon Christ and upon the revelation concerning Christ
The Foursquare denomination is built upon the revelation of the foursquare gospel, not on the revelation of Christ
The problem today is that Christians like to form groups or so-called churches according to their concept and viewpoint
Any group that is built upon doctrines, views, practices, or concepts is not the church built upon the revelation concerning Christ
The Greek word rendered 'Peter' in verse 18 may also be rendered 'a stone,' which is the material for God's building
The words 'the kingdom of the heavens' here are interchangeably used for the word 'church' in the previous verse
The authority to bind and to loose is given not only to Peter, the apostle for the church here, but also to the church itself
Whatever the church people bind or loose on earth must be what has been bound or loosed in the heavens already
Following this, there is the corporate eating, the warning regarding leaven, and the clear revelation concerning Christ and the church
Many of us can testify that before we came to such a place, the revelation of Christ and the church did not come
We feed on Christ not only as the crumbs, but also in a corporate way as the rich, unlimited, inexhaustible supply of life
After the revelation of the great mystery concerning Christ and the church, the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ are unveiled
For Christ to build His church, He must go to the religious center, pass through crucifixion, and enter into resurrection
Following the revelation of Christ and the church, the Lord Jesus revealed to His enlightened disciples His crucifixion and resurrection
The disciples heard that the Lord was to be killed, but it seems that they did not hear that He would be resurrected
Verse 22 says And Peter taking Him to him began to rebuke Him saying God be merciful to You Lord this shall by no means happen to You!
Without Peter, we would not have so many revelations, for through his boldness in making mistakes a number of revelations were given
You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men'
Verse 24 says Then Jesus said to His disciples If anyone desires to come after Me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me
Our soul-life is embodied in and lived out by our self, and our self is expressed through our mind, our thought, our concept, our opinion
When we set our mind, not on the things of God, but on the things of men, our mind grasps the opportunity to act and express itself
The Lord's following word indicated that he had to deny himself and not save his soul-life, but rather lose it
If you exercise your mind too much, you will be the expression of Satan, and the Lord Jesus will say to you, 'Get behind Me, Satan'
In verse 24 the Lord said, 'If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me'
The Lord's word here does not have the concept of suffering; His concept concerning the cross is that of killing
From the moment of His baptism, the Lord Jesus was constantly putting Himself under the cross and keeping Himself there
The genuine bearing of the cross builds up the church, because it puts to death the self, the soul-life, and the natural life
If you tried to bend the minds of those buried in a cemetery and they could speak, they would say, 'You have come to the wrong place
Matthews view covers rejection necessity the storm the accusation from religion the leaven Satan the self the mind and the soullife
It is not sufficient merely to pass through rejection or to experience the Lord's supplying our material necessities
Because in resurrection He has become the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit , we follow Him in our spirit
In verse 25 the Lord says For whoever desires to save his soullife shall lose it but whoever loses his soullife for My sake shall find it
In following the Lord we should not save our soul-life, that is, we should not let the soul have its enjoyment
In verse 26 the Lord asked, 'For what shall a man be profited if he should gain the whole world, but forfeit his soul-life?
To gain the world for the enjoyment of the soul is to forfeit the life in the enjoyment of the kingdom in the coming age
It depends on whether or not we keep ourselves under the killing of the cross, on whether we save our soul-life in this age or lose it
His transfiguration was His coming in His kingdom, which was seen by His three disciples, Peter, James, and John
In the next message we shall point out that the transfiguration of Christ was a miniature of the manifestation of the kingdom
His followers not only shared His rejection by the Jews , but were also persecuted and even martyred by Gentile politics
When they were on the stormy sea under the contrary wind, He walked on the sea, calmed the storm, and brought them through
Nearly all the points in that message were the same as those covered in these messages on the pathway to glory
His transfiguration was His coming in His kingdom, which was seen by three of His disciples, Peter, James, and John
Matthew 171 says And after six days Jesus takes with Him Peter and James and John his brother and brings them up into a high mountain apart
Verse 2 says, 'And He was transfigured before them, and His face shone as the sun, and His garments became white as the light'
In the past we pointed out that the Lord's coming will not take place suddenly; rather, it will come gradually
According to Matthew 17:1 with 16:28, His coming was His transfiguration, and His transfiguration was His glorification
One day He brought three of His most intimate disciples to a high mountain, and was there transfigured before them
At the time of the manifestation of the kingdom, our humanity will be glorified by the glorious divinity within us
Thessalonians 1:10 says, 'When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe'
They both appeared in the coming of the kingdom, that is, they were present in the manifestation of the kingdom
God purposely did these two things so that Moses and Elijah might appear with Christ on the mount of His transfiguration
In his excitement Peter made the absurd proposal that he make three tabernacles, one for the Lord, one for Moses, and one for Elijah
In God's economy the law and the prophets were only a testimony to Christ; they should not be put on the same level with Him
God took Moses and Elijah away because He would not tolerate seeing His children rank anyone on the same level as His Son Jesus Christ
In God's economy today Christ is the living lawgiver, the One who has imparted Himself into our being as the Giver of the law of life
Because we have Christ as the real Moses and the real Elijah, we do not need any other Moses or Elijah in God's New Testament economy
As we await the coming of the kingdom, we must learn not to rank Moses, Elijah, or anyone else on the same level as Christ
The vision of the transfigured, glorified Jesus cannot be realized by anyone except in the resurrection of Christ
If we believe in resurrection and live in resurrection, we shall be in glory, even though the manifestation of the kingdom has not yet come
When we live and walk in resurrection, we have the sense that we are in glory and that we can see the glorious manifestation of the kingdom
Immediately after the record of the Lord's transfiguration on the mountain, we have the record of the healing of a demon-possessed person
If we would understand the Gospel of Matthew, we need to remember that Matthew puts different facts together to reveal a doctrine
In the realm of the Lord's transfiguration there is glory, but outside this realm there is the power of darkness
While we are enjoying the transfiguration on the mountaintop, others are in the valley suffering from demon possession
As the heavenly King, the Lord has such authority, but we need to pray, even with fasting, to execute the Lord's authority
According to the concept of Peter, James, and John, the Christ who had been transfigured on the mountaintop did not need to be crucified
Afterward, however, we still need to descend from the mountain and bear the cross in the presence of our husband or wife
No matter how excellent the experience of transfiguration might be, we still need to stay under the killing of the cross
Unless we receive light from the Lord, it is difficult to see the connection between verses 1 through 23 and verses 24 through 27
In chapter sixteen Peter received a clear revelation from the heavenly Father regarding Christ as the Son of the living God
When you are with your wife or husband, the revelation of having been crucified with Christ and of Christ living in you may vanish
If he had still remembered what had taken place on the mountain, he would have referred the question to Christ to hear what He would say
Verses 25 and 26 say, 'And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon?
Whenever the church undergoes a test, the 'nose' is the part that gets hurt because it is the first to bump into things
The Lord asked Peter whether the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax from their sons or from strangers
Peter had received the revelation concerning Christ being the Son of God and he had seen the vision of the Son of God
When the Lord asked Peter whether the kings of the earth received tax from their sons or from strangers, Peter answered, 'From strangers'
When the Lord said that the sons are free, He was indicating that He, as the Son of God, was free from paying the poll tax
Perhaps Peter was about to go after the poll-tax gatherers and tell them that the Lord did not need to pay the tax
The meaning of the vision on the mountaintop is that we should hear the Lord Jesus and not anyone else, including ourselves
When the Lord indicated to Peter that He would pay the temple tax, He did not reach into His pocket, take out a shekel, and give it to Peter
Peter, however, had learned a great deal; and this time, instead of saying a word, he did what the Lord had told him
It implies that Christ is the Prophet, for He told Peter to go fishing and that the first fish would have a shekel in its mouth
Through this incident, Peter was tested that he might know how to apply the revelation and the vision concerning Christ
Now we must see the relationships among the kingdom people, that is, how to be related to one another in the kingdom
Because it is difficult to be together in company, Matthew includes these chapters covering our relationships with one another
The outward reaction or appearance may be different, but the dispositional anger, the anger hidden in our disposition, is the same
The reason there are so many separations and divorces is that the women complain and that the men find it difficult to forgive
Many times when elders were appointed in the churches, brothers were offended because others were appointed instead of them
Nearly every time the leading ones were appointed, some sister was offended because she was not among those appointed
Matthew purposely covers these five problems in his Gospel to show that we must take care of them in order to be in the kingdom
If the hand, the foot, or the eye causes us to stumble, we must deal with these causes of stumbling in a serious way
We so easily offend the little ones for whom the Father cares, and as little ones ourselves we are easily stumbled
Rather, you should go to him with one or two witnesses, hoping that the brother will listen to you and be rescued
The last part of verse 17 says, 'And if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you as the Gentile and the tax collector'
The offending brother who will not listen to two or three or to the church may not necessarily require excommunication
Because he will not listen to the one he has offended, to two or three witnesses, or even to the church, he becomes rebellious
Because such a rebellious brother will not listen to the church, the church must exercise the kingdom authority to bind him until he repents
When he repents, the church must exercise the kingdom authority to forgive him and to restore him to the fellowship of the church
Strictly speaking, in verse 19 'ask' refers to prayer which deals with the brother who refuses to hear the church
If we pray according to the Lord's promise, our prayer will be answered, and the offending brother may be recovered
Chapter sixteen relates to the universal building of the church, whereas chapter eighteen relates to the local practice of the church
According to the context of verse 17, both the reality and the practicality of the kingdom are in the local church
Many Christians today talk about the kingdom life, but without the practical local church life, this talk is in vain
Without the local church, the universal church cannot be practiced; rather, it will be something suspended in the air
If you read this portion of the Word carefully, you will see that the two or three mentioned in verse 20 are not the church
They may gather together in the Lord's name, but they are not the church; for if there is some problem, they need to tell it to the church
The fact that they need to 'tell it to the church' proves that they are not the church, but rather part of the church
Two or three may meet in the name of the Lord and the Lord may truly be in their midst, but this does not mean that they are the church
If we do not submit to the church, we are through with the kingdom, for the kingdom life is a life of submission to the church
The church must be certain that it has the presence of the Lord as its reality; otherwise, it has no genuine authority
Rather, you may have thought that it is merely concerned with Christian behavior, that it is merely a word about forgiving our brothers
If he still does not listen to us even in the presence of witnesses we should tell the matter to the church and let the church deal with him
If he refuses to hear the church then the church should consider him a heathen or a tax collector and cut off his fellowship with the church
If you consider verse 18 in its context, you will realize that it is not an insignificant matter to rebel against the church
If you repent to the church, the heavens will immediately loose you, and then the church will loose what has been loosed in the heavens
Both reveal that our relationship with the brothers and with the church has a great deal to do with the kingdom life
Peter did not ask this on behalf of others; rather, being quick and bold, he asked it according to what was in him
Verses 23 and 24 say, 'Therefore, the kingdom of the heavens is likened to a man, a king, who desired to settle accounts with his slaves
If we do not forgive the brother who sins against us, it will grieve the other brothers, and they may bring this matter to the Lord
Verse 34 says, 'And his lord was angry and delivered him to the tormentors until he should pay all that was owed to him'
In this parable the one who refuses to forgive his fellow slaves is not a false Christian, but a real Christian
The Lord may say, 'No, you didn't rob a bank or damage anyone, but you have not forgiven your brother from your heart'
If you claim to be in the kingdom life in a practical way, why then are you not willing to forgive others from the heart?
If we offend someone but are not willing to repent and ask for forgiveness, we shall be kept out of the kingdom
In the same principle, if we are offended but are unwilling to forgive, we shall also be kept out of the kingdom
In the church life we simply cannot avoid offending one another, for we are daily in close contact with one another
If you still remember a brother's offense against you, it indicates that you have not forgiven him from your heart
Many Christians do not know how to interpret this part of the Word because they have not seen God's dispensational administration
If we do not practice the way of repentance and forgiveness, the longer we stay in the church life, the more offenses there will be
Otherwise, during the millennium we shall be under God's discipline so that we will repent of our offense or forgive the one who offended us
In 19:3-12 the Pharisees tempt the Lord by asking Him about divorce, and in 19:16-22 a rich man inquires of Him concerning eternal life
When we get into the depths of the significance of these things, we see that all are related to entering the kingdom of the heavens
If we mean business with the Lord concerning the kingdom, we must deal with lust, pride, and the love of wealth
The reference to plucking out our eyes or cutting off our hands in Matthew 529 and 30 shows how strict and serious we must be in this matter
If the Lord had seven thousand in this country, He would have a prevailing testimony against all adulterous things
Matthew 19:3 says, 'And the Pharisees came to Him, tempting Him, and saying, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause'?
In verse 7 the Pharisees asked the Lord, 'Why then did Moses command to give her a writing of divorce and to put her away'?
It was given by Moses, not according to God's ordination from the beginning, but temporarily because of the hardness of man's heart
Verse 10 says, 'The disciples say to Him, If the case of the man is thus with the wife, it is better not to marry'
Once one is married, he is fully bound, without any way to be released, unless the other party commits fornication or dies
In verse 11 the Lord said to His disciples, 'Not all men can accept this word, but those to whom it has been given'
The religionists' temptation here afforded an opportunity for the Lord to unfold a further matter concerning the kingdom of the heavens
To be saved is to have God's life enter into us, whereas to enter into the kingdom of the heavens is to enter into God's life
Keeping the commandments is not the requirement for salvation; it is related to entering into the kingdom of the heavens
When we preached the assurance of salvation, all the careless Christians were happy and said, 'Hallelujah, we are saved!
After a message on the kingdom, a wealthy woman once said to me, 'Brother Lee, is what you are talking about related to my going to heaven?
He had come to the Lord to ask Him what he should do in order to have eternal life, that is, to live in the kingdom
In His answer the Lord seemed to be saying, 'Even if you have kept all the commandments, you still are not perfect
You may be perfect according to the law of Moses, but not according to the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens
To be perfect according to the constitution of the kingdom, you must sell your possessions, give them to the poor, and follow Me'
When the Lord mentioned six of the commandments, the young man was very encouraged, for he was one who kept the law
By the divine life with the divine grace, we can say that it is a joy for us to lay up treasure in the heavens
May the Lord have mercy upon us to give us a thorough dealing with these matters for the kingdom of the heavens
Verse 25 says, 'And when the disciples heard this, they were exceedingly astonished and said, Who then can be saved'?
If, for the kingdom's sake, or for the sake of the Lord's name, we leave all these things, the Lord will reward us a hundredfold
We need to believe the promise of the Lord that if we leave everything behind us to follow Him, we shall receive a reward, even in this age
In the manifestation of the kingdom, we shall participate in the enjoyment of eternal life in the millennial kingdom with the Lord Jesus
The first twelve apostles, including Peter, will judge the twelve tribes of Israel, while the others will rule over the nations
Some say that a person who has just been saved but who has considerable experience is an example of the last becoming first
Others say that the young ones, who are last, have become the first, and that we, the older ones, are out of date and have become the last
The Lord seemed to be saying to Peter, 'Those who are the first will be last, and those who are the last will be first
Although you must pay in order to receive the reward of the kingdom, receiving the reward is not a commercial matter
Even if the President of the United States were to give up his presidency in order to have the kingdom reward, that would not mean anything
In the eyes of the Lord, the price we pay for the reward is just a few cents, but the reward He gives is worth millions
The Lord seemed to be saying to Peter, 'Peter, in the kingdom you will be sitting on the throne ruling over the children of Israel
When the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they themselves also received each a denarius'
Peter's natural concept, representing that of all believers, was commercial; he did not know the Lord's gracious wish
The Lord has the right to give the same thing to the latest workmen according to His own wish, in the principle not of work but of grace
Peter's concept, in dealing with the Lord in 19:27, was altogether commercial, according to the principle of work, not of grace
In His answer to Peter the Lord strongly indicated that His reward to His followers is not commercial but according to His desire and grace
To leave all things behind and follow the Lord is not to pay a price; it is to enjoy the grace we have received
If you were in the right spirit, you would be thankful, joyful, and praise the Lord that you are no longer burdened'
Perhaps as we are receiving the reward, Peter will say to John, 'Look, these people are receiving the reward before us'
After giving His disciples a definition of the kingdom reward, He spoke to them again about His coming crucifixion and resurrection
Although we may know everything regarding the kingdom, we must still have a proper grasp of the Lord's crucifixion and resurrection
Apart from experiencing the Lord's cross and resurrection, it is impossible to experience the Lord's life for the reward of the kingdom
He said that he desired to know Christ and the power of His resurrection that he might be conformed to Christ's death
As He was going to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside and told them about His coming crucifixion and resurrection
Rather, verses 20 and 21 say, 'Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Him with her sons, worshipping and asking something of Him
She said to Him, Say that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right hand and one on Your left, in Your kingdom'
The mother of the sons of Zebedee was the Lord's aunt, His mother's sister, and Zebedee's sons, James and John, were His cousins
The selfish entreaty of the mother of John and James afforded an opportunity for the Lord to reveal the way to enter into the kingdom
Standing in the position of man, the Lord was fully subject to the Father, not assuming the right to do anything outside the Father
In verse 24 we see the fleshly rivalry of the disciples: 'And when the ten heard it, they were indignant concerning the two brothers'
The disciples were more than angry; they were indignant, apparently fearing that nothing would remain for them
The twelve were filled to the brim with ambition for position, and nothing regarding the Lord's death and resurrection penetrated them
We need to see that what is in the mind of the Lord is utterly different from what is in our natural mentality
In the New Testament there is a verse telling us that the governing of the elders is lower than the help of the deacons
The Apostle Paul, under the inspiration of God, lists the function of the elders after the function of the deacons
In Catholicism there is a hierarchy of priests, bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope, all of whom are above the laity
Verse 28 says, 'Even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve and to give His life a ransom for many'
No one should exercise control, because we all are under the one Lord and have the one Spirit living in us and leading us
The time of the meetings should not be decided according to the elders' convenience, but according to the situation of the saints
In Matthew 23 the Lord Jesus said that among us there should be no teachers or leaders, but that we should all be brothers
The fact that this incident immediately follows the record of the mother of James and John indicates that James and John were blind
They might have thought that they were following Christ, but actually they were on the wayside, for they had not yet seen the way
Of having a proper understanding of the Lord's crucifixion and resurrection, they were still seeking a position
Acts 26:18 says, 'To open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God'
When the two blind men who had been healed began to follow the Lord Jesus, they were on the way, no longer on the wayside
The Lord had asked them if they were able to drink of the cup which He was about to drink, and they said that they were able
Now in chapter twenty-one they have come to the Mount of Olives, which was just outside the city of Jerusalem, in a suburb of that city
The Lord also indicated to them that He was omniscient, for He could see things clearly without physically being in a certain place
The colt must have been a baby donkey because it is called a foal of a beast of burden, and this beast of burden must have been a donkey
Both the mother and the offspring worked together to bear the King, for He was mounted on both the donkey and the colt
A palm tree, signifying the victorious life, is rooted deeply in hidden springs and grows prevailingly upward into the air
In honoring the meek King with whatever they were, the people recognized that He was the One with the victorious life
In the warm welcome of the heavenly King the people shouted out a quotation from Psalm 118 Blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord
According to Psalm 118, only the One who came in the name of the Lord was qualified to be praised in such a way
The spontaneous praise of the people sovereignly indicated that this meek King came not in His own name, but in the name of Jehovah
When we welcome the Lord into us as our King, He does not go immediately to the throne; rather, He goes to our spirit and cleanses it
At least a few times the Gospel of Matthew mentions children, for this book stresses that the kingdom people need to become as children
The stubborn chief priests and scribes were indignant, even after they saw the wonders the lowly King performed
Their indignation was due to their pride and jealousy, which blinded them from seeing any vision concerning the heavenly King
After many Christians receive Christ into them and experience His cleansing of their spirit, they do not love Him
In the New Testament we read of two houses in Bethany: the house of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus and the house of Simon the leper
During the last week of His life on earth, He went every day into Jerusalem, but every night He went out of Jerusalem and lodged in Bethany
If the Lord Jesus comes into you and cleanses your spirit yet you still do not love Him it means that you remain among the Jerusalem people
According to the Bible, leaves are an outward show, but the fruit is something real and solid to satisfy God and man
According to history, from the last few days the Lord Jesus was on earth, there has been a curse upon the nation of Israel
He cleanses us that we may offer proper worship to God, and He deals with us that we may bear fruit for God's satisfaction
Matthew says that Christ ascended the Mount of Transfiguration after six days, but Luke says that He did so after eight days
These two powers came together to test Christ, who was standing before them as the Passover Lamb to be examined by the children of Israel
If they had said that John's baptism was from heaven, the Lord would have asked them why they did not believe him
Because they were afraid of the crowds, who regarded John as a prophet, they did not dare to say that it was from men
The chief priests and elders told the Lord Jesus that they did not know whether John's baptism was from heaven or from men
In God's economy the birthright was taken from Israel and given to another people, a people composed of saved sinners and tax collectors
Because they received John's way of righteousness, they will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but you will be shut out'
The birthright was taken from Israel and given to the saved, repentant, and forgiven sinners who constitute the church
John the Baptist came in the way of such righteousness, and the Lord Jesus was willing to be baptized by John to fulfill such righteousness
The householder is God, the vineyard is the city of Jerusalem , and the husbandmen are the leaders of the Israelites
When the householder sent his slaves to the husbandmen to receive his fruits, the husbandmen flogged them and killed them
The flogging, killing, and stoning mentioned in verse 35 were the persecutions suffered by the Old Testament prophets
When the husbandmen saw the son, they said, 'This is the heir; come, let us kill him and possess his inheritance'
The stone here is Christ for God's building , and the builders are the Jewish leaders, who were supposed to work on God's building
The kingdom of God was already there with the Israelites, whereas the kingdom of the heavens had only drawn near
In the ancient times the nation of Israel was a vineyard; however, today the church is not merely a vineyard, but also a building
Through Christ as the cornerstone the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers are brought together as one building for God
Christ is not only the foundation stone to support the building, but also the cornerstone to join the two main walls
Was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors
If you are a Jew and reject Him and are stumbled by Him, you will experience Him as the stumbling stone and be broken to pieces
Matthew was the only one among the four writers of the Gospels to give us a clear record of Christ as the stone
When we are built, we shall have the reality of the church life, and the church will be the life-pulse of the kingdom
After such a marvelous revelation, the Jewish leaders sought to seize the heavenly King that they might kill Him
The parable of the vineyard indicates that the kingdom of God was about to be taken away from Israel and given to the church
These first two parables refer to Israel on the negative side, for both the birthright and the kingdom were taken away from Israel
After the first two parables, the Lord added the parable of the marriage feast as the completion of His answer
Matthew 22:2 says, 'The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man, a king, who made a marriage feast for his son'
Another parable is needed for Him to illustrate how the kingdom people in the kingdom of the heavens will be strictly dealt with
The parable of the vineyard depicts labor under the law, and the parable of the marriage feast depicts enjoyment under grace
Verse 3 says, 'And he sent his slaves to call those who were invited to the marriage feast, and they would not come'
Verse 7 says, 'And the king was angry; and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city'
The fact that the troops here are described as the king's troops indicates that all the armies on earth are the Lord's
In the parable of the vineyard, the owner destroyed the evil men because they rejected, persecuted, and killed his servants
After the apostles had been rejected and killed, the Lord sent the Roman army under Titus to destroy the city of Jerusalem
Verses 8 and 9 say, 'Then he says to his slaves, The marriage feast is ready but those who were invited were not worthy
Verse 11 says, 'But when the king came in and beheld those reclining at the table, he saw there a man not clothed with a marriage garment'
In verse 14 the Lord Jesus speaks of many being called, and in Ephesians 4:1 Paul points out that we, the saved ones, are the called ones
In the parable of the vineyard, the Lord was strict with the husbandmen, requiring that their labor reach a certain standard
Most Christians think that the Lord is not strict with us and that as long as we have His grace, everything is all right
The requirements of the second garment are strict, more than a matter of keeping a few commandments or regulations
In the New Testament economy, God does not mainly deal with our doings, but with our living, by whom and by what way we live
It is easy to grasp the doctrine that we have been crucified with Christ, that we live no longer, and that Christ lives in us
Because the man without a marriage garment is cast into outer darkness, many Christian teachers say that he is a false believer
According to the Gospel of Matthew, believers may be subject to dispensational punishment, a subject covered more than once in this Gospel
Those who are not overcomers will be excluded from the enjoyment of the kingdom during the millennium and will probably be punished
When we come back to the pure Word, we see that it is a serious matter to come to the marriage feast without the marriage garment
Some may argue that we do not adequately know the love of God and that we present God as One who is too hard and cruel
Some preachers dare not teach what they see in the Bible because they are concerned about losing their audience or offending others
Remember, one day you will be examined to see whether or not you have the second garment to qualify you for the marriage feast
My burden in this message is not to threaten you; it is to open the pure Word and give you a healthy dose that has no sugar-coating
The overcomers, the chosen ones, will be rewarded and qualified to participate in the marriage feast of the Lamb
Normally they sided with the Sadducees, but were opposed to the Pharisees; here they united with the Pharisees to ensnare the Lord Jesus
If the Lord Jesus had said that it was lawful to do this, He would have offended all the Jews who followed the Pharisees
If He said that it was not lawful, this would have given the Herodians, who stood with the Roman government, strong ground to accuse Him
According to their concept, no matter how the Lord answered their question, He would still fall into their snare
For this reason, the Jewish people had to pay tax to both systems, to the Roman government and to God's temple
They were exactly like the modernists and higher critics of today who do not believe in the Scriptures, in angels, or in miracles
Verse 29 says, 'But Jesus answered and said to them, You are deceived, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God'
They claimed that the shallow water of the sea was blown apart by a strong wind and that this enabled the people to walk on land
In verse 30 He said, 'For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as angels of God in heaven'
Since God is the God of the living and is called the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, these three who have died will be resurrected
When the Pharisees learned that the Lord had silenced the Sadducees, they held a council about what to do next
In all these tests the Lord Jesus was questioned regarding four things: religion, politics, belief, and the law
Verses 41 and 42 say Now while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus questioned them saying What do you think concerning the Christ
People today have many questions but all their questions can be classified into the four categories of religion politics belief and the law
According to him, Christ is at the right hand of God in the third heaven, and the Holy Spirit represents Him in us
The Pharisees had only half the scriptural knowledge concerning Christ's Person, that He was the Son of David according to His humanity
The mention of the spirit in verse 43 indicates that Christ is only known by us in our spirit through God's revelation
Verse 46 says, 'And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone from that day dare to question Him any more'
Of arguing about Christ's Person, we should say, 'Hallelujah, we have a Person who is glorious and mysterious!
And his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace'
We also know that Christ is the Son of God and the Son of man and that He has both the divine nature and the human nature in one Person
In this message we shall consider the Lord's rebuking of the Jewish religionists and His forsaking of Jerusalem with its temple
All things therefore, whatever they tell you, do and keep; but do not do according to their works, for they say and do not do'
For this reason, the Lord told His disciples to do whatever the scribes and Pharisees said, for their speaking was according to the Bible
The scribes and Pharisees put the burden of law on others, but they would not use even their finger to lift it
They also broadened it for the purpose of making a display of how they loved the law, were for the law, and kept the law
The scribes and Pharisees enlarged the fringes pretending that they kept Gods commandments and were regulated by them to a surpassing degree
Verse 6 says that the scribes and Pharisees 'love the chief place at the dinners and the chief seats in the synagogues'
Verse 9 says, 'And do not call anyone your father on the earth; for One is your Father, He Who is in the heavens'
In verse 17 the Lord continues, 'Fools and blind, for which is greater, the gold or the temple which sanctifies the gold'?
To sanctify the gold is to make the gold holy positionally by changing its position from a common place to a holy one
When the gold was taken from the market place and put into the temple, it was positionally sanctified by being in the temple
The sanctification spoken of in Romans 6, however, is dispositional sanctification; it touches our being, our inward nature
The scribes and Pharisees tithed mint, anise, and cummin, but left aside the weightier matters of the law, judgment and mercy and faith
Blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and the dish, so that their outside may become clean also'
Although the scribes and Pharisees cleansed themselves outwardly, inwardly they were full of the love of money and lust
As verse 34 indicates, the scribes and Pharisees later scourged and killed the New Testament apostles sent out by the Lord
After the Lord had been tested and examined and after He had rebuked the scribes and Pharisees, He forsook Jerusalem with its temple
According to the context of the whole Bible, the house here refers to the temple, the unique house, the house of God
At this point the house of God had become 'your house'; it was no longer the house of God, but the den of robbers
When the Lord was cleansing the temple, He said, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a den of robbers'
At the time the temple was destroyed, it was no longer the house of God; rather, it had become the house of rebels
The Lord's word here is brief, but it includes a number of things from the destruction of Jerusalem until the Lord's second coming
As individuals, the Jews still have the opportunity to believe, but as a nation they do not have this opportunity today
Christ will descend and place His feet on the Mount of Olives, which will be cleft like the waters of the Red Sea
For the basic understanding of these chapters we are standing upon the shoulders of many great teachers who have gone before us
According to church history, not until about one hundred fifty years ago were these chapters opened to the Lord's people
Later, Brother Nee held a study of Matthew in which he gave several messages on chapters twenty-four and twenty-five
The prophecy of the kingdom given on the Mount of Olives is a continuation of the Lord's declaration regarding His forsaking of Israel
As the Lord Jesus was going away from the temple, 'His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the temple'
As the Lord was going away, there might have been a distance between Him and His disciples, who were probably still lingering by the temple
Notice that the Lord did not say, 'I have seen these things'; instead, He said, 'Do you not see all these things'?
As they all walked from the temple to the Mount of Olives, neither the Lord nor the disciples had anything more to say
Because the matter was too serious, the disciples asked Him nothing further until they came to the Mount of Olives
Having heard the terrible news that the buildings of the temple would be leveled, they wanted to keep this matter confidential
Not until the Lord had come to the Mount of Olives and sat down were they bold enough to ask Him about these things
In verse 3 the disciples said Tell us When shall these things be and what is the sign of Your coming and of the consummation of the age
His answer in chapter twenty-four deals mainly with the sign of His parousia and with the sign of the end of this age
As we read chapters twenty-four and twenty-five, we need to be clear that the Lord's answer is directed to the disciples' three questions
The 'end' in verse 6 is the consummation of this age , which will be the three and a half years of the great tribulation
Verse 7 says For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and earthquakes in various places
According to history, war has always brought famine, signified by the black horse of the third seal in Revelation 6:5-6
Since Christ's ascension, earthquakes have been increasing throughout all the centuries and will be intensified at the end of this age
On the one hand, they were Jews; on the other hand, they were the disciples of Christ, the representatives of the church
We must be careful not to apply the verses in the section dealing with the Jews to the Christians in the church
We have pointed out that the Lord's word in the section concerning the Jews is a plain word and requires no interpretation
The third section, the section concerning the Gentiles, is spoken in plain words and does not require interpretation
The section regarding the Jews is full of suffering because the nation of Israel is compared to a woman giving birth to a child
Although the nation of Israel has been in the process of delivering a child for such a long time, the child still has not come forth
Verse 9 says Then they shall deliver you up to affliction and shall kill you and you shall be hated by all the nations because of My name
Verse 10 says, 'And then many shall be stumbled and shall deliver up one another, and they shall hate one another'
Because the Jewish believers are to suffer persecution, they are called upon to endure to the end in order to be saved
The gospel of the kingdom including the gospel of grace not only brings people into Gods salvation but also into the kingdom of the heavens
The most important sign of the consummation of the age is the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom to all the inhabited earth
The section concerning Israel is divided into two parts: from Christ's ascension to the end of the age and during the end of the age
We must also be careful not to misapply the verses, that is, not to apply them to the wrong time or to the wrong people
In order to understand the prophecies in the Old and New Testaments, we must have a clear understanding of this matter
Many Christian teachers are confused regarding the prophecies because they are not clear about the end of this age
Because we hope to be raptured, we expect the Lord to be with us until the end of this age, not until the close of the age
In 24:6 the Lord told His disciples that they would hear of wars and rumors of wars, but that 'the end is not yet'
These verses describe the things that will happen at the end of the age, during the last three and a half years
Verse 14 indicates that a strong sign of the end of the age is the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom to the whole world
These things are not the signs of the end of the age, for in speaking about them the Lord said that the end was not yet
The preaching of the gospel of the kingdom to all the inhabited earth will be the unique sign of the end of this age
Immediately after the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom, the events described in verse 15 will take place
Verse 15 says, 'When therefore you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place '
It refers to Antichrist's image set up in the temple of God as an idol at the beginning of the great tribulation
As soon as Antichrist sets up his image and forces people to worship it, he will begin to destroy all religious things
One who is on the housetop should not even come down to take the things out of his house, for the great tribulation has come
The mention of Sabbath here indicates that the Jews will keep it after the restoration of the nation of Israel
Verse 21 says For then there shall be great tribulation such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now nor ever shall be
No other tribulation will be able to compare with this great tribulation which will take place under the hand of Antichrist
Luke 21 indicates that the destruction of Jerusalem under Titus is connected to the destruction under Antichrist
We must be careful not to confuse the verses in Matthew 24 with those in Luke 21, for they do not refer to exactly the same thing
In Matthew there is no reference to the destruction under Titus, which was a shadow of the destruction recorded here
Do not apply 241531 to any time other than the last three and one half years of this age when Antichrist will rise up to persecute the Jews
Verse 22 says And except those days were cut short no flesh at all would be saved but because of the elect those days shall be cut short
They need to be warned that Messiah, the Christ, will not arise here or there on earth, but will descend on the cloud from heaven
Antichrist will be the last of the false Christs and will work signs and lying wonders with the power of Satan to deceive the perishing
Verse 27 says, 'For as the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be'
Christ will also be clothed with a cloud in the air for a time and then will suddenly appear like a flash to the earth
Between the two aspects of the Lord's coming, His coming to the air and His coming to the earth, there is the parousia, the Lord's presence
In the context, verses 15 and 21 imply that at the end of this age Antichrist will be the cause of the great tribulation
According to the previous verses, we can learn what day the Lord Jesus will come to earth, but we cannot find out where
When Antichrist sets up his image, we may begin to count twelve hundred sixty days until Christ descends publicly to the earth
Some even bathed, put on clean garments, and went to a housetop to wait for His coming; however, nothing happened
His coming to the earth will be open and the day is revealed: twelve hundred sixty days after the idol is set up
In this portion of the Word everything spoken by the Lord is related to two matters watchfulness and readiness and faithfulness and prudence
In chapter twenty-four watchfulness and readiness is covered in verses 32 through 44, and faithfulness and prudence in verses 45 through 51
In chapter twenty-five, the parable of the virgins illustrates watchfulness, and the parable of the talents illustrates faithfulness
The word 'But' at the beginning of verse 32 indicates that from verse 32 through 25:30 is another section, the section concerning the church
When the Jews see the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom, they should realize that it is a sign of the coming tribulation
The disciples had asked the Lord concerning the sign of His coming and the sign of the consummation of the age
When its branches become tender and it puts forth its leaves, we know that summer, the full restoration of the Messianic kingdom, is near
Verse 36 says, 'But concerning that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of the heavens, nor the Son, but the Father only'
The believers, however, should be de-drugged and soberly know that Christ is coming to execute God's judgment upon this corrupted world
Due to man's lust, Satan utilizes these necessities of human life to occupy man and keep him from God's interests
Toward the end of this age, this situation will be intensified and will reach its climax during the Lord's parousia
The most striking features of the days before the flood were eating, drinking, marrying, and being given in marriage
People today are studying and working for the purpose of enjoying good eating, good drinking, and a good marriage
During the days of Noah, this climax was reached a little before the flood which came in with the judgment of God
Both 'watch therefore' and 'your Lord' prove that the two men and the two women in verses 40 and 41 are believers
It is very interesting to see that the two men are working in the field and that the two women are grinding at the mill
Remember, according to verse 40 the brothers were farming, and according to verse 41 the sisters were grinding
Some sisters know how to have fellowship about being holy, but they do not know how to do a good job in their cooking
They always cook plain meals for their families, excusing themselves by saying that there is no need for them to waste time in cooking
Notice, the rapture does not take place when the two brothers and the two sisters are praying, but when they are working
He wanted to show us that as we wait for His coming and expect to be raptured, we must be very faithful in our daily duties
The sisters who are wives and mothers must do the best grinding and learn how to prepare the most healthy meals for their families
Do not spend your time in talking about holiness, but spend it in cooking healthy, digestible, delicious meals
You need to prepare good meals to preserve the life of your husband and to build up the health of your children
The brothers who are fathers and husbands also need to work diligently at their jobs to earn the money needed to take care of their families
We should not have the attitude that it is good enough for them to graduate from high school and work in a menial job
As those with a fallen human nature, it is easy for us to excuse ourselves for not spending so much time in the field or at the grinding
Of the two men in the field, one is taken and the other is left; and of the two women grinding at the mill, one is taken and the other left
The householder refers to the believer, and the house, to the believer's conduct and work which he has built up in his Christian life
Therefore,' as the Lord says in verse 44, 'you also, be ready, for the Son of Man comes in an hour that you think not'
Verse 45 says Who then is the faithful and prudent slave whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the appointed time
To give them food is to minister the Word of God with Christ as the life supply to the believers in the church
The faithful slave of the Lord will be set over all His possessions as a reward in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
The evil slave is a believer, because he is appointed by the Lord , he calls the Lord 'my master,' and he believes that the Lord is coming
The problem with the evil slave is not that he does not know that the Lord is coming, but that he does not expect Him
The Lord will not cut the evil slave in pieces; rather, He will cut him off from the glory in which He Himself will be
In chapter twenty-five there is the need of a complementary word for each aspect covered in chapter twenty-four
Matthew 25:13, the last verse of the parable of the virgins, says, 'Watch therefore, for you do not know the day nor the hour'
One indication that the parables in chapter twenty-five are a completion of 24:32-51 is found in the numbers two and ten
The two men or two women in 24:40-41 represent the remaining believers, who will be alive until the Lord's coming
Only a small number, the remainder represented by the two men in the field or the two women grinding, will be alive
Matthew 251 says Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom
As virgins we do not take weapons for fighting or sports equipment for playing, but lamps for testifying, shining, and enlightening
The fact that five are foolish and five prudent does not indicate that half the believers are foolish and the other half are prudent
Verse 3 tells us the reason they were foolish: 'For the foolish, when they took their lamps, did not take oil with them'
The foolish ones were foolish because they had oil only in the lamp, but not the extra portion of oil in the vessel
In addition to the regenerating Spirit, they did not have the infilling Spirit, the extra portion of the Holy Spirit
In Revelation He promised to come quickly, but nearly two thousand years have passed, and still He delays his coming
Going out' proves that the lamps of the foolish virgins are lighted, having oil in them, but not having an adequate supply
Verse 9 says But the prudent answered saying Lest there be not enough for us and for you go rather to those who sell and buy for yourselves
Those who sell oil must be the two witnesses during the great tribulation, the two olive trees and the two sons of oil
We should be ready by always having oil in our vessel, always being filled with the Spirit of God in our whole being
The marriage feast in verse 10 is the marriage dinner of the Lamb , which will be held in the air during the Lord's coming, His parousia
Whether we are prudent or not depends on whether or not we have the extra portion of the Holy Spirit in our vessel
No Christian should neglect these two aspects; rather, we must pay the proper attention to both, becoming proper in life and in service
It is from within that the renewing of our being takes place, and it is from within that transformation transpires
Religion is concerned with outward show, but God's grace in the infilling of the Holy Spirit gets into us and transforms us from within
Regarding the aspect of life, we need to be renewed from within, and regarding the aspect of service, we need to be very active outwardly
Verse 14 says, 'For it is as a man who, going into another country, called his own slaves and delivered to them his possessions'
Verse 15 says, 'And to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his own ability'
While oil in the parable of the virgins signifies the Spirit of God, talents in this parable signify spiritual gifts
We should be eager to know the fall of man, redemption, regeneration, salvation, the cleansing of the blood, and the washing of the Spirit
If we have a heart for the saints and are burdened for them, they, the Lord's possession, will be given to us as a talent
During the past twenty-eight years, more than two hundred eighty churches have been built up under this ministry
Although the talents are not our ability, but the Lord's possession, they are delivered to us according to our ability
Hiding the Lord's silver signifies rendering the Lord's gift useless, letting it lie waste under the cloak of certain earthly excuses
Some may think that the one-talented slave did well in not losing his talent and in returning to the Lord what was His
If you are faithful merely to keep the gospel, the truth, and the church without any multiplication, the Lord will say that you are slothful
A long time signifies the entire church age, and the coming signifies the Lord's coming to the air in His parousia
The one-talented one, who did not gain any profit for the Lord, also came to the judgment seat of Christ in the air
The one-talented one said that the Lord was a hard man, reaping where he did not sow and gathering where he did not scatter
Apparently the Lord is hard in His strictness, demanding that we use His gift to the fullest extent for His absolute work
In a sense the slave's word about the Lord's gathering where He has not scattered and reaping where He has not sown is true
To hide the talent in the earth is to get involved with something earthly, with something other than the Spirit
In the Lord's recovery every brother and sister must bear the burden to take care of others, especially the young ones and the new ones
Although you may be very busy, you can still take care of someone if you have the heart to do so and are willing to exercise your talent
There will be no need for the elders to do everything, for everyone will be functioning to take care of others
In order to make a show that everyone functions in the meetings, the elders sometimes try to make people function
An attitude has been created that it is a shame not to speak in the meetings, but that it is glorious to do so
The best way to use your talent is to take care of others, to become interested in others and concerned for them
Do not say, 'Lord, You are a hard man, reaping where You have not sown and gathering where You have not scattered'
In this way, the one talent will become two, the two talents will become four, and the five talents will become ten
Depositing the silver with the bankers signifies using the Lord's gift to lead others to salvation and to minister His riches to them
If a dissenting brother is contacted by a number of others, he will eventually come back to the church and praise the Lord for the church
You will be renewed in the spirit of the mind, and among us there will be a marvelous testimony of the Body to the whole universe
Taking away the talent signifies that the Lord's gift will be taken away from slothful believers in the coming kingdom
The giving of the talent to the one with ten talents signifies that the gift of faithful believers will be increased
Verse 30 says, 'And cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth'
According to 24:47, the reward to the faithful and prudent slave is that the Lord will set him over all His possessions
Matthew 13:50 concerns the evil Gentiles, the corrupt fish that are equivalent to the goats in chapter twenty-five
Matthew 812 says But the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into the outer darkness there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth
The sister verse, 25:30, says that the slothful slave will be cast out into the outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth
In addition to salvation, there is still the matter of the reward and punishment that will be rendered during the coming kingdom age
Our watchfulness in life is related to the early rapture, and our faithfulness in service is related to the reward
If we are watchful and faithful, then we shall be raptured early and we shall be rewarded when the Lord comes back
At the end of this age, the people on earth will be in three categories: the Jews, the believers, and the Gentiles
When the Lord's prophecy turned from the Jews to the church in 24:32, the word 'but' was used to indicate this change
If the Lord's prophecy had covered only the Jews and the church, it would not be complete, for there would be nothing about the nations
In order to make His prophecy all-inclusive, the Lord had to say a word about what would happen to the nations at the close of this age
Many have taught that the judgment of the nations is the final judgment that the Lord will execute upon us all
We were told to love the poor and suffering ones so that when the Lord Jesus came back we might be regarded as the sheep
Thank the Lord that in His prophecy He used the little word 'but' in two crucial places, in 24:32 and in 25:31
Verse 31 says, 'But when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He shall sit on His throne of glory'
His glory comprises the glory of His divinity , the glory of His humanity , the glory of His resurrection , and the glory of His ascension
Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world'
The prophecy concerning the kingdom given by the Lord on the Mount of Olives concerns God's economy to bring in His kingdom
The result is that God will obtain three peoples, the priests, the kings, and the citizens, with whom He will have a complete kingdom
The nation of Israel is like a woman in travail to deliver the remnant of Jews who will be the priests during the millennium
The believers, covered in the second section of this prophecy, will be the kings, and the citizens will be taken from among the nations
Even the fundamental Christians believe that God judges people only according to two things-the law and the gospel
The gospel we have heard is absolutely different from the eternal gospel, for we were told to repent to God and to believe in the Lord Jesus
In addition to the law and the gospel of grace, the eternal gospel is the third thing according to which God will judge people
Christ will not separate the nations according to the ten commandments or according to their repentance and belief in Him
Rather, He will separate them according to the way they have treated the least of His brothers according to the eternal gospel
Those who treat the least of His brothers in a good way will be 'sheep' , but those who do not treat them well will be 'goats'
All the sufferings in verses 35 through 39 will betide the believers who are left for the trial during the great tribulation
At that time an angel will preach the eternal gospel warning the people to fear God and not to mistreat His people
A voice from heaven will say something like this: 'Fear God and worship Him, and don't do anything to harm God's people
God deals with the unbelievers according to the law and with the believers according to the gospel of Christ during the age of grace
The 'goats' will perish in the lake of fire after Antichrist and the false prophet and before the Devil and the resurrected sinners
If any man follows the Devil to oppose the Lord, he will share the lake of fire with the Devil and the fallen angels
The Christians who will be kings during the millennium will receive what was predestinated from before the foundation of the world
We, the overcoming believers, will share in the spiritual enjoyment of Christ and in all the heavenly blessings
In the prophecy of the kingdom neither the section concerning the Jews nor the section concerning the Gentiles is related to life
Christ is the Lamb of God that God may pass over us, the sinners, as portrayed in typology by the Passover in Exodus 12
According to the type, the Passover Lamb had to be examined for its perfection during the four days preceding the day of the Passover
There was no blemish found in Him, and He was proved to be perfect and qualified to be the Passover Lamb for us
The chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel together how they might seize Jesus by craftiness and kill Him
Eventually, under God's sovereignty, they did kill the Lord Jesus at the feast for the fulfillment of the type
Being grateful to the Lord and loving Him, he spread a feast in his house for the Lord and His disciples in order to enjoy His presence
In verse 11 the Lord said to the indignant disciples, 'For the poor you have with you always, but you do not always have Me'
Along with Simon, Mary also probably thought that this was her last chance to do something over the Lord's body to anoint Him for burial
According to John 13:2, the Devil had put it into the heart of Judas to betray Him, and John 13:27 says that Satan entered into him
In these verses we see three categories of people: the religious ones, the loving ones, and the betraying ones
When the disciples heard this, they were grieved, and each one began to say to Him, 'I'm not the one, am I, Lord'?
After the betrayer, the false believer, was exposed, the Lord established the table with the eleven real believers
The table of the Passover was the table of the Old Testament economy, but the Lord's table is the table of the New Testament economy
In verse 26 the Lord took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying, 'Take, eat; this is My body'
By participating in this life we become the mystical Body of Christ , which is also signified by the bread of the table
After the Passover feast, the Lord Jesus did not take the flesh of the lamb, but He took bread and gave it to His disciples to eat
Rather, we were told to examine ourselves; we were not told that we were taking the Lord's body as our nourishment
Many pastors and preachers today charge people to remember Christ's death as they participate in holy communion
The Lord did not tell us to remember His death, but to remember Him, for He said, 'Do this unto the remembrance of Me'
After the wheat is harvested, the grains are ground into fine flour that is blended into a lump and baked in an oven to make a loaf of bread
As a grain of wheat , the Lord Jesus passed through such a process until He eventually became the bread on the table for us to eat
According to John chapter two, the Jews killed His physical body, but it was resurrected in a mysterious way to become His mystical Body
When we see the bread at the Lord's table, we need to realize that it is a symbol both of the Lord's physical body and His mystical Body
We need to be reminded that as sinners we have the problem of sin and that the Lord Jesus shed His blood to cleanse us
Concerning the Lord's table , the bread signifies our participation in life, and the cup, our enjoyment of God's blessing
Christ has drunk that cup for us , and His blood has constituted the cup of salvation for us , the cup that runs over
The fruit of the vine within the cup of the Lord's table is also a symbol, signifying the Lord's blood shed on the cross for our sins
In this new covenant, God gives us forgiveness, life, salvation, and all spiritual, heavenly, and divine blessings
The Lord shed the blood, God established the covenant, and we enjoy the cup, in which God and all that is of Him are our portion
The blood is the price Christ paid for us, the covenant is the title deed God made to us, and the cup is the portion we receive from God
In this message we come to 26:31-75, a long section in the Gospel of Matthew that is also related to the kingdom
When we come to the Lord's table, we see on the table a symbol of the Lord's death, but we remember Him, not in death, but in resurrection
Through His death our negative situation is settled, and by His resurrection He is able to be taken in by us and even become us
If we see this matter clearly, we shall pay careful attention to Peter's denial as well as to Christ's victory
What was Matthew's main intention in 26:31-75-to unveil the victory of Christ or to expose the defeat of Peter?
At the same time, we must come to realize that we, as fallen human beings, are not able to be the kingdom people
Throughout chapter twenty-six, the Lord Jesus stood in the position of a man, not in the position of the Son of God
Peter heard the decree of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, and he heard all the mysteries concerning the kingdom
He was trained concerning Christ's being the Son of God, concerning the building up of the church, and concerning the pathway of the cross
Perhaps after reading these messages, you have been stirred up for the kingdom and desire to be today's kingdom people
In the light of the contrast between Christ's victory and Peter's failure, let us now consider verses 31 through 75
In His warning the Lord promised that He would be raised up and go to meet with them in resurrection in Galilee
The Lord Jesus had told them seriously that His soul was 'exceeding sorrowful, even unto death,' and He had asked them to watch with Him
Notice that the Lord Jesus spoke this word specifically to Peter, for Peter was the 'nose,' the one who was the most prominent
In verses 36 through 46 we see a contrast between the life that is absolutely able for the kingdom and the life that is completely unable
After praying to the Father three times, He took the Father's will and was prepared to be crucified for the fulfillment of the Father's will
The word 'so' refers to His death on the cross, which was prophesied in the Scriptures and needed to be fulfilled
The Lord, standing before the Sanhedrin like a sheep before its shearers, would not say a word to vindicate Himself
The high priest said to Him, 'I adjure you by the living God that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God'
Without man, God's purpose could not be carried out on earth and the kingdom of the heavens could not be constituted on earth
When the Devil in the wilderness tested the Lord regarding His being the Son of God, the Lord answered by saying, 'Man'
The high priest, Caiaphas, was the same as the Devil, and his question was the same as the Devil's temptation in the wilderness
After the others said that the Lord was liable to death, they spit in His face, beat Him with their fists, slapped Him, and mocked Him
Verses 69 and 70 say, 'Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard; and a maid came to him, saying, You also were with Jesus the Galilean
In his first denial, Peter said only the word; in his second denial, he replied with an oath; and in his third denial, he cursed and swore
After denying the Lord the third time and hearing the cock crow, Peter remembered the word of the Lord, and he went out and wept bitterly
Because we all are the same as Peter, we should not try to follow the pathway into the kingdom by our natural life
Only after we have passed through all the tests and have suffered all the defeats and failures will we realize our need for another life
His death was not a matter of compulsion, but a voluntary fulfillment of the prophecies of the Old Testament concerning His crucifixion
In 27:19 Pilate's wife referred to the Lord Jesus as a righteous man, and in verse 24 Pilate himself called Him a righteous man
In their evil conspiracy, the Jewish religionists persuaded the heathen politician to collaborate with them to kill the Lord Jesus
After giving us an account of all this, in verse 11 Matthew resumes his record of the judgment of Christ by Pilate
It is very meaningful that Matthew inserted the record of the destiny of Judas into his account of Pilate's judgment of Christ
In an attempt to be righteous, he threw away the thirty pieces of silver, for his conscience did not allow him to keep them
When Judas returned the money, the religious leaders seemed to say, 'We cannot keep this money, the price of blood, for the service of God
These verses reveal that righteousness is related to the kingdom and that the kingdom is built upon righteousness
Although they could spy on the Lord Jesus regarding certain things, they did not have the governmental position to judge anyone
The earthly government, the kingdom of this world, is unrighteous, but the kingdom of the heavens is righteous
The Lord Jesus stood before Pilate as the uniquely righteous One, yet He was condemned to death by the unrighteous worldly government
In chapter twenty-six we saw a contrast between the life that can make it to be for the kingdom and the life that cannot make it
The significance of chapter twenty-seven is that it shows the contrast between the kingdom of the world and the kingdom of the heavens
On the side of the kingdom of the world, there is unrighteousness, but on the side of the kingdom of the heavens, there is righteousness
Because of the unrighteousness of the government of the kingdom of this world, Christ was wrongly condemned to die
Verse 26 says, 'Then he released to them Barabbas; but Jesus he scourged and delivered Him up that He might be crucified'
According to his conscience, Pilate also knew that Jesus was righteous and that the Jews were unrighteous in arresting Him
Crucifixion was a heathen practice , adopted by the Romans for the execution of slaves and heinous criminals only
The Lord here, as the Passover Lamb to be sacrificed for our sins, was brought like a lamb to the slaughter, fulfilling Isaiah 53:7-8
Verse 32 says, 'And as they were coming out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name; this man they compelled to bear His cross'
Verse 46 says, 'And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?
God forsook Christ on the cross because He took the place of sinners , bearing our sins and being made sin for us
At the sixth hour twelve noon God came in and there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour until three oclock in the afternoon
Because sin had been judged and the flesh of sin had been crucified, the separation between God and man was taken away
Hallelujah, the Lord's death tore the veil, shook the base of Satan's rebellion, and broke the strongholds of Satan's kingdom!
Verse 53 says that they came out of the tombs after His rising, entered into the holy city, and appeared to many
The Roman centurion and guards testified that Jesus was truly God's Son when they saw what happened at the death of Christ
After the Lord Jesus was buried, the chief priests and the Pharisees came to Pilate and asked him to secure the grave until the third day
During the first three hours, He was dealt with by man, and during the second three hours, He was dealt with by God
Not only was Pilate unrighteous toward the Lord Jesus, but the Jewish leaders were also unrighteous toward Him
In turning man's unrighteousness into God's righteousness, Christ first exposed man's unrighteousness to the uttermost
In all of human history there has not been a case in which man's unrighteousness has been as totally exposed as in the crucifixion of Christ
No earthly court has seen as much unrighteousness as was exposed in the case of the trial and crucifixion of the Lord Jesus
The Christ who exposed man's unrighteousness to the uttermost also bore all the unrighteousness He had exposed
As He hung there on the cross, He was the universal 'dustpan' into which all the 'dust' in the universe had been gathered
Because all the 'dust,' all man's unrighteousness, was put on the cross, the stage was prepared for God's righteousness to be revealed
If there had not been so much unrighteousness, it would not have been possible for so much righteousness to be manifested
The complete unrighteousness of mankind was heaped upon the Lord on the cross so that God's righteousness could be manifested
The gospel of Christ is so powerful not because of God's love nor because of God's grace, but because of God's righteousness
Legally speaking, both love and grace can fluctuate, but righteousness, especially God's righteousness, cannot
Many Christians like to quote John 3:16, the verse that says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son
The salvation we have received today is not merely a matter of love or of grace, but also a judicial matter of God's righteousness
Have you seen the contrast between man's unrighteousness and God's righteousness, between man's kingdom and God's kingdom?
In chapter twentysix Matthew fully exposed the weakness of Peters natural life and in chapter twentyseven he exposed mans unrighteousness
Later, in 28:11-15, the chief priests and the elders bribed the soldiers, paying them to lie about the resurrection of Christ
Few realize that the resurrection of Christ was not only a matter of power, but also a matter of righteousness
According to His righteousness, God had to judge Christ on the cross because Christ was bearing all our unrighteousness
According to Matthew, for Christ to be raised from the dead meant that God released Him according to His righteousness
Matthew includes it to show that Christ's resurrection was related to God's righteousness, which is versus man's unrighteousness
Not only was God's righteousness manifested in raising Christ from the dead, but we were justified because of Christ's resurrection
Let us now consider some of the details of Christ's resurrection as presented in chapter twenty-eight of Matthew
The earthquake signifies that the earth, the base of Satan's rebellion, has been shaken by the Lord's resurrection
The angel came to confirm the Lord's resurrection by rolling away the stone that was sealed and to explain the resurrection to His seekers
Verse 8 says, 'And going away quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to bring word to His disciples'
They went away with fear because of the great earthquake and with great joy because of the Lord's resurrection
Verses 11 through 15 indicate that the Jewish leaders with the Roman soldiers spread a false rumor about Christ's resurrection
They gave the soldiers a large sum of money to say that the Lord's disciples came by night and stole Him away while the guards slept
In verse 14 they said to the soldiers, 'And if this be heard by the governor, we will persuade him and free you from worry'
Verse 18 says, 'And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth'
According to John's record, after His resurrection the Lord met with His disciples in a room where the doors had been shut
Because they needed to be strengthened by life, the Lord came to them as life, breathed upon them, and told them to receive the holy breath
In Matthew the Lord commands the disciples to disciple all the nations to make all the nations part of the kingdom
Verse 19 says, 'Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
Because all authority had been given to Him, the heavenly King sent His disciples to go and disciple all the nations
In verse 19 the Lord speaks of baptizing the nations into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
The visible aspect is the expression the testimony of the invisible aspect whereas the invisible aspect is the reality of the visible aspect
The water, signifying the death of Christ with His burial, may be considered as a tomb to terminate the old history of the baptized ones
The baptism ordained by the Lord here is to baptize people out of their life into the Body life for the kingdom of the heavens
In chapter twelve, the Son, in the person of man, cast out demons by the Spirit to bring in the kingdom of God the Father
In chapter sixteen the Son is revealed by the Father to the disciples for the building of the church which is the lifepulse of the kingdom
Such a baptism into the reality of the Father, Son, and Spirit, according to Matthew, is for the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens
Matthew proves that He, as Emmanuel, is the heavenly King who is with His people continually until He comes back
As the King in the kingdom with the kingdom people, the Lord is with us all the days until the consummation of the age
