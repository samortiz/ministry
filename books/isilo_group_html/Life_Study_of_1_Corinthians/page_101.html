A SPECTACLE BOTH TO ANGELS AND TO MEN</h2><p>First Corinthians 4:6 says, &ldquo;Now these things, brothers, I have applied to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that you may learn in us not to go beyond what has been written, that no one be puffed up on behalf of the one against the other.&rdquo; By &ldquo;these things&rdquo; Paul refers to the things mentioned in the preceding passage, from chapter one to this chapter. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;applied&rdquo; literally means transfigured, transferred in a figure. It is a metaphoric term. What the apostle has written in the preceding passage, beginning with chapter one, gives a figure. Now he transfers that figure to himself and Apollos, that is, he applies it figuratively to himself and Apollos.</p><p>Some translators and expositors think that the expression &ldquo;what has been written&rdquo; refers to the writings of the Old Testament. We disagree. This phrase must refer to what has been written in the preceding chapters, such as: &ldquo;Was Paul crucified for you?&rdquo; (1:13), &ldquo;What then is Apollos? And what is Paul?&rdquo; They are simply ministers of Christ, a planter and a waterer (3:5-7). They are not Christ crucified for the believers. They are not God, who makes the believers grow. They should not be appraised beyond being ministers of Christ, planters and waterers. Otherwise, their appraisers, like the fleshly Corinthian believers, may be puffed up on behalf of the one against the other.</p><p>Verse 7 continues, &ldquo;For who makes a distinction between you and others? And what do you have that you did not receive? And if indeed you received it, why do you boast as not receiving it?&rdquo; It is God who makes a distinction between us and others. And what we have we received from God. Hence, all the glory should be ascribed to God, and we should boast in Him, not in ourselves or in any servants, such as Paul or Apollos, whom He has used. Here Paul seems to be saying, &ldquo;Do you think that it is Peter, Paul, or Apollos who makes a distinction between you and others, or who makes you different from others? Don&rsquo;t think like this. Furthermore, what you received you received not from Paul, Cephas, or Apollos&mdash;you received it all from God. Therefore, you should not boast as if you have not received it. If you have something which makes you different from others or distinct from others, that is something you have received from God. Since God has given it to you, you should boast in Him alone, not in any man.&rdquo;</p><p>Verse 8 says, &ldquo;Already you are filled; already you have become rich; you have reigned without us; and I would that you really did reign, that we also might reign with you.&rdquo; The Corinthian believers, proud of what they obtained, became satisfied with what they had. They became self-sufficient and reigned independently of the apostles. This was altogether in themselves and in their flesh.</p><p>Once again Paul refers to the situation among those philosophical Greek believers at Corinth. They thought they were sufficient, that they were rich and full. They acted as if they were kings reigning without the apostles. Speaking very faithfully, Paul says to them, &ldquo;I would that you really did reign, that we also might reign with you.&rdquo; This word is not sweet, pleasant, or sugar-coated in any way. It is a word that shows Paul&rsquo;s faithfulness.</p><p>In verse 9 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;For, I think, God has set forth us the apostles last of all, as doomed to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.&rdquo; Paul says that God has set forth the apostles last, because the Corinthians were acting as if they were already kings. Here Paul is telling them that they had become kings before the apostles did. This means that God has set forth the apostles last; they would be the last to become kings.</p><p>In Paul&rsquo;s time, when criminals fought with wild beasts in the amphitheater for the entertainment of the populace, the criminals were exhibited last of all. The criminals were regarded as nothing, for they were the lowest of people, those who had committed crimes deserving the death penalty. The Roman government often would have them fight against wild beasts in the amphitheater as an exhibition. Whenever there was such an exhibition, the criminals were exhibited last of all. Paul uses this as a metaphor to illustrate that the apostles have been set forth by God to be the last show, the last exhibition. The Corinthians were not last; the apostles were those who were last. The apostles considered themselves as criminals doomed to death before the world, not as kings destined to reign like the Corinthians.</p><p>Paul also tells the Corinthians that the apostles had become &ldquo;a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.&rdquo; This also is a metaphor, referring to fights between criminals and wild beasts in the Roman amphitheater. The apostles became such a spectacle to the world, seen not only by men but also by angels. Both men on earth and angels in the air were watching the exhibition of the apostles. Hence, they were a spectacle to the whole universe. As we shall see in the next message, this is related to their becoming &ldquo;the offscouring of the world&rdquo; and &ldquo;the scum of all things&rdquo; (v. 13).</p><p>By using these metaphors Paul was telling the Corinthian believers that they should not act as if they were kings or as if they were rich and had everything. Paul seems to be saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t behave like kings. God has made us, the apostles, last in the divine exhibition. We are as criminals doomed to death. This is our destiny. But you seem to be enjoying another kind of destiny. You are rich, you are full, and you are reigning. We, however, are a spectacle.&rdquo;</p><p>Paul&rsquo;s word to the Corinthians applies to us today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We also should be like the apostles in verse 9&mdash;criminals doomed to death and a spectacle both to angels and to men. We should not consider ourselves those who are full, rich, and powerful. This attitude is altogether wrong. We in the recovery must give others the impression that we are as criminals condemned to death and a spectacle to the whole universe.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_100.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_102.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 Corinthians &nbsp; pg 101</div><br></body></html>
