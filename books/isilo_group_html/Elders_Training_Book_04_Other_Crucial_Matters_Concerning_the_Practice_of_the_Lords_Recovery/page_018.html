This has been a debatable subject in church history. &#8220;In Ephesus&#8221; (v. 1) is not found in earlier manuscripts. There is a question as to when the words &#8220;in Ephesus&#8221; were inserted into the manuscript. Some good Greek manuscripts indicate that this Epistle was not definitely written to Ephesus. In other words, it was not written definitely to a particular local church.<p>In this entire book of six chapters the only definite reference to the local aspect of the church is in 2:22. The building in verse 21 is universal and the building in verse 22 is local. The word &#8220;also&#8221; in verse 22 indicates these two aspects. Undoubtedly, this book was written to a certain locality, but the general concept of the book is concerning the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all. Chapter two of Ephesians is actually concerning God&#8217;s universal dwelling place.<p>Concerning the practice of the church life, we must stress the local church. Without the local church, you could not have a practical church life. However, concerning the testimony that the church bears, we must stress the Body, which is the universal aspect of the church. These two aspects are definitely and distinctly revealed in Romans. The first eight chapters of Romans cover two main items-justification and sanctification. These items are mainly concerning the individual believers. Everyone must be justified and sanctified. The second half of Romans is also of eight chapters. Chapters nine through twelve are on the Body and chapters thirteen through sixteen end with the local churches. Concerning the testimony of the church, we must stress the Body. Concerning the practicality of the church, we must stress the local church. Without the local church, the Body would be something in the air. It would not be practical. With the testimony of the church, however, we must be extra-local and the Body must be stressed.<p>Sometimes expositors might be forced to say that a church in a locality is a local Body. This may be said temporarily. Actually, not one local church is the Body. Every local church is a part of the Body. The Body can never be divided into localities, but in the sense of the churches, they are in different localities. There are many local churches but there are never many bodies. We must see this and we must be balanced.<p>The tragedy is this: when Christians should pay attention to the local churches they take Ephesians as a refuge, saying that the church is universal; when they should take care of the universal testimony, they &#8220;run away&#8221; from Ephesians and take Revelation 1:11 as a refuge, saying that every local church has its own jurisdiction. The seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 are all different from one another. The seven lampstands, however, are absolutely not different. They are altogether the same in nature, in shape, in makeup, and in function. Today when Christians talk about the church, they should cover the local churches, but they run away from Revelation and go to Ephesians, taking Ephesians as a refuge. When they should bear the testimony of the one Body, they run away to Revelation and give up Ephesians. In Revelation 2 and 3 every local church is different, but in chapter one the seven lampstands are not different in any aspect. They are absolutely the same in size, in quality, in standing, in shape, in makeup, and in function.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 04: Other Crucial Matters Concerning the Practice of the Lord's Recovery &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
