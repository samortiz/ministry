<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CHRIST BEING THE SHOOT OF JEHOVAH<br>AND<br>THE FRUIT OF THE EARTH</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Isa. 4:2-6; 7:14; Matt. 1:22-23; John 1:14; Luke 1:42; Heb. 2:14; John 12:24; Exo. 40:34-35, 38; Num. 9:15-16; 2 Cor. 12:9</H1><P>Isaiah is a rich book concerning Christ. In this series of messages, we want to see the all-inclusive Christ in the book of Isaiah. We need to thank the Lord, our Immanuel, that in these last days, He has opened up the depths of this book to us.</P><P>In this message we would like to read a new translation of Isaiah 4:2-6:</P><P>2In that day the Shoot of Jehovah will be beauty and glory, and the Fruit of the earth, excellence and splendor, to those of Israel who have escaped.</P><P>3And he who is left over in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone who has been written down in Jerusalem for life;</P><P>4When the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and has cleansed away the bloodstains of Jerusalem from her midst, by the judging Spirit and the burning Spirit.</P><P>5Jehovah will create over the entire region of Mount Zion and over all her convocations a cloud of smoke by day, and the brightness of a fiery flame by night; for over all, the glory will be a canopy.</P><P>6And there will be a tabernacle as a daytime shade from the heat and as a refuge and a cover from storm and rain.</P>
