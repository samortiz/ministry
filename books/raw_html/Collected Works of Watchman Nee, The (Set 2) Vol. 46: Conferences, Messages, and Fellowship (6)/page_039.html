<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINETY</h1><h1 class="title">THE PRESENT WILL OF GOD</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Num. 14:29-30, 40, 44-45; 20:10-12</h1><p>The passages concerning Moses striking the rock a second time are quite serious. They speak of a Potter and a marred vessel; they also speak of God changing His mind. In these passages, the vessel that was designated for God's original plan was marred. It was not marred by the Potter but by something in the clay. However, the vessel was only marred; it was not broken.</p><p>Moses is a very prominent man in the Old Testament, and great attention is given to the details of his life. But Moses failed to "sanctify [Jehovah] in the eyes of the sons of Israel" (Num. 20:12). Moses was the meekest man on the earth, but he was rash when he said, "Hear now, you rebels; shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock?" (Num. 20:10). He brought God into the wrong light; therefore, God changed His plan concerning him. God had to vindicate Himself; therefore, He had to prepare another vessel. When Israel was told of its punishment for refusing to go into the land, they decided to go in according to His original command. But God had changed His mind. They went to their death, for the Amalekites smashed them to pieces.</p><p>We must not hold on to something that God spoke to us last year. We must always hold on to God and live in the present will of God because God may change His mind. We must know Him in a more intimate way and avoid any carelessness in life and service that would cause Him to change His mind. However, if a second will has been ordained, there is only death in striving to be according to the first. The Israelites were slain when they insisted on holding on to the first will of God. We cannot play with the will of God. There is no way to tell whether or not God will change His mind and ways. The fear of God is the most important thing in the Christian life. Our attitude should be, "Lord, what is Your present will? Keep me near to You and fearing You. Keep me for Your best, but if something in me has caused You to change Your mind, I am willing to be according to Your second will. If setting me aside vindicates Your holiness among Your people and if Your punishment shows Your children a clearer way, I am willing." God's glory must be vindicated, even at the expense of our pleasure and happiness. We must be pliable and ready to take the second place. We must bow to His governmental hand, and one day He may restore us. "Therefore be humbled under the mighty hand of God that He may exalt you in due time" (1 Pet. 5:6).</p><p>We must live in the present will of God. We must not be proud of our past. A present relationship is necessary. We must be pliable and must always be open to Him. If we have really learned the cross, we will prostrate ourselves before Him before the judgment seat is even here. God's glory must be vindicated, even at the expense of our happiness. The solemnity of the possibility of God changing His mind demands that we walk softly before Him with open minds. We need grace to overcome everything which would resist Him, because there is always the possibility of being cast aside in service. Let us presume and assume nothing. Our God is a consuming fire. He is our loving Father, but He is also sovereign in His governmental ways.</p><p>"Lord, I will learn to fear You. I will never have anything in my life that would resist You."</p>
