   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE KING'S ANTECEDENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND STATUS 7</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We come now to chapter two of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous messages we have covered the genealogy of Christ and the birth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we shall consider the youth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>HIS YOUTH A. The Record of Christ's Youth</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>in Matthew and Luke</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we pay attention to the four Gospels, we shall see that John and Mark contain no record of Christ's youth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John tells us that Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With God there is neither youth nor old age.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God is ancient, yet unchanging.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, there is no problem of youth with God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Mark, Christ is revealed as a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No one cares about the youth of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the contrary, both Luke and Matthew record the youth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, as was the case with the genealogies, there is a difference between these two records of Christ's youth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Luke's Record</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Proving the Humanity of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Gospel of Luke proves that Christ was a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, Luke's record testifies and demonstrates the humanity of Jesus Luke 2:21-52 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The items of Christ's youth recorded by Luke show that Jesus was a proper, normal man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Jesus was circumcised on the eighth day according to Jewish law Luke 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Also, according to Jewish custom, He was named Jesus on the eighth day, not on the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was offered to God with the sacrifice of a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons Luke 2:22-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The fact that Mary and Joseph could only afford a small sacrifice shows that they were poor.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They nevertheless fulfilled the requirement of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, Jesus was brought to Jerusalem every year at the time of the feast of the Passover Luke 2:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was also according to the law requiring that all Israelite males attend the feasts three times a year.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Luke specifically notes that Jesus was brought to the feast when He was twelve years old Luke 2:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Luke also records that Jesus grew physically, that He became strong in His spirit, and that He found favor with God and man Luke 2:40, 52 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All these items recorded by Luke demonstrate that Jesus was a typical man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Matthew's Record</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Proving the Kingship of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Matthew's record demonstrates that the young Jesus was the King of God's people 2:1-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Luke did not include this point, but Matthew, ignoring all the points covered by Luke, dwells on it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By this we see that the Bible has an intention: in Luke it is to prove that Jesus was a man; in Matthew it is to show that Jesus was a kingly child.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We shall now consider Matthew's record to see how Jesus was such a kingly child.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not try to understand the Bible by the black and white letters alone.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must enter into it and find something of life in it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Matthew 1 tells us that the Old Testament contained prophecies concerning Christ and that the people of God were waiting for His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Matthew 1 Jesus came.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ has been brought into humanity; He has appeared on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Chapter two continues by showing the way to find Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His coming was prophesied, He has come, and He is here.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, there is the problem of how to find Him.</S>
