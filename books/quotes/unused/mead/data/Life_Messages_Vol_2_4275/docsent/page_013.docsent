   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO RECEIVE OF HIS FULLNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>His fullness comes to us in two ways: by the Word and by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We can liken this to electricity with its two wires, the antenna and the ground wire.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit is the antenna, and the Word is the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These are the two lines that convey the heavenly electricity, which is Christ Himself, the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is brought into the house, our being, by means of these two wires, the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you read the Gospel of John carefully, you will notice that at the beginning Christ is presented as the Word; then toward the end He becomes the Spirit 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the Word He is the ground wire; He came down to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the Spirit He is the antenna.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These two, the Word and the Spirit, are brought together in John 6:63: "The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the antenna and the ground wire become one, the electricity comes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the Word and the Spirit are intertwined, Christ is conveyed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How can we receive Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must read the Word and touch the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then we have both the antenna and the ground wire.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This brings the heavenly electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With the Word as the ground wire and the Spirit as the antenna, all the riches of Christ will be transmitted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This receiving is not once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It began when we believed in the Lord Jesus, receiving Him as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It should continue all day long, every day, along these two wires.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I trust that by our considering the Gospel of John together in this way, your appetite for the Word has been stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Several times every day come to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Pray over it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Understand and receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Read it and love it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>STUDYING THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I hope we shall eventually have the whole New Testament in the Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For the present you can study the books we have already finished.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you will use them, they will save you much time and effort.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It has taken a great deal of research and many hours to compile them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have checked interlinear translations, lexicons, concordances, and many other translations.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By using the Recovery Version of the books we have completed, you will get all the benefit of our efforts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It will save you from studying too much on your own; studying is sometimes a frustration to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Especially read John, Romans, Hebrews, Ephesians, Colossians, and Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Leave Matthew aside at first; that is a hard book.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Besides your morning reading of a few verses, spend some other time to delve into these books.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One way to study them is to notice the key words.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In John, for example, pay attention to the word came.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then consider the word receive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our receiving will last even to eternity, because we shall still have the water of life to drink and the tree of life to eat of.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>AN ORGANIC RECEIVING</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How do we receive this Triune God?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is first by believing into Him, then by drinking, eating, and breathing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Drinking and eating are the best ways to receive, but the fastest is by breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These are the three means of receiving what is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To accept something that is handed to you is not an organic receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But drinking, eating, and breathing are; they cause a metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You must read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You cannot drink without something to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You cannot eat without food.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You cannot breathe if there is no air.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The water, the food, and even the air are all in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Come to the Word at least three times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You must build up this habit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As you get older, you will be grateful that you did.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>MEETING TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Word will make you grow and experience the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then you will be impelled into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The word ecclesia, which we translate church, means a called-out congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Without meeting together or congregating there can be no church life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The more meetings we have, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our coming together is not just with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We come with Christ, with the growth in life, and with the experience of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This will make our meetings living.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Merely to shout "Praise the Lord!" may not help the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>From the Old Testament we can see that when the children of Israel gathered together, they brought a rich surplus of the produce of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>No one could appear there empty-handed Deut 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It was not sufficient simply to shout.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Of course, they did come singing the psalms of blessing, but singing was not the main factor.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They had to bring a surplus of their produce.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>For us this means that we come to the meetings with the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>How full our meeting will be depends on how much we have experienced Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Our experience of Christ is dependent upon our daily eating of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Word is our source.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Eating of it regularly is basic.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Our Christian life and the church life both stem from our being in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we practice this in a thorough way, every one of us will be a shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When we meet together, the church will be strong.</S>
