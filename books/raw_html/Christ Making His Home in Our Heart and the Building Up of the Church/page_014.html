	 <h2 class="head1">THE TWO &ldquo;BECOMINGS&rdquo; OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>In verses 16 and 17 the Lord, the Father, and the Holy Spirit are mentioned. Are these three Gods? Matthew 28:19 says, &ldquo;Baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; In this verse the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are plural in number, yet the word <em>name</em> is singular. This shows that God is triune. He is the one unique God, yet He is the Father, Son, and Spirit. This is something that the human mind cannot explain. For this reason, some theologians have attempted repeatedly to use analogies to explain this three-one reality. One of the analogies that is often used is vapor, water, and ice. Apparently, these are three substances, but they are actually one. It is one substance in three forms. When vapor cools down, it becomes water, and when water cools down further, it becomes ice. Ice is water, and water is vapor. The theologians who use this analogy say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are just like ice, water, and vapor.</p>
<p>However, this analogy is not only incomplete; it also has the danger of deviating from the truth. In an ordinary situation ice, water, and vapor cannot exist simultaneously. According to the revelation of the Bible, the Father continued to exist when He was incarnated in the Son, that is, when the Word became flesh. Furthermore, the Son continued to exist when He became the Spirit. The three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;exist simultaneously. Therefore, human analogies cannot give a correct and complete explanation of the Triune God.</p>
<p>In the beginning God was in heaven, dwelling in unapproachable light. He was dwelling in light that man can neither comprehend nor approach (1 Tim. 6:16). He is the Father as the source. One day God was manifested. The Word which was in the beginning became flesh (John 1:1, 14). This is the first becoming of God. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, declared the God whom no one has ever seen (v. 18). Hence, the Son is the manifested God. No one has ever seen God, but the Son manifested Him. The Father is the hidden God. The God who hides Himself in a place that no one can see is the Father. The Son is the manifested God. The God who manifests Himself is the Son. Therefore, when the Bible speaks of the Father, it refers to God as the source. When the Bible speaks of the Son, it refers to God manifested. As the Son, God could only be manifested among men. He could not enter into men. Hence, God needed to go through another &ldquo;becoming.&rdquo; First, the Word became flesh; the hidden Father became manifested in the Son. Then the Son &ldquo;became a life-giving Spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:45b). These are the two &ldquo;becomings&rdquo; of the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN&mdash;<br />
GOD IN MAN AND MAN IN GOD</h2>
<p>As the source, God is the Father, whom man cannot approach. However, He came in the Son to be among men and was seen by men. At that time, the Lord was with the disciples on the earth. One day the disciples asked the Lord to show them the Father, and the Lord answered, &ldquo;He who has seen Me has seen the Father&rdquo; (John 14:9). Hence, knowing the Lord is equivalent to knowing the Father. The Lord came to manifest the Father. The Lord is the manifested God; hence, he who has seen the Lord has seen the Father. However, there was still one more thing that needed to be accomplished&mdash;the Lord needed to enter into His disciples. If the Lord did not enter into His disciples, the mystery in the universe would not have been accomplished; that is, God would not have been mingled with man. In order for the Lord to enter into His disciples, He had to go through another &ldquo;becoming.&rdquo; For this reason, the Lord said that He would ask the Father to give us the Comforter, the Holy Spirit (vv. 16-17, 26). The Holy Spirit is the Son, and the Son is the Father. The Father came in the Son to be among men, and the Son became the Spirit to enter into man. Because the Son lives, we who believe in Him also live (v. 19). When we live because of the Son, we know that He is in the Father and that we are in Him, and He is in us (vv. 19-20). This is the mingling of God and man.</p>
<p>My desire is that we would see God&rsquo;s salvation. Today not only do educated people, such as scientists, politicians, and philosophers, not know God&rsquo;s salvation, but even many theologians and pastors do not have a complete understanding of God&rsquo;s salvation. God&rsquo;s salvation is the mingling of God and man; it is God in man and man in God. The Bible is a story of the Triune God working Himself into man and working man into Himself. This is God&rsquo;s salvation. Just as our clothes, eyeglasses, and pens are not our person, matters such as forgiveness of sins, justification, sanctification, and escape from eternal perdition are not the focus of God&rsquo;s salvation. Forgiveness of sins and sanctification are not the substance of God&rsquo;s salvation. The substance of God&rsquo;s salvation is the Triune God being mingled with man and man being mingled with the Triune God.</p>
<p>Are you joyful to have the Triune God dwelling in you? You might rejoice because you have a gold watch. However, now that the Triune God, who is the Lord, is in you, are you rejoicing? Do you treasure this? Nothing can be more glorious and precious than having the Lord in us. It is a pity that many people do not realize this. If we tell a child that there is water in the air or that there is vapor in the air, he may not understand or believe us. However, we know that vapor is in the air. Vapor is water, and though we may not be able to touch it or feel it, it is in the air. Similarly, it is a fact that the Spirit of the Lord lives in you. It is also a fact that the Spirit is the Lord and that the Lord is God. Hence, the Spirit being in you is God being in you. Perhaps you do not feel it, but this is the fact. The Spirit is in you, the Spirit is the Son, and the Son is the Father. This is the Triune God in you.</p>
