<h1 class="title">The New Man<br />
(1)<br />
Putting On the New Man and<br />
the Constitution and Renewing of the New Man</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 3:5-11, 17; Eph. 2:15; 4:22-24</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The ultimate goal of God in His economy is to gain the new man constituted with the all-inclusive, extensive, preeminent Christ wrought into a corporate people&mdash;Col. 1:27; 2:2, 9, 16-17; 3:4, 10-11.</li>
<li>The new man equals the Body of Christ&mdash;vv. 10, 15; Eph. 2:15-16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>The new man</em> and <em>the Body</em> are synonyms and may be used interchangeably:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The emphasis on the church being the Body of Christ is on life; the emphasis on the church being the one new man is on the person&mdash;1 Cor. 12:12; Eph. 4:4; 2:15; 4:24.</li>
		<li>As the Body of Christ, the church needs Christ as its life; as the new man, the church needs Christ as its person&mdash;Col. 3:4; Eph. 3:17a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ and we together form a universal man; as the One in heaven, Christ is the Head, and as those on earth, we are the Body&mdash;Col. 1:18a.</li>
	<li>The new man is the corporate God-man, with Christ, the firstborn Son, as the Head and the believers, the many sons of God, as the Body; for the new man as the corporate God-man we need to live the life of a God-man&mdash;3:10; Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:10; Phil. 1:19-21a.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Although the new man was already created in Christ, we still need to put on the new man&mdash;Col. 3:10; Eph. 2:15; 4:24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Since the new man is the Body of Christ, to put on the new man means to live a life by the Body, not individually but corporately:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Individualism is hateful in the sight of God; if we would know the Body, we need to be delivered from our individualistic life&mdash;1 Cor. 12:18-20.</li>
		<li>The strongest proof that we have seen the Body is that we can no longer be individualistic&mdash;Acts 9:4-6; Philem. 14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Before our salvation we were living in the old man, in the old society, but now we are members of Christ, living in His Body; thus, we should put off the old man with the old social life and put on the new man, the church&mdash;Col. 3:10, 15; Eph. 4:4, 22-24.</li>
	<li>In order to put on the new man in an experiential way, we need to take Christ as our person&mdash;3:17a; Gal. 2:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church is the new man, and in this new man there is only one person&mdash;Christ&mdash;Matt. 17:5; Col. 3:10-11.</li>
		<li>The old man must be put off, and we must live by our new person&mdash;vv. 5-9; Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20; Eph. 4:22-24.</li>
		<li>When we live by taking Christ as our person, especially in making decisions, our living will be the living of the new man&mdash;John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38; Rom. 15:32; James 4:13-15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If we would put on the new man in a practical way, we need to do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus&mdash;Col. 3:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The name denotes the person, and the Lord&rsquo;s person is the Spirit&mdash;2 Cor. 3:17a.</li>
		<li>To do things in the name of the Lord is to act in the Spirit; this is to live Christ&mdash;Gal. 5:16; Rom. 8:4; Phil. 1:21a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The new man is Christ constituted into us&mdash;Col. 3:10-11; Eph. 3:17a; 4:24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As the One who indwells us and who is our life, Christ is the constituent of the new man&mdash;Col. 1:27; 3:4.</li>
	<li>The Christ we enjoy as our God-allotted portion becomes the constituent of the new man&mdash;1:12; 3:10-11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Through enjoying the all-inclusive, extensive, preeminent Christ we experience Him as the content and constituent of the new man.</li>
		<li>The issue of our experience and enjoyment of Christ is the church as the new man; as we enjoy Christ, He is constituted into us, and we become the new man&mdash;1:27; 3:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Because Christ is all and in all, in the new man there is room only for Christ; there is no room for the natural man&mdash;v. 11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Since Christ is all and in all in the new man and we are part of the new man, we are part of Christ.</li>
		<li>Christ is everyone in the new man, and He is in everyone in the new man&mdash;v. 11.</li>
		<li>The only way Christ can be all and in all in the new man is for Him to be constituted into us&mdash;Eph. 3:17a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Concerning the new man, we need to be &ldquo;renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him&rdquo;&mdash;Col. 3:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Because the new man was created with us, who belong to the old creation (Eph. 2:15), as his constituents, he needs to be renewed; this renewing takes place mainly in our mind as the mingled spirit spreads into our mind and saturates it&mdash;Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23.</li>
	<li>The new man is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of the One who created him&mdash;Col. 3:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This image is Christ, God&rsquo;s Beloved&mdash;the wonderful, glorious, all-inclusive Christ&mdash;as the expression of God&mdash;1:15.</li>
		<li>We need to be renewed in our mind unto full knowledge according to the expression of God, according to what Christ is.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The renewing of the new man depends on our seeking the things which are above&mdash;3:1-2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we turn to the heavenly Christ with all His activities and set our mind on these things, the renewing of the new man will take place spontaneously&mdash;Heb. 8:1-2; 12:2; Col. 3:2, 10.</li>
		<li>When we set our mind on the things above, the way is open for the divine element to spread from our regenerated spirit into our soul; this spreading of the divine element within us is according to Christ, who is the image of God, God&rsquo;s expression.</li>
		</ol></li>
