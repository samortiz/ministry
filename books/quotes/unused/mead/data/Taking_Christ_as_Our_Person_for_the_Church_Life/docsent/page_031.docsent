   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Renewed in the Mind and</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not Following the Fashion of the Age</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After our body is presented, it is essential that our mind be renewed Rom 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are many different kinds of people in the church, and according to our nature, we all have some peculiarities.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church involves the gathering of hundreds and even thousands of people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If our mind is not being renewed, the church will be in constant turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thank the Lord that we have one life and are one person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, we have one mind; that is, we have the mind of Christ as our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Having the mind of Christ is related to being transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord also requires us to not be fashioned according to this age v. 2 , that is, to not be overly fashionable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever a saint pursues being modern or fashionable, he is finished with the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To put off the old man is to put off the fashion of this age; to put on the new man is to put on the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No saint who is fashionable can serve God in the church, because this fashionableness is just the devil in disguise.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whoever is fashionable is on the devil s side.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is very easy for saints who desire to be fashionable to damage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord has had mercy upon the churches, and the spirits of the saints have been strong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For this reason the church has not been influenced by fashionable things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever something fashionable is brought in, the spirits of the saints do not respond.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>None of the saints should have the thought of being fashionable.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once they become fashionable, their experience of the church life is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, this does not mean we will have the church life if we make ourselves look old-fashioned.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not focus on not being modern and fashionable or on being old-fashioned.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should simply put on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This will keep us from being fashioned according to this age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Burning in Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Finally, our spirit should be burning v. 11 . In order to be burning in spirit, we need to call, O Lord! If we call for ten minutes, our spirit will be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord is the real and living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we call, He, as a consuming fire, will burn in us, causing us to be on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Service involves our body being presented in time, our mind being transformed, and our spirit being burning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>SUPPLYING LIFE IN THE SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The principle of service is to supply others with life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since life is Christ, to supply life means to supply Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we visit and contact an unbelieving friend, we should supply him with Christ as if we were a conduit for electricity or a carrier of germs.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not too much to say, because even the apostle Paul was accused of being a pest cf.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Acts 24:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul was full of germs ; wherever he went, he passed on germs to others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should all be equipped with such a skill.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we have been teaching in a school for two years and our school has not caught a Jesus-epidemic, we must not be proper Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are proper Christians, people around us will be supplied with the germs of a Jesus-epidemic.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If there are ten colleagues in your office and nothing has changed for them related to the gospel in two years, you must be a defeated Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you are a normal Christian, the colleagues in your office would be infected with a Jesus-germ after only a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should be full of germs, but it seems as if our germs have been killed by the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many Christians are so sanitary that they have no effect on others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some have worked in an office for two years, yet their colleagues still do not know that they are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some have taught in a school for four years, but their students still do not know that their teacher believes in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Too many of our germs have been killed by the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should be full of spiritual germs.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have the divine life, and we should supply this life to others; that is, we should impart this life as germs so that others will be infected.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Not only should we impart these germs to unbelievers but also to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>With only a little contact, some saints quickly become burning.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This contact can include praying with them, fellowshipping with them, pray-reading with them, and inviting them for a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Such a result does not depend on our ability to speak but on the amount of germs that we supply.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those who infect others with germs are usually unaware of it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not a matter of being eloquent but a matter of having an ample supply of germs.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>EXERCISING IN THREE MATTERS IN OUR SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Since we have a desire to serve the Lord, I hope that we would exercise in three matters.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First, we need to exercise in the matter of our meetings; this does not mean attending the meetings but knowing how function to in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to learn to sing hymns, read the Bible, pray-read, testify, share, and fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Second, we need to exercise to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the fruit-bearing referred to by the Lord in John 15:2 and 16.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At the end of the Gospel of Matthew, the Lord Jesus said, Go and disciple all the nations 28:19 ; at the end of the Gospel of Mark, He said, Go therefore into all the world and proclaim the gospel 16:15 ; and at the end of the Gospel of Luke, He spoke of proclaiming repentance for forgiveness of sins...to all the nations 24:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, there is no similar command in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This does not mean, however, that the Lord did not speak of preaching the gospel in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Because the focus of the Gospel of John is on life, the Lord referred to the multiplication of life rather than speaking directly about preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the Gospel of John, the Lord said that we are branches of the vine and that we should go forth to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hence, the fruit-bearing spoken of in chapter 15 is actually the preaching of the gospel, the supplying of life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The life of Christ, the life of the vine, is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we go and impart this life to our friends and relatives, they will become a part of the vine tree; that is, they will become fruit on the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We all should exercise to bear fruit that remains.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we set aside two hours each week for preaching the gospel and continue to come together related to this burden, we will learn how to best use this time.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We may write to our relatives or friends, call them on the phone, pay them a visit, mail them some spiritual literature, or invite them for a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we invite them, we can also invite some saints.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There are many ways to proceed.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In short, we must spend time on them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Of course, in regard to these ways, the indispensable point is our need for prayer in order to mention their names before the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Third, we must exercise to feed the Lord s lambs, which the Lord Jesus spoke of in John 21.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Chapter 15 is on bearing fruit by preaching the gospel, and chapter 21 is on feeding the lambs by taking care of the young, tender saints.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As far as preaching the gospel is concerned, the church is doing quite well.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We baptize close to a thousand every year.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Regrettably, however, after baptizing these ones, we fall short of feeding them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In other words, we have the bearing of fruit in John 15, but we do not have the feeding of the lambs in John 21.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>For this reason not many of our lambs remain over the years.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must learn to preach the gospel, and we must learn to feed the lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In chapter 21, verses 15 through 17 say, Then when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He said to him, Feed My lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He said to him again a second time, Simon, son of John, do you love Me?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He said to him, Shepherd My sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He said to him the third time, Simon, son of John, do you love Me?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Peter was grieved that He said to him the third time, Do you love Me?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>And he said to Him, Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Jesus said to him, Feed My sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In this portion the Lord responded to Peter s answers three times, and He emphasized different things each time.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The first time He used the word feed, the second time shepherd, and the third time feed again.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Similarly, in His first response He used the word lambs, the second time sheep, and the third time sheep again.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Lambs need to be fed, whereas sheep are slightly larger and thus require shepherding as well as feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Feeding is somewhat different than shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Mothers know that young babies need only to be fed.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>As they grow, however, they need shepherding; that is, they need to be instructed and taught to perform some tasks.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>When people are saved, they need to be fed with the words of the Bible, the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>However, as they grow, they need to be shepherded.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Shepherding includes leading, guiding, and instructing.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>However, if we desire to lead them further, they will need more than just shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This is the reason that the Lord ended by saying, Feed My sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In our shepherding there should also be feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In this way new believers will proceed on the right track.</S>
