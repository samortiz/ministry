	 <h2 class="head1">THE ORDER OF THE CHURCH SERVICE</h2>
<p>The New Testament speaks of the elders&rsquo; administrating of the church, but it does not stress this point. First Corinthians 12:28 says, &ldquo;God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.&rdquo; <em>Helps</em> refers to deacons and deaconesses, who deal with practical matters. <em>Administrations</em> refers to the elders. Bible readers encounter a difficulty with this verse, because they do not understand why Paul placed the deacons before the elders. This verse says, &ldquo;first,&rdquo; &ldquo;second,&rdquo; &ldquo;third,&rdquo; and &ldquo;then,&rdquo; showing that there is an order in these services.</p>
<p>In our view, elders are somewhat higher than the deacons, and they should be mentioned before the deacons. But it seems that Paul considers the service of the deacons to be higher than that of the elders, so he placed the elders after the deacons. The last item mentioned is the least desirable&mdash;speaking in tongues. Paul placed the elders next to speaking in tongues.</p>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 12:28, the first three gifts established by God are apostles, prophets, and teachers. These are higher gifts. Then there are works of power and gifts of healing. Today&rsquo;s Pentecostal movement promotes the gift of healing, but it disregards prophesying and teaching the Bible. Prophesying and teaching the Bible are our specialties. The gifts we have in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are the highest gifts. I encourage you to function in this way. Even if you are a small sister, you can lead your family members to be saved. When you do so, you are an apostle. When you speak the Lord&rsquo;s word to your family members, you are prophesying. If you can help them understand the Word, you are functioning as a teacher.</p>
<p>We do not, however, encourage you to do works of power, because it is easy to become abnormal or even deluded. You may even think that you can heal all illnesses through prayer. Many Christians want to pursue such gifts, but in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the Lord does not give us such gifts, and neither do we pay attention to them. We emphasize being apostles, prophets, and shepherds and teachers.</p>
<p>Paul lists helps, administrations, and tongue-speaking as the last items. Paul put the eldership last to prevent the elders from elevating themselves. The Bible does not give ground for the saints to elevate themselves. The Lord Jesus told the apostles that none of them should be the master; rather, they were all brothers. Whoever wanted to be the greatest among them had to become a slave. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery follows this pattern and emphasizes it. Even though the fellowship of the elders should be considered by those who want to serve full time, we should never think that the approval of the elders is a condition for full-time service. When someone submits a consecration slip, the elders must be careful, because a saint&rsquo;s future in the Lord&rsquo;s service can be ruined if the fellowship of the elders is received as if it is a formal approval.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING IN SPIRIT WITH FEAR AND TREMBLING</h2>
<p>If the formal approval of the elders is not a condition for full-time service, some elders might ask why their consideration is needed. Such a question shows an organizational mind that is focused on the matter of authority. This is not a question of authority. As soon as authority is brought into a matter, it becomes organizational. If the elders have a proper understanding, they will follow their inward sense and the anointing of the Spirit. Then their consideration of the saints will not be organizational.</p>
<p>However, some elders in the churches cannot distinguish between the organic function of the Body and an organization. The elders are not part of an organization but rather functioning members of an organism. If they stand on the ground of organization and serve as elders with an organizational view, they are part of an organization. They will have no organic function, and they will not have the life of the Body. Forgive me for speaking such a strong word, but this is the same as false teeth and prosthetic legs. They do not have an organic function, because they do not have the life of the Body.</p>
<p>The elders in every locality, both in Taiwan and abroad, have made this mistake to one degree or another. They serve as elders in an organizational way, not according to an organic function. An elder who functions in an organic way will be in fear and trembling as he considers whether a saint should serve full time.</p>
<p>Paul says, &ldquo;Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure&rdquo; (Phil. 2:12-13). This means that we have a life in us with an organic function, and this life is operating in us. We must obey the operating of this life with fear and trembling. We need to be in fear and trembling; otherwise, we will not pay attention to the Spirit&rsquo;s operating, and we will make our own decisions. The elders may regard their character, feelings, opinions, thoughts, preferences, and choices too highly, and they may even regard these traits as the reason they were chosen to be elders. If they are not watchful, it will be easy to ignore the inward operating of the Spirit.</p>
<p>The sense of life and the anointing of the Spirit are things that we understand doctrinally. We must ask ourselves how many times during the day do we obey the sense of life and the anointing of the Spirit. Making a small joke can be in disobedience to the operating of the Spirit. Whenever we speak loosely with others, we lose the anointing. Murmuring and grumbling to others are expressions of ignoring the inward sense of life. We must confess that this is our condition, especially with our spouse and other family members. For this reason in verse 14 Paul says, &ldquo;Do all things without murmurings and reasonings.&rdquo; Murmurings are related to our emotions and come mainly from the sisters. Reasonings are related to our mind and come mainly from the brothers. Whenever the sisters stop murmuring to their husbands and the brothers cease reasoning with the ones they coordinate with, they are obeying God&rsquo;s inward operating.</p>
<p>According to my observation, no wife lacks love toward her husband. The Bible does not command the wives to love their husbands, because God knows that the wives love their husbands. The Bible does say that the husbands must love their wives. The main problem with husbands is that most of them do not love their wives. Therefore, the Bible commands the husbands to love their wives. Even though the wives love their husbands, the main problem with wives is that they do not submit to their husbands. Rather, it is the husbands who submit to their wives. The Bible does not charge the husbands to submit to their wives, because all husbands submit to their wives. Wives love their husbands, and husbands submit to their wives. These are almost iron-clad principles. Hence, the Bible provides correction and tells husbands to love and wives to submit.</p>
<p>Wives murmur because they love their husbands. If they did not love their husbands, they would not murmur. The more a wife loves her husband, the more she murmurs. The same thing happens in the church. There are not many sisters who do not complain about the elders. The most difficult thing for the elders is the endless complaining and murmuring of the sisters. Although the sisters often lift the elders up very high, they also murmur and complain about the elders. This is a problem.</p>
<p>We need to take care of the sense of life and the anointing. However, in our experience we ignore the operation of the Spirit most of the time. If we obey the anointing only occasionally, we think that we are spiritual Christians.</p>
<p>The greatest danger in the elders&rsquo; administration of the church is not administrating according to the operating of the Spirit. Of course, the elders do not administrate the church out of evil or bad motives. However, they can administrate out of themselves, rather than by the Spirit. Some elders have a very good character. They are thoughtful and capable, even full of insight. However, it may be that only a few of their decisions related to the administration of the church are according to the operation of the Spirit. The elders who administrate the churches do not fear the Lord to the extent that they say, &ldquo;I fear the Lord, so I am afraid of my views, ideas, and opinions. I am afraid that I will take charge of the church&rsquo;s administration.&rdquo; Instead, nearly every elder feels that he understands the truth and has clear insight; therefore, he is strict to carry things out. It is possible to carry out the truth and not follow the operation of the Spirit.</p>
<p>The elders may ask whether this means that they should not carry things out according to the truth. We should be clear that if we do not carry things out according to the truth, we are not obeying the operation of the Spirit. In many situations it is better to make a decision to not make a decision. When we do not make a decision, it means that we still have some inward consideration. This gives the Spirit an opportunity to operate within us. Our concern is that many brothers shut the door to the Spirit&rsquo;s operation as soon as they become elders.</p>
<p>Those who give themselves to be full-timers should never have the thought that there is a group of co-workers who approve and decide whether one is qualified. That would be centralized authority, and such a practice is unscriptural. Those who desire to serve full time should have the approval of the elders in their locality. This is proper.</p>
<p>We need to turn the cake. We are concerned that in considering the saints who have a heart to serve full time, some elders will function in a habitual way of doing things, not according to their spirit. They might not be in fear and trembling. The consideration of the saints in such a way is organizational, not organic. In other words, we are concerned that the elders will not follow the Spirit but will merely consider outward qualifications.</p>
<p>For the past two thousand years this problem has caused the church to not grow much and to not be useful to the Lord. This problem has also forced the church to rely on organization. It seems that if the church does not rely on organization, it cannot move. The genuine church, however, cannot be in organization. We need to be organic, but we do not have enough growth in life or the habit of being organic. Therefore, what we do still lacks an organic element. This is our greatest problem.</p>
<p>My burden is that every saint would have a heart to fear the Lord. The elders must learn to fear the Lord in every matter. They should fear the Lord not merely concerning playing mah-jongg but also in following the Spirit. The elders in the churches fear the Lord in many aspects of their living; however, in following the operation of the Spirit to obey the anointing and the sense of life, they do not fear Him enough. Most of their decisions are based on what is right or wrong and good or bad. Our consideration of those who wish to serve full time must not be based on what is good or bad or on who is qualified or not qualified. We must be fearful before the Lord and learn to follow the Spirit by obeying the anointing and the sense of life. What the elders do according to the Spirit will not have the flavor of exercising authority or controlling others, because the Spirit is living and not dead.</p>
<p>When we asked the elders in every locality to consider those who desire to serve full time, we did not use the word <em>examine.</em> This means that we asked the elders to consider the situation of every applicant. This does not mean that they have the authority to accept or reject anyone. If we were an organization, it would be easy to carry things out according to rules. However, we are a living organism.</p>
