   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In God's New Testament economy the Spirit has the attribute of reality John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Reality is the all-inclusive attribute of the Spirit of God, for it includes the Father, Christ the Son, and all the divine items and entities.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit is the reality of Christ and of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, the Spirit is the reality 1 John 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Holy Spirit is the all-inclusive reality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Reality, therefore, is one of the most marvelous attributes of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Apart from the Spirit of reality, in our experience we cannot have the Trinity or any of the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These would be nothing more than terms to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The reality of the Triune God and of all His attributes is the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the Spirit of reality, the Spirit is the reality of God and of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Spirit is the reality of every divine thing, and, as such, He is the reality of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, because the Spirit is the reality, He is God, the Son, and eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Without the Spirit of reality, eternal life would be empty, vain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the Spirit is the reality of God, the Son, eternal life, and every divine matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the reason He is called the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, reality had not yet entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The reality was present, for Christ Himself is reality John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But this reality was only among the disciples; it had not come into them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, the Lord told the disciples that it was expedient for them that He go away John 16:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The purpose of His going was for Him to have a change in form, a change from the form of the flesh to the form of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As soon as this change had been accomplished, His reality would become the reality of the Spirit, and the Spirit would become the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then this Spirit of reality would come to abide in the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus said in John 14:17, "Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because the Spirit of reality has come into us, reality now abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>G. POWER</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The last attribute of the Spirit revealed in the New Testament is power.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Luke 4:14 says, "Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The power of the Spirit here is economical, for it is power for ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit in verse 14 is the Holy Spirit who descended upon the Lord Jesus at the time of His baptism for the accomplishment of His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Before the Holy Spirit in power descended upon Him, He already had the Holy Spirit within Him essentially for His living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus had the Holy Spirit both essentially as life for His living and economically as power for His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Romans 15:13 Paul speaks of the believers abounding "in hope in the power of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here the power of the Holy Spirit is not economical but essential.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The believers' abounding in hope is not a work; it is an aspect of their living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For this aspect of the living of the believers, the power of the Holy Spirit is needed essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Acts 1:8 is another verse that speaks of the economical power of the Spirit: "You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To receive power is to be baptized in the Holy Spirit Acts 1:5 for the fulfillment of the promise of the Father v. 4 . The Holy Spirit was breathed into the disciples on the day of Christ's resurrection John 20:22 to be the Spirit of life to them essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The same Holy Spirit came upon the disciples on the day of Pentecost to be the Spirit of power economically.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Both essentially and economically the Spirit has the attribute of power.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to Acts 1:8, through the power of the Spirit, which truly is an excellency of the Spirit, we may be Christ's witnesses to the remotest part of the earth.</S>
