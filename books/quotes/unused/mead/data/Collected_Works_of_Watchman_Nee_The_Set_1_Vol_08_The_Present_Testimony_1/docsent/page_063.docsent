   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONSCIENCE OF THE BELIEVERS Issue No. 18 Scripture Reading: 1 John 3:20-21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the spirit of a believer has been regenerated, his conscience is enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The precious blood of the Lord Jesus cleanses his conscience, causing his conscience to be pure and keen and enabling it to follow the will of the Spirit to do His work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The work that is done in man by the renewing and sanctifying Spirit and the work that is done by his conscience are related and joined one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the believers are to be filled with the Spirit, be sanctified, measure up to God's will, and fully follow and walk in the Spirit, then they should pay attention to the voice of their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If they do not allow their conscience to occupy the place that it should, then they will fall into the position of following and walking in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Faithfully dealing with the conscience is the first step of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Following and walking according to the conscience are the marks of true spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a fleshly believer does not let his conscience do a thorough work, he has no way to get into the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even though he and other people may consider him spiritual, his spirituality is still without foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If sin and everything which is not according to God's will, including everything that is unbecoming of the saints, are not dealt with according to the voice of the conscience, then the spiritual foundation is not well laid.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Regardless how many spiritual ideas are being built on top, they will all fall apart.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our conscience testifies to us whether or not we are right toward men and God, whether or not what we do, think, or say measure up to God's will, and whether or not we are without rebellion to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the Christian life is progressing, the witness of the conscience and the witness of the Spirit are almost the same.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the conscience is fully governed by the Spirit, it gets sharper day by day so that it harmonizes more with the voice of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, the Spirit speaks through the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is exactly what the apostle Paul meant by, "My conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit" Rom 9:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If our own conscience says we are not right, then surely we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If our conscience condemns us of our sin, we must repent immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must not use something to cover up or bribe our conscience, since "if our heart blames us, it is because God is greater than our heart" 1 John 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Would God not condemn us more?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The rebuking of our conscience says we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When our heart condemns us, God will most certainly condemn us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's holiness can never be lower than the standard of our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, if our conscience tells us that we are wrong, then we must be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since we are wrong, what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the act has not yet been committed, we should immediately stop.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If it has been done, we should repent, confess our sin, and ask for the cleansing of the precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is pitiful that believers today do not practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When their conscience rebukes them, they try to bribe their conscience, seeking to make peace with their conscience in order to avoid any further rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Under this condition, a believer always uses two methods.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first is reasoning with his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He tries to explain with reason the cause for his actions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The believer thinks that if his reasons are acceptable, then his action must be according to God's will, and his conscience can be at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Little does he realize that the conscience is like the intuition; it does not reason.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The conscience knows God's will through the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a thing is not truly God's will, the conscience will condemn it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The conscience only speaks on behalf of God's will; it does not care for reason.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A believer should not do something just because it is reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He should only obey the will of God revealed in his intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever the believer disobeys the prompting of the intuition, the conscience begins to speak and condemn him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The explanation of the believer's reason may satisfy his mind, but it is not enough to satisfy his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If something condemned by the conscience is not removed, the conscience will not stop condemning it through any explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At the beginning the conscience is the witness only of what is right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After a believer's spiritual life has grown, the conscience will not only be a witness to things that are right or wrong but also a witness to things that are from God or not.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, many things that are good according to man's eyes will still be condemned by the conscience if they are not from God's revelation but are from the believer's motivation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The second way in which the believer seeks to make peace with his conscience is that he endeavors to do many other things to comfort the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the one hand, he does not want to obey the voice of the conscience and follow its guidance to please God; on the other hand, he is afraid of being condemned by the conscience because that condemnation makes him feel ill at ease.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For this reason, he plans to do many good works.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He tries to use the good works to replace God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He does not obey God, but he explains that what he has done is as good as what God has instructed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It may even be better, nobler, broader in range, higher in yield, richer in use, and deeper in influence than God's instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The believer thinks that this kind of good work is even better.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, regardless of what he does and how people evaluate it, in God's eyes there is no spiritual usefulness at all.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is not a matter of how much fat or how many burnt offerings there are, but a matter of how much obedience to God we have.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If God reveals in spirit that something should be removed, regardless of how good your intention, how fatted your cattle and lambs may be, and how much value your gold and silver have, all of these will not move God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The voice of conscience must be obeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Otherwise, regardless of how good your work is, God will never be pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even if the sacrifices are many times more than God's demand, they will not cause the voice of the conscience to be silenced.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The conscience only demands our obedience; it does not require us to serve God in an extraordinary way.</S>
