Prayer for God&#8217;s Work</h2><p>After having the proper fellowship with God in prayer, a foundation is laid for us to go on to petition God for His work. Because of our proper fellowship, the Lord is able to impart into us His burden for a particular person or matter. At this time we can petition God for them. The Lord, upon hearing our petition, will act from His throne in the heavens to accomplish the work. Sometimes He does not act immediately because we may still have some hidden problems not yet confessed; or His timing requires that we wait. At other times Satan and his fallen angels are resisting God&#8217;s work. If we do not see an immediate answer it does not mean that prayer does not work. It means that we need to persist in prayer.<p>This type of prayer also energizes us by filling us with the Spirit and with boldness to go to open peoples&#8217; eyes with the Word, turn them from darkness to light, and deliver them from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and the common portion among the saints.<p>Finally, this type of prayer shows us how to approach our friends, what to say to them, what verses to use, etc. Many times we claim that we do not know what to say, or that we are afraid, or that we cannot get anyone saved. If we pray, God will work within us and within our friends.<h2 class=head1>V. INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE PRAYER</h2><p>We need to pray individually and corporately. In Matthew 6:6 the Lord says that we should pray in our private room. Certain sins should be confessed privately without anyone knowing but the Lord. It is also more convenient to pray by yourself. But even when we pray by ourselves, our standing should always be in the Body. We are praying individually yet not as an individual.<p>In Matthew chapter 18 the Lord mentioned praying with two or three. In Acts chapters 1 and 2 the 120 disciples were praying together. We also need to pray together. Corporate prayer is stronger and more effective. In fact, the keys of the kingdom were not given to an individual, but to the church corporately. Therefore, the most powerful prayer for God&#8217;s work is still the corporate prayer of the church. Some may say, &#8220;It is good enough for me to pray by myself. I enjoy the Lord better by myself.&#8217;&#8217; It may be true that you can enjoy the Lord by yourself. However, we must ask ourselves, &#8220;Is God&#8217;s work accomplished through your individual enjoyment&#8217;&#8217;? You may be enjoying the Lord for yourself and not for the Lord. Our individual enjoyment is for the corporate work of God. Therefore, we must get together to pray for God&#8217;s work and to carry out God&#8217;s work.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_111.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_113.html">Next</a> </body></html>
