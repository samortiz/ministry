   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE APPLICATION OF CHRIST AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us be very practical about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As a regenerated Christian, how do you deal with people?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a brother with Christ as your life, how do you deal with the brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do you deal with them by Christ, or by yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To deal with a brother by Christ is to be in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must deal with one another in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What does it mean to be "in the Spirit"?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, we must realize that Christ is now living with us in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 , the "Lord Spirit" 2 Cor 3:18, Greek , because He was transfigured from the flesh to the Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is in us today as our life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second, having Christ as our life, we must live by Christ John 6:57 and not by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a problem, for there are many of us who have Christ as life, but do not live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Third, we must know that Christ is living in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22; Rom 8:16 not in our mind, emotion, or will.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Have we not often had the experience of something deep within contradicting us contradicting our mind, our emotion, or our will?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That "something" is really the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes we intend to talk with a certain person, but that something within says, "No!"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Don't we all have this experience?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even in ministering the Word it is often so.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We make up our minds to speak on a certain subject, but something within does not agree.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He tells us, "Forget about what you are going to say."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It seems that the Lord is always troublesome, never giving us a free hand, but always asking us to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yes, we must follow the Lord Spirit Rom 8:4 , not He follow us!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is the resurrection life living within us, and we must follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all have a natural life, but we must give it up and take Christ alone as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must not serve the Lord by our mind or by our emotion, but in our spirit Rom 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we come to the meetings, we must be dead to ourselves, our desires, our thoughts, and that which we love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must tell the Lord, "You are my life; I live by You and not by my will, my mentality, or my knowledge."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>So often we have a certain thought or a certain emotion that we want to express in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But we must forget our thoughts and emotions and only remember the Lord Himself as life and live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brothers and sisters frequently come to talk with me about the right way to meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I always answer that the right way is Christ Himself in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must forget about forms, opinions, and our way of thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to say, "Lord, You are my life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whatever I do here in ministering or serving, I do by You as life and not by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I wish to learn how to live by You."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is why I asked how you deal with people and with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must learn to deal with people by CHRIST.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we actually take Him as our life, He will be real to us!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to know Christ, even as the Apostle Paul said, "That I may know Him and the power of His resurrection" Phil 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to know Him as the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must not know Him in knowledge, teaching, doctrine, the mind, the emotions, the desires, or the will, but in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One day a brother came to me and asked if I thought Christians should joke.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I said, "There is no regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no law in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ did not give us such a law; so I dare not say whether it is right or not.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But there is one thing I must say.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you would joke, you must first consult Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You must take Him as your life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you can joke by Christ, go ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If He is your life in joking, it is quite right.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You yourself know whether or not Christ will go along with your joking.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The only rule is Christ Himself!"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today there is only one law, one rule, one regulation: Christ Himself, the all-inclusive Christ as our life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How should we deal with people?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Simply by taking Christ as life!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christ is risen to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>May we realize this positively in our daily lives.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Listening or reading is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must put this into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must take Christ as our life for every occasion.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How very real and practical it is!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we do this, we will very quickly be filled with Him in our spirit Eph 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We will be full of Christ and our whole being will be saturated with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord is seeking this kind of people today.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To live by Christ is true spirituality!</S>
