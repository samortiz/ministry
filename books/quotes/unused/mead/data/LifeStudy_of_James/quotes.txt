[1]  In our Life-study of the Bible we have covered all the books of the New Testament except the books of James, Mark, Luke, and Acts.
[2]  A SLAVE OF GOD AND OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST
[3]  James was a flesh brother of the Lord Jesus Matt 13:55 and of Jude Jude 1 .
[4]  He was not one of the twelve Apostles chosen by the Lord while He was on earth, but he became one of the apostles after the Lord s resurrection Gal 1:19 and the leading elder in the church at Jerusalem Acts 12:17; 15:2, 13; 21:18 , reputed with Peter and John to be a pillar of the church, and mentioned by Paul as the first among the three pillars Gal 2:9 .
[5]  At the end of 1:1 James tells the recipients of his Epistle to rejoice.
[6]  The word rejoice is a translation of the Greek word chairein, which means to be happy, rejoice, hail; it was a word used for greeting or farewell.
[7]  James writes not merely concerning Christian perfection, but concerning practical Christian perfection, that is, a perfection that is not theoretical but practical in our daily living.
[8]  In 1:2 James exhorts us to count it all joy whenever we fall into various trials.
[9]  In verse 3 he goes on to say, Knowing that the proving of your faith produces endurance.
[10]  Faith here is the Christian faith given by God in Christ 2:1; Eph 2:8 .
[11]  In verse 5 James says, But if anyone of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and does not reproach, and it will be given to him.
[12]  It was by His wisdom that God, in Christ, made His eternal plan and carried it out 1 Cor 2:7; Eph 3:9-11; Prov 8:12, 22-31 .
[13]  In verses 9 and 10 James continues, And let the lowly brother glory in his exaltation, and the rich in his being brought low, because as a flower of the grass he will pass away.
[14]  In verse 2 James says, Count it all joy, my brothers, whenever you fall into various trials.
[15]  Then, at the end of this section on enduring trials by faith, he says in verse 12, Blessed is the man who endures trials.
[16]  LIFE-STUDY OF JAMES MESSAGE THREE PRACTICAL VIRTUES OF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION 3 Scripture Reading: James 1:13-27 A BALANCED VIEW OF THE EPISTLE OF JAMES
[17]  After studying Paul s writings and all the Life-study Messages on these writings, we shall no doubt be influenced to receive the light concerning God s economy and to be strongly for it.
[18]  But there is the possibility that we may be careless in our behavior or that we may neglect the matter of practical Christian perfection.
[19]  We need to realize that after the revelation in Paul s writings concerning God s economy, God put in the book of James, one of the seven books of the New Testament that was not fully recognized until the council of Carthage in A.D. 397.
[20]  The book of James is a balance to those who are unbalanced in their Christian life.
[21]  Perhaps in your Christian life you are wholly for God s economy.
[22]  James 1:13 says, Let no one say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted of evil, and He Himself tempts no one.
[23]  The Greek word for tempted here also means tried, tested.
[24]  In verses 16 and 17 James goes on to say, Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.
[25]  LIFE-STUDY OF JAMES MESSAGE FOUR PRACTICAL VIRTUES OF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION 4 Scripture Reading: James 1:19-27 QUICK TO HEAR, SLOW TO SPEAK, SLOW TO WRATH
[26]  In verse 19 James says, You know this, my beloved brothers; but let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.
[27]  If we would resist temptation, we need to be nourished through receiving the implanted word.
[28]  Concerning the perfect law, the law of freedom, one interpretation is that the perfect law refers to the entire New Testament.
[29]  Our notes say that the perfect law, the law of freedom, is the law of life within us.
[30]  James writing concerning God s New Testament economy is not as striking as Paul s, Peter s, or John s. Paul focuses on Christ living and being formed in us Gal 2:20; 4:19 and Christ magnified in us and lived out of us Phil 1:20-21 , that we as the church, His Body, may become His fullness, His expression Eph 1:22-23 . Peter stresses the fact that God has regenerated us through the resurrection of Christ 1 Pet 1:3 , making us partakers of His divine nature, that we may live a life of godliness 2 Pet 1:3-7 and be built up a spiritual house to express His virtues 1 Pet 2:5, 9 . John emphasizes the eternal life given to us for our fellowship with the Triune God 1 John 1:2-3 and the divine birth that brings into us the divine life as the divine seed for us to live a life like God 1 John 2:29; 3:9; 4:17 and be the church, as a lampstand, bearing the testimony of Jesus Rev 1:9, 11-12 , which will consummate in the New Jerusalem to express God for eternity Rev 21:2-3, 10-11 . James stresses, as New Testament characteristics, only God s begetting of us James 1:18 , the perfect law of freedom 1:25 , the indwelling Spirit 4:5 , and a little bit of the church 5:14 , without speaking of Christ as our life and the church as the expression of Christ, the two most outstanding and dispensational characteristics of the New Testament.
[31]  We have pointed out that we need to have a balanced view of the Epistle of James.
[32]  On the one hand, this Epistle is helpful in emphasizing practical Christian perfection.
[33]  Let us now consider the situation in Acts 21.
[34]  After Paul had greeted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry v. 19 . When they heard this report, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law.
[35]  In this message we shall consider chapter two of the Epistle of James.
[36]  Verse 1 says, My brothers, do not have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with respect of persons.
[37]  In verse 5 James goes on to say, Listen, my beloved brothers: Has not God chosen the poor in the world, to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which He promised to those who love Him?
[38]  The kingdom of God here is also the kingdom of Christ, which will be inherited by the overcoming believers in the coming age Eph 5:5; Gal 5:21; 1 Cor 6:10; Rev 20:4, 6 .
[39]  In verse 11 James says, For He who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder.
[40]  Now if you do not commit adultery, but you murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.
[41]  In 2:13 James says, For the judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.
[42]  To despise a poor brother is to have no mercy.
[43]  In 2 Timothy 2:15 Paul speaks about cutting straight the word of the truth.
[44]  To cut straight the word of the truth means to unfold the Word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion.
[45]  The writing of James is very much involved with the matter of dispensation.
[46]  But his view was not clear concerning God s dispensation.
[47]  Verses 1 through 12 of this chapter are concerned with bridling the tongue, and verses 13 through 18, with behaving in wisdom.
[48]  In 3:5 and 6 James likens the tongue to a fire: So also the tongue is a little member and boasts great things.
[49]  Behold, how great a forest a little fire kindles!
[50]  In verses 14 and 15 James goes on to say, But if you have bitter jealousy and rivalry in your heart, do not boast and lie against the truth.
[51]  This wisdom is not coming down from above, but is earthly, soulish, demonic.
[52]  By this wisdom in verse 15 James means the wisdom of having bitter jealousy and rivalry to boast and lie against the truth v. 14 . Moreover, in verse 15 earthly refers to the world, soulish to the natural man, and demonic to the Devil and his demons.
[53]  In this message we shall consider what James says in 4:1-10 concerning dealing with pleasures, the world, and the Devil.
[54]  However, before we consider these matters, I would like to give a further brief word on the contrast between wisdom as it is revealed in the writings of James and wisdom as revealed in the writings of Paul.
[55]  In 4:1-10 James speaks concerning dealing with pleasures, the world, and the Devil.
[56]  Some may be bothered by the fact that we use the word pleasures in a negative sense.
[57]  In our church life we do not have pleasures we have enjoyment.
[58]  In verse 4 James says, Adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?
[59]  Therefore whoever determines to be a friend of the world is constituted an enemy of God.
[60]  Here James makes a turn from the matter of pleasures to the matter of friendship of the world and enmity with God.
[61]  Although it is difficult to trace James thought from verse to verse, we can see clearly that in 4:1-10 James is concerned with three major items that are problems to us: pleasures v. 1 , the world v. 4 , and the Devil v. 7 . These matters must be thoroughly dealt with.
[62]  Surely, as those who love the Lord, we do not want to be adulteresses, enemies of God, and sinners.
[63]  In the foregoing message we considered three major problems found in 4:1-10.
[64]  These problems are pleasures, the world, and the Devil.
[65]  In this message we shall go on to consider what James says in 4:6-17.
[66]  In verses 11 and 12 James gives us a word about not speaking against the brothers: Do not speak against one another, brothers.
[67]  He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks against the law and judges the law.
[68]  Many Christians treasure 4:13-17, especially James word in verses 14 and 15.
[69]  In verse 14 James says, You are a vapor, appearing for a little while, and then disappearing.
[70]  Then in verse 15 James encourages us to say, If the Lord wills, we will both live and do this or that.
[71]  LIFE-STUDY OF JAMES MESSAGE ELEVEN PRACTICAL VIRTUES OF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION 11 Scripture Reading: James 5:1-11 A WORD TO THE RICH
[72]  Verses1 through 6 may be regarded as a parenthetical section, and this section may be addressed, according to its contents, to the rich class among the Jews in general, since James regarded his recipients as the twelve tribes of the Jews 1:1 .
[73]  In 5:1 James says to the rich, Come now, you rich, weep, howling over your miseries which are coming upon you!
[74]  After the parenthetical section in 5:1-6, we have a word concerning awaiting the Lord s coming with longsuffering 5:7-11 .
[75]  In these verses James speaks both of longsuffering and endurance.
[76]  He uses the prophets as an example of longsuffering and Job as an example of endurance.
[77]  In this message we shall consider the last two sections of the Epistle of James: speaking honestly without swearing 5:12 and healthy practices in the church life 5:13-20 .
[78]  In 5:12 James says, But above all things, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth, or with any other oath; but let your yes be yes, and your no be no, that you do not fall under judgment.
[79]  In 5:13 James goes on to the matter of healthy practices in the church life: Does anyone among you suffer evil?
[80]  In 5:16b-18 James says, An operating petition of a righteous man avails much.
[81]  Elijah was a man of like feeling with us, and in prayer he prayed that it should not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.
[82]  In 5:20 James also says that the one who turns such a sinner, such a backslidden brother, will save his soul from death.
[83]  We need to pay attention to the fact that James does not say save him, but says, save his soul.
[84]  LIFE-STUDY OF JAMES MESSAGE THIRTEEN A LIFE NOT FULLY
[85]  In the Gospel of Mark we see a life the life of the Lord Jesus that is fully according to and for God s New Testament economy.
[86]  In 1:17 and 18 James says, All good giving and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the lights, with whom is no variableness or shadow cast by turning.
[87]  Having purposed, He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a certain firstfruit of His creatures.
[88]  In 1:25 James says, But he who looks into the perfect law, the law of freedom, and continues in it, not having become a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in his doing.
[89]  In his Epistle James emphasizes the importance of wisdom.
[90]  James realized that the wisdom of God is needed for practical Christian perfection.
[91]  LIFE-STUDY OF JAMES MESSAGE FOURTEEN A LIFE NOT FULLY
[92]  GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY 2 Scripture Reading: James 4:15; 5:7, 13-20; Acts 21:15-24
[93]  In the foregoing message we began to point out how in the Epistle of James we see a life that is not fully according to and for God s New Testament economy.
[94]  Thus far, we have covered eight characteristics of such a life as found in this book: still keeping the twelve tribes of the Old Testament dispensation, possessing the divine life through the divine birth, receiving the implanted word, keeping the perfect law of freedom in the Old Testament practice, mixing with the practice of the recovered Old Testament dispensation, still keeping the Old Testament law of letter, behaving by the wisdom with the Old Testament flavor, and having the indwelling Spirit only for dealing with the world.
[95]  After considering all the matters in the Epistle of James that show us a life not fully according to and for God s New Testament economy, we must go on to consider a major problem the problem of the inspiration of the Scriptures.
[96]  Since we have pointed out so many shortcomings of the book of James, some may wonder if this Epistle is inspired of God, if it is God-breathed.
[97]  In 2 Timothy 3:16 Paul says, All Scripture is God-breathed.
