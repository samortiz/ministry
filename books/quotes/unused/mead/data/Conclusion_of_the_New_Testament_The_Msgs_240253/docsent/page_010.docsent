   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>in Matthew 24:44 25:30</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the Lord Jesus comes back, the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will be realized.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord s angels will bind the tares into bundles and cast them into the fire Matt 13:40-42 because the tares have done much damage to the Lord s kingdom.</S>
