<p>Third, we need to know whether our work has a definite impact on the saints. We must minister to the saints and build them up in a definite way; we must not be careless. If we render help to people, there will be a definite impact. Rendering help that is not definite or solid can be compared to chicken scratches in the dirt. It seems that there may be some chickens nearby, but this is not definite. Our help to people must be solid and definite.</p>
<p>An incompetent carpenter cannot tell whether a piece of wood is good or bad material. He may put aside a good piece of wood, thereby wasting its function. Even if the best material is in his hand, he will be unable to produce something of quality and instead will produce something that is of inferior quality. An incompetent carpenter will either waste a piece of wood and render it useless or produce something of poor quality. When we serve the Lord and care for the saints, we should not be incompetent carpenters who waste the function of others; rather, we should provide solid help to others in order to develop their usefulness before the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Prevailing Results</h2>
<p>Fourth, we need to consider whether our work has prevailing results. Whether we establish churches, minister to the saints, or perfect co-workers, our work must be prevailing. In other words, our work should produce prevailing churches, prevailing saints, and prevailing co-workers. What does this mean? A prevailing church is definite concerning the ground, rich in life, full of the impact of life, and shines brightly. A prevailing saint is not careless and is not deceived, because he has spiritual discernment. A prevailing co-worker is able to serve and produce many useful persons. A prevailing work can be compared to definite and unmistakable colors in a painting: the blues are blue, the greens are green, the reds are red, and the yellows are yellow. If we want to do a work, we must do a prevailing work.</p>
<p>When we work for the Lord, we must pay attention to the results of these four basic points. Does our work establish churches, does our work minister Christ, does our work help people in a definite way, and does our work have prevailing results?</p>
<p>If we would allow the Lord to measure and examine us according to these four points, we may find out that most of us are not up to the standard. If our answers to these basic points are not positive, then our past work has been a failure. We must not continue in such a way. This does not mean that we should withdraw from the work. Rather, it means that we should no longer work as we have in the past, because our previous way was not effective; it delayed both the saints and ourselves.</p>
<p>Some who have labored and toiled for many years are frustrated and discouraged. Instead of being frustrated and discouraged, we should look at the result. We should be comforted and thank and praise the Lord if our work bears some trace of these basic points. However, there are some who have served for years and who are self-deceived and do not have prevailing results. They feel that they have done a good job and should continue to work in the same way, even though they do not have definite results. These ones have deceived themselves and delayed others. We must go before the Lord and allow Him to measure us and our work. We should never rely on our seniority or boast in our seniority, thinking that we know more than others because we have served longer. The more we rely on or boast in our seniority, the less worth we will have. Those who rely on their seniority or boast in their seniority will be disqualified. Seniority has no value in the Lord&rsquo;s work. What matters is our effectiveness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASIC CONDITIONS FOR SERVING THE LORD</h2>
<p>Regardless of our age, if we desire to serve the Lord in a proper way and to be effective in our work for the Lord, we must know and meet the following seven basic conditions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Vision</h2>
<p>First, we must have a vision. We need to pray for the Lord to give us a vision. The work in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not centered on preaching the gospel, teaching the Bible, or pursuing spirituality. Rather, our work is centered on Christ and the church. Throughout history many Christians have been zealous in preaching the gospel; they made the gospel the center of their work. Some Christians were so burdened to teach the truths of the Bible that they established Bible-study groups, Bible-study classes, Bible schools, and even seminaries. However, the center of their work was merely to teach the Bible. They cared for nothing else and were content only when they were able to teach the Bible. Still other Christians claimed to be spiritual and helped people to be spiritual. These Christians made inner-life experiences their center. These pursuits, however, are not the center of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The center of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is Christ and the church, that is, ministering Christ and building up the church. Every saint must see this vision.</p>
<p>If our work does not produce churches, minister Christ, have a definite impact, or have prevailing results, it is because we are short of a basic vision or because we violate or neglect this basic vision. If we have a basic vision, we will obey this vision in our work, and we will have proper results. Arguments are useless. We need to see whether we have results. If we value the basic vision, there will be a result. The result in our service proves that our service is according to vision.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> </body></html>
