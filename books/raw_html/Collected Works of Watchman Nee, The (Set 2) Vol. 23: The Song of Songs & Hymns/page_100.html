O city fair!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's dwelling with man to eternity is there.<br /><br />	He looked for a city, his God should prepare;<br />No mansion on earth, could he covet or share,<br />For had not God told him, that royal abode<br />Awaited His pilgrims on ending the road.<br /><br />He looked for a city; if sometimes he sighed<br />To be trudging the road, all earth's glory denied,<br />The thought of that city changed sighing to song,<br />For the road might be rough, but it could not be long.<br /><br />He looked for a city, his goal, Lord, we share<br />And know that bright city, which Thou dost prepare<br />Is ever our portion, since willing to be<br />Just pilgrims with Jesus, our roof a tent tree.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 class="head1">HYMN NO. 89</h2><h2 class="head2">10.10.10.10.4.
