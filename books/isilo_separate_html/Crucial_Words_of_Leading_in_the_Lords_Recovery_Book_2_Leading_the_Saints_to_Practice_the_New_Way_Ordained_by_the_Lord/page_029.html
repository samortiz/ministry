Rich Content in Order to Supply the Saints</h2>
<p>The district meetings are generally fresh and living and are different from the past; more saints are speaking in the meetings, and the atmosphere is more open. However, as a whole, the speaking is not rich enough, so the content of the meetings is rather poor; this is a shortcoming that requires our further study. From now on we will spend more time focusing on the ninety-six districts in Taipei; we will study these districts one by one and present the condition of each district to the saints. This may be likened to our appearing before the Lord&rsquo;s judgment seat in the future. At that time the Lord will ask us what we have done since the day of our salvation. Romans 14:10 says, &ldquo;We will all stand before the judgment seat of God,&rdquo; and verse 12 says, &ldquo;Each one of us will give an account concerning himself to God.&rdquo; Moreover, in Matthew 12:36, the Lord spoke even more severely, saying, &ldquo;Every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment.&rdquo; God records all the words that we speak in our entire life. Today man invents equipment such as audio machines and computers to record sound and information, but God does not need to invent anything; He has already recorded what we have spoken. This is what the Bible reveals to us.</p>
<p>I hope that the saints will make progress in the matter of prophesying. Although we all speak in the meetings, we still need to improve. What we lack is rich content in our speaking. This can be compared to a ball game. Sometimes though every player is capable, because of the weather conditions, everyone feels spiritless on the field, and in the end they lose the game. We have at most fifty people in each district meeting. If all fifty would speak, the meetings would be marvelous. However, one of the responsible brothers may not be happy when he gets up in the morning, another brother may be upset, and many others may have their own situations. In the end, although everyone speaks, every person&rsquo;s speaking was poor, and the entire meeting was flavorless.</p>
<p>At such times, if one of the brothers is watchful, he will be able to turn the condition of the meeting. In a basketball game, when there are only fifteen seconds left and the result has not yet been determined, the coach will ask for a time out to instruct the players, presenting them with a strategy so that they can score in the last fifteen seconds. Sometimes, because of the speaking during the time out, the team gains the final victory. It is the same with the condition of the meetings. Someone must be on the alert and speak something in spirit so that we all can learn and be encouraged.</p>
<p>When we older ones first began to serve in the church, we led in this way; that is, we exercised to be alert. Fifty years ago we learned to &ldquo;direct the rudder&rdquo; in the meeting; though the directing may have not been visible outwardly, we were absolutely in control of the rudder in a hidden way. For example, when a prayer in the meeting was off the mark, we would inwardly ask the Lord to bring the prayer back to the burden. When some saints were not functioning properly, we would ask the Lord to find someone to uplift the meeting. The Lord always answers this kind of prayer. Today in the process of changing the system, we must be on the alert while directing the rudder of the meeting. When we see that the condition of the meeting is not proper and that there are only three or five minutes remaining, we should stand up and speak a word to supply the saints. This depends on our labor in our daily life. If we speak well, we will be able to supply others. Our meetings must be like a feast to which we all gather. On the table there is food, not empty bowls and plates; however, the food may be tasteless. Nevertheless, if in the last few minutes someone would open his mouth to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word, everyone will be supplied. The Lord has revealed this way to us, and if we take it, every group meeting and district meeting will be enriched. This requires that we all labor.</p>
<p>We must labor over the Lord&rsquo;s word, grasping every opportunity to redeem the time and get into the riches in the Lord&rsquo;s word. After we have prepared a ten-minute prophecy, we can practice by speaking it to people. If we do not have a person to speak to, we can speak to the wall. We need to practice unceasingly so that we can quickly learn to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word in the meetings with a rich content. The sisters should not think that because they are sisters, they do not have a responsibility. Although the sisters cannot be elders, they should be prophets who prophesy for the Lord. There were many prophetesses in the Old Testament. For instance, the first one who took the lead to praise God after the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea was Miriam, a prophetess (Exo. 15:20-21). There are also prophetesses in the New Testament. According to Acts, Philip the evangelist had four daughters who prophesied (21:9); this, I believe, was due to Philip&rsquo;s family being a learned family. Hence, we see that the habit of prophesying must be promoted.</p>
<p>Whether we are a brother or a sister, we should prepare ourselves to prophesy in the district meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. We should not wait until the Lord&rsquo;s Day; instead, we should prepare our prophecy by Thursday. Then when we come to the meeting, we should speak it before the brothers and sisters to supply them. Preparing to prophesy in this way is worthwhile. Some may wonder if this kind of preparation involves too much human effort. However, if we consider Mary as an example, we will realize her familiarity with the Old Testament required human effort. Not every Jewish woman could have prophesied as she did; she truly was a blessed woman. We should also see that Mary did not prophesy as people had prophesied in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament when the Spirit of Jehovah fell upon someone, he was able to give a word of prophecy (Num. 24:2-9; 1 Sam. 10:6; 19:20; 2 Chron. 15:1-2). From the outset, however, Mary&rsquo;s prophesying was in the principle of the New Testament, which involves the cooperation of God and man, man working in coordination with God. God needed a woman like Mary who spent much effort to study the Scriptures, was well versed in God&rsquo;s word, loved the Lord inwardly, and had fellowship with the Lord. Only such ones are suitable candidates, and only such human effort coordinates with God&rsquo;s work. This is what we are shown in the beginning of the New Testament.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul exhorts the brothers and sisters to desire earnestly to prophesy; he exhorts them to desire not only the Lord but to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord. All the trainees should practice much in this matter; like the pious Mary, they need to consecrate themselves to love the Lord, study the Lord&rsquo;s word, and not waste time. If we waste time doing other things, we will not be right with ourself, and even more we will not be right with our parents. Our parents have the expectation that we will not waste our time, and we should not let them down; therefore, we must also firmly grasp the time and diligently exercise in every matter. We not only need to be familiar with the Bible, but we also need to thoroughly know the outlines and footnotes of every book. If the majority of us have this kind of spirit, what is within us will be manifested outwardly when we come to the meetings. We will be able to put forth what we have when the opportunity comes. This is to have our human work cooperate with God&rsquo;s work to speak forth God&rsquo;s word and speak it into people so that they may be supplied. How rich such a meeting will be!</p>
<p>In the past, under the influence of the tradition of Christianity, our meetings became somewhat deformed and were the same as the so-called Sunday worship services. Although we used the term <em>meeting</em> and everyone came with their Bibles, no one was concerned about what they should do because the responsible brothers made all the arrangements. It was not the saints&rsquo; responsibility to call hymns and pray, much less to speak; their responsibility was simply to sit and listen. After over thirty years of listening, we became numb, and a tradition of not speaking became established among us. This is the reason that it is so difficult to promote prophesying today. Hence, we should all enter into and promote prophesying, speaking for the Lord. In the past, we did not have the opportunity to do this, but now we have been given the opportunity in the district meetings. Whether we are brothers or sisters, we can join a district meeting, and when the opportunity comes, we can open our mouth to speak for the Lord and speak Him into others.</p>
<p>After serving the Lord for more than sixty years, I have seen that the saints, whether in the East or in the West, have been greatly influenced by Christianity. We know that the Lord&rsquo;s salvation enlivens man, but the practice in Christianity deadens man. Even if people are saved and enlivened through the gospel preaching of some great evangelists, they seem to become frozen once they are sent to the denominations. Although many have seen this outcome, no one has called out loudly to overturn the degraded tradition and let the saints rise up to function. Do not think that my speaking is too much. The burden within me is too heavy.</p>
<p>What causes my heart to ache the most is that some people have doubts concerning the new way. I must tell them to wait and see; the new way will succeed. We can be sure of this because we know that the new way is according to the Lord&rsquo;s word. Matthew 5:18 says that until heaven and earth pass away, not one iota or one serif will pass away from the Lord&rsquo;s word. First Corinthians 14:26 says, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.&rdquo; Though this word is very familiar to us, it has not yet been fulfilled. Can this word be in the Bible but not be fulfilled by the time the Lord returns? Moreover, Hebrews 10:25 says, &ldquo;Not abandoning our own assembling together...but exhorting one another.&rdquo; Do we have any meeting in which we exhort one another? We can say that in all of Christianity there is nothing like this; nevertheless, I have a deep conviction that these two verses in the Bible will be fulfilled. Even if I do not see the fulfillment and accomplishment of this word of the Lord in my lifetime, those who continue the recovery will surely see the success of the new way. The Lord will definitely fulfill this matter.</p>
<p>If we are wise, we should not adopt a wait-and-see attitude; rather, we should all endeavor and strive together. Even if we cannot see the success in our generation, the next generation will see it and be grateful that we who preceded them endeavored in this matter. History tells us that the reforms carried out by Martin Luther did not originate with him but were begun by a few pioneers who had brought in some reforms before him. The battle we are fighting is supported by the truth; no one can deny that. Even those with a wait-and-see attitude acknowledge that we are speaking according to the Bible; nevertheless, there is a big &ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash;they are unable to keep pace with us. I hope that all the elders and co-workers among us will say Amen instead of &ldquo;but.&rdquo; Let us all push this &ldquo;old car&rdquo; together. Even if the &ldquo;mountain road&rdquo; is difficult, we will be able to push the car uphill if several hundred are in one accord. This is our spirit; we all should have such a spirit.</p>
<p>I am not being proud when I say that in the early days, I was the first one to take this way in northern China. When we first took this way, we had such a spirit, and no one was able to shake us. Some in Chefoo said that they did not need to pay attention to us because we were merely a group of youngsters leading other youngsters and that we would come to an end. However, this was not the case; the situation of the whole church changed completely within as little as one or two years.</p>
<p>After I came to Taiwan, some people told me that the church ground of which I spoke would never work. Later, when I came to America, some people also tried to persuade me that if I spoke about the church ground, no one would accept it. Nevertheless, I was clear inwardly that they needed to wait and see. Although some may not accept it, they do not represent the whole world. It is true that some may not want to take this way, but there are many more who desire to take it. What matters is whether or not we are speaking the truth according to the Scriptures. If some could prove that my speaking was not according to the truth or the revelation in the Bible, I would immediately kneel down to pray, confess my sins, and ask the Lord for His forgiveness and the saints&rsquo; for their forgiveness. However, if my speaking is according to the Bible, none should put a question mark on it. In particular, those brothers who are my fellow workers should not have this kind of attitude. To do so is to be wrong and unfaithful. If some are my co-workers, they should be in one accord with me; otherwise, they are not my co-workers.</p>
<p>From now on, all the responsible ones in the district meetings need to direct the rudder and supply the meetings; otherwise, they cannot be considered responsible ones. To be a responsible one in the district meetings means to be one who prepares a &ldquo;dish&rdquo; in case everyone else fails to bring their &ldquo;dishes&rdquo; to the meeting. It also means being one who can put out some &ldquo;dessert&rdquo; even if everyone else has brought something. The responsible ones need not be in a hurry to prophesy; they can save their prophecy for the end and give priority to others. In this way, the district meetings will not be poor. A long message cannot supply people; everyone functioning is what supplies people.</p>
<p>A lengthy message may not supply people, but if in the last ten minutes of the district meeting a responsible one rises up to speak a finishing prophecy, it will be most edifying. The food we offer to people when they are hungry is the most delicious. They may be listening for forty-five minutes without receiving anything, but when a responsible one stands up to speak eight minutes, he can give them a sense of freshness and of being full of supply. I truly believe and have the assurance that this can be attained to.</p>
<p>Through this kind of fellowship, I hope that we are all clear and understand the direction we should take from now on. We are serving the churches; if we receive this burden, the meetings in all the churches will not be a problem. Furthermore, I hope that we can study and come together for fellowship concerning the increase or decrease in number within the ninety-six districts in the church in Taipei. In this way, we can receive the light for the future progress of our meetings. We are still in the process of investigation and improvement, and we want to receive help and revelation from these words of fellowship so that the churches may reap a great benefit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
