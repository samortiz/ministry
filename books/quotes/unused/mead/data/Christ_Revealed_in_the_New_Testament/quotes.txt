[1]  CHAPTER ONE CHRIST IN THE GOSPELS Scripture Reading: Luke 1:35; Matt 1:20; John 1:14; 14:9, 10; Matt 3:16; Luke 4:1, 14; Matt 27:45, 46; Luke 24:5, 6; John 20:22 OUTLINE Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit of God in the womb of a chaste virgin and born with both the nature of God and of man, being the complete God and perfect Man, a God-man in whom God and man are mingled Luke 1:35; Matt 1:20.
[2]  The Triune God, as the Son coming from and with the Father and by the Spirit, became a man of flesh on earth John 1:14; 1 Tim 3:16.
[3]  The Son is one with the Father, living by the Father, working with the Father, speaking the Father s word, and doing the Father s will John 10:30; 6:57; 5:19; 14:24; 6:38.
[4]  The first item of the outline says that this wonderful Person, Jesus Christ, was conceived of the Holy Spirit of God in the womb of a chaste virgin.
[5]  The origin of Jesus Christ is, on the one hand, God, and on the other hand, man.
[6]  THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT BEING ONE
[7]  Item number two continues by saying that the Son is one with the Father.
[8]  Essentially speaking, the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of life was in Him for His existence; economically speaking, the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of power came upon Him for His work.
[9]  Item number six says that the Triune God the Son as the good shepherd, the Spirit as the fine woman, and the Father as the loving father works together to seek, save, and receive the repentant sinners who turn to Him.
[10]  Item number ten says that this God-man entered death, passed through death, and overcame death.
[11]  CHAPTER TWO CHRIST IN THE ACTS Scripture Reading: Acts 1:3-5, 8-9, 12-14; 2:1-4, 16-18; 4:8,31; 13:9, 52; 6:3, 5; 7:55; 11:24; 8:29, 39; 13:2; 16:6-7 OUTLINE In His resurrection, after breathing Himself as breath into those who believed in Him, He was physically with them for forty days, sometimes appearing and sometimes disappearing to train them to be accustomed to His invisible presence so that they would realize the kingdom of God as the reality and sphere of the living of the divine life John 20:26; 21:1; Acts 1:3.
[12]  After charging the disciples to wait for the Spirit promised by the Father to fall on them so that they could be His witnesses unto the uttermost parts of the earth, He visibly departed from them according to God s economy and was taken up into heaven Acts 1:4-9.
[13]  Hence, they were able to withstand the threat of the Jews and remain in Jerusalem to wait for the promised Spirit of power from God, and the one hundred and twenty people were able to pray in one accord for ten days, cooperating with God s administration in heaven to bring in the great act of God at Pentecost Acts 1:12-14.
[14]  At Pentecost this exalted God-man, who has ascended to the throne to be made Lord and Christ and Head of all things by God Acts 2:33, 36; Eph 1:22 , poured Himself out as the Spirit of power on those disciples who had already received Him as the Spirit of life and who were waiting for the Spirit of power.
[15]  From now on those who believe in Him are filled outwardly with His Spirit of power Acts 2:4; 4:8, 31; 13:9 , and they are filled inwardly with His Spirit of life Acts 13:52 to be inwardly full of His Spirit Acts 6:3, 5; 7:55; 11:24 , becoming a group of people mingled as one with this all-inclusive Spirit.
[16]  Over fifty years ago, Brother Watchman Nee often told us that the Lord Jesus was the Son, but in eternity past He was the Father, and after resurrection He was the Spirit.
[17]  TO BRING IN THE GREAT ACT OF GOD S ECONOMY
[18]  Item number three says that as far as God s essence is concerned, He was still with the disciples by being in them.
[19]  CHAPTER THREE CHRIST IN THE EPISTLES Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2, 6, 9-11; 1 Cor 12:13; 3:16; 6:17; 2 Cor 1:21-22; 3:17-18; 13:14; Gal 3:14; 1:16; 2:20; 4:19; Eph 3:8, 17-19; Phil 1:19-21a; 1 John 2:27; Heb 7:25; 8:6 OUTLINE Christ, the last Adam, passed through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45.
[20]  Christ, the life-giving Spirit, as the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of Christ, who is Christ Himself, first enters into the believers spirits to make their spirit life.
[21]  He then spreads from their spirit to their mind, making their minds life also, and finally gives life to their mortal body, so that their whole being spirit, soul, and body is saturated by Him as the Spirit of life, and is sanctified and conformed to the image of Him as the firstborn Son of God, to become the many sons of God, being His living members to build up His Body to be His corporate expression Rom 8:2, 6, 9-11; 15:16; 8:29; 12:5.
[22]  After His ascension, He baptized all His believers, whether Jews or Gentiles, in Him as the all-inclusive Spirit into one Body, and made them to drink of one Spirit.
[23]  In this way they become the temple for Him to dwell in them as the Spirit and are joined to Him as the Spirit to become one spirit, that He may become wisdom to them from God: power, righteousness, sanctification, redemption, and everything 1 Cor 12:13; 3:16; 6:17; 1:24, 30.
[24]  With this all-inclusive Spirit He anoints His believers, sealing them and giving them this Spirit within them as the pledge of their enjoyment of God as their inheritance.
[25]  As the all-inclusive Lord in resurrection, who is the all-inclusive Spirit, He releases us from the bondage of law and ordinances, that we, with an unveiled face, may behold His glory, may be transformed into His image, from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.
[26]  He as the pneumatic Christ, being the blessing of the gospel promised by God, has been revealed in the believers, lives in them, and is being formed in them, that they may live to God by Him as the Spirit Gal 3:14; 1:16; 2:20; 4:19; 2:19; 5:25.
[27]  He as the pneumatic Christ who has ascended to the heavens and has been exalted by God as the Lord, being the Head of the church, will make His home in the hearts of the believers with His unsearchable riches, that they may be strong to apprehend with all the saints His breadth, length, height, and depth, that they may be filled unto all the fullness of God the full expression of God, the built up church, as the Body of Christ who fills all in all.
[28]  He as the compound Spirit of such a processed, all-inclusive, life-dispensing Triune God, being typified by the holy ointment in Exodus 30:23-25, abides in us as the anointing of the Triune God, for the purpose that we would abide in the Son and live in the fellowship of the Father, receiving the anointing of this all-inclusive, compound Spirit to enjoy the eternal life, overcoming sin, the world, and Satan, to live out God s inward love and outward righteousness 1 John 2:20, 23-28, 6; 1:5; 3:9; 5:4, 18; 4:7; 5:1; 2:29, 6, 24, 28.
[29]  As an example of the above, let us consider Ephesians 3:8.
[30]  Here Paul says that he will preach to us the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[31]  Although Christ is so mysterious and unlimited, He is very real and dear.
[32]  By calling on His name, we can experience Him and be saved by Him in everything in our daily life.
[33]  Item number five says that He, as the pneumatic Christ, is the blessing of the gospel promised by God.
[34]  Not only is Christ living in us, He has to be formed in us, with the result that we would live to God by Him as the Spirit.
[35]  Paul used this word to describe the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, which supplies all the needs of those who believe in Him and who live in Him so that they can suffer with Him under all kinds of circumstances by His resurrection power and in conformity to His death, thus living Him and magnifying Him, being enabled to do all things in Him through His empowering, and gaining Him as the righteousness of God manifested in us.
[36]  CHAPTER FOUR CHRIST IN REVELATION Scripture Reading: Rev 1:4-5; 4:5; 5:6; 1:20; 21:10-23; 22:1-2 OUTLINE The pneumatic Christ in the Epistles is the redeeming Lamb in Revelation, who also has become the Executor of God s New Testament economy Rev 5:7-10.
[37]  The all-inclusive, compound Spirit in the Epistles has become the seven Spirits before God s throne in Revelation.
[38]  The seven Spirits are the center of the divine Trinity in Revelation, proceeding out from the eternal One and of the redeeming One Rev 1:4-5.
[39]  The seven Spirits are the seven lamps of fire before God s throne for the execution of God s economy in the universe and also the seven eyes of the slain Lamb searching and transfusing the churches Rev 4:5; 5:6.
[40]  The redeeming Lamb as the High Priest in the holy place with the seven eyes which are the Spirits of the seven lamps of fire of God walks among the churches which are the seven golden lampstands to search and to transfuse all the churches that they would become His testimony, the testimony of Jesus Rev 1:12, 13, 20.
[41]  This One, who is the all-inclusive Head who walks in the midst of the churches to search and to transfuse them, is the Spirit who speaks to the churches, purifying the churches and calling forth the overcomers to enjoy Him that they would overcome the deformed churches to bring in His kingdom Rev 2:1, 7, 17, 18, 26-28; 3:7, 12-13, 14, 20-22.
[42]  As the Lamb who is God s High Priest, He is also God s particular Messenger to care for Israel, the chosen people of God, and the redeemed saints throughout the generations to execute the prayer of the saints concerning God s economy, to take over the earth in the future, and to descend in glory to claim the whole earth for His kingdom Rev 7:2-17; 8:3-5; 10:1-5; 18:1; 11:15.
[43]  The Holy Spirit in Revelation is no longer the one Spirit in the Epistles but the sevenfold, intensified Spirit, because the world today is corrupted, and the church is degraded, full of darkness and confusion; even the eyes of man s heart are blinded and cannot see clearly the will of God.
[44]  This sevenfold, intensified Spirit is the shining of the seven lamps of fire, enabling us to see the church clearly according to God s desire.
