<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: Can you tell us what kind of spiritual movement you are starting?</em></p>
<p>Answer: In response to this question, I would say that we do not want to be a part of any movement. Upon hearing this answer, you may wonder, &ldquo;If Brother Lee is not starting a new movement, then what is he doing?&rdquo; I can only answer you in the following way. God created the heavens, the earth, and man, but man fell. Thus, through incarnation God Himself came to be the second man (1 Cor. 15:47). This man died on the cross to put the entire old creation to an end, and then in resurrection He was transfigured into the Spirit so that He could impart His life into all those who believe into Him (v. 45). Those who believe into Him and receive Him as life into their spirit are the Body of Christ. God&rsquo;s desire is that this Body would express God the Father in the Son as the Spirit. This Body is the church (Eph. 1:22-23; Col. 1:18). Wherever they may be on this earth, the believers should come together as the corporate Body of Christ. They should come together to express, exhibit, exalt, and preach Christ. This is the church life.</p>
<p>We know from church history that Satan has done and continues to do many things to damage the Body of Christ and the genuine church life. One of the main things he has done is to bring many foreign things into the church. If you put a nail into your physical body, this foreign item will damage your body and cause it to suffer. This is an illustration of what Satan has done to the Body of Christ. In addition to bringing foreign things into the Body, Satan has done much to divide the Body. Thus, if we consider the condition of today&rsquo;s Christianity, we see these two things&mdash;foreign things and division. The Roman Catholic Church has brought many foreign things into the church, and the Protestant groups have produced a great number of divisions. I once read an article that was written following World War I. The brother who wrote the article said that in 1919 there were more than one thousand five hundred denominations. He also said that at that time there were more than one hundred divisions among the Brethren. That was in 1919. Consider how many more divisions there are today. This is a terrible and wicked situation.</p>
<p>Faced with a situation marked by foreign things and division, what shall we do, and what is the Lord doing? Today the Lord is working to deliver His people from all the damage caused by foreign things and division. We do not want to have any kind of movement; rather, we realize that the Lord is going to deliver us from the negative things, bring us back to the original state of the church, and lead us to have a very simple church life. We must forget about all the foreign things and all the division, and we must practice the church life in a simple and general way. Wherever we are and wherever we go, we should meet together with the saints as a corporate Body to express, experience, exalt, and preach Christ in a simple way. We believe that this is something that the Lord will recover in these last days.</p>
<p><em>Question: Who should be excluded and who should be accepted into the church life? Who would you recommend that we receive into our church life?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The only ones who should be excluded are those who are not saved. We must include all the believers. All the regenerated believers are members of the Body of Christ, even those in the Catholic Church. If some from the Catholic Church desire to participate in the church life, we must welcome them. If they do not have this desire, that is their business, and there is nothing that we can do. Our responsibility is to forget about all the foreign things and to forsake division. If someone were to come to me and ask what church I belong to, I would tell him that I simply belong to the church. There is only one church in the entire universe, and I belong to that one church. If they were to ask me what kind of Christian I am, I would say that I am simply a Christian.</p>
<p><em>Question: Some would question the practicality of actually doing this on a local scale. We are all members of the spiritual church, but how can this be carried out in actuality?</em></p>
<p>Answer: In the Scriptures this is very practical. Wherever Christians are, they should come together to practice the meeting life, the assembly life. This is a demand of the Spirit within all believers. If you are in Las Vegas, you should come together with the other believers in Las Vegas. You should not stay home and be a secret Christian. You need to join with others. This is very simple. The problem is that we have become confused by the situation in today&rsquo;s Christianity. If we were living in the first century and we had received the Lord, I believe it would have been very simple. We would have realized our need to join ourselves with the other Christians around us. Today we should do the same thing. If we live in Los Angeles, we should simply join with the other believers in Los Angeles. The problem today is that when a believer goes to Los Angeles, he does not know where to go, because there is so much confusion. The present situation is confusing, but in principle the church is something simple. It is genuine, divine, eternal, heavenly, spiritual, and of the Lord. Today if we want to realize the church life, we need to rid ourselves of all the foreign things in Christianity, forsake all the divisions, and be simple, general Christians, coming together in the place where we are, to worship God in Christ through the Spirit and to experience, exalt, exhibit, express, and preach Christ.</p>
<p><em>Question: It does not seem easy to find a group of believers whose desire to grow spiritually is strong enough that they are willing to take this way. What does it take for a believer to be brought to the point where he has the desire to take this way?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This relates to the third great matter that we considered earlier in this message&mdash;the application of the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. The question you are asking relates to how we can apply what Christ has accomplished. When we meet an unbeliever, we need to preach the gospel to him. This is clear to all of us. However, what should we do when we meet believers? When we meet a group of Christians who have been regenerated by the Lord and we realize that they do not have much realization of spiritual matters, we need to help them. First of all we need to help them to be impressed with the love of Christ. For this we need to pray much. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, I need these saints. I realize that they are genuine brothers and sisters in Christ. However, I also realize that although they have been regenerated, they do not love You very much. Work in them and cause them to love You more.&rdquo; In addition to praying for these believers, we need to fellowship with them to stir up their hearts to love the Lord more. If they would begin to love the Lord more and would offer themselves to the Lord, the Spirit would have the ground within them and would be able to work in them and cause them to desire to take this way.</p>
<p>If we have the desire to realize the genuine church life, we must consecrate ourselves to the Lord again. We should go to the Lord and tell Him, &ldquo;Lord, cause me to love You more.&rdquo; Stanza 1 of <em>Hymns,</em> #368 says, &ldquo;More love to Thee, O Lord, / More love to Thee! / Hear Thou the prayer I make / On bended knee; / This is my earnest plea: / More love, O Lord, to Thee, / More love to Thee, / More love to Thee!&rdquo; We need to love the Lord more, and we need to help others to love and seek the Lord more. Then the Holy Spirit will have the ground in us to bring us on and to apply to us everything that God has accomplished for His eternal purpose.</p>
