   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BUILDING UP THE ELDERS MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I hope we will overturn the Chinese disposition, which is to be nice and polite when sitting in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even if everyone decided to visit hell, there would be no disagreement; at the most there might be an oblique suggestion to visit heaven instead.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But after the meeting, everyone is freely criticized and condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the elders come together, they can talk and debate about everything, but in the end everyone must be in one accord to carry out the decision.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No one can act independently.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Please remember that we are not serving merely as elders in our own little halls; we are serving as one of the elders of the entire church in conjunction with eighty other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the past I told the senior elders that they should not carry the burden of the church in Taipei entirely on their own shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They must build up the elders meeting and let that meeting lead and direct the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only in this way can the church be strong and the Lord have a free way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I returned to Taiwan a year and a half ago, I appointed eighty elders.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The purpose of my appointment was to build up the elders meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I hope that we will learn to pick up the burden of the church and will learn to expand and head up the church in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only then will the church advance and have a good future.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In summary, our goal is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to work on the communities because the general population is there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church must follow the direction of the population.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the same time, we must work on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to gain the present generation of young people for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In particular, the church must do something at National Taiwan University.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For this purpose, the elders need to rise up, pray much, and fellowship concerning what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For now, we will advance toward these two main goals.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The spreading of the gospel in other areas will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is right to be careful and cautious, but where there is a will, there is a way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord wants our cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church is here, and it should have some action and endeavoring.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Several times in the past I rebuked the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I pointed out that in Taiwan, industry, commerce, education, and politics are all advancing, but the church is not advancing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have waited for many years, but nothing has changed; everything has remained the same.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the reason I made the drastic decision to come back and do something myself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The elders can consider themselves a new generation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The senior elders should also consider themselves as young and vigorous.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should begin everything anew and build up the church anew.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot sit around and do nothing, merely conveying a little truth and life to the saints and expecting them to grow in life at their own pace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the island of Taiwan the Lord has been delayed by our delaying for more than thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There has been no gain, no progress.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the face of all the advances and prosperity around us, we must do something.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should strive with all we have.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only then will the Lord have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must pick up these three burdens building up the home meetings, having a success in the truth-teaching meetings, and aggressively developing the community and campus work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>MATCHING GOD S WORK WITH OUR MATERIAL SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to pick up the burden and to spread the work aggressively, we need to match God s work with our material supply.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The present urgent need is to take care of the full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today the standard of living in Taiwan is high, yet our support for the full-timers is very low.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These full-timers have given up their future for the spread of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In addition to taking care of their living, they also give away books and booklets to their contacts and the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For this reason, I have seriously considered before the Lord to raise the support of the full-timers so that they will not need to worry about their living and can concentrate on the great work of evangelizing Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have presented all these needs to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I hope we will see that the gospelization of Taiwan is not a slogan.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must give our all.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The need of the full-timers is at least NT 120,000,000 approximately US 4,000,000 per year.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we can raise this amount, we can be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we cannot raise this amount, we are not qualified to be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In order for all the saints to give everything to the Lord, the co-workers and elders must be in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must take the lead to charge forward.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The result will surely come.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, if we expect the horses to run fast without supplying them with adequate grass, we are impractical.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord cannot bless this kind of attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I say this because I am clear within that the Lord has blessed us greatly in material supply.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today the assets and income of most of the saints far exceed their need.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The question is whether or not we are truly for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Have we truly consecrated our all to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we all put our shoulders together, we can build a city.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When everyone gives a hand, we can lift many things easily.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If everyone puts in his share, we will more than meet our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This requires not only the churches attention and the saints awareness but also our practical consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In addition to all this, should any church or meeting hall have some promising persons, I hope we would send them to the United States for special training.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Their mind will be opened when they learn from other churches and fellowship with other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the way the world advances in science, education, and commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It encourages international exchange, and the result is phenomenal.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We, however, are barely moving at all.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We need to learn so that the church can catch up with the advance of the age.</S>
