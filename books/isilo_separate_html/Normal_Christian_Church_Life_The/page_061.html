He dared to say to those who were almost his sole supporters, &#8220;I have received in full all things and abound.&#8221; Paul gave no hint of need, but took the position of a wealthy child of a wealthy Father, and he had no fears that by doing so further supplies would not be forthcoming. It was all very well for apostles to say to an unbeliever who himself was in distress, &#8220;Silver and gold I do not possess,&#8221; but it would never have done for a needy apostle to say that to believers who would be ready to respond to an appeal for help. It is a dishonor to the Lord if any representative of His discloses needs that would provoke pity on the part of others. If we have a living faith in God, we shall always make our boast in Him, and we shall dare to proclaim under every circumstance, &#8220;I have received in full all things and abound.&#8221; There is nothing petty or mean about God&#8217;s true servants; they are all great souls. The following lines were penned by Miss M. E. Barber on Psalm 23:5 when she had used her last dollar:<p class=hbody>There is always something over,<br>When we trust our gracious Lord;<br>Every cup He fills o&#8217;erfloweth,<br>His great rivers all are broad.<br>Nothing narrow, nothing stinted,<br>Ever issued from His store;<br>To His own He gives full measure,<br>Running over, evermore.</p><p class=hbody>There is always something over,<br>When we, from the Father&#8217;s Hand,<br>Take our portion with thanksgiving,<br>Praising for the path He planned.<br>Satisfaction, full and deepening,<br>Fills the soul, and lights the eye,<br>When the heart has trusted Jesus<br>All its need to satisfy.</p><p class=hbody>There is always something over,<br>When we tell of all His love;<br>Unplumbed depths still lie beneath us,<br>Unscaled heights rise far above.<br>Human lips can never utter<br>All His wondrous tenderness.<br>We can only praise and wonder<br>And His Name for ever bless.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_060.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_062.html">Next</a> </body></html>
