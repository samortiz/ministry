The Jews Rejecting the Apostles' Preaching<br>and Persecuting the Apostles</H2><P>The Jews rejected the apostles' preaching and persecuted the apostles (Acts 13:45-46, 50; 14:2, 5, 19; 17:13; 18:12-13; 19:9; 20:3; 21:27-36). The Jews pursued the apostles in order to persecute them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Judaizers Stressing<br>Circumcision among the Believers</H2><P>The Judaizers stressed circumcision among the believers (Acts 11:1-3; 15:1-2). That was something quite negative.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. Peter and Barnabas Becoming Weak<br>in Keeping the Truth of the Gospel</H2><P>Peter and Barnabas became weak in keeping the truth of the gospel (Gal. 2:11-14). They became hypocritical and were rebuked by Paul.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. Barnabas Separating Himself<br>and His Work from Paul</H2><P>In Acts 15:36-39 Barnabas separated himself and his work from Paul. That terminated Barnabas' glorious ministry. For this reason, in the remaining chapters of Acts, although there is a long record of the glorious activity of Paul, there is not a word of glory concerning the activity of Barnabas. He was out of the flow of the Spirit. Barnabas is mentioned elsewhere in the New Testament, but he is not mentioned with any record of glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>g. The Church in Corinth<br>Having Divisions, Fornication, and Lawsuits,<br>Questioning the Apostleship of Paul,<br>and Condemning Paul of Being Crafty,<br>Saying That He Took Advantage of Them by Guile</H2><P>The church in Corinth had divisions, fornication, and lawsuits (1 Cor. 1:10-13; 11:18-19; 5:1; 6:1, 6-8). They also questioned the apostleship of Paul (9:1-3) and even accused Paul of being crafty, saying that through Titus he took advantage of them by guile (2 Cor. 12:16-18). In principle, the situation is the same today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>h. The Jewish Preachers of the Gospel<br>Preaching the Gospel in Rivalry with Paul</H2><P>The Jewish preachers, the Judaizers, preached the gospel in rivalry with Paul (Phil. 1:15-17). From this we see that there can be rivalry even in the preaching of the gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>i. The Judaizers, as Dogs, Evil Workers, the Concision,<br>and False Brothers, Stealing into the Churches</H2><P>Philippians 3:2 and Galatians 2:4 reveal that the Judaizers, as dogs, evil workers, the concision, and false brothers, stole into the churches to cause trouble.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> </body></html>
