   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LETTER FROM SISTER RUTH LEE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HER TRAVELS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The following letter was written to Brother Witness and me by Sister Lee while she was traveling and working in southern China.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>She specifically requested that we not publish her letter in Collection of Newsletters because it is contrary to the position of head covering for a sister to talk about church matters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But feeling that this letter is profitable to the believers in each locality, we publish it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brother Lee and I assume full responsibility for its content and anything pertaining to it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ruth Lee's Letter Reads:</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Dear Brothers Watchman and Witness:</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It has been one month and four days since I left Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I arrived in Swatow on June 13.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I left Swatow on July 10 and arrived in Hong Kong on the eleventh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I arrived in Kung Ho City in Tai Shan on the twelfth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I already described the approximate condition in Swatow in my letter of July 9 to the sisters in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On June 25, I wrote a letter to Mr. Watchman which was delivered by the #215 in which I explained why I could not return to Shanghai for a time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I asked that the responsibility for editing the Collection of Newsletters be given to Mr. Witness in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I did not mean to place a heavy burden upon the brother, but I have a desperate reason for not being able to return to Shanghai the sisters outside of Shanghai truly have a need.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They do not have as many good opportunities as the sisters in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I will stay in Tai Shan until August 5.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the beginning of next week, we will start a sisters' conference.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In general, the first week will be for preaching, the second week for studying the Bible, and the third week for preaching again.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every afternoon there will be a time for individual fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All work must pass through fire to prove its value.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What can one do apart from the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At this time, in the various places, through personal fellowship with the brothers and sisters and from what I have seen and heard, I have much for which to be grateful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet I also have some fear and sighings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Most of the brothers and sisters in Swatow are like a sheet of white all that is needed is some good writing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are also like a piece of good ground all they need is proper sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Within a year's time, about twenty brothers and forty to fifty sisters have actually begun meeting together, not including those who only come for the messages.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The sisters in Taishan labor incessantly and offer themselves to the best of their ability.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These are good signs.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I wish that from now on the brothers would pay attention to the following matters:</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>1 If the brothers in a certain locality desire to have the Lord's table, they should at least know what the church is and the reason for the table.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If some presume that simply because they have no name they are not a sect, and yet in many activities they are a sect in another form, and if they consider that only they are the church and are better than anyone else, then inevitably they will become the worst sect.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>2 The brothers and sisters in a locality who are lacking in gift should procure proper jobs and serve God with their jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Otherwise, they simply become dead preachers sitting in their parishes, where neither sinners are being saved nor brothers and sisters are growing in life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Consequently, the place is full of spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may ignore any derision from the denominations, but what about our testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If a place is without a worker, it is best for the brothers and sisters there to pray livingly, remember the Lord, and give personal testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not necessary to adhere to a set form.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a brother or sister professes to be called by the Lord yet is not gifted, then in the eyes of others, this calling is questionable.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The problem with this kind of worker is that he is either presumptuous or lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sometimes problems also arise in regard to material supply those who are pure may suffer hardship, while others may make godliness a means of gain.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>3 If a brother or sister is gifted, it is best for him or her to serve God according to what he or she has.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For anyone to go beyond their gift when they minister will unavoidably be unreal or in error.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>4 Even though we are standing on the "right" side, nevertheless, it would be best that our messages would emphasize what is in the Bible, without saying explicitly that this denomination or that denomination is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should let any seeking one, after hearing the truth and realizing the error in which he is, be willing to pay the price to follow the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Avoid arguing over minor points.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To be divided because of different interpretations of the Bible, is not this the way of the Brethren?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>More and more I feel that every time as we break the bread, although our eyes can only see a certain number of brothers and sisters, yet, through the bread, what we actually see are all the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Otherwise, the testimony of Ephesians 1:23 is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>5 When the authority of a local church is in the hands of the sisters, and the sisters are not clear, then the brothers should be frank to admonish them concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But if the sisters intentionally refuse to stand on the proper position, then the brothers will not have a standing there.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, there are some places where the sisters are very good, while the brothers are old, formal, and dead.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In such cases there is need for some enlightened brother to deal with these brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If the brothers will not listen, then one cannot blame the sisters for backsliding or being disjointed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In cases like this, the brothers are still a sect, only with the word free added to it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is excusable to be in this situation if one is unclear, but if he is disobedient after knowing, then it becomes a matter of motive.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The reason why I have said so much is not that the brothers in Shanghai have any strong points or special authority; I am only hoping that in your speaking or writing you would pay attention to these aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I am a sister, and in this letter I am simply conversing with you as a member of the family giving you a report of these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The brothers in Swatow are very burning for the gospel, preaching twice weekly with two brothers responsible each time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this matter I will be honest to say that the brothers in Shanghai are behind.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I really ask the Lord to supply the work and the need of the workers in each of these localities.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Recently quite a few brothers and sisters in each locality were out of jobs, while the others mostly had only average jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although many brothers and sisters have given their utmost, there is still a lack for the work and the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>On the one hand, the workers should never tell the brothers and sisters directly or indirectly of their need by giving hints or speaking through others.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Yet on the other hand, often some brothers and sisters either regard the responsible worker as a rich man, or sometimes care only for the work and not the worker.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I say this not because I have a need, but because of my observation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Pardon me for writing about so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Sincerely yours,</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Ruth Lee</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Greetings to all the brothers and sisters in Shanghai.</S>
