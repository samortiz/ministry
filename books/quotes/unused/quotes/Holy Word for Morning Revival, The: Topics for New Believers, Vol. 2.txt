11:6 But without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to Him, for he who comes forward to God must believe that He is
Elohim, a plural noun in Hebrew, implies the notions of the strong One and faithfulness, hence, the faithful, strong One
The Gospel of John reveals that He is all we need: life, light, food, drink, the pasture, the way, and everything
Do not believe either in your weakness or in your strength, for both your weakness and your strength will pass away
Some have said wrongly that the three of the Godhead, the Father, Son, and Spirit, are separate from one another
They are one God with three aspects-the aspect as the Father, the aspect as the Son, and the aspect as the Spirit
Paul said that the last Adam, who was the Son in the flesh, after His death and resurrection became a life-giving Spirit
Father, in Greek Pater, denotes that God as the Father is the origin, the source, of all the families of God's creatures
In God's creation there are many families, such as the family of the angels, the family of mankind, and the family of the animals
We are the genuine family because we were not only created by God as the Creator the origin the source but also regenerated begotten by God
28:19 Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
Many more particulars concerning God's person are revealed in the New Testament than are unveiled in the Old Testament
These points may be compared to the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that need to be put together in order to form a complete picture
21 Matthew 28:19 says that we need to baptize the nations into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
A person may have a first name, a middle name, and a last name, but these are all actually one name for one person
In Acts 7:2, as Stephen was testifying before the Sanhedrin, he said, 'The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham
The glory here might have been visible glory, as when the cloud and the fire appeared to Israel and filled the tabernacle and temple
It separated, sanctified, him from the world unto God , and it was a great encouragement and strength which enabled him to follow God
One day the God of glory came to us through the preaching of the gospel, and we were attracted and convinced and began to appreciate Him
During that time, the God of glory transfused some element of His being into us, and we believed in Him spontaneously
The father then said to his slaves, 'Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet
The word 'eternal' means being uncreated, without beginning or ending, existing by itself, and ever, unchangeably existing
Because of His great love, God is rich in mercy to save us from our wretched position to a condition that is suitable for His love
The nobler love of God as His essential attribute needs His attribute of mercy to reach us in the deep pit of our fallen life
The emphasis here is that the Triune God is holy and is triply holy, referring to the quality of God's nature-God's being
Holy not only means sanctified, separated unto God, but also different, distinct, from everything that is common
For us, God's chosen ones, to be holy is to partake of His nature and to have our whole being permeated with God Himself
Whereas holiness is related to God's inward nature, righteousness is related to God's outward acts, ways, actions, and activities
Whenever our conscience condemns us because of our failures, we need to remember to stand upon the foundation of God's righteousness
In the future you may fail Him and become very disappointed with yourself, unable to believe that God could ever forgive you
Tell Him that no matter how much you have failed, Christ is still at His right hand as the receipt for payment for all your debts
Whenever we confess our sins, claim the blood of Jesus, and appeal to God's righteousness, God has no choice except to forgive us
The foundation is not our fervency or victory; it is God's righteousness, the unshakable foundation of God's throne
In a general way God is dispensing Himself into us, but in a particular, actual, and practical way God is dispensing His Trinity into us
His Trinity is constituted solely with His person, and His person is in the Trinity-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
In order for us to enjoy God's dispensing, we need to consider all the aspects of who Christ is and what Christ is
In the Old Testament the Master of the slaves is called Adonai, but in the New Testament, in the Greek, He is called Despotes
Jesus is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name Joshua , which means Jehovah the Savior, or the salvation of Jehovah
To be anointed means to be appointed by God to be His Christ, to be His anointed One, for the accomplishing of His eternal economy
In the New Testament the two titles, Jesus and Christ, are often used as a compound title, either Jesus Christ or Christ Jesus
47 We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that our Lord Jesus Christ is the very God who is over all and blessed forever
His disciple John wrote in the very beginning of his Gospel, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God
All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being'
The Lord Jesus is not only God but also man; hence, He is qualified to be the Mediator, the go-between, of God and men
Rather, in eternity He was God and not man, but two thousand years ago He was born of the virgin Mary through the Holy Spirit to be a man
1:30 But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption
When we experience Christ as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, we truly have Him as wisdom to us from God
55 All the types, shadows, and figures of Christ in the Old Testament are descriptions, explanations, and definitions of what Christ is
Paul said that Christ is the treasure that we contain as earthen vessels, vessels that are worthless and fragile
We need to continually practice living by Him and thus pass through a time of travailing that Christ may be formed in us
We may live by our natural life and even become perfect men, but we are still human beings; we are merely copper, not gold
Our problem today is that after we are saved, we keep trying to be a proper Christian living a pure and faultless life
In the apostle's suffering in his body, Christ was magnified, that is, shown or declared to be great , exalted, and extolled
In order to live and magnify Christ, Paul said that he suffered the loss of all things and counted them as refuse that he might gain Christ
Paul was zealous for the law to such an extent that he said that he was blameless according to the righteousness which was in the law
He cast all those things aside completely, counting them as refuse on account of the excellency of the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ
Because of such knowledge, he was willing to pay the price by considering all things to be loss, refuse, that he might gain Christ
Toward such a One our reaction should be that it is no longer we who live but it is Christ who is God man and the Spirit who lives in us
He is waiting to be formed in us, He wants us to live Him out and express Him, even to the extent that for us to live is Christ
We should consider the knowledge of Christ as something excellent and aspire to know such a Christ and the power of His resurrection
The power of Christ's resurrection will operate in us so that our living is full of the experience and enjoyment of Him
The first stage of Christ's full ministry was the stage of His incarnation, from His birth through His human living to His death
He was begotten as God's firstborn Son; second, He became the life-giving Spirit; and third, He regenerated the believers for His Body
From the time of His incarnation, when He put on human nature, He possessed humanity in addition to His divinity; hence, He had two natures
The holy anointing ointment typifies the compound, life-giving Spirit whom Christ became in the stage of His inclusion
He is intensifying His organic salvation; second, He is producing His overcomers; and third, He is consummating the New Jerusalem
The first thing that happened in the degradation of the church was the turning away from the apostles' teaching
If we do not experience the Lord's being with our spirit and therefore lose the presence of grace, that is the degradation of the church
The difference between God's move, God's act, God's work, and religions is that religions do not have the Spirit
The first story is concerning God's creation of the heavens and the earth, with millions of items, and His creation of man
79 This divine title is first used when God came in to prepare a forerunner of the Lord Jesus and a human body for Christ
The Holy Spirit in God's incarnation makes man distinct from being common as God is distinct in His holy nature
Galatians 4:6 says, 'Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father'!
The Redeemer the Savior who passed through incarnation human living crucifixion resurrection and ascension became a lifegiving Spirit
84The title 'the life-giving Spirit' indicates that the Spirit is moving, working, and living in us to impart life into us
He was among the disciples, but He needed to go through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit
When we are the partakers of the Holy Spirit , this means that we are the partakers of the Holy Spirit as grace
The Spirit is called the Spirit of reality because whatever the Father in the Son is and whatever the Son is, is realized in the Spirit
Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne
The seven Spirits in Revelation 1:4 undoubtedly are the Spirit of God because They are ranked among the Triune God
As seven is the number for completion in God's operation, so the seven Spirits must be for God's move on earth
The seven lamps here refer to the seven lamps of the lampstand in Exodus 25:37 and the seven lamps of the lampstand in Zechariah 4:2
The seven lamps of fire which are the seven Spirits of God signify the enlightening and searching of the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God
The seven lamps are for God's judgment, which will issue also in God's building-the building of the New Jerusalem
When all the aspects and elements of the Spirit are put together, we have a totality, an aggregate, known in the New Testament as the Spirit
On the night of resurrection the Lord came into the midst of the disciples and breathed into them a breath saying Receive the Holy Spirit
100 By breathing the Spirit into the disciples, the Lord Jesus imparted Himself into them as life and everything
Rivers of living water are the many flows of the different aspects of life of the one unique river of water of life
102 One river is the river of peace, and other rivers are joy, comfort, righteousness, life, holiness, love, patience, and humility
Make it very clear that the compound ointment was strictly for the purpose of anointing the tabernacle and the priests
Only those who are for the building of God and the priesthood of God can have the enjoyment of the compound, all-inclusive, processed Spirit
In 2 Corinthians 1:21 Paul says, 'The One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God'
John 2:20 says that we have an anointing from the Holy One, and verse 27 says that this anointing abides in us
While the Holy Spirit is anointing us, He kills the negative things in our being, and He purifies and cleanses us with all that Christ is
113 Today we all are under the anointing of the compound Spirit with Christs divinity humanity allinclusive death and wonderful resurrection
117 There is no need to teach a peach tree to bring forth peaches because there is a law of life in that plant
We see that the children of God have been born of God, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man
The condition for being heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ is that 'we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him'
Divine inheritance is the Triune God with all He has, all He has done, and all He will do for His redeemed people
In His divinity with His humanity that passed through death and resurrection, He was born in resurrection as God's firstborn Son
As the Firstborn, Christ has both humanity and divinity, and as His brothers we have both divinity and humanity
Christ indwells our spirit, and from our spirit He spreads throughout our entire being, thereby making His home in our heart
16:24 Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me
In this we shall begin to cover the four designations of the believers given in the New Testament disciples believers saints and Christians
In 1 Timothy 4:12 charges Timothy to 'be a pattern to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity'
In 2 Corinthians 6:14 Paul exhorts the Corinthian believers not to 'become dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers'
Because of their divine nature and holy standing, the believers should not be yoked together with the unbelievers
1:2 To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints
The expression 'called saints' indicates that the believers in Christ are the called saints; they are not called to be saints
If we turn away from ourselves and look at Christ, in whom we have been sanctified, we shall be able to declare that we are saints
God has put us into Christ, and this makes it possible for us to experience the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity
144 The ending ianos, denoting an adherent of someone, was applied to slaves belonging to the great families in the Roman Empire
One who worshipped the emperor the Caesar or Kaisar was called Kaisarianos which means an adherent of Kaisar a person who belongs to Kaisar
When people believed in Christ and became His followers, some in the Empire came to consider Christ a rival of their Kaisar
At Antioch they began to call the followers of Christ Christianoi , adherents of Christ, as a nickname, a term of reproach
On the one hand, the Lord Jesus says that the believers are wheat ; on the other hand, He tells us that the believers are the good seed
147 Here three things are interrelated: the word of the kingdom, the sons of the kingdom, and Christ Himself as the life within the seed
148 Therefore, the good seed, as well as the wheat, is the sons of the kingdom, the real believers, those regenerated with the divine life
The sowing of the good seed is a kind of martyrdom, for the seed experiences a real crucifixion and is put to death
Those who are not willing to be sown into the ground, who are not willing to be put to death, will be barren and unfruitful
At regeneration we received the seed of the divine life, which by its growth in us transforms us into living stones
When Peter received the revelation concerning Christ, the Lord revealed further that He also was the rock-a stone
157It takes a long time in our life and it requires us to contact God, to receive God, and to get God added into us all the day
It is by the Spirit living in us as a foundation; then the Father and the Son come to us to make a mutual abode with us
To do a building work in us, making an abode which will be a mutual dwelling place for the Triune God and for us
If we see this, we will realize that all our problems today are due to one thing- our shortage of having God in Christ built into our being
If you would be a proper Christian, you need to see not only the vision of Christ but also the vision of the church
The purpose of the ages is the purpose of eternity, the eternal purpose, the eternal plan of God made in eternity past
In order for Christ to form the church it was necessary for Him to pass through death and enter into resurrection
In resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit , and now He can come into the believers to impart life to them
After showing the disciples 'His hands and His side' , the Lord 'breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit'
Ten days later, on the day of Pentecost, He, having again received the consummated Spirit, poured out this Spirit upon all His disciples
The second step was the Lord's pouring out Himself as the consummated Spirit upon the believers, baptizing them into one Body
The church is formed not only with all the believers as the extrinsic form but also with Christ as the intrinsic constituent
181 Universally, all the churches are one Body, and locally, every local church is a local expression of that universal Body
When God caused Christ to die on the cross, one of the soldiers pierced His side, and blood and water flowed out
189 The church is the issue of the Triune God the Father embodied in the Son the Son realized as the Spirit and the Spirit mingled with us
Such a high vision of the church needs us to pray, 'Lord, give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation to see and to know what Your church is'
We can see that oil being poured upon a stone signifies that God is poured upon man, that God is mingled with man
The Greek word , poiema, means something that has been made, a handiwork, or something that has been written or composed as a poem
Not only a poetic writing may be considered a poem, but also any work of art that expresses the maker's wisdom and design
197 This masterpiece of God was created in Christ through His death and resurrection with His divine element in its all-inclusiveness
There are two Israels: the one in the flesh, located in what was called Palestine, and the one in the Spirit, to which we belong
Express God's image, and execute God's authority, and are typified by Jacob, who was transformed into Israel, a prince of God and a victor
Christendom has become a big tree producing no fruit, but having become a lodging place for so many evil things
According to the literal sense of the word, the church is the assembly of those called out of the world by God
208 There must be a great and thorough separation between the church as the ekklesia and the world as the system, the cosmos, of Satan
As the assembly, the church is separated entirely for God so that He may have a means to carry out His eternal purpose
In the Old Testament both the tabernacle and the holy temple were called the house of God , which was a type of the church
The house of God, the dwelling place of God on earth, the place in which God can have His rest and put His trust
God's house is a matter of life and enjoyment; all believers are born of God into His house to enjoy His riches
When he lives a life of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit in the church, he is in the reality of the kingdom of God
When he labors and works for the church according to God's intention, he labors and works for the kingdom of God
On the one hand, the church is the Body of Christ, and we take Christ as our life to act, to work, and to bear responsibilities
On the other hand, the church is the new man, and we take Christ as our person to make plans and to decide on how we should live
227 Since the kingdom is one of the most complicated subjects in the Bible, the chart on pages will be a great help to our understanding
Genesis 1 says that God created man in His own image and that He gave man the authority to rule all the created things
The plants in the plant kingdom have the plant life, and the animals in the animal kingdom have the animal life
The kingdom of God as the reign of God is a divine realm to be entered into, a realm which requires the divine life
Unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens
232 In the book of Ephesians, Christ as our life has saved us into a position in which we are above all God's enemies
Before we were saved, our situation was like that of the prodigal son in Luke 15-rebellion against the heavens
After we received the call from the heavens, we became another kind of people, people no longer of this earth but of the heavens
As we shall see this rule is in our spirit for this rule is nothing other than the living One Christ consummated as the lifegiving Spirit
The kingdom of the heavens is a part of the kingdom of God just as Texas and Louisiana are part of the United States
Texas and Louisiana are the United States, but it is not correct to say that the United States is Texas and Louisiana
We can say that the kingdom of the heavens is the kingdom of God, but we cannot say that the kingdom of God is the kingdom of the heavens
237 To enter into the kingdom of the heavens is to live in its reality today and to participate in its manifestation in the future
239 the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the inward content of the kingdom of the heavens in its heavenly and spiritual nature
Unveiled to that the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the victorious living of the overcoming believers
The kingdom of the heavens within the kingdom of God in this age has its appearance, in addition to its reality
248 The first of these is the tares, signifying the nominal Christians , growing together with the wheat, the real believers
The church, according to its heavenly and spiritual nature, should be like the mustard, sojourning on the earth
The third item in the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is leaven taken by a woman and hidden in three measures of meal
The church as the practical kingdom of the heavens with Christ the unleavened fine flour as its content must be a loaf of unleavened bread
Such leavening is absolutely against the Scriptures, which strongly forbid putting any leaven into the meal offering
The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the last aspect of the kingdom of the heavens258 will occur at the Lord's coming back
262 If we exercise ourselves in a proper way after we are saved, we will enjoy the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens as a reward
263 How we live, walk, function, and work for the Lord after we are saved is the ground for the Lord to reward us
The last section of Matthew concerns the manifestation of the kingdom when the Lord Jesus will come back to the earth
They show us that, at the manifestation of the kingdom, some of the saints will enter into the joy of the Lord, and others will not
The servant with one talent missed the joy and also was put into darkness where there was weeping and gnashing of teeth
During the time Paul was living, there were the Greek Olympic games where people ran the race in order to receive a prize
All the saved Christians must run the race to win the prize , not salvation in the common sense but a reward in a special sense
At the time Paul wrote Philippians he had been a believer for many years, but he was still pursuing toward the goal for the prize
The prize is the uttermost enjoyment of Christ in the millennial kingdom as a reward to the victorious runners of the New Testament race
When Paul knew that his martyrdom was imminent, he had the assurance to tell us that he would be awarded with the crown of righteousness
The crown is a symbol of glory given as a prize, in addition to the Lord's salvation, to the triumphant runner of the race
Such a reward will be awarded to the believers, not according to the grace of the Lord, but according to His righteousness
Paul was assured that such a prize was reserved for him and would be awarded to him at the day of the Lord's second appearing
We must all be clear that to be saved eternally is one thing, and to be exercised to bear responsibility in the kingdom is another thing
We must realize that as Christians today we are in the kingdom of the heavens-today to be exercised and tomorrow to be rewarded
The kingdom is the requirement of the gospel and this requirement can only be met by the life of Christ within us
We must not interpret this noble revelation in God's Word according to our natural view or religious superstition
The book of Revelation itself indicates that we should interpret the New Jerusalem not according to the letter but as a sign
In the typology in the Old Testament, the Passover lamb signifies Christ as the One offered to God for our redemption
The old man has nothing of God in it, but the new man is not only born of God but also created and constituted with God
There is no saturation of God in the Old Testament, and the holiness, or sanctification, there is only positional, not dispositional
In the New Testament, however, we see both objective, positional sanctification and subjective, dispositional sanctification
The New Jerusalem is a city composed of living persons who have been separated unto God and saturated with Him
In 12:22, however, the writer tells us that we have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem
Many Christians are waiting to go to the New Jerusalem, but we need to realize that we have come to the New Jerusalem already
On top of the mountain is a throne, from which the street spirals down to the bottom to reach the twelve gates
298 This indicates that God the Father in His nature , signified by the pure gold, is the base on which this organic building is built
When an oyster is wounded by a grain of sand, it secretes its life-juice around the grain of sand and makes it into a precious pearl
304 Such an entry today is available to all the people on this earth in four directions: east, north, south, and west
21:14, 18-19 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb
The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation was jasper
On this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month
306 The apostles here represent the grace of the New Testament, signifying that the New Jerusalem is built upon the grace of God
All the apostles were created as clay, but they were regenerated and were transformed into precious stones for God's eternal building
For administration this throne is the throne of authority, and for provision this throne is the throne of grace
Hebrews 4:16 tells us that we may come to the throne of grace to 'receive mercy and find grace for timely help'
If there were not such a throne, then in the New Jerusalem there would be no administration, no communication, no food, and no water
316We need to consider why the temple is considered a furnishing of the holy city and not part of the structure itself
317 The holy city as the tabernacle of God is for God to dwell in, and God and the Lamb as the temple are for us to dwell in
318 Thus, the redeeming God is not only the basic factor for the structure of the New Jerusalem but also the very central furnishing
323 However, with the redeeming Christ as the lamp, the divine light does not kill us but instead illumines us
The glory of God as the light is in the redeeming Lamb as the lamp shining through this organic building as the light's diffuser
In eternity God's redeemed will drink of the water of the river of life, eat of the fruit of the tree of life, and walk in the light of life
