He gives us the overcoming life by giving us His Son, who becomes our victory. Paul said, "For to me, to live is Christ" (Phil. 1:21a). Paul did not say that we should live by Christ, that we should live by His strength, or that we should live by His life. He said that for him to live was Christ. Our greatest misconception is to think that God gives us Christ to help us to overcome our sins. It is true that we have to overcome sin. But the way is not by Christ granting us the strength to overcome our sin. The biblical way is to set ourselves aside and to allow Christ to overcome for us. Christ died for us on the cross. Now Christ is living within us and for us. If Christ were not living for us and if Christ only died for us on the cross, it would be impossible for us to overcome. Christ is not here to sustain us or to strengthen us to overcome our sins. He is here to set us aside and to live within us in our place. He is overcoming sin for us. This is why Paul said that for him to live was Christ. Only when Christ lives for us can we say that for us to live is Christ. If Christ is not living for us, we cannot say that for us to live is Christ. We are not living by Him, and we are not living by imitating Him or living by drawing from His strength. For us to live is Christ. It is not a matter of Christ strengthening us, but a matter of Christ becoming our life.</p><h2 class="head1">VICTORY BEING CHRIST LIVING FOR US WITHIN</h2><p>Three years ago I was working in America. One day after a meeting, a doctor invited me to go to his home. His wife said to me, "Please pray for me." I asked, "Why do you want me to pray for you?" She said, "I have several naughty boys, and they make me lose my temper all the time. I tried to be patient when the first child was born, and I tried to endure when the second child was born. However, when the third child came along, I felt powerless. When all four are together, I can no longer hold back, and I begin to lose my temper. The more they are together, the more I lose my temper. I cannot be patient. What should I do?" I smiled at her and said, "Do you really want to be patient?" She answered, "It would be wonderful if God would grant me patience. Then I could keep from losing my temper." I said, "You are not lacking in patience." She said, "What do you mean? If I am not lacking in patience, what do I lack?" I said, "You lack Christ. You do not lack patience. If you pray for patience, God will never give it to you, because Christ is our patience." Christ does not help us become patient; He does not give us the power to be patient. He is patience within us. There is a great difference between these two things. We do not lack patience; we lack Christ. Christ is our patience. He does not help us become patient. He does not give us the strength to make us patient. He is living within us and for us, and He is living out His patience within us. Christ within is our patience.</p><p>First Corinthians 1:30 says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption." This verse shows us that God has made Christ our sanctification. It does not say that Christ helps us to become sanctified or gives us the strength for sanctification. Christ does not give us the strength for us to be sanctified. Rather, He becomes our sanctification. Christ is our very sanctification. This is victory. Victory is for Christ to be our life.</p><p>Many people are familiar with Galatians 2:20. But few see the real significance of this verse. We often think, "Since it should be no longer I that live, I must strive and struggle to live no longer." Actually, it is not a matter of us striving or struggling to live; it is a matter of Christ living. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who is living. This means that Christ is living instead of us. Christ has redeemed us from sin on the cross, and He is now living within us and for us. This is an exchanged life: It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> </body></html>
