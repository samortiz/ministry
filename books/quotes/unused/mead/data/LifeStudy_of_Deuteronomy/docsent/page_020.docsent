   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF DEUTERONOMY MESSAGE FOUR A REVIEW OF THE PAST 2 Scripture Reading: Deut 4:1-40</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From Genesis to Revelation, the entire Bible does three things: it manifests God, exposes man, and unveils Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before considering further the matter of a review of the past, I would like to give an additional word on these three functions of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, the Bible shows us what kind of God we have.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Bible God is manifested as the loving, righteous, and faithful God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Further, in the Bible we see that God is a God who blesses.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's heart is loving, His hand is righteous, His mouth is faithful, and His eyes are mainly for blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is our God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second, the Bible exposes man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible is the only book which shows us man's real condition.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we come to the Bible, we see ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible exposes us and shows us that we are nothing, that we have nothing, and that we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, we are a zero.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, this is what God wants, for He does not want us to be anything in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the reason Paul tells us that he has been crucified with Christ Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In His economy, in His plan and divine arrangement, God wants us to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that He wants us to be nullified, to become a zero.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Third, the Bible unveils Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is hidden, mysterious, and abstract; no one can know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the Bible unveils Him to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have pointed out that the entire Bible is implied in the book of Deuteronomy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may also say that Deuteronomy is an extract of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible as a whole manifests God, exposes man, and unveils Christ, and the book of Deuteronomy, as an extract of the Bible, also manifests God, exposes man, and unveils Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let us now go on to consider some further matters related to a review of the past.</S>
