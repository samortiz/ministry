   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Concerning the Preaching of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Are we serious about the preaching of the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Swatow you have three hundred people meeting here.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If everyone would bring one person to the Lord per year, in ten years there will be one hundred fifty thousand people saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that in ten years the whole of Swatow will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our gospel work is wrong today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need the Lord's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is difficult for an old tree to bear new fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The older a tree becomes, the thicker its bark is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But a young tree can bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Among us, the new ones grow much faster than the old ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This exposes our unfaithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How many gospel tracts have we passed out today?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How many people have you invited to the gospel meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the matter of gospel preaching, we cannot be a person who only talks but who does not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You may say that you have preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But how many times have you passed out gospel tracts?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How many times have you posted gospel posters, and how many times have you preached in the open?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How many times have you given books away to people?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How many times have you written letters to others exhorting them to believe in the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not say that you are concerned about having false believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even if they believe in a false way, you can still bring them in. We have to have a love for the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only this love is the real love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once Moody was standing in the rain without an umbrella.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Others thought that he was crazy, but he told them, "I am doing this to show you something.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You say that I am foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually you are more foolish than I am.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One day when God's judgment comes, the fire from heaven will shower down.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you do not believe in the Lord, one day you will suffer punishment."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moody also told others that he preached to at least one person a day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One night, he was in his bed already and remembered that he had not preached to anyone that day.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Immediately, he got up and went out to the street.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There he met a policeman, and he preached to him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The next day the policeman asked around and found out that the one who was preaching to him was Moody.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Later he visited Moody and was saved through him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today we have to drive out fallen Christianity, and we have to chase away the dead pulpits.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The real work today is one that revolutionizes a person.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>D. Concerning Material Offerings</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How much have we done with respect to the matter of material offerings?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do we offer according to a budget?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What is our budget every week?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you walk on the street today, you can see many advertisements, but you do not find one gospel advertisement.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The reason for this is that men have not offered up themselves thoroughly enough.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When a person comes to the meeting hall, he comes only to attend a service, and there is no real consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>E. Concerning Supplications</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the matter of making supplications for others, how many times have you dealt seriously with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How many of your prayers have been answered?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How many times have you prayed for the servants of God?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How many times have you visited the sick?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How many poor brothers have received your help?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>F. Concerning the Services</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the matter of the services, have we taken them up in a serious way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Have you ever mopped the floor of the meeting hall?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Have you ever cleaned the windows, the doors, and the chairs of the meeting hall?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You cannot expect the angels to come and do these things for you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many jobs require the brothers and sisters to do them together.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do not be so spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to learn the proper lessons in the practical services before we can learn the lessons in the spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I wish that we did not have any hired laborers here, and that every work would be taken up by the brothers and sisters themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is more precious in the eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The brothers and sisters in Chefoo all gave themselves to serve this way.</S>
