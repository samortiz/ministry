My spirit seems to be resting, sleeping, yet Brother Nee wants me to say something. I guess I have to say something.</p><p>We have to know that God works according to His laws. In order for us who are engaged in His service to be useful, we have to know the laws governing God's work. If we want to become useful in His hand, we have to know the laws governing His work. I have met many brothers and sisters. I cannot say that they have not prayed. Nor can I say that they are lacking in love, godliness, or gifts. They have all these things, but very little of God's work is manifested in them. I feel that there has to be a reason for this. Eventually, I discovered that these ones do not understand the laws governing God's work.</p><p>If I want this room to be filled with sunlight, I should not only open a window that faces north, but windows that face east, south, and west as well. The more windows I open, the more light I will have. On the other hand, if I want light to come in but do not open any window, I can pray all I want for light, but I will not see any result. The same can be said with regard to God's work. We have to work according to God's laws before we can receive His blessing. If we do not work according to His laws, we can pray all we want and be as godly as we want, but nothing will happen. If we have a clear understanding of the laws governing God's work, we will become useful servants in His work. After many years of training, many brothers and sisters have become very clear concerning the laws governing the Lord's work through us. There are at least a few points we must take note of before we can serve Him properly. Of course, we need to know the laws governing His work not only individually but among the co-workers and the church as well.</p><p>Seven or eight years ago, I was meditating one day on this question. I was considering the kind of laws one should know concerning God's work. Strangely enough, during that time of meditation, I seemed to hear a voice saying, "Read Exodus 3 and 4 about Moses' calling and how God used him." Immediately I went to Exodus 3. I did not feel anything dramatic upon reading it. But after reading chapter four, I felt that every sentence burst forth with God's light. I dare not say that I received a great shining, but I dare say that I saw some great principles there.</p><h2 class="head1">THE THREE LESSONS MOSES LEARNED</h2><p>Moses can be considered the model servant of God in the Old Testament. In the New Testament, we can consider Paul the model servant. Both in the Old Testament as well as in the New, Moses was considered faithful in all God's house (Num. 12:7; Heb. 3:2). In terms of spiritual principle, Moses' service as a servant of God has nothing to do with the period in which he lived; it has nothing to do with whether he was in the Old Testament or the New Testament. The principle governing his work is the principle governing the work of all God's servants. We all know the background of Moses. I do not need to repeat it here. He came from an excellent background. He was raised as the son of the daughter of Pharaoh, and he had a heart to serve the Lord. He acquired all the knowledge of Egypt in order to equip himself for the deliverance of God's people. Although God ordained that Moses would be the one to deliver His people Israel out of Egypt into the good land, his desires, knowledge, and eloquence did not qualify him for such service. God had to stir up the environment in a sovereign way to force him to escape to the wilderness in Sinai.</p><p>After Moses was driven to the wilderness, he felt that God had put him aside. During the years he spent in the wilderness, he lost faith in himself (Exo. 3:11; cf. 2:11-13). He admitted that human life is at its end at the age of eighty (Psa. 90:10). It seemed that there was no more time or space before him and that his life would end in the wilderness. Just when he thought that his life was going to be wasted away, God came in and called him in Exodus 3 and 4. When God appeared to him in the burning bush and called him to His work, he considered himself unqualified for any work. He excused himself by saying that he was a man slow in speech. God prepared Aaron and Miriam to be his helpers. But in Exodus 4:1 Moses replied, saying, "They [the Israelites] will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee." This shows that Moses was not yet motivated or convinced. Then God revealed Himself through three miracles. These miracles were the sure proofs that God had called Moses. Moses was told to do three things. In the first act, his rod was turned into a serpent. In the second act, his hand became leprous. In the third act, water was turned into blood (Exo. 4:2-9, 17). The three things&mdash;the rod, the flesh, and the water&mdash;were all useful. But they were turned into three harmful things&mdash;a serpent, leprosy, and blood.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 62: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (2) &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
