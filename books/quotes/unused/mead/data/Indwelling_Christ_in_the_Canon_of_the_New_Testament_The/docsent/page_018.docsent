   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRACTICE AND FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is simply a matter of practice and a matter of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must practice to open ourselves to Him and deal with all our sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whatever bothers our conscience, we must confess to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is simply a matter of making a thorough confession.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is no need for us to stay in that kind of condemned situation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We only need to pray, Lord Jesus, forgive me in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am wrong and I need the cleansing of Your blood.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hallelujah for the redeeming and prevailing blood that cleanses us and sets us free!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Under the blood there is no condemnation; we are released from all kinds of condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then we will say, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You are my life, You are my Person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now I know that I am in You, and You are in me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I know now that You are abiding within me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then we are full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not be so confused, distracted, and complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am afraid that even after reading this, some would still think that to be full of the Holy Spirit is difficult, requiring much fasting and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But to be filled with the Holy Spirit is part of the Gospel, and the Gospel is absolutely free.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not difficult, and we don t need to do so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What we do need to do is to open ourselves to the Lord and confess whatever is condemned in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then we apply the cleansing of the precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our conscience then will be free, and there will be no offense.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We will have a conscience void of offense.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We will have boldness to call on the Lord and be filled by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more we call on Him, the more we will be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We will be a person full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At this time it will be so easy to preach the Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We will not speak to others by exercising our mind to think what we must say.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We will preach to others by exercising our spirit to flow out the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE OUTFLOW OF THE INFILLING</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By reading the book of Acts carefully, we see that the early disciples did not have much knowledge or preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But they were people full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Day by day, they were filled with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When they reached out to others, it was by the outflowing of the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is exactly what is mentioned in Matthew and John.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Matthew we are told that the disciples of Jesus are baptized into the Triune God, and John tells us that Jesus will be living within them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now in Acts we see such a group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the early disciples were those that were put into Christ, and Jesus was living within them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They did not have all the things that people think we need today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we are reaching others, what we need, strictly speaking, is not power, but the outflowing of the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The real gospel is the outflow of Jesus from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not a matter of learning much, but of continually being full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Acts 6:3, 5, we see that the deacons chosen by the Apostles were men full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then in Acts 7:55, we see that Stephen, while he was being stoned to death, was full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Acts chapter nine, we read that Saul of Tarsus was persecuting the early disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then Jesus met him on the road to Damascus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>And he said, Who art thou, Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>9:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Saul was surprised when the Lord said that he was persecuting Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But the Lord made it clear that to persecute the disciples was to persecute Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>While Stephen was being persecuted, he was full of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All the persecuted disciples were one with Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They had been put into Jesus, and Jesus was living within them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, when they were persecuted, Jesus was being persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is why Jesus asked Paul, Why persecutest thou me?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All the disciples were in Jesus, and Jesus was in them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To persecute them was to persecute Jesus, because whatever they did, it was Jesus doing it in them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When they were persecuted, Jesus considered that He was persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Actually it was not Peter, John or Stephen that was persecuted, but it was Jesus who was indwelling all the disciples.</S>
