<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Dying on the Cross to Bear<br>God's Judgment on Sin</H2><P>When He was crucified on the cross, He was rejected by God. Because of this He cried out on the cross, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Matt. 27:46). He was the sinless Son of God, yet He was forsaken by God. He was judged by God not for His own sins but for the sins of all mankind (1 John 2:2). Through this judgment God's righteous requirement concerning sin was satisfied, and man was redeemed.</P><P>In explaining Christ's death on the cross, Isaiah, the Old Testament prophet, said, "Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all to fall on Him" (Isa. 53:6) and "Jehovah was pleased to crush Him, to afflict Him with grief" (v. 10). It was Jehovah God who executed judgment on Christ. Christ was not judged under man's hand. Because it was God's own judgment on Him, God was satisfied.</P><P>We need to be clear that redemption is something that God has done in Jesus Christ to satisfy His own righteous requirement on mankind; it has nothing to do with what we are or what good works we have done. It is foolish for some people to try to crucify themselves again or to imitate Christ's suffering. Nothing can add to what God has already accomplished in Christ. Redemption is an act before God and it satisfies God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Christ's Blood Speaking for Man<br>and Giving Man Peace</H2><P>When the Passover lamb was slain, its blood was put on the doorposts of the children of Israel's houses. When God saw the blood, He would not execute His judgment on those who were under the blood (Exo. 12:7, 13). Jesus, the Son of God, has shed His blood for mankind. His blood has satisfied all God's righteous requirements. Because He has died, man need not die for his sins. Through Christ's blood God is silenced and heaven is at peace. Now man can come boldly before God (Heb. 10:19). The Bible says that the blood of Christ speaks for us (Heb. 12:24) like an attorney in a law court speaking for the defendant. Through this blood God is at peace (Rom. 5:9) because His righteous requirement is satisfied. When God is at peace, our conscience also is at peace.</P><P>If you see how the redemption of Christ has fully satisfied God, you will be at peace with God. By the redemption of Christ, God has forgiven man's sins (Eph. 1:7). When God forgives man's sins, He forgets man's sins (Heb. 8:12). His forgiving is His forgetting. God can do everything, but He cannot remember the sins of those who have believed in the redemption of Christ. Those who believe in Christ's redemption are cleansed, justified, purified, absolved, unspotted, and untainted before God.</P>
