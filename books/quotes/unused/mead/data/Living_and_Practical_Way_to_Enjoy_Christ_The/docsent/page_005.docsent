   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS THE CONTENT Scripture Reading: John 1:1-2; 14:16-20; 1 Cor 15:45b</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous chapter we saw that we are the vessels of God, the containers of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we have to know what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As the content to us, the containers, He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is only as the Spirit that there is the possibility for Him to come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>CHRIST REVEALED IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Gospel of John shows that the Lord Jesus is the very God who is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It starts in this way: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then John 4:24 says, "God is Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the beginning was the Word, the Word was God, and God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Who is God?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to say that Jesus is God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 4:24 is a continuation of verse 14 of the same chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 14 Jesus told the Samaritan woman that He is the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The living water is Jesus, who is God Himself as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jesus, the living water, God, and the Spirit are four titles referring to one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Jesus is the living water, the living water is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of God is God Himself, and God becomes Jesus in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Son Being the Father</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some heretically say that Christ is merely a man and not God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is a group of people in a so-called church in the Philippines who do not believe that Jesus is God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some would even say that Jesus is just the Son of God, that He is neither the Father nor the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They teach this way because they want to systematize the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But we cannot systematize the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Isaiah 9:6 tells us that a child is born whose name is called the mighty God, and a son is given whose name is called the eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This shows that Jesus is both the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we could understand this thoroughly and explain it to the uttermost, He would no longer be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Isaiah 9:6 says that His name shall be called "Wonderful."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because He is Wonderful, we cannot fully explain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you asked me, "Brother Lee, is Jesus the Son or the Father?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I would say He is Wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His first title is Wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Is He the child or the mighty God?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I would say, "Wonderful."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A little child is the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Is this not wonderful?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those in Judaism do not believe that the little child born in the manger at Bethlehem is the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But Isaiah 9:6 tells us this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We cannot explain this because He is Wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you can explain it to me, then He is no longer Wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hallelujah, He is Wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In John 14 Jesus spoke with His disciples in a wonderful way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He said, "If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord responded, "Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He who has seen Me has seen the Father" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord Jesus is Wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is not only the Son but also the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is not only the Son and the Father, but also the Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ is all.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is the child; He is the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is a human being; He is also the Divine Being.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>People try to systematize the Divine Trinity, but it is impossible to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our Lord Jesus is all in all!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is Wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is God, man, the Son, the Father, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord Jesus told the disciples that they had already seen the Father because He had been with them and they had seen Him for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This meant that they had seen the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord went on to say, "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works" v. 10 . While the Lord was speaking, the Father was working.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Philip's asking the Lord to show him the Father was like someone saying to me, "Brother Lee, please show us Witness Lee."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I would say, "Don't you believe that Brother Lee is in Witness Lee and Witness Lee is in Brother Lee?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you have seen Brother Lee, surely you have seen Witness Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Now Brother Lee speaks, but Witness Lee does the work."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Jesus is really Wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He is both the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do not think that outside of Him, there is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Father is in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As you have seen Him, you have seen the Father.</S>
