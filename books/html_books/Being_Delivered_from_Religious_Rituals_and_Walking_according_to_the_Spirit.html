<h1 class="title">THE BIRTH, LIVING, AND WORK OF CHRIST<br />
BEING A STORY OF THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SUBSTANCE OF THE BIBLE BEING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Bible is a mysterious book. On the surface the Bible is plain and easy to understand. Hence, some people regard the Bible as a book of stories. Others, being more thoughtful, consider the Bible to be a book of doctrines. However, if we have the Spirit of God with us, we know deep within that the significance of the Bible is not related to stories or doctrines but to the Spirit.</p>
<p>When people look at me, they first notice the clothes that I am wearing, and if they look more intently, they notice the next layer, my skin and flesh. If there were a way to look deeper, people would see my bones and internal organs. This is the deepest layer that is visible to man. Nevertheless, I am not composed of only these layers. Within me there is something invisible, something that neither medical professionals nor scientists can uncover. This something is my spirit. Within every human being, there is a spirit. If I did not have a spirit, I would be a walking corpse, an absolutely worthless person. I thank the Lord that I have a spirit. The spirit of man is what makes man valuable.</p>
<p>Man has a spirit, and the substance of the Bible is Spirit. The Bible is not of the letter but of the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:6). In John 6:63 the Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; Regrettably, when many people read the Bible, they touch only the words on the surface of the Bible but not the Spirit. Many people know that Jesus was born of the virgin Mary and that He was born in Bethlehem, because they heard this story when they were children. However, there is another story within these Bible stories. This story is spirit and is life. There is not much value in knowing only the stories on the surface. We must see that within the stories there is another story&mdash;spirit and life. Only then is the Bible of value.</p>
<p>The story of Jesus is an extremely mysterious story. For two thousand years historians, theologians, and men of letters have acknowledged the story of Jesus. However, we must know the story within the story of Jesus. The story within the story of Jesus is of the Spirit. The Gospel of Matthew shows not only how Jesus lived, worked, and acted on the earth; it also shows the Spirit within His living, work, and actions.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST&rsquo;S BIRTH BEING OF THE SPIRIT<br />
AND OUTSIDE RELIGION</h2>
<p>Matthew 1:18 and 20 say, &ldquo;Now the origin of Jesus Christ was in this way: His mother, Mary, after she had been engaged to Joseph, before they came together, was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit...For that which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; According to the Gospel of Matthew, the origin of Jesus is a story of the Spirit and is entirely outside religion. Jesus was born in the land of Judea. At the time of His birth, Judaism was a strong religion. Judaism is not a Gentile religion or a heathen practice but an orthodox religion. This religion was established in the Old Testament with a holy temple, altar, priestly system, rituals for offering sacrifices, and ways of worshipping God. These are the items that constitute Judaism as an orthodox religion.</p>
<p>However, the birth of Jesus took place outside religion. God sent an angel, Gabriel, to a young virgin (Luke 1:26-27). Who could imagine such a thing? If we were God, we would send a messenger to the home of a priest in Jerusalem. According to our concept, if Jesus is to be born, He should be born in Jerusalem, in the holy temple, and in the home of a priest. Furthermore, He should be born as a priest. But God is different from us. We have religious concepts and natural concepts, but God does not have any of these. God sent Gabriel to Galilee, an insignificant lower-class province. Gabriel went to a little city called Nazareth in Galilee. He did not go to a wealthy family but to a poor and humble family and even to a weak and fragile virgin. This shows that the birth of Jesus took place outside religion; it was against religious tradition and contrary to cultural regulations. His birth was a story of the Spirit.</p>
<p>It is a pity that Christianity has put Christ into religion and made Him a religious figure. The Jesus we believe in is not a religious figure, nor is He in religion. Where is He? He is in the Spirit.</p>
<p>Christ was born outside religion, outside Jerusalem, outside the holy temple, and outside the priestly system. He was born in the lowly region of Galilee to a poor and humble family in Nazareth through a weak and fragile girl. This is seemingly negative. However, Mary was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit. This was not of religion, tradition, culture, or regulation. It was entirely a story of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:20).</p>
<p>At the time of Christ&rsquo;s birth there were Gentile religions. Now even Christianity has turned into a religion. Christianity has regulations, methods, and doctrines, but it lacks the Spirit. We must see that the age has turned. The Lord desires to turn His church away from religion, doctrines, and regulations and from the law and rituals. He wants the church to turn away from everything outward to the Spirit. The Lord Jesus was not in religion, nor was He a religious figure. The conception and birth of the Lord Jesus was altogether of the Spirit. We did not receive the founder of a religion or a savior in religion. We received the living Christ, who is altogether in the Spirit. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit, and His birth was outside religion.</p>
<p>Christ was apparently the same as any other human being, and He had a lowly status. According to the prophecy in the Bible, He was to be born in Bethlehem, but He was conceived in Nazareth. This is wonderful. When the time came for Him to be born, God exercised His mighty hand to arrange the environment to take Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, her days were fulfilled, and the Lord Jesus was born. This fulfilled the prophecies in the Bible. After a short period of time, they left Bethlehem and went down to Egypt, and from Egypt they returned to Nazareth. Nazareth was in a despised region. The Lord grew up in a poor family, and He grew up gradually, just like any other human being. However, within Him there was something different. This something was the Spirit. God does not desire religion, rituals, or doctrines. Neither does He desire spectacular material things, such as buildings. Rather, He desires the inner story of the Spirit. The Lord wants to turn the age. He does not want us to pay attention to religion, rituals, ordinances, methods, regulations, or doctrines. The Lord wants us to pay attention to Him as the living Spirit.</p>
<p>Are our meetings in religion? Do we have ordinances, methods, or regulations in our meetings? God does not want any of these things. God wants us to meet in spirit. Should we be quiet or noisy when we worship God? Some may say that we should be noisy; if this is the case, we have a noisy religion. Others may say that we should be quiet; if this is the case, we have a quiet religion. Saying that we should be quiet is wrong, and saying that we should be noisy is also wrong. Being noisy is of no value, and likewise, being quiet is of no value. We do not want to be quiet, nor do we want to be noisy. We want the Spirit. We do not care for silence or for noise. We care only for the Spirit. If the Spirit is with us, we can be in Nazareth or in Bethlehem. What matters is that we are in the Spirit and that the Spirit is with us.</p>
<p>We need to be delivered from our natural concepts and our religious thoughts. We do not care about outward things. We only care about the Spirit in us. As long as the Spirit of the Lord Jesus is present, it is right even to be in a manger. Today Christ is not concerned with outward things, which are material, visible, religious, systematic, doctrinal, and ritualistic; He is concerned with the Spirit in us.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST HAVING THE SPIRIT WITHIN AND WITHOUT</h2>
<p>Matthew 3:16 says, &ldquo;Having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon Him.&rdquo; When the Lord was about thirty years of age, He began to minister. Although He was filled with the Spirit inwardly, He still needed to have the Spirit upon Him. The Lord went to John to be baptized. After His baptism, when He came out of the water, the heavens opened, and the Spirit descended upon Him. By being conceived of the Holy Spirit, the Lord was filled with the Holy Spirit. In His baptism the Spirit was poured upon Him. Hence, He was filled within with the Spirit and clothed without with the Spirit. The Lord was saturated with the Spirit within and engulfed by the Spirit without. This was the preparation for the Lord Jesus to begin His ministry.</p>
<p>However, this is not emphasized in Christianity. If someone in Christianity desires to be a preacher, he does not need to be filled with the Spirit, nor does he need the outpouring of the Spirit. Rather, he must study theology and preferably obtain a Doctorate of Divinity. May the Lord grant us mercy to see that serving the Lord is not a matter of education, talent, or knowledge; it is a matter of the Spirit. All that matters is the Spirit. We need the Spirit within and the Spirit without, the Spirit&rsquo;s infilling and the Spirit&rsquo;s outpouring. We need the Spirit within and without.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST LIVING THE HUMAN LIFE<br />
ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Matthew 4:1 says, &ldquo;Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil.&rdquo; In the previous section, we saw that the Lord Jesus had the Spirit within and without; however, He was still a man. As such, His actions were those of a man. However, His actions were also led by the Holy Spirit. He went wherever the Spirit led Him. He was a person who lived in the Spirit; that is, He was a person who walked according to the Spirit.</p>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s purpose in tempting the Lord was to cause the Lord to leave His standing as a man. Satan tempted Him and said, &ldquo;If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves of bread&rdquo; (v. 3). Satan wanted the Lord to take His position as the Son of God rather than as a man. However, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone&rdquo; (v. 4). The Lord remained in His position as a man. Although the Lord was a man, He was led by the Holy Spirit. The Lord was a man, but He lived in the Spirit.</p>
<p>Suppose a sister says that since she is filled with the Holy Spirit, she no longer wants to be a wife, or suppose a brother says that he has been a husband for many years, bearing the burden of his family, just like a cow dragging a cart, but now that he is filled with the Spirit, he no longer wants to be a husband. Such statements are not of the Spirit. A husband should still be a husband, but with the Spirit he can be a better and more proper husband. Formerly, he was a husband according to his ideas. After being filled with the Spirit, he is a husband according to the Spirit. A wife cannot resign from being a wife after being filled with the Spirit. Formerly, she was a wife in herself, but after being filled with the Spirit, she can be a wife in the Spirit. Formerly, she was a wife without the Spirit, but now she is a wife filled with the Spirit, clothed with the Spirit, and according to the Spirit. In this situation Satan has no way to deal with her.</p>
<p>It is a failure to be a wife without the Spirit, and it is also a failure to have the Spirit and not want to be a wife. Satan&rsquo;s way is to push us to either extreme, that is, either to be a wife without the Spirit or to be full of the Spirit but not a wife. A sister may say that instead of cooking and taking care of her home, she will go out to preach the gospel because it is right to listen to God rather than man. Another sister may say that she will take care of her home and be a good wife whether or not she is filled with the Spirit. Both situations are not according to the Spirit.</p>
<p>Similarly, the young saints are children to their parents. They cannot resign and say that they will no longer be children. This is what God has arranged for them. When we were born, we were assigned the role of being children. We cannot stop being children, but we should not be children without the Spirit. The young saints should be filled with the Spirit within and without. They should be first-class children, excellent children, children in the Spirit.</p>
<p>We should never think that the Holy Spirit always leads us to a good place. The Holy Spirit led the Lord Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan. After being filled with the Spirit, a young brother may say, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Since the Lord cares for me and I am filled with the Spirit, my father will receive me.&rdquo; If his father opposes him and his mother is unhappy with him, he might say, &ldquo;I quit! My father is unreasonable, and my mother is unsuitable to be a mother. I will forget about them and follow the Spirit. I will go to the church and follow Jesus.&rdquo; If he wants to follow Jesus, he should go home. His home is his &ldquo;wilderness.&rdquo; He should never say that his father is unreasonable. His father is a good father, and his mother is a good mother. He must learn to be a son in the Spirit.</p>
<p>Christianity has lost its power because it has lost the Spirit. The churches in the recovery also lack power because the churches also need more of the Spirit. May the Lord enlighten us to see our need to live in the Holy Spirit. This does not mean that we should only care for our families or do housework, but those who live in the Spirit are more diligent in their housework, and they are more thorough in the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST WORKING BY THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Matthew 12:28 says, &ldquo;If I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.&rdquo; According to this verse, the Lord Jesus worked entirely by the Spirit. He did not use His own method or His own effort; He worked by the Spirit. The co-workers should not care for methods; rather, they should care for the Spirit. The age has changed, so there are no more methods, and even if there were methods, the methods are not effective and should not be employed. We should turn from methods to the Spirit.</p>
<p>May the Lord grant us mercy to live in the Spirit and not use or follow any methods. When the Lord Jesus worked on the earth, He worked in the Spirit, not according to any methods. Hence, we also must serve in the Spirit. Our eyes need to be opened to see that we do not want methods; rather, we should work in the Spirit and walk according to the Spirit. The age has changed. We should no longer live in the age of following dead ordinances. This does not mean that everyone may do as they wish. Our Lord Jesus never kept the Judaic regulations; however, He never did anything in a wild way. The Lord lived and worked in the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BAPTIZING PEOPLE IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Matthew 3:11 says, &ldquo;He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord was born of the Spirit, was baptized in the Spirit, was led by the Spirit, walked according to the Spirit, and worked by the Spirit. As a result, He baptized people in the Spirit. If we had lived in those days and had gone to follow the Lord, He would have baptized us in the Spirit. The Lord would not have taught us to believe that there is a God, to know that the universe and the things in it were created by God, to know that our forefather is the old Adam, or to know that we are fallen. The Lord never taught people in this way. As long as a person would repent, the Lord baptized him in the Spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This is the primary matter. The Lord did not teach people or correct them; rather, He baptized people in the Holy Spirit. This is entirely a matter of the Spirit. Christianity also baptizes people, but baptism in Christianity has become a ritual. The Lord Jesus did not follow rituals. As soon as people believed into Him, drew near to Him, and followed Him, He baptized them in the Spirit and caused them to be persons in the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DISCIPLES BEING PERSONS WHO ARE BAPTIZED<br />
INTO THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Matthew 28:19 says that we should go forth and baptize people into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Does this baptism refer to water baptism or to the baptism of the Spirit? Into what do we baptize people? Apparently we baptize people into water, but we actually baptize people into the Spirit. When we baptize people, we believe that although we are baptizing them with water, we are actually baptizing them into the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The first time that the Bible uses this term <em>the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit</em> is in Matthew 28. This term is very meaningful. The Father is the source; He has a heart&rsquo;s desire, a will, and a plan. The Son is the expression; He came to accomplish the Father&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire, to fulfill the Father&rsquo;s will, and to carry out the Father&rsquo;s plan. The Son died on the cross and shed His blood to redeem us, and He resurrected from the dead to accomplish redemption, thus fulfilling the Father&rsquo;s will. Then the Spirit came to apply what the Son accomplished. The Son accomplished the Father&rsquo;s plan, and the Spirit applies the Son&rsquo;s accomplishment. The Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit enters into us. Not only so, through baptism we enter into the Triune God. Then all that the Father has planned is ours, all that the Son has accomplished is our portion, and all that the Spirit is applying becomes our enjoyment. This is the significance of baptizing people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>I am afraid that baptism has become a ritual or ordinance. We preach the gospel, visit the gospel friends, and prepare them for baptism. When we think that they are ready, we arrange a date for their baptism. This arrangement leaves the gospel friends with the feeling that baptism is a ritual or ordinance for them to join a religion. We may tell them that to be baptized is to die with the Lord, to be buried with the Lord, and to resurrect together with the Lord, but subconsciously, they still regard baptism as a ritual to join a religion. Likewise, the brothers who baptize do it as a ritual. Since they are assigned to baptize, it does not matter whether or not the new ones are baptized in the Spirit. The brothers care only to put the new ones into the water. Their sole responsibility is to immerse people into water. This is our condition.</p>
<p>When we baptize people, we should be filled with the Spirit, and we should believe that when we immerse them in water, we are baptizing them into the Holy Spirit. We should have this faith, and we should help the new ones to have this faith. Through this one faith and one baptism, we enter into the Holy Spirit. Those who are baptized in this way are in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Being a Christian is not a matter of believing certain doctrines or being baptized into a religion. It is a matter of entering into the Spirit. Formerly I was a person outside the Spirit, but now I am in the Spirit. Hence, a person should not wait in order to be baptized. A person who hears the gospel, repents, and believes should be baptized immediately. If he must wait three weeks to be baptized, the baptism will not be as effective. We should baptize a person as soon as he repents so that he can enter into the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE MATTERS CONCERNING A PERSON IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Matthew 5:3 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; Verses 19 and 20 of chapter 10 say, &ldquo;When they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you should speak, for it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak; for you are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is the One speaking in you.&rdquo; In verses 42 through 45 of chapter 22 Jesus said, &ldquo;What do you think concerning the Christ? Whose son is He? They said to Him, David&rsquo;s. He said to them, How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, &lsquo;The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies underneath Your feet&rsquo;? If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?&rdquo; A person who is baptized into the Spirit becomes a person in the Spirit. These three portions of the Scriptures show three characteristics of a person in the Spirit. First, he is poor in spirit (5:3). This is not about being humble; it does not refer to humility. Rather, it is being emptied in spirit. Such a person can say, &ldquo;I have lived for so many years, yet I still need to know God.&rdquo; He may be very successful in the world, be very educated, and have many things, but he knows that he is short of God. Because he is poor in spirit, he wants God. Such a person is blessed. He does not tell the Lord that he knows or that he understands. He is poor in his spirit and tells the Lord that he does not understand the heavenly things, the spiritual things. If he is poor in spirit in this way, he will be blessed, and the kingdom of the heavens will be his. A person who is poor in spirit is in another realm; he is in the kingdom. He is no longer in the earthly realm but in the heavenly realm.</p>
<p>Second, when a person who has been baptized into the Spirit encounters a difficult situation, he is not anxious as to what to do or say, because it is not his responsibility to speak; the Spirit of the Father speaks in him (10:19-20). A person who is anxious is exercising his mind. Instead of exercising our mind, we should follow the indwelling Spirit. To be anxious is to depend on ourselves, but to follow the Spirit is to depend on the Lord. This is the principle of being a Christian.</p>
<p>Third, a person who is in the Spirit is able to know Christ in his spirit. According to the flesh, Christ is the offspring of David, but in spirit David called Christ Lord (22:42-45). David did not know Christ according to the flesh; he knew Christ in the spirit. This is the type of person we should be. We should know Christ in our spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">FINDING AND SERVING CHRIST OUTSIDE RELIGION</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that the birth of the Lord was outside religion. His birth had nothing to do with religious matters, people, places, or ordinances. His birth was entirely of the Spirit. Therefore, He can save His people from their sins (Matt. 1:21). Moreover, since His birth was entirely of the Spirit, He is Emmanuel, meaning &ldquo;God with us&rdquo; (v. 23).</p>
<p>When we fall into religion, we lose the saving power of Jesus, and we also lose Emmanuel&mdash;we lose God&rsquo;s presence. Both Jesus&rsquo; saving power and God&rsquo;s presence are in the Holy Spirit, not in religion. We should never think that we can touch Jesus&rsquo; saving power or have God&rsquo;s presence in religion. We need to be outside religion and in the Holy Spirit in order to receive the saving power of Jesus and enjoy the presence of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE STAR OF CHRIST APPEARING TO THE GENTILE MAGI</h2>
<p>Matthew 2:1-12 shows the kind of people who are able to find and serve the Lord. The Lord was born outside religion, and He is found and served by people outside religion.</p>
<p>It is marvelous that although the Lord Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, His star appeared to the Gentile magi. The magi, who were in a heathen land, saw the star, but no one in Jerusalem or Judea saw it. None of the people who were in the realm of religion saw the star. The scribes and the chief priests were people with the equivalent of doctorate degrees in the Holy Scriptures. They knew the Scriptures well, and they understood the Scriptures. They taught people the Scriptures daily. However, the star of Christ did not appear to them. The Gentile magi did not understand anything of the Bible, and it is likely that they did not even have a copy of the Scriptures, but they saw the star of Christ. This is marvelous. Our Lord was born in Bethlehem, but His star appeared to Gentiles who lived far away in a heathen land.</p>
<p>Numbers 24:17 says, &ldquo;There shall come forth a Star out of Jacob.&rdquo; <em>Jacob</em> is another name for Israel, and it is also another name for the people of Israel. The Lord is the Star out of Jacob, but He did not show this star to the people of Israel, because at that time the people of Israel were in religion. The Lord as the star appeared to the Gentiles. The Gentile magi had heathen knowledge only. They did not have any religious knowledge, but the star appeared to them and was seen by them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NATURAL CONCEPTS CAUSING US<br />
TO LOSE THE LEADING OF THE STAR</h2>
<p>It is wonderful that the Gentile magi saw the star of Christ. However, they committed a common human mistake: they had natural concepts. When they realized that the star signified the King of the Jews, they followed their natural concept. They did not have religious knowledge or ordinances, but they had a natural concept. Natural concepts hinder us from knowing the Lord much more than our religious knowledge hinders us.</p>
<p>The magi did not have religious knowledge, but they had natural concepts. They exercised their mind and reasoned that the King of the Jews would be born in Jerusalem, the capital of the kingdom of the Jews. Based on this concept, they went to Jerusalem (Matt. 2:1-2), and the star disappeared. The star appeared to them because they did not have religious knowledge; the star disappeared because they had a natural concept. Religious knowledge and natural concepts are two dreadful things that cause us to lose the Lord&rsquo;s revelation.</p>
<p>When the magi arrived in Jerusalem, King Herod was very troubled and all Jerusalem with him (v. 3). King Herod gathered all the chief priests and scribes and inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. The chief priests and scribes were familiar with the Bible. They were bona fide religionists and Bible teachers. They replied, &ldquo;In Bethlehem of Judea&rdquo; (vv. 5-6; cf. Micah 5:2). The chief priests and scribes answered correctly because they knew the Bible. However, what they had was mere knowledge. They did not have revelation.</p>
<p>Not only so, the chief priests and scribes did not have a heart to seek after Christ. They heard that Christ, the King of the Jews, was born, and they knew that He was born in Bethlehem, but none of them went to find Christ. After they answered Herod, they went their own ways. This shows that Bible knowledge alone does not help us. This is the situation of many Christians today. They have Bible knowledge, but they do not have revelation, nor do they have a seeking heart.</p>
<p>After Herod found out the birthplace of Christ, He sent the magi to Bethlehem and said, &ldquo;Go and find out accurately about the child. And when you find Him, report to me, so that I also may come and worship Him&rdquo; (Matt. 2:8). Although Herod said this, he did not intend to worship Christ; rather, his intention was to harm Christ. Herod lied to deceive men, but he could not deceive God. God came in, and Herod discovered that he was mocked by the magi (vv. 12, 16).</p><h2 class="head1">NEEDING THE LEADING OF THE LIVING STAR<br />
IN ADDITION TO THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>As soon as the magi left Jerusalem for Bethlehem, the star appeared again (v. 9). Once we leave the realm of religion, we receive revelation. Micah 5:2 says that Christ would be born in Bethlehem, but this knowledge is not enough. The Bible says only that Christ would be born in Bethlehem, but there was more than one street in Bethlehem, and there was more than one home on each street. On which street and in which home was Christ to be born? If the magi had only the prophecy from the Bible, it would have been difficult for them to find Christ in Bethlehem.</p>
<p>Hence, it is not enough for us just to study the Bible; however, we cannot be without the Bible, because the Bible is the Word of God. When we are confused and lose sight of the star, we need the Bible to guide us. I believe that if the magi had simply followed the leading of the star, instead of depending on their natural concept, they would have been brought to the baby Jesus. If they had not cared whether they were being led toward the east or the west, or whether they were going to Jerusalem, Bethlehem, or Nazareth, but had simply followed the star, they would have been brought step by step to Bethlehem and to the baby Jesus. It is a pity that they thought the King of the Jews should be born in Jerusalem and went there. When they went to Jerusalem, the star disappeared because they were in the wrong place. They needed the Bible to guide them. When we lose the guiding of the star, we need the Bible.</p>
<p>Knowing the Bible did not help the scribes and chief priests. It helped only those who were seeking the Lord. After receiving the words of the Bible, the magi left the religious center of Jerusalem and went to Bethlehem. As soon as they left Jerusalem, the star appeared to them and led them to Bethlehem and to the house where the Lord Jesus was. They did not need to ask whether the child was Jesus or why the King of the Jews would be born in a manger, because the star led them. As a result, they did not have any doubts. As soon as they saw the child, they fell down and worshipped Him, and opening their treasures, they offered gifts to Him (Matt. 2:11).</p>
<p>Some Christians teach that the Bible is complete and that we need only the Bible and nothing else. The Bible is indeed complete. However, to say that we need only the Bible and nothing else is not accurate. Our Bible must be living. If our Bible is not living, we cannot say that we need only the Bible and nothing else. Besides the Bible, we must have the living star. We need to see the living star in addition to knowing the Bible.</p>
<p>We thank the Lord that the Bible is on earth, and the star is in heaven. Even today the star is still in heaven. This heavenly star is for those who have a seeking heart. As long as a person has a seeking heart, the heavenly star will appear to him so that he may know Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING REVELATION IN A DREAM</h2>
<p>After following the star and seeing Christ, the magi were divinely instructed in a dream not to return to Herod so that they would not be deceived by him: &ldquo;Because they had been divinely instructed in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed by another way to their country&rdquo; (v. 12). <em>Dream</em> in this verse does not refer to the ordinary dreams that people have. Some people have strange and weird dreams that are worthless and meaningless. The dream that the magi had was a trance, a kind of comprehension that is beyond reasoning, a vision that transcends natural concepts. It is a dream, and yet it is not a dream.</p>
<p>I have had at least one such experience. It was as clear as a scene before my eyes. I cannot say that it was a dream, nor can I say that it was not a dream. During China&rsquo;s War of Resistance against Japan, I was imprisoned by the Japanese military police in Chefoo, Shantung Province. After I was released, I was not permitted to leave home at will. While I was in prison, I suffered to the extent that even after I was released I still felt the fear and threat of the prison. I was released on a Thursday, and on the Lord&rsquo;s Day afternoon I attended the bread-breaking meeting. Prior to that day I had never fallen asleep in the bread-breaking meeting. However, that afternoon, as the cup was being passed, seemingly I fell asleep, but I did not sleep. I saw a dog coming toward me, but it shook its head and tail in shame and then walked away. I knew then that the Japanese police would seek me out again; however, I had peace within me. The Holy Spirit told me to be at peace because the dog walked away in shame. This was not a dream, but it seemed like a dream. It was a trance. In this trance the Lord gave me a revelation.</p>
<p>The dream that the magi had was this kind of special vision. Later, Mary&rsquo;s husband, Joseph, had many dreams, which were also this kind of dream. In the dream the magi were divinely instructed not to return to Herod, so they went home by another way. After a person has seen Christ, he will always take another way. A person who has seen Christ will never go the same way that he came. A person who has met the Lord and been touched by Him will always take another way.</p><h2 class="head1">JOSEPH SERVING CHRIST OUTSIDE RELIGION</h2>
<p>After the magi departed, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph, saying, &ldquo;Arise, take the child and His mother and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is going to seek the child to destroy Him&rdquo; (v. 13). Joseph was led in a special way. It was not that Joseph was having morning watch and read Hosea 11:1, which says, &ldquo;Out of Egypt I called My son,&rdquo; and then Joseph understood that the Bible was instructing him to take his family down to Egypt. This was not the case. The Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and gave him the revelation to flee to Egypt with the child and His mother. Joseph received the Lord&rsquo;s word, and he took the child and His mother and went down to Egypt. Thus, the fulfillment of the prophecy concerning Christ in Hosea 11:1 was carried out by God through Joseph&rsquo;s following the leading he received in his dream.</p>
<p>Joseph went down to Egypt and stayed there. This was his service to Christ. Joseph was the first person to serve Christ. He served Christ not according to Bible knowledge or teachings but according to his fellowship with the Lord. Joseph had a humble status and did not attract people&rsquo;s attention, but he fellowshipped with the Lord. In this fellowship the Lord revealed His heart&rsquo;s desire to Joseph. By following the revelation he received, Joseph served Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was born of Mary. However, Mary was a woman; she needed someone to coordinate with her. We must realize that if there were only Mary and no Joseph, the birth of the Lord Jesus would have been a problem. Perhaps Jesus would have been born in Nazareth, not in Bethlehem, which would not have been according to the Scriptures. The Lord Jesus was conceived in Nazareth, but He was born in Bethlehem. This was the result of Joseph&rsquo;s coordination. Joseph was from Bethlehem. Hence, when it was time to be registered, he had to return to Bethlehem (Luke 2:1-5). This is the way that the Lord Jesus was born in Bethlehem.</p>
<p>Later they had to flee to Egypt because Herod was seeking to kill the Lord Jesus. In ancient times it was very difficult for a young woman, like Mary, to travel with a child. In this matter it was even more necessary for Joseph to coordinate with Mary. It was only at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s conception that an angel went to Mary and told her that the Lord would be conceived in her (1:26-38). After that, the angel of the Lord did not tell Mary what to do, where to flee, or when to return. Instead, the angel of the Lord told Joseph what to do, where to flee, and when to return (Matt. 1:20; 2:13, 19-20). All Mary did was to obey Joseph. When Joseph said that they should go to Bethlehem, Mary followed him to Bethlehem. When Joseph said that they should flee to Egypt, Mary went with him. This kind of following was not in vain. When Mary followed Joseph, the prophecies in the Bible were fulfilled, and God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire was accomplished.</p>
<p>Mary was a good sister, and she had a portion in serving Christ. Without Mary, it would have been impossible for the Lord Jesus to be born. However, after the Lord Jesus was born, without Joseph, there would have been no way for Him to flee and be preserved. This is a picture of the coordination between the brothers and sisters. In the church we need the sisters to be like Mary and the brothers to be like Joseph in their coordinating together to serve Christ. The sisters have their portion, and the brothers have theirs, but neither the sisters nor the brothers should serve in a religious way or according to knowledge. Joseph and Mary received the Lord&rsquo;s living, instant, and timely instruction. When they were instructed, Joseph obeyed and Mary followed. This is truly a beautiful picture.</p>
<p>It is not so simple to follow the Lord. Often the Lord does not take the simple way. He does not tell us everything at once. Rather, He instructs us one step at a time. He told Joseph, &ldquo;Arise, take the child and His mother and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you,&rdquo; so Joseph fled to Egypt with the child and His mother and stayed there (vv. 13-15). Joseph did not know how long they should stay in Egypt. After a period of time, the Lord&rsquo;s instruction came again: &ldquo;Arise, take the child and His mother and go into the land of Israel&rdquo; (v. 20). So Joseph returned to the land of Israel with the child and His mother. But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. At this point in time the Lord&rsquo;s instruction came again, and he departed into the regions of Galilee (vv. 22-23). Although Joseph might not have understood the significance of the Lord&rsquo;s instructions, through these moves the words in the Bible were fulfilled.</p>
<p>The Bible does not say that the Lord would be born in Nazareth. It says that He would be born in Bethlehem. Since the Lord&rsquo;s conception occurred in Nazareth, how could His birth take place in Bethlehem? According to history, after the divided Grecian Empire, the Roman Empire rose up and conquered Europe, Asia, and Africa to become a great empire with a vast territory. In that vast empire no census had been taken. Then during the reign of Caesar Augustus, a decree went out for a census to be taken of all the inhabited earth, and everyone went to his own city to be registered. Joseph lived in Nazareth, but he was of the house and family of David. Hence, when the decree was made, he went up from Nazareth to Bethlehem, David&rsquo;s city. Since Mary was engaged to him, Joseph brought Mary with him to Bethlehem. This was God&rsquo;s sovereignty; it was His arrangement in the environment for the fulfillment of His heart&rsquo;s desire (Luke 2:1-5).</p>
<p>Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s birth in Bethlehem was a very mysterious thing. He was conceived in Nazareth, and He grew up in Nazareth, but He was born in Bethlehem. The prophecies in the Bible indicate that He would be born in Bethlehem but be called a Nazarene (Micah 5:2; Matt. 2:23). The fulfillment of these prophecies is related to Joseph&rsquo;s service. Joseph truly lived before God and therefore was able to receive step-by-step instructions from God. What Joseph did fulfilled the words in the Bible. It is not good enough to do everything according to the Bible merely because we know and understand the Bible. The best thing is to contact the Lord and live in the shining of His face. Then everything that we do will spontaneously correspond to the Bible.</p>
<p>Last year a very peculiar male in his early twenties came to the church in Los Angeles. He had long hair, a long beard, and wrapped himself in a large and colorful but dirty blanket. Since the church should receive all people, including &ldquo;tax collectors&rdquo; and &ldquo;prostitutes,&rdquo; this person was not excluded. We received him, but we could not tell him to give up his dirty blanket. Every time he came, he wore his blanket. That was a real test to us. Then one day, after about a month, the blanket disappeared, his hair was short, and his beard was shaved. He was a tidy and clean young man. When he walked into the meeting hall, all the saints saw that he was a different person, and they leaped for joy. The Bible does not say whether or not it is acceptable to wear a blanket, nor does the Bible say that a brother should keep his hair short and shave his beard. That young man experienced a dramatic change in his life because he lived in the shining of the Lord&rsquo;s face. He did not keep dead letters and regulations; rather, he followed the living Spirit within him.</p>
<p>According to this principle, Joseph followed Christ. He walked with Christ step by step. Wherever he went, Christ was with him. When Christ was still a child, Joseph walked with Him, stayed with Him, and served Him. Joseph did not live according to the teaching of the Bible but according to the living light he received. Joseph lived in the presence of God. Our need today is the living light.</p><h2 class="head1">MISSING CHRIST BY LIVING<br />
ACCORDING TO THE LETTER OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Let us now consider three examples in the Gospel of John that show how knowing just the Bible can cause us to miss Christ. The first example is in John 1. After Philip met the Lord, he went and told his friend Nathanael, saying, &ldquo;We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth&rdquo; (v. 45). Nathanael replied, &ldquo;Can anything good be from Nazareth?&rdquo; (v. 46). Nathanael seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Christ is from Nazareth? I know what the Bible says. Christ should come from Bethlehem.&rdquo; People who have mere mental knowledge of the Bible run the risk of missing Christ. We cannot say that their knowledge is right, nor can we say that their knowledge is wrong. Was the Lord Jesus the son of Joseph? The answer is both yes and no. Did the Lord Jesus come from Nazareth? The answer is both yes and no. The Lord Jesus is not simple.</p>
<p>A person cannot know Christ merely according to the Bible. The Bible says that Christ would be born in Bethlehem. This means that He comes from Bethlehem. This being the case, how could He be from Nazareth? This reasoning is logical and correct; however, this way of reasoning will cause a person to miss Christ. We often miss Christ because we know too many doctrines. Philip did not reason with Nathanael; he simply said, &ldquo;Come and see&rdquo; (v. 46). By going to see, Nathanael met the Lord and was caught by the Lord (vv. 47-49). Therefore, instead of arguing with people concerning doctrine, we should lead them to Christ.</p>
<p>The second example is in chapter 7. The Lord Jesus went up to Jerusalem for the Feast of Tabernacles and did many miracles. On the last day of the feast, He cried out, saying, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink&rdquo; (v. 37). Some of the people who heard this said, &ldquo;This is truly the Prophet,&rdquo; and others said, &ldquo;This is the Christ.&rdquo; However, some said, &ldquo;Does then the Christ come out of Galilee? Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes out of the seed of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?&rdquo; (vv. 40-42). In this portion of the Scriptures, people missed Christ because of their knowledge of the Bible. They knew the Bible, but their Bible knowledge caused them to miss Christ.</p>
<p>The third example is also in chapter 7. There arose a division among the crowd because of the Lord Jesus (v. 43). The Pharisees reprimanded their attendants because they did not seize the Lord Jesus. Nicodemus, who had gone to see the Lord Jesus previously, spoke on behalf of the Lord, but the Pharisees rebuked him in anger, saying, &ldquo;Are you also from Galilee? Search and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee&rdquo; (vv. 45-52). It is true that no prophet had ever arisen out of Galilee. However, out of Galilee arose the greatest Prophet.</p>
<p>Nathanael nearly missed Christ because of his knowledge of the Bible. The Jewish religionists missed Christ because of their knowledge of the Bible, and the Pharisees also missed Christ for the same reason. There may still be Nathanaels, religionists, and Pharisees today, but may we not be Pharisees or religionists! We need to be Nathanaels who go to see the Lord. We should not care for our Bible knowledge; rather, we should care only for contacting the living Lord, the living Spirit. May the Lord have mercy on us and deliver us from religion, doctrines, and Bible knowledge so that we may live in the light and in the Lord&rsquo;s presence. We must pray for ourselves, for others, and for the church not to miss Christ. We desire that every saint in the church would be a Joseph or at least a Nathanael.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST BEING INTRODUCED OUTSIDE RELIGION</h1>
<p>The Lord Jesus was born outside religion, people sought Him outside religion, and people served Him outside religion. People served the Lord, followed Him, and walked with Him outside religion. Before the Lord Jesus began His ministry, He was introduced by His forerunner, John the Baptist. This introduction was also outside religion. The Lord Jesus was introduced outside religion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">JOHN&rsquo;S LIVING BEING CONTRARY TO<br />
RELIGION AND CULTURE</h2>
<p>Matthew 3:1-6 says, &ldquo;Now in those days John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the wilderness of Judea and saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near. For this is he who was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, &lsquo;A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths.&rsquo; Now this John had his garment of camel&rsquo;s hair and a leather girdle around his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey. At that time Jerusalem and all Judea and all the surrounding region of the Jordan went out to him, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.&rdquo; In verse 11 John said, &ldquo;I baptize you in water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is stronger than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John the Baptist introduced Christ. According to the Bible, John was born a priest. The priests were central figures in the Jewish religion. They lived in the temple, wore the priestly garments, and ate the priestly food, the sacrifices. The work that the priests did was also special. In addition to offering sacrifices and setting the bread of the Presence in order, they lit the lamps, burned incense, and lived in God&rsquo;s presence. This was the life of an Old Testament priest. The one who introduced the Lord Jesus was a priest. Ordinarily, a priest should live in the temple, wear priestly robes, eat priestly food, and do the priestly work. However, John the Baptist introduced the Lord Jesus in a way that was contrary to religion. He put religion aside. Not only so, he went against the culture that was attached to religion. The priests lived in the temple, but John lived in the wilderness. The wilderness cannot compare with the temple. The temple was the center of the Jewish religion and a place of culture; whereas the wilderness was completely outside religion and culture. If we had a choice, would we choose the temple or the wilderness? I am afraid that even though many of us shout that we want the wilderness, in our heart we would rather have the temple.</p>
<p>What does the temple signify, and what does the wilderness signify? In Christianity, especially in Catholicism, people like to build chapels with tall steeples and painted glass. There is a logic to this kind of architecture. When we go to an open stadium or to a field, we feel released, but when we walk into a chapel, we are filled with a sense of respect and dare not be casual. This is the culture of the temple. The ritual of worship in the temple is very solemn and serious. First a pastor goes to the platform and leads the congregation to sing, then a music conductor directs the choir to sing a four-part harmony, and then a young lady sings a solo. After singing, a minister leads the congregation in the reading of the Scripture, which is followed by prayer. After all this a doctor of divinity gives a message. Finally, the congregation is dismissed following a benediction: &ldquo;May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.&rdquo; This is religion. This is today&rsquo;s temple.</p>
<p>To be in the wilderness is to be without regulations, ceremonies, and established rules, that is, to do everything according to the Spirit&rsquo;s leading. The religionists would say that such worship cannot be considered as worshipping God, because there is no religious atmosphere. This is the significance of being in the wilderness. By the eighteenth century the Anglican Church had become the state church of England, and every person who was born in England was born into the Anglican Church. The Anglican Church taught that the word of God is holy and therefore should not be preached outside of a sacred place such as a chapel that had been consecrated and sanctified. The holy word of God could be preached only in a chapel and not anywhere else. Anyone who preached the word of God outside a chapel was committing a serious offense. But God raised up John Wesley as His servant in England. Just like John the Baptist, John Wesley preached in the &ldquo;wilderness.&rdquo; He did not preach in a chapel; instead, he preached on the street. When he spoke, his listeners were touched, some even to tears, and thousands repented.</p>
<p>These examples should help us understand the significance of the temple and of the wilderness. When we sit quietly in a meeting, we are in the temple. Suppose a brother stands up and says, &ldquo;I have a testimony. Hallelujah! I am not in the temple; I am in the wilderness. I am released! I have been set free from religion!&rdquo; Then another brother also stands up and says, &ldquo;Amen! Hallelujah!&rdquo; If this is the way we meet, we are not in the temple but in the wilderness. May the Lord lead us out of religion, ordinances, and oldness.</p>
<p>There are many experienced, godly, and well-behaved saints. They are somewhat older and frown upon this way of meeting. An older saint once said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you need to balance the young ones. They are too loud. We can hardly bear it any longer.&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;Perhaps the young ones are too loud. Maybe they should not be so loud, or maybe they should even be silent. However, allow me to say that you need the Lord to balance you. You need to be a little louder. You should take the lead to be louder and stronger than the young ones. I do not know whether or not the young people should be loud, but I do know that you need to be loud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a brother is for being loud, being loud will be his temple. The younger saints are for being loud. They insist on being loud and are not happy when they must be quiet. The louder they are, the happier they are; thus, being loud has become their temple. The older saints like to be quiet; hence, being quiet has become their temple. However, the Lord does not want us to be in religion. His leading is often the opposite of what we want. If we want to be loud, He may tell us not to. If we want to be silent, He may tell us that we must be loud. Whatever we desire to do may become our temple, but it is not what the Lord wants. What we dislike is often our wilderness, and that is what the Lord wants.</p>
<p>Now that we are clear concerning the significance of the temple and the wilderness, we should ask ourselves which is better. The young people should consider what is their wilderness. If their temple is to be loud, then their wilderness is to be quiet in a meeting. The older saints should also consider what is their wilderness. Their wilderness might include not only being loud but also jumping. When they are loud and jump, they are in the wilderness, and they are against religion. John the Baptist was born a priest. He should have lived in the temple, worn a priestly robe, eaten priestly food, and done the priestly work of offering sacrifices, setting the bread of the Presence in order, lighting the lamps, and burning the incense. However, in order to introduce Christ, he went against religion by living in the wilderness and wearing a garment of camel&rsquo;s hair. Leviticus 11 speaks of ordinances concerning contacting clean and unclean animals and concerning being defiled by them. Verse 4 says that camels are unclean and that the Israelites were not to touch them. However, John the Baptist wore garments made of camel&rsquo;s hair. This was against the religious regulations, but the Lord liked it. May the Lord grant us mercy to see that He is not for religion. John the Baptist ate locusts and wild honey, which was against the Jewish culture and tradition. John the Baptist was not an accident. Christ had come! He is always contrary to religion and does not remain in a religious atmosphere. Therefore, those who introduce Christ are contrary to religion. They live in the wilderness, wear camel&rsquo;s hair, and eat locusts and wild honey.</p><h2 class="head1">JOHN&rsquo;S INTRODUCING OF CHRIST<br />
BEING CONTRARY TO RELIGION</h2>
<p>John the Baptist introduced Christ in a very particular way. Instead of preaching doctrines, he proclaimed, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&rdquo; (Matt. 3:2). The Greek word for <em>repent</em> means to &ldquo;have a change of mind,&rdquo; that is, to have a change of concept. John seemed to be proclaiming, &ldquo;Another sphere, another realm, has come. Turn and have a change of concept. Turn from your way of worship. Turn from your religious ordinances. Formerly, we offered sacrifices in the temple, set the bread of the Presence in order, lit the lamps, and burned incense, but now we must abandon these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John the Baptist did not teach doctrines to those who repented; rather, he buried them in water. John terminated and buried anyone who had a change of mind. It did not matter whether a person was a chief priest, a tax collector, or a scribe; as soon as they repented, John buried them. They were buried out of their old society, old religion, old culture, old ordinances, and old methods. Once they were buried, they were terminated.</p>
<p>However, this was not the end. In verse 11 John the Baptist said, &ldquo;I baptize you in water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is stronger than I...He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire.&rdquo; John buried people and terminated them, but the Lord Jesus, whom John introduced, would enliven the buried and terminated people so that they would be His followers. The way that John introduced the Lord Jesus was very crude and uncultured.</p>
<p>If John were to introduce Christ according to the Jewish religion, he would have convened a meeting with the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes. In the meeting he would say, &ldquo;The purpose of this meeting is to introduce Christ. Thank God that Christ is born. I am John, a priest, and I am here to introduce Christ.&rdquo; He would then ask Christ to go up to the platform, and continue, &ldquo;This is Jesus Christ. He was born in Bethlehem and grew up in Nazareth. Now I would ask all of you to come forward to shake hands with Him and congratulate Him.&rdquo; This is the religious way, but John did not introduce Christ in this way. Instead, he was by the river Jordan in the wilderness. The people that went to him repented and were buried one by one. John told them that he buried them, but Jesus Christ would come and baptize them in the Holy Spirit and fire so that they would be made alive. The Lord Jesus was introduced in a way that had no religious color, background, or atmosphere.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIVING OF CHRIST<br />
BEING OUTSIDE RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS</h2>
<p>Matthew 11:18-19 says, &ldquo;John came neither eating nor drinking; and they say, He has a demon. The Son of Man came eating and drinking; and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners. Yet wisdom is justified by her works.&rdquo; John had no taste for eating or drinking. Since the Lord was introduced by John, people thought that the Lord should not have a taste for eating or drinking. John did not eat or drink, but the Lord Jesus ate and drank. He was not according to the new religious thought. The Lord did not even eat and drink in an ordinary manner: He feasted in Matthew&rsquo;s home with tax collectors and sinners (9:9-10). This was intolerable to John&rsquo;s disciples. Is it right to eat and drink? Or is it right to not eat and drink? Hallelujah! There is no regulation. Is it right to be loud or remain quiet in the meetings? Both are right, and both are also wrong. Both right and wrong belong to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. To be concerned with being right or wrong is to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The Lord does not care for being right or wrong. He cares only for the tree of life. To be loud is not right, and to remain quiet is also not right.</p>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;Wisdom is justified by her works&rdquo; (11:19). Wisdom is Christ (1 Cor. 1:24, 30). All that Christ did was according to the wisdom of God, which is Christ, and He was justified, vindicated, by His wise deeds and works. The King James Version uses <em>children</em> instead of <em>works</em> in Matthew 11:19 (cf. Luke 7:35). The New Testament believers are the children of wisdom, who justify Christ and His deeds and follow Him as their wisdom. We do not follow eating or not eating. We follow only Christ. If Christ is loud in us, we should be loud, and if He is quiet in us, we should be quiet.</p>
<p>The young saints like to be loud, but they must ask themselves whether Christ is the One who is loud in them. If they have the assurance that Christ is the One who is loud in them, it is right to be loud. My concern is that the Lord is not loud in them. The older saints should also ask themselves whether the Lord Jesus is quiet within them. If the Lord Jesus is quiet within them, then it is right to be quiet. It is not a matter of whether we should be loud or be quiet; it is a matter of having the Lord Jesus in us. It is not a matter of eating or not eating but a matter of having wisdom. Wisdom is the living Christ. We follow the living Christ however He leads us.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT THE OLD RELIGION OR<br />
THE NEW RELIGION BUT CHRIST</h2>
<p>Our problem is that we follow methods instead of wisdom. Formerly, we met according to the old method. We came to the meeting and sat quietly until a brother called a hymn. Then an elder or responsible brother would say, &ldquo;Let us pray together, and then we can pray one by one.&rdquo; After the prayer an elder would announce that it was time to give testimonies. After half a minute of silence, another elder would encourage us to be bold because time is precious. If there was still no response, another elder would call on a certain brother to give a testimony. This brother would stand up reluctantly and give a rambling testimony. This was the situation of our meetings in the past. We all have been in such meetings. I praise the Lord that this time when I came to Taiwan, the old religion has been buried to some extent. However, although the old religion has been buried, a new religion has been brought in.</p>
<p>The disciples of John the Baptist also brought in a new religion. John the Baptist lived in a way of neither eating nor drinking, and his work was to baptize people. However, not long afterward, his disciples formed a religion of baptizing people. In John 3, before John was thrown into prison, his disciples were questioning a Jew about purification. The Jew might have said, &ldquo;We do not need baptism. We have the rite of purification. We wash our hands and feet, and we are clean.&rdquo; The disciples of John might have replied, &ldquo;Your washing is not good enough, because you just wash your hands and feet. The washing by our rabbi John is better. He buries you into the water.&rdquo; Thus, the disciples of John probably regarded baptism as the best rite of purification. This was a new religion. When John began to minister, he did not establish a religion of baptism. He baptized people and buried them in order to introduce them to Christ. However, based on this baptism, his disciples formed a religion of baptism. This religion continued to exist until the time of Acts 19:3-5. Up until that time some of the people did not care about going to Christ or being baptized into Christ; they only cared about baptism as a ritual.</p>
<p>Based on John&rsquo;s not eating and drinking, the disciples of John also set up the regulation of fasting. When they saw that the Lord Jesus and His disciples were feasting, they questioned the Lord, &ldquo;Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?&rdquo; (Matt. 9:14). The disciples of John formed two new religious practices: the practice of baptism and of fasting. Their old religion was buried, but a new religion was raised up. The old religion was over, but a new religion appeared. Our way of meeting in the past was according to an old religion, but I am concerned that our present way of meeting has become a new religion. The saints have been trained to have a new way of meeting. The meeting begins with loud prayers, then there is a time for sharing, and finally there is some testifying. The brothers and sisters must bury these steps. We buried the old religion, and we must also bury the new religion. Any form of religion must be buried. The way to meet is to be in spirit, not to follow procedures. It is a matter of wisdom, not a matter of eating or not eating. Sometimes we may be loud, but sometimes we may not be loud. Sometimes we may have some sharing, but sometimes we may not have some sharing. Sometimes we may testify, but sometimes we may not testify. There is no regulation.</p>
<p>Formerly our prayers were long. A brother could pray for at least one or two minutes. Certain saints had the ability to pray for fifteen minutes. They prayed long prayers in every prayer meeting. Such long prayers caused everyone to sleep. The long prayers were so intimidating that other saints would not dare to pray. Only the co-workers, elders, deacons, and responsible ones were able to pray, but their prayers were routine and long.</p>
<p>Now there are no long prayers. Everyone prays short prayers. The saints proclaim, &ldquo;Praise the Lord,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lord is good,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lord is lovely,&rdquo; &ldquo;We eat locusts and wild honey,&rdquo; &ldquo;We wear garments of camel&rsquo;s hair.&rdquo; Is this kind of prayer good? Yes, it is good. However, praying short prayers has become a new regulation. Sometimes there is the need for someone to offer a long prayer. In the meetings everyone is loud, and everyone prays short prayers, but it is more enjoyable for there to be a long prayer between the short prayers. However, there should not be any regulation concerning this.</p>
<p>In the past when there was no regulation, we were at a loss and did not know what to do. It is difficult for the young people to give up being loud, but Jesus is the Lord when we are loud, and He is also the Lord when we are not loud. The Lord does not always want the older saints to be quiet. When the older saints insist on being quiet, they are the Lord, not Jesus. It is a precious experience for Jesus to be the Lord. Tonight He may want us to be loud, but tomorrow night He may want us to weep, to jump, or to remain quiet. There is no regulation.</p>
<p>May the Lord be merciful to us. The age has changed, and the old religion has been buried. No one should say that being quiet is right, nor should anyone say that being loud is right. Both are right, and both are wrong. We do not eat or drink, and we do not abstain from eating and drinking. We do not have meetings with long prayers, nor do we have meetings with short prayers. In our meetings we have both long prayers and short prayers. Hallelujah! We do not have an old religion, nor do we have a new religion. We only have the leading of the Spirit. We follow Christ and take Him as our wisdom. We have left religion, regulations, rituals, and methods. We have neither the old practices nor the new practices. We have Christ, we have wisdom, and we have the Spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST BEING NEW AND OUTSIDE RELIGION</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD DETESTING DEATH</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus was born in a religious nation where Judaism originated, but everything related to Him, including His birth, took place outside religion and had nothing to do with religion. This was not an accident or a coincidence; it was God&rsquo;s arrangement and ordination. Man likes religion, but God detests religion. From man&rsquo;s point of view, religion is better than sin, the world, and the flesh with its lusts, and religion renders a certain amount of help to communities and societies. From God&rsquo;s point of view, however, religion is deceitful, because it undermines God&rsquo;s work by causing man to reject the living God. Hence, religion is God&rsquo;s enemy.</p>
<p>We must receive this word with much prayer. If a young saint would go to a dance club or visit an improper place, we would be quite concerned, but if he comes to the meeting with his Bible and sits in a well-behaved manner, we would praise him. It is easy to understand that a Christian should not be in a sinful place like a dance club, but few of us realize that it is also improper for a Christian to devoutly attend a meeting in a dead and formal way. We condemn the practice of going to a dance club, but we do not condemn the practice of coming to a meeting in a dead and formal way.</p>
<p>Many saints who used to attend dance clubs have confessed this matter to the Lord and asked for forgiveness. However, how many saints have ever confessed to participating in a meeting in a dead and formal way? I doubt that many saints have confessed this, because in our concept going to a dance club is a sin, but attending a meeting is an honorable thing. In God&rsquo;s eyes, however, death is no less defiling than sin.</p>
<p>Because we have a concept of morality, our consideration of what is a sin is quite clear to us. Because we do not have the concept of life, however, we have very little realization related to death. God detests sin, but He detests death even more. He is not only a holy and righteous God who detests sin and the world; even more, He is a living God who detests death. Going to a dance club is in the realm of sin, but attending a meeting in a formal way is in the realm of death. Even if there are five hundred people in a meeting that is dead, it is still an insult to God. This is something that we must confess and repent of and ask for the Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness.</p>
<p>Perhaps some saints cannot accept this word. They may say that they are not dead and that they do not meet in a dead way or attend a dead meeting. I would ask whether a living person can remain inactive for two hours. Before a living person enters the meeting room, others will hear the voice of his joyful prayers: &ldquo;Hallelujah! Amen! Praise the Lord!&rdquo; Since we have a concept of morality but not a concept of life, some saints say that they do not like the meetings in which others are noisy. Those who have children know that the more living the children are, the noisier the home will be. If a family has five children between the ages of two and nine, it will be impossible for their home to be quiet and orderly. If the home is quiet and orderly, it may be because all five children are sick, or they are all dead. If they are dead, that home will be very quiet, and it will surely be tidy, without any confusion. The children will no longer fight or quarrel. If, however, the five children are neither sick nor dead, they will be active and lively, even causing problems. Although they may be troublesome to others, they will be living.</p>
<p>I have many grandchildren, and when they come to visit, they are like a team of destroyers. Everything in my living room must be removed before they come; otherwise, in less than five minutes they will break everything. Do you prefer children who are sick or dead to those who are active, lively, and messy? In the same principle, when the saints are dead in their spirit, our meetings are quiet and orderly, but when we call &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; and are living, it is not possible to be orderly. This does not mean that we should not be orderly. However, sometimes when we are living, we will not be concerned about being orderly. Man cares for religion, but God cares for life. God does not want religion. He wants us to be living.</p>
<p>In John 5 during a certain feast, the Lord Jesus went up to Jerusalem. A feast should be a happy occasion. However, near the sheepgate in Jerusalem there was a pool with five porticoes where many sick people lay, waiting for the moving of the water. These people were sick, lame, blind, and withered. These sick ones did not have any rest, because they were very sick. One man had been in his sickness for thirty-eight years and could not move. The Lord Jesus went to this pool on the Sabbath and spoke to the man who had been sick for thirty-eight years, asking him if he wanted to get well. Then the Lord said, &ldquo;Rise, take up your mat and walk.&rdquo; Immediately the man became well, and he took up his mat and walked. This was on the Sabbath. Therefore, the Jews said to this man, &ldquo;It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your mat&rdquo; (vv. 1-10). The Jews were saying that it was unlawful for the man to take up his mat and walk on the Sabbath, because he was profaning the Sabbath. Does God want man to keep a dead Sabbath by lying down and suffering, or does God want man to be enlivened?</p>
<p>Christians have held many dead Sunday services. God wants to do a work that is contrary to religion. The end time is approaching&mdash;Jerusalem has been returned to Israel, and the Lord is returning soon. In these days God wants to move faster. When a person wants to move faster, he does not care about being elegant. Since God wants to move faster, He does not care for religious rituals and ordinances. Everything about the Lord Jesus took place outside religion. His star was shown to those outside religion, the way people sought Him was outside religion, and the way people followed Him was also outside religion. If we are in religion, we will miss the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE BRIDEGROOM</h2>
<p>Christ is new, and He is outside religion. He is our Bridegroom, and He is the new cloth for making our new garment. He is the new wine for us to drink, and He makes us a new wineskin to contain the new wine. We have been saved for many years, but have we enjoyed Christ as our Bridegroom? One day we said, &ldquo;Lord, I receive You as my Savior. Thank You, You died for me on the cross, and You resurrected and ascended.&rdquo; However, have we ever said, &ldquo;O Lord, You are so lovely. You are our Bridegroom&rdquo;? In the bread-breaking meeting, we have praised the Lord for descending from heaven, putting aside His throne, being born in a manger, suffering afflictions in His human living, dying, and resurrecting. Now we say, &ldquo;O Lord! Amen! Hallelujah!&rdquo; We dropped the clich&#233; of the past, but we have a new clich&#233;. Not many saints may have experienced the loveliness of the Lord during the bread-breaking meeting. Not many saints say, &ldquo;O Lord! You are the lovely Bridegroom. O Lord! You are so lovely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord is not only our Savior but also our Bridegroom. In Matthew 9:10 the Lord Jesus was reclining at table in the house, and many tax collectors and sinners were also feasting with the Lord and His disciples. However, some disciples of John did not like that the Lord and His disciples were feasting, so they came to the Lord and said, &ldquo;Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?&rdquo; (v. 14). John had been ministering for about a year, and he had overthrown the old religion, but his disciples formed a new religion. Hence, not only the disciples of the Pharisees questioned the Lord, but the disciples of John also questioned the Lord. Furthermore, the disciples of John took the lead to give the Lord Jesus a difficult time. The Lord Jesus gave them a profound answer. The disciples of John paid attention to methods, but the Lord Jesus did not reply with a method. His answer was concerning His presence. The Lord said, &ldquo;The sons of the bridechamber cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they?&rdquo; (v. 15). Hence, it is not a matter of fasting or feasting. It is a matter of having the Lord&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>The young people like to be loud. Why are they loud? They should reply, &ldquo;It is because of the Lord&rsquo;s presence. The louder I am, the more I touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence, touch Him as the Bridegroom, and touch His loveliness, sweetness, and freshness.&rdquo; If this is the case, they should always be loud. Why do the older saints like to be quiet? Can they say that the more they are quiet, the more they have the Lord&rsquo;s presence and touch His freshness and His loveliness? If this is the case, they should be quiet. We should not care about whether we are quiet or loud; rather, we should care about whether or not we sense the Lord&rsquo;s presence. In the church there should be no regulations, no ordinances, and no rituals. In the church we care only for the Lord&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus did not give any reasons to John&rsquo;s disciples. He did not say, &ldquo;You have formed a new religion, and in order to tear down your new religion, I do not want My disciples to fast.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus did not say this. However, some saints might have this thought. The older ones may say, &ldquo;The young people&rsquo;s being loud has turned into a new religion, so I will be quiet. I will use silence to counter their loudness. They are loud in order to oppose our old methods, so now I object to their new method by being quiet.&rdquo; The older saints may have overthrown the new religion by being quiet, but they have also produced a third religion. The Lord is not concerned with methods.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said that He was with His disciples as the Bridegroom. If He as the Bridegroom wanted them to fast, they should fast, and if He wanted them to eat and drink, they should eat and drink. Likewise, if the Lord&rsquo;s presence wants us to be loud, we should be loud. If we can touch the presence of the Bridegroom by being quiet, we should be quiet. If we cannot touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence in our quietness, we should proclaim, &ldquo;O Lord! Lord Jesus!&rdquo; By calling on Him in this way, we will enjoy the presence of the Bridegroom. The older saints say that to proclaim loudly is not right. I am not saying that it is right. However, the older saints should try to touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence by declaring His name. Once they taste the Lord in this way, they will enjoy it. This is not a theory but a fact.</p>
<p>We are not speaking of the Lord&rsquo;s ordinary presence but of His presence as the Bridegroom. A bridegroom is a special person. He is the most lovely and most admired person. Our Lord should be so sweet and precious to us. We must touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence as the One who is our Bridegroom. Hallelujah! He is not merely our Savior, our Redeemer, and our Lord, but He is even more our Bridegroom.</p>
<p>The first stanza of <em>Hymns,</em> #170 says, &ldquo;Lord, Thou art the lovely Bridegroom, / God appointed, dear to us; / Thy dear self is so attractive, / To our heart so beauteous!&rdquo; When we truly see that the Lord is our Bridegroom, our meetings will be different. They will become wedding meetings. Can we fast when we have the Lord&rsquo;s presence as our Bridegroom? Suppose a young brother is getting married and will soon become a bridegroom. To fast for him would be to put him to shame. We would fast for him only if he had encountered misfortune. Has the Lord encountered misfortune, or is He our Bridegroom? He is our Bridegroom! Hence, we need not fast. Let all the religionists fast. Let the followers of religion fast. We will eat and drink, and we will sing of our Lord being the lovely Bridegroom.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE NEW GARMENT</h2>
<p>Before our salvation we looked like ragged beggars and could not possibly match our Bridegroom. We thank the Lord that He is not only the Bridegroom for our enjoyment but also the new cloth to be made into our new garment for us so that we are worthy to enjoy His presence. In Matthew 9:16 the Lord spoke of Himself as unfulled cloth. The Greek word for <em>unfulled</em> also means &ldquo;new.&rdquo; In Luke 5:36 the Lord spoke of Himself as the new garment. Do we know the difference between the new cloth and the new garment? The new cloth is material that is untreated, uncut, and unwashed, and it has not yet been made into a garment. A new garment is made from new cloth that has been treated, cut, washed, sewn, and steamed. From the time of His incarnation until His death on the cross, the Lord was the new cloth. Through His death and resurrection, this new cloth became a new garment. We can put on this new garment simply by saying, &ldquo;O Lord! I believe in You. You died and were resurrected for me.&rdquo; This new garment is our garment of righteousness for us to be justified by God and for us to be able to stand before Him (15:22; Gal. 3:27; 1 Cor. 1:30). This is the way that we are saved by grace to be His match.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE NEW WINE</h2>
<p>In Matthew 9:17 the Lord spoke of the new wine. We have put on the new garment and can match our Bridegroom, but what about our inward condition? How can there be any enjoyment if we are still hungry and thirsty? Hence, merely wearing the new garment is not adequate. We also need to have the new wine within us so that we may have true enjoyment. The new garment can be put upon us, but it cannot be mingled with us to become our life. When we drink the new wine, it enters into us to become our life. The Lord is not only the new garment upon us but also the new wine within us. He not only justifies us outwardly in our position by becoming the garment of righteousness upon us, but He also causes us to drink the new wine of His life. The moment this wine enters into us, we become vigorous and energetic. Those who are drunk with physical wine bring harm to their bodies, but we are energized and invigorated when we drink the Lord Jesus as the new wine. On the day of Pentecost the Jews said that the disciples were &ldquo;full of new wine&rdquo; (Acts 2:13). As Christians, we should also be persons drunk with Christ as the new wine.</p>
<p>Many saints in the church in Los Angeles are drunk with this new wine. From morning until evening they are always proclaiming, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Jesus is Lord! Christ is Victor!&rdquo; There is a brother who is not yet forty years old. He is truly drunk with Jesus, the new wine, and every day he is beside himself. One day this brother was driving his car and calling, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; A policeman thought the brother was drunk and stopped him. Our brother told the policeman that he was not drunk, but he was declaring that Jesus is Lord. A few days later this brother was calling on the Lord, and the same policeman saw him. The policeman could do nothing but agree that Jesus is Lord.</p>
<p>There are seven brothers who live near the meeting hall of the church in Los Angeles. Every day these brothers drive to and from work together. This gives them a good opportunity to enjoy the Lord, especially on their way home from work. When the traffic lights turn red, all the cars stop, and the seven brothers proclaim, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; They are truly beside themselves.</p>
<p>This kind of atmosphere not only releases Christians but also releases the spirit of the gospel, which draws people to follow the Lord. This is much better than being in a dead religion, participating in a dead Sunday service, or attending a dead meeting. It would be wonderful for some of the saints to be beside themselves just as the saints in Los Angeles are. We need to drink the Lord Jesus as the new wine. The more we drink, the better we will be. We need to be drunk and full of the new wine.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LOCAL CHURCHES BEING THE NEW WINESKIN</h2>
<p>Not only do we have the new wine, but we also have the new wineskin (Matt. 9:17). The new wineskin is the local churches. Anything religious is an old wineskin. If we put new wine in old wineskins, the wineskins will burst. New wine must be put in new wineskins. The local churches are the new wineskins that can hold the new wine. In the local churches we can enjoy the new wine.</p>
<p>Some saints may prefer to stay at home and enjoy the Lord instead of going to the meetings. They can stay at home and enjoy the Lord, but after a few days their enjoyment will disappear, because the new wine is depleted. We must go to the meetings of the church, because the local churches are the new wineskins that store the new wine. Hallelujah! We have the Bridegroom, and we have the new cloth to clothe us as the new garment so that we may match our Bridegroom. Furthermore, we have the new wine to drink and the new wineskin to contain the new wine.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR CATEGORIES OF CHRISTIANS</h2>
<p>According to our observation, those who profess to be Christians may be divided into four categories. The first category consists of those who take Christ as the new cloth. The second category consists of genuine Christians who take Christ as the new garment. The third category consists of genuine Christians who not only put on the new garment but also drink Christ as the new wine. The last category is the highest. The Christians in this category not only have put on the new garment and drink the new wine but also have the new wine in the new wineskin. The first category of people who profess to be Christians regard Christ merely as a model. They acknowledge that Christ&rsquo;s noble character has made Him a perfect example for humanity, and they imitate Him to serve society. However, they do not accept the vicarious death of Christ or His redemption of their sins, nor do they believe that Jesus was resurrected. This is to take Christ as the new cloth. These are Christians in name only, the so-called modernists.</p>
<p>Genuine Christians receive Christ as their new garment by acknowledging that the Lord Jesus died and was resurrected. They accept that the new cloth passed through the process of cutting and sewing to become the new garment. Those who receive the crucified and resurrected Christ as the new garment are saved and justified. This is very good, but it is still not good enough. Some Christians take a step further. They not only receive the Lord Jesus as their Redeemer but also as their life. They not only put on the new garment but also have the new wine within them.</p>
<p>However, we are not only clothed with the new garment and drinking the new wine, but we are also in the local churches. We have the new wineskin to contain the new wine. We are justified, and we have Christ as our life and the church as our living. Furthermore, we can enjoy Christ as our Bridegroom. Hallelujah! He is the Bridegroom, He is the new cloth for the new garment, He is the new wine, and, as the church, He is even the new wineskin.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST VERSUS RELIGION<br />
INDICATING THAT CHRIST IS THE HEAD<br />
CARING FOR HIS BODY</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that Christ is five new items in the Gospel of Matthew. He is everything new. He is the Bridegroom, the new cloth, the new garment, the new wine, and the new wineskin. With Him nothing is old; everything is new. The book of Matthew also shows that Christ is versus religion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BREAKING THE SABBATH IN MATTHEW 12:1-2<br />
INDICATING THAT HE IS THE HEAD</h2>
<p>In chapter 12 the Lord Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath (v. 1). Why did the Lord go through the grainfields? Was He lost, or was He walking aimlessly? Everything that the Lord did was full of meaning. Grainfields are certainly not the place to hold a meeting. Grainfields contain food to eat, but eating in a grainfield can be done only in a crude way. Furthermore, the Lord went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. The Lord did not go through the grainfields during the first six days of the week. He waited until the seventh day. I believe that the Lord chose to do this on the seventh day, the Sabbath day, with the intention of showing the Pharisees that He wants to overthrow religion.</p>
<p>The Lord went through the grainfields on the Sabbath, but why did the Pharisees also go to the grainfields? Perhaps the Pharisees were looking to see if there were people in the grainfields breaking the Sabbath. When the Lord Jesus and His disciples went through the grainfields, they picked ears of grain and ate, and the Pharisees saw them. This event shows that the Lord did not come to keep religious regulations or to care about cultural tradition. He did things on the Sabbath that broke the Sabbath. On the Sabbath the Lord went through the grainfields with His disciples, and His disciples ate ears of grain. The disciples ate in a way that was against the regulations; they ate the grains raw and in a crude way. The Lord did not care for religion or culture. He cared only for the reality of Himself.</p>
<p>Is the church a holy temple, a chapel, or a grainfield? The church should be a grainfield. Our meeting is a grainfield, and the local church is also a grainfield. If the saints come to the meetings in order to keep regulations, they will remain hungry, and our meetings will have the nature of a chapel. What is the significance of a grainfield? There are no regulations in a grainfield. There is only food to satisfy people. The Lord&rsquo;s disciples picked ears of grain and ate in a crude way, without plates and bowls. Outwardly they were crude, but they had enjoyment and real satisfaction. They did not have the outward Sabbath, but they had rest within.</p>
<p>The Jews were keeping religious regulations, but the Lord did not keep the regulations; instead, He went to the grainfields. This indicates that the Lord did things contrary to religion and culture so that His disciples would be satisfied. When the Pharisees saw the Lord&rsquo;s disciples picking ears of grain and eating them, they said to the Lord, &ldquo;Behold, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath&rdquo; (v. 2). This means that the disciples had profaned the Sabbath. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Have you not read what David did when he became hungry, and those who were with him; how he entered into the house of God, and they ate the bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, except for the priests only?&rdquo; (vv. 3-4). The Lord&rsquo;s words are very meaningful. They imply that He is today&rsquo;s David and that the disciples who follow Him are following the real David. David the king was only a shadow. The Lord is the substance, the real David.</p>
<p>The bread of the Presence in the temple was for the priests to eat. The Lord&rsquo;s words indicate that the age of the priesthood was over. Just as the age was changed when David became the king, the Lord&rsquo;s coming changed the age. Christ is not only the greater David and the real David; He is also the One who has changed the age. The coming of David changed the age from the age of the priests to the age of the kings. Now that the Lord is here, the age has changed from the age of the Old Testament to the age of the New Testament. In the Old Testament age people kept the Sabbath, but in the New Testament age the Lord is our Sabbath. Thank the Lord that the age has changed. Since the Lord is the real David, those who follow Him should not be hungry. When we meet together to worship the Lord, we are satisfied within. The more we worship, the more we are satisfied. The Lord Jesus does not care for regulation; He cares for our being fed and satisfied.</p>
<p>The Lord spoke a further word to the Pharisees in verse 5: &ldquo;Have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?&rdquo; These words indicate that even if the age had not changed from the age of the priesthood to that of the kingship, the priests who labor in the temple on the Sabbath are guiltless. Hence, the regulation of the Sabbath is effective only outside the temple; there is no such regulation inside the temple. Once a person is inside the temple, he is free. The Lord also said, &ldquo;I say to you that something greater than the temple is here&rdquo; (v. 6). The Lord Jesus is greater than the temple. Since His disciples were doing things in Him, the One who is greater than the temple, they were guiltless. Outside of Christ we are in bondage, but in Christ we are set free.</p>
<p>Are we in Christ or outside of Christ? We are in Christ! There is freedom in the temple, but here is One who is greater than the temple. Christ is not only the greater David but also the greater temple. He is David who gives us satisfaction, and He is the temple that sets us free.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus also said, &ldquo;The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath&rdquo; (v. 8). The Lord Jesus is the Lord. If He wants to establish the Sabbath, He will establish it, and if He wants to do away with the Sabbath, He will do away with it. He is not only the real David and the greater temple, but He is also the Lord of the Sabbath. These items show that He is Christ, the Head. Jesus is Lord! In Him we have satisfaction, freedom, and rest.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BREAKING THE SABBATH IN MATTHEW 12:10-11<br />
INDICATING THAT HE CARES FOR HIS BODY&mdash;<br />
THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The record in the Bible is very particular. After breaking the Sabbath in verses 1 and 2, the Lord broke the Sabbath again in verses 10 and 11. The Lord&rsquo;s repeated breaking of the Sabbath indicates that He was against the regulation of keeping the Sabbath. The second time, the Lord did not break the Sabbath in the grainfields but in a synagogue. Among the people worshipping in the synagogue, there was a man who had a withered hand. The Lord Jesus confronted the Pharisees. The Pharisees asked the Lord whether it was lawful to heal on the Sabbath (v. 10). The Lord Jesus answered with an analogy, &ldquo;What man will there be among you who will have one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?&rdquo; (v. 11). The Lord&rsquo;s answer shows that the man was one of the Lord&rsquo;s members and one of His sheep. Those who understand the Bible know that members are for the Body and that sheep are for the flock. Both the Body and the flock refer to the church. The church is the Lord&rsquo;s Body and the Lord&rsquo;s flock. In this situation a sheep had fallen into a pit; that is, a member had become withered. Would the Lord heal him? Would the Lord care for the Sabbath or care for His sheep, His member? Would He care for keeping religious regulations or for healing His members? It is very clear that our Lord does not care for religious regulations. He cares for His members, His sheep. He is satisfied when a sheep is rescued and a withered member is healed and made alive.</p>
<p>According to the Lord&rsquo;s leading, for a period of time we had some experience of burying our oldness. This practice was condemned as a violation of religious regulations. Some in Christianity called it a heresy and said that believers should be baptized only once. But where in the Bible does it say that we can be baptized only once? The Bible says that a believer should be baptized, but it does not say that a believer can be baptized only once. The regulation of being baptized only once comes from religion and tradition. The result of this tradition is that baptism has become a rite for joining an organization. According to the Bible, baptism is not a ritual but the testimony of a fact. The fact is that by believing into the Lord, we are joined to the Lord and have died with Him. He was buried, so we are also buried in water. He resurrected, and we are resurrected with Him (Rom. 6:3-5). Not only so, we are baptized into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19). Hence, baptism is not a ritual or a regulation; it is a spiritual reality.</p>
<p>Many Christians have turned baptism into an empty ritual, a dead ordinance. Even among us baptism has somewhat become an ordinance. Among the local churches, there is the practice of first preaching the gospel and then visiting our gospel friends in order to prepare them for baptism. In the past there was even an interview for baptism. We would ask a person who desired to be baptized whether he believed in God, whether he believed that Jesus died for his sins, and whether he had confessed his sins. If he said yes, we would schedule a baptism for him. Then on the assigned day the new believer would come and listen to a message concerning baptism. Although on the surface this new believer understood the meaning of baptism, he subconsciously thought that baptism is a ceremony for him to join the church. In his consideration he is baptized in order to join a church.</p>
<p>Christianity has turned spiritual realities into religious regulations, ordinances, and rituals. For this reason, throughout the centuries the Lord has raised up believers who reacted to the regulations in Christianity. For example, He raised up the Quakers who said that when the Holy Spirit was poured upon them, they quaked. The Quakers, the Society of Friends, said that they do not need to be baptized in water or sprinkled with water. They need only to quake. Today there are not many Quakers. The Quakers were a reaction stirred up by the Lord against the rituals in Christianity.</p>
<p>Later the Lord raised up others, such as Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis. She was knowledgeable concerning spiritual things, but she repudiated both baptism by immersion and baptism by sprinkling. She said in effect, &ldquo;Both baptism by immersion and baptism by sprinkling are useless; they are mere forms and regulations. A believer needs Spirit baptism. He needs to be in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord has also stirred up the matter of burial among us. I believe this is also a reaction. We would never have imagined such a thing. Under the operation of the Holy Spirit a group of brothers and sisters felt that they were old, and they desired to be buried. Thus, burials began. The saints went into the water to be buried one by one. Their feeling was, &ldquo;Let me be buried! Let my corrupt self be buried! Let my world-loving self be buried! Let my old self be buried!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After their burial, many saints became living; they were enlivened. Nevertheless, the burials aroused opposition among Christians, who asked what we were doing and said that we had violated the rule, because a believer should be baptized only once. Before the saints were buried, some might have gone dancing or watched movies, but they were not accused of violating any regulations. However, after they were buried and enlivened, they were criticized and condemned for breaking the regulation.</p>
<p>Does the Lord Jesus care for regulations? Suppose everyone in a meeting is half-dead, having a withered member. Your left hand is withered, my right hand is withered, his left leg is withered, and my right leg is withered. You keep the Sabbath with your withered hand, and I keep the Sabbath with my withered leg. What is the value of our keeping the Sabbath? Does the Lord want this kind of Sabbath-keeping? Absolutely not! The Lord wants to break this kind of keeping of the Sabbath. He purposely chose to work on the Sabbath by restoring the man with a withered hand. Likewise, the Lord Jesus does not care about our keeping a regulation of being baptized only once. He would rather that we be buried and living.</p>
<p>The Lord is not concerned about our keeping religious regulations. His focus is whether His sheep have been lifted out of the pit and whether His members are living. If we are not living, we are wrong, whether we are baptized once, multiple times, or not at all. If we are not living, we are wrong no matter what we do. However, if we are living, everything is right. The Lord does not care for being baptized once or being baptized twice. His concern is whether we are living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE SIGN THAT IS CONTRARY TO RELIGION</h2>
<p>Matthew 12 not only presents two instances of the Lord breaking the Sabbath; it also shows that the Lord is the sign that is contrary to religion. In verse 38 several religious representatives, the scribes and the Pharisees, came to speak to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.&rdquo; The Lord answered, &ldquo;An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet. For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights&rdquo; (vv. 39-40). The Lord&rsquo;s answer indicates that He is the real Jonah who would be buried and resurrected from the dead. The Lord being the real Jonah is the sign given to this generation. The Christ who died and resurrected to give us life and to enliven the dead is the greatest sign.</p>
<p>Not only so, the Lord also said that He is more than Solomon (v. 42). When we receive Him as Jonah, who died and resurrected to give us life, He becomes Solomon, the King within us to give us wisdom. This is the sign given to religion. This sign is nothing other than the resurrected Christ, the reigning Christ, and the Christ who gives us wisdom.</p>
<p>The words spoken by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 12 indicate that He is the reality of every positive person and thing. He is David, the temple, the Sabbath, Jonah, and Solomon. He is everything. He is the greater David, the greater temple, and the Lord of the Sabbath; He is more than Jonah and more than Solomon. He satisfies us, sets us free, gives us rest, and restores us. Furthermore, He makes us living sheep and living members for the accomplishing of His purpose, the building of His Body. He gives us the crucified and resurrected life, and He also gives us wisdom. He breaks the Sabbath in order to show that He is the Head and in order to restore His Body. This is the great mystery, Christ and the church (Eph. 5:32). Christ the Head and His Body are related to His being versus religion and to His breaking the Sabbath. Where there is religion, there is no Christ, and where there is religion, there is no church. Only when we are versus religion will we have the reality of Christ and the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST BEING THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD</h1>
<p>The Gospel of Matthew shows how much Christ is versus religion. Matthew 1, 2, 3, 9, and 12 show that all things related to the Lord Jesus took place outside religion. The birth of the Lord was outside religion. He was sought and found outside religion. He was followed, served, and cared for outside religion. He was even introduced outside religion. Everything related to Him was versus religion. He rejected the old religion, and He also put the new religion aside. He cared neither for the religion of the Pharisees nor for the religion of John the Baptist. Outside religion He wants to be everything to us.</p>
<p>He is the Bridegroom, the new cloth, the new garment, the new wine, and the new wineskin. Furthermore, He is the real David, the greater temple, the Lord of the Sabbath, the greater Jonah, and the greater Solomon. Our Lord is the Bridegroom for our appreciation. He is the new cloth to be made into a new garment for us to put on so that we may be in His presence. He is also the new wine to be our joy and satisfaction so that we may have life and be strong. He is even the new wineskin to uphold and preserve us. As the real David, He satisfies us; as the greater temple, He sets us free; as the Lord of the Sabbath, He gives us rest; as the greater Jonah, He gives us the crucified and resurrected life; and as the greater Solomon, He gives us wisdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING REVELATION OUTSIDE RELIGION</h2>
<p>One day Peter received the revelation that the Lord Jesus is the Son of the living God. The One in whom we believe and whom we follow is the Son of the living God. In Matthew 16:13 Jesus and His disciples went into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, which is on the border of the Holy Land. The holy temple is in the holy city, and the holy city is in the Holy Land. Everything outside the Holy Land is the land of the Gentiles. Caesarea Philippi cannot be considered Gentile land, but it is very close to Gentile land, because it is on the border of the Holy Land. If we want to know the Lord Jesus, we must be outside religion; we must not remain in the holy temple and the holy city. However, it is not sufficient to leave the holy temple and the holy city; we must also leave the Holy Land and follow Christ into a realm outside religion. The Lord Jesus took His disciples to the parts of Caesarea Philippi with the intention of bringing them completely out of their religious background, that is, out of the atmosphere, environment, and influence of religion so that they could break away from it.</p>
<p>As long as we have even a little religious concept, we will have a veil covering us. This veil will prevent us from knowing the Lord Jesus. We should not think that only unbelievers do not know the Lord Jesus. People in Christianity do not necessarily know the Lord Jesus. The &ldquo;anity&rdquo; in Christianity is a veil. The Lord must bring us out of religion. The Lord and His disciples came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi. The words <em>into the parts of</em> indicate being in a sphere. In this sphere there was no religious atmosphere, no religious environment, no religious background, and no religious influence. The religious veil was gone.</p>
<p>In Caesarea Philippi the Lord Jesus questioned His disciples, asking, &ldquo;Who do men say that the Son of Man is?&rdquo; (v. 13). They said, &ldquo;Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets&rdquo; (v. 14). In the sphere of religion people are filled with religious concepts and religious figures. John the Baptist was a new religious figure, Elijah was the greatest of the Old Testament prophets, Jeremiah was next, and there were other prophets who were also considered great religious figures. This was how the religious people viewed the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>The Lord then turned to His disciples and asked, &ldquo;But you, who do you say that I am?&rdquo; (v. 15). Peter answered and said, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (v. 16). This was a revelation. It was not tradition, teaching, regulation, or religion. We must all receive a revelation of who Christ is. Christ is the Son of the living God. He is not merely the Son of God; He is the Son of the living God. </p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VISION ON THE MOUNTAIN</h2>
<p>Spiritual matters are more difficult to learn than an academic course. A person who has a good teacher can learn mathematics. However, spiritual revelation often appears briefly and then disappears. It may seem as though we have seen something, but after a while it seems as though we have lost it. Peter received the heavenly revelation in Matthew 16 concerning who Christ is, but the Lord Jesus wanted Peter to receive a supplementary lesson.</p>
<p>After the revelation received in Matthew 16, verse 1 of chapter 17 says, &ldquo;After six days Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and brought them up to a high mountain privately.&rdquo; Luke 9:28 records the same event, and says, &ldquo;About eight days after these words, He took with Him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.&rdquo; Matthew 17:1 says six days, but Luke 9:28 says eight days. How could it be both six days and eight days? The Jews counted their days from five o&rsquo;clock in the evening until five o&rsquo;clock the following evening. Therefore, four o&rsquo;clock in the evening until six o&rsquo;clock the following evening is three days, because the first hour is counted as one day, and the last hour is also counted as one day. Hence, we may say that it is either one day or three days. Similarly, the period of time between the revelation concerning Christ and the vision on the mountain is recorded as six days in the Gospel of Matthew but eight days in the Gospel of Luke. This signifies that one week had elapsed. A week is a specific turn of time. A day is a short turn of time; a week is a longer turn of time; a month and a year are much longer turns of time.</p>
<p>The Lord brought only three disciples to a high mountain. If we want to see spiritual things, we must pay the price to go up to a high mountain. This time the Lord Jesus did not ask any questions; instead, He showed the disciples something. He was transfigured before the disciples. His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as the light. The Jesus whom the disciples saw on the mountain was different from the person they saw on the plain. In this glorious scene Moses and Elijah suddenly appeared (Matt. 17:1-3). There is a mysterious aspect about both Moses and Elijah. When Moses died, God hid his body, and the children of Israel do not know where he was buried (Deut. 34:6). Elijah was taken up to heaven alive, and the children of Israel do not know where he went (2 Kings 2:11). However, that day on the high mountain not only did Moses appear, but Elijah also appeared.</p>
<p>Peter often took the lead to speak, and this time was not an exception. He said, &ldquo;Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You are willing, I will make three tents here, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah&rdquo; (Matt. 17:4). Peter&rsquo;s first sentence was right: &ldquo;It is good for us to be here.&rdquo; However, he spoke nonsensically when he said that he would make three tents, one for the Lord Jesus, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. Moses and Elijah are representatives of the Old Testament, Moses representing the law and Elijah representing the prophets. When the Jews spoke of the Scriptures, they often did not use the term <em>Scriptures;</em> they referred to it as the Law and the Prophets. When they spoke of the Law and the Prophets, they were referring to the Scriptures. If someone asks us whether or not we want Christ, we would surely say that we want Christ. However, do we want the Law and the Prophets? If we want both Christ and the Law and the Prophets, we will be making two tents. That will surely be troublesome. Christ is not only versus religion; He is also versus the Law and the Prophets. He is versus the Scriptures of the Jews.</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s nonsensical statement did not elevate Moses and Elijah, but it demoted Christ. He put Christ on the same level as Moses and Elijah. Therefore, a bright cloud came and overshadowed them, and a voice out of the cloud said, &ldquo;This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight. Hear Him!&rdquo; (v. 5). This word indicates that we should no longer listen to Moses or Elijah. The bright overshadowing cloud and the voice brought an atmosphere that greatly frightened the disciples, and they fell on their faces (v. 6). Then the Lord Jesus came to them and touched them, saying, &ldquo;Arise, and do not be afraid.&rdquo; When they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone (vv. 7-8).</p>
<p>If our Bible replaces Christ, we should not want the Bible. The Bible should not replace Christ. We must reach a point where we can say, &ldquo;Hallelujah! I see Jesus Himself alone. I do not see anyone else.&rdquo; Believers often say that the Bible says this and that. Yes, the Bible says this and that, but have we met Christ? It is one thing to know the Bible, but it is quite another to meet Christ. In her Bible reading, a young sister may come to Ephesians 6:1, which says, &ldquo;Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.&rdquo; She may be so touched by the verse that she makes up her mind to always obey her parents. After less than five minutes, however, her mother may unexpectedly complain about something, which rouses the young sister&rsquo;s anger and causes her to forget the verse she just read. If, however, the sister has a time with the Lord in the morning, she will not only be touched by the verses but will also meet the Lord in her spirit. As a result, instead of becoming angry when her mother complains, she will be able to sing Hallelujah. Do we see the difference between these two situations? It is one thing to be touched when reading the Bible, but it is another thing to meet the Lord. The Bible should bring us to Christ. The Bible should cause us to meet the Lord. The Lord occupies a unique position. We should hear Him only.</p><h2 class="head1">THE APPLICATION IN OUR DAILY LIVING</h2>
<p>When the disciples came down from the mountain, the Lord Jesus charged them not to tell the vision to anyone (Matt. 17:9). Matthew 16 contains a revelation; Matthew 17 contains a vision. The revelation in chapter 16 concerns Christ being the Son of the living God. The vision in chapter 17 shows that Christ is God&rsquo;s beloved Son, God&rsquo;s delight, and that we should hear Him. It is one thing to receive a revelation, it is another thing to see a vision, and it is still another thing to be able to apply the revelation that we have received and the vision that we have seen. Peter received a revelation, but he was still confused when he saw the vision.</p>
<p>After the vision on the mountain, the Lord and His disciples went to Capernaum, and those who take up the temple tax came to Peter. The temple tax was collected from the people of Israel for the holy temple, not for the Roman Empire. Exodus 30:11-16 says that every male Israelite was to give half a shekel as a ransom for himself. The half-shekel was used for the service of the holy temple. To pay the half-shekel was to pay tax to God&rsquo;s temple, that is, to pay tax to God.</p>
<p>The collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and said, &ldquo;Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?&rdquo; (Matt. 17:24). This environment was arranged by God to expose whether or not Peter was clear about the vision that he had seen. Regrettably, when it was time to apply what he had seen, Peter completely forgot the vision. When he was asked, &ldquo;Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; (v. 25) because from his youth he had been taught that in Exodus 30 Moses said every male Israelite should pay the temple tax. However, when Peter said yes, he was listening to Moses. From the time of Moses, generation after generation of the children of Israel had been listening to the word concerning every male paying the temple tax. Since Jesus was an Israelite, Peter assumed that Jesus would pay the temple tax.</p>
<p>After Peter said yes, he went into the house, and Jesus questioned him, saying, &ldquo;What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers?&rdquo; Peter said, &ldquo;From strangers,&rdquo; and Jesus said, &ldquo;So then the sons are free&rdquo; (Matt. 17:25-26). In effect, the Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Did you not hear the voice on the mountain? I am the Son of God.&rdquo; When Peter heard the Lord&rsquo;s word, he might have thought, &ldquo;This must mean that He should not pay the temple tax. I am wrong again!&rdquo; The Lord then said to him, &ldquo;But that we do not stumble them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. And when you open its mouth, you will find a stater; take that and give it to them for Me and you&rdquo; (v. 27). I think that after Peter heard the Lord&rsquo;s words, he must have been at a loss. He might have thought, &ldquo;Lord, You are giving me a difficult time. You said that You do not pay the temple tax, but You also said that You would pay the temple tax. You are always right whether You say yes or no, but I am always wrong whether I say yes or no. Therefore, from now on, no one should listen to me; rather, we should listen to You!&rdquo; The voice on the mountain said, &ldquo;Hear Him!&rdquo; (v. 5). Peter should have told those who collected the temple tax that he needed to ask the Lord because he was told to hear Him. If Peter had replied in this way, he would have applied the vision that he had seen, and it would have spared him much trouble.</p>
<p>Peter created trouble for himself. After telling Peter that He would pay the temple tax, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. And when you open its mouth, you will find a stater; take that and give it to them for Me and you&rdquo; (v. 27). Peter was probably very depressed when he went fishing. While the other disciples were in the house, he was sent to fish. When he cast the hook, he might have wondered when the first fish would come. He might have waited for a long time. In this way Peter learned a lesson. He probably regretted and thought that if he had not been so fast to express his opinion, he would not be waiting for a fish.</p>
<p>This example is simple; however, it presents the Lord Jesus as today&rsquo;s Moses, today&rsquo;s law. He is the living law. If He says that we should pay, then we pay; if He says that we should not pay, then we should not pay. Whatever He says, we should do. We should listen to Him. This example also presents the Lord Jesus as today&rsquo;s Prophet. We should not listen to anyone else; rather, we listen only to the living Jesus.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we should despise or even neglect the Bible. However, the Bible does not give clear instructions concerning many things in our daily living. For example, the Bible does not say how long a sister&rsquo;s hair should be. It does not say how long her skirt should be. We cannot find an answer to these matters in any of the sixty-six books of the Bible. How should we handle these matters? We can ask the Lord Jesus. He is in us. He is our living law, our living Moses.</p>
<p>Not only so, He is the living Prophet, our living Elijah who prophesies. The Lord&rsquo;s prophecies are always fulfilled. When He says to go fishing, the fish will come. When He says to open the mouth of the fish and find a stater, it will be fulfilled. He is today&rsquo;s living Elijah. Hence, when we have the Lord, we do not need Moses or Elijah. When we have Jesus, we do not need anyone else. In the Old Testament a person had to find a way to pay the temple tax, even if he did not have money, in order to fulfill the commandment of Moses. However, the Lord Jesus, today&rsquo;s Moses, is not like this. When He asks us to pay the temple tax, He will provide a way for us. He says, &ldquo;Go fishing. When the fish comes, open its mouth, and you will get a stater.&rdquo; This is today&rsquo;s Elijah. His prophecy is His supply. Jesus not only gives us commandments, but He also prophesies to supply the demand of the commandment. As long as we listen to Him and do everything according to His word, the supply and the strength will come.</p>
<p>Our Lord Jesus is outside religion. We do not have religion, doctrine, or regulation. We have only the living Jesus. He is the living law, the living Moses, and the living Prophet, the living Elijah. We should listen to what He says and do whatever He asks. Then we will receive the supply. This is the Son of the living God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST BEING THE REALITY</h1>
<p>In the Gospel of Matthew, the first Gospel, the Lord Jesus was completely outside religion; in other words, He had nothing to do with religion. Now we will take a look at the last Gospel, the Gospel of John.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INCARNATE WORD COMING WITH REALITY</h2>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; When was the beginning? What is the meaning of <em>the beginning</em>? The beginning in this verse is the beginning before time existed. It refers to eternity past before the beginning in Genesis 1:1. In eternity past, before the beginning of time, the Lord Jesus was the Word. <em>Word</em> in the original Greek does not refer to an instant word or a brief word. It refers to a constant word.</p>
<p>As the Word of God, Christ speaks concerning God in a constant manner. As the Word, Christ speaks concerning God. Christ is the constant definition, expression, and declaration of God. Verse 18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; As the Word of God, Christ explains God. This means that the Word is God Himself.</p>
<p>God is mysterious. We believe that God exists, but none of us has seen God. Some people are experts in electricity, but no one has seen electricity. We can see light, the expression of electricity, but not electricity itself. A person may say that electricity is inside a light bulb, but if he breaks the light bulb, he will not see electricity. Likewise, God is mysterious. God is omnipresent, and His existence is real, but no one has ever seen Him. We praise the Lord that when the Lord Jesus came, the invisible God was declared through the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>One day Philip said, &ldquo;Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us&rdquo; (14:8). The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father?&rdquo; (v. 9). The Lord&rsquo;s answer shows that He is the expression, manifestation, and explanation of the Father. Our Lord Jesus is God.</p>
<p>Verse 1 of chapter 1 says that in the beginning, before time, the Lord was the Word. Verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.&rdquo; How mysterious this is! One day the Word became flesh. This means that the Word became a man named Jesus, and He tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality. What is reality? The Gospel of John says that the Lord Jesus is our real light (8:12; 9:5) and air (20:22). He is also the bread of life (6:35, 41, 48), the water of life (4:14; 7:38), and the eternal abode (14:2, 23). He is our light, air, bread, water, and abode. The light from the sun is not the real thing; it is but a shadow. The Lord Jesus is the real light. If we do not have Him, whether we are under the powerful shining of an electric light or under the shining of the sun at noontime, we are still in darkness. The Lord Jesus is the real light. Only when we have the Lord Jesus do we have real light.</p>
<p>Likewise, no matter how much fresh air we breathe, that air is but a shadow; it is not the reality of air. The Lord Jesus is the real air. No matter how much water we drink, without the Lord Jesus, we will still be thirsty. No matter how much food we eat, without the Lord Jesus, we will still be hungry. We may live in a luxurious penthouse or a palace, but without the Lord Jesus, we are homeless and wandering. Only when we have the Lord Jesus do we have a home, a place of rest. All things are but shadows; only the Lord Jesus is reality. We may think that the clothes we wear are real, but if we do not have the Lord Jesus, we will realize that we are naked when we meet Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE REALITY OF THE LAW</h2>
<p>There are three main categories of the Old Testament law. The first category is related to the tabernacle with its furnishings, such as the Ark, the golden lampstand, the table of the bread of the Presence, the golden incense altar, and the various offerings. These items are all types of the Lord Jesus. The second category is related to ceremonies, including circumcision, the Sabbath, and the feasts. An Israelite had to be circumcised, keep the Sabbath, and keep the three annual feasts of the Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles. These ceremonies are also types of Christ. The third category consists of commandments and ordinances, such as honoring one&rsquo;s parents, not stealing, loving one&rsquo;s neighbor as oneself, and dietary regulations.</p>
<p>The tabernacle with its furniture, the offerings, the ceremonies, the commandments, and the ordinances are all shadows. The Lord Jesus is the body, that is, the solid substance, the reality, of the shadows (Col. 2:16-17). The Lord Jesus is the real tabernacle, the real table of the bread of the Presence, the real lampstand, and the real golden incense altar. The Lord Jesus is also the real burnt offering, the real meal offering, the real peace offering, the real sin offering, the real trespass offering, the real wave offering, and the real heave offering. He is all the offerings. Not only so, He is also the real Sabbath, our real rest, and He is our real circumcision. He is also our real feast. When we have Him, we have a feast daily and are truly joyful. In order to truly honor our parents, our honoring must be Christ. Apart from Christ, our honoring is merely a shell, without any reality. Christ is the reality of honoring our parents. In order for our children to honor us, they must have Christ. Without Christ, their honoring is unreliable and temporary. They may honor us in the morning but argue with us in the evening.</p>
<p>The Bible says, &ldquo;Husbands, love your wives&rdquo; (Eph. 5:25). Do the brothers who are husbands really love their wives? We must admit that our love for our wives is problematic because it is unreliable. In the beginning we loved our wives very much, but now we do not love them that much. The Bible also says, &ldquo;Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord&rdquo; (v. 22). I know a certain sister who complained to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;You are unfair. If You had given me a husband who is as good as Mrs. Chang&rsquo;s husband, I would be subject to him. You gave me a bad husband, and You want me to be subject to him. This is unreasonable.&rdquo; It is not easy for a wife to be subject to her husband. A wife&rsquo;s subjection to her husband is Christ, and a husband&rsquo;s love for his wife is also Christ. Christ is our reality. Without Christ, there is no reality.</p>
<p>According to Colossians 2:16-17, eating, drinking, feasts, new moons, and the Sabbath are all shadows, but the body is of Christ. Christ is the body of every positive thing. Even our humility is a shadow. Christ is the reality of our humility. Some sisters are very gentle, but is this gentleness real? Some brothers are well mannered, but is this real? Without Christ, our gentleness is not real, our humility is not real, our patience is not real, and our manners are not real. Christ is our real gentleness, our real patience, our real humility, and our real manners. Without Christ, everything is vanity. Christ is the reality of every positive thing.</p>
<p>The Bible says that husbands should love their wives. If a brother determines to love his wife because of this word, he will become a religious person and grit his teeth in order to love his wife. This also applies to the sisters. A sister who forces herself to be subject to her husband because of what the Bible says is a religious person. When she is not in subjection, she is rebellious, but when she is in her self-imposed subjection, she is religious.</p>
<p>Some sisters may say that this is very difficult and ask whether they should be in subjection. Do not refuse to be in subjection, and do not try to be in subjection. We should neither be rebellious persons nor religious persons. What should we be? We should be Christians. We do not care for being in subjection, nor do we care for not being in subjection. We care for only one thing&mdash;living by Christ. We should not read Ephesians 5 as a law or a commandment; rather, we should take it as our enjoyment. We should pray-read the words in Ephesians 5 and receive them into our spirit to be our supply. Then instead of a sister gritting her teeth to be in subjection or making up her mind to submit, she will inexplicably be subject to her husband. Being in subjection to her husband will be so spontaneous that she will not realize or sense that she is in subjection. This is what it means to be a Christian.</p>
<p>The Bible says, &ldquo;Always rejoice&rdquo; (1 Thes. 5:16). In the past I tried to practice being joyful. However, I discovered that when I did not practice to be joyful, I did not have many problems. However, once I tried to be joyful, problems would arise, and many unhappy things would happen. Instead of good news, I would receive only bad news. Finally, when I decided to give up on the matter of being joyful, I experienced the real joy that is in the Lord. The Lord is my joy when I am in Him. When we are in the Lord, no matter how many problems we have, we are joyful, and our difficulties deepen our taste of the Lord. Our taste of the Lord is deepened in our difficulties, and our taste of the Lord is sweeter in our hardships. Real joy comes from Christ.</p>
<p>What is reality? Reality is Christ. Christ should be everything to us in our living. He is the honoring that we have toward our parents. He is the love that brothers have toward their wives. He is the subjection that sisters have toward their husbands. He is joy, peace, patience, humility, and gentleness. He is our all.</p><h2 class="head1">TAKING CHRIST AS REALITY AND WORSHIPPING GOD</h2>
<p>Our meetings have totally changed. The middle-aged and older sisters are living, and they exercise their spirit with a released voice. The meetings have changed because the saints are released. The meetings are no longer dull and dead. This is very good. It is good to be living and to exercise our spirit, but we must have reality. We must meet in reality. We should not just declare things; otherwise, what we declare becomes an empty slogan. Even though there are times when it is necessary to be loud, if we are always loud, we will have many problems. There should be reality in our meetings. Reality is the Christ we have experienced. We must bring the Christ we have experienced to the meeting.</p>
<p>John 4:23 says, &ldquo;An hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness.&rdquo; Here the Greek word translated &ldquo;truthfulness&rdquo; can also be translated as &ldquo;reality.&rdquo; The Lord spoke this to a Samaritan woman. A Samaritan is half Jew and half Gentile. Like the Jews, they worshipped God according to the law of Moses. The law of Moses contained two important matters concerning the worship of God. First, they had to worship God in the place that He appointed. They could not worship God in the place of their choice. Second, they could not appear before God empty-handed. They had to bring offerings with them (Deut. 12:13-14; 16:16-17). The offerings were produced from the good land of Canaan. Before the Israelites worshipped God, they had to labor on the land of Canaan. This labor included turning the soil, digging rows, sowing seeds, watering the seeds, and pruning and caring for the plants. After this labor, there was a harvest. Those who raised cattle, sheep, pigeons, or turtledoves also needed to labor in order to have a harvest. Then at the time of a feast the Israelites brought the best, the top, portion of the harvest, that is, the firstfruits of the harvest or the firstborn of the flock, to Jerusalem and presented it to God at the temple as an offering. This is the way the Israelites worshipped God.</p>
<p>It is easy for us to have a natural and religious concept concerning worshipping God. To some people worshipping God means to prostrate themselves before God or to kneel down to God. Moses spoke many times concerning worshipping God in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, but he never told the children of Israel to kneel down, bow down, or prostrate themselves. Moses taught them to worship by bringing offerings and presenting them to God. The offerings included the morning and evening offerings. The priests needed to know how to slaughter the animal sacrifices, how to skin the sacrifices, drain the blood, cut the sacrifice in pieces, and wash it with water. They also needed to know which part should be burned completely and which part should be kept, that is, which part was for God&rsquo;s enjoyment, which part was for themselves, and which part was to be shared with their neighbors (Exo. 23:14-19; 34:18-26; Lev. 1&mdash;7; 23; Num. 7&mdash;9; 15; 28&mdash;29; Deut. 14:22-27; 15:19&mdash;16:17). When the children of Israel offered in this way, they worshipped God.</p>
<p>The offerings are Christ. Our real worship to God is to labor on Christ. In our daily life we should labor on Christ. The middle-aged sisters need to manage their homes and care for their husbands and children. Surely, this is not easy. Although the sisters may have a difficult time with house chores, peculiar husbands, and naughty children, God has given them such an environment to cause them to labor on Christ. Crops grow when the sun shines, the rain falls, and the wind blows. Sometimes a husband&rsquo;s words are like the blazing sun, the children&rsquo;s tears are like the pouring rain, and the children&rsquo;s quarrels are like the blowing wind. However, in these situations the sisters can grow a good crop of Christ. These are the best opportunities for us to labor on Christ and to experience Christ. The sisters who experience Christ through their husbands and their children reap a rich harvest. When the saints experience Christ in this way, they bring Christ to the meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day in varying measures. When everyone brings Christ to the meeting, the meeting is full of Christ, and God receives real worship.</p>
<p>Although children are not without problems, parents often wrongly blame their children. Parents often do not understand their children&rsquo;s feelings. Children are provoked in school, and they have pressure from their studies. These are sufferings. However, the children should realize that these sufferings are good opportunities for them to labor on Christ. A young brother who does not have a father to trouble him, a mother to misunderstand him, classmates to take advantage of him, or pressure from his studies will not experience or enjoy Christ in a deep way. Brothers who have businesses also have problems. They have deadlines to meet and payments to make. The saints who are employers cannot find employees to hire, and those who are hired find it difficult to work for their employers. The saints who are principals find it difficult to manage the teachers, and those who are teachers find it difficult to be under the principal. Everyone has a difficult situation. The Lord uses these difficulties to help us experience and enjoy Christ daily.</p>
<p>Our need is to learn how to enjoy and experience Christ. God has placed us in Christ. The children of Israel entered into the land of Canaan and were each allotted a portion of the land. Whether or not they were willing to labor on the land was a serious matter. If an Israelite was lazy and did not rise early to diligently labor, his plot of land would be desolate, and he would not have a harvest at the end of the year. When it was time for the Feast of Pentecost or the Feast of Tabernacles, others would go to worship God with bundles of produce, but he would be empty-handed. Not only would he be without offerings to present to God, but he would also starve. What a pitiful sight that would be! Similarly, as believers, we each have a portion of Christ. You have a portion of Christ, and I have a portion of Christ. If we do not draw near to the Lord in the morning and we do not talk with Him, enjoy Him, or experience Him during the day, we will be very poor. However, if we are diligent to fellowship with the Lord by enjoying Him in the morning and experiencing Him during the day and especially during difficult times, we will have the element of Christ within us.</p>
<p>If we have many experiences of Christ, we will be able to bring the Christ whom we have experienced to the meeting. Suppose there are four thousand saints in a meeting, and everyone brings their portion of Christ. There would be no need for a message, because all the saints would be anxious to present their portion of Christ. Two hours would not be long enough for all the saints to present their portion of Christ. A brother may share how he experienced the Lord at work. A sister may share how she experienced the Lord at home. A young person may share how he experienced the Lord at school. One by one the saints would testify to exhibit Christ. Such a meeting would be very rich. This is our true worship to God. This is also the kind of worship that God wants.</p>
<p>In the meeting it is good to declare short sentences with the release of the spirit. However, the short sentences that we declare with the release of our spirit must have content. The content should not be merely words from the Bible or phrases from hymns. Our content should be the Christ whom we experience daily. May the Lord have mercy on His church so that we not only release our spirit and call on the Lord but also daily and moment by moment enjoy and experience the Lord as our reality. When we meet, we do not bring doctrines with us; rather, we bring Christ, the reality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WORSHIPPING GOD IN SPIRIT<br />
WITH CHRIST AS THE REALITY</h2>
<p>We need to worship God in spirit with Christ as the reality. To worship God in spirit does not mean to worship God with the Holy Spirit but with our human spirit. The present condition of our meetings is good because many saints have learned to release their spirit. However, we need to exercise more. We should not use our mind so much; rather, we should exercise to have a strong spirit. Whenever we come to a meeting, we should bring Christ, that is, our experiences of Christ, and our spirit must be living. We do not have to wait until we reach the meeting hall before we begin to sing and to call on the Lord. We should begin to sing and to call on the Lord on our way to the meeting. Then when we sit down, our spirit will come forth in a released way. In this way, we will have the experiences of Christ as well as the release of the spirit. In such a meeting God will be glorified.</p>
<p>However, when we come to the meetings without experiences of Christ and do not release our spirit, the responsible brothers need to repeatedly encourage us to open our mouth and to function. In such meetings very few saints rise up to speak, and there is no content in their speaking. Furthermore, their spirit is not living, and they do not know how to exercise their spirit. As a result, one person speaks for fifteen minutes. This deflates everyone&rsquo;s spirit and kills the meeting.</p>
<p>Hence, we must labor on Christ daily. Every saint must have fresh experiences of Christ. Our experience of Christ must be fresh, not old. Then when we come to the meeting, everyone will be strong. There will be no need for the responsible brothers to urge us to speak, because we will all leap up to release our spirit. When our spirit is strong and our testimonies are rich, simple, and concise, the meeting will be rich, and God will be glorified. This is to worship God. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we worship God in our spirit with Christ as the reality.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">MAN&rsquo;S TENDENCY BEING<br />
TO KEEP LAWS AND ORDINANCES</h1>
<p>There is a tendency within man to keep laws and ordinances. In this chapter we will consider some examples in the Bible of man&rsquo;s tendency to keep laws and ordinances.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXAMPLE OF THE JEWISH BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>The first example is the Jewish believers. The Jews have the law of Moses. The most important ordinances in the law of Moses are related to circumcision, the Sabbath, and dietary regulations, which stipulate what the Jews can and cannot eat. Circumcision takes place once in a person&rsquo;s lifetime, the Sabbath takes place once every seven days, and dietary regulations are kept daily. The ordinances show that the law of Moses is very strict.</p>
<p>In Acts 10 Peter, a Jew, was led by God in a special way to break away from Jewish tradition and custom in order to contact the Gentiles. When Peter returned to Jerusalem, the Jewish believers disputed with him and condemned him for going into the home of a Gentile and eating with Gentiles (11:2-3). In their consideration Peter had violated the law. It was not easy for Peter to overcome in this matter. Three times God had to give him a vision of a great sheet in which were all kinds of animals. According to Leviticus 11, which is concerning dietary regulations, the Jews could eat animals that have divided hoofs and that chew the cud, such as cattle and sheep. These animals are considered clean. Animals that do not have divided hoofs and do not chew the cud, such as pigs, dogs, and crawling things, are unclean. The Jews could not eat or touch them.</p>
<p>Before Peter went to the Gentiles, God showed him a vision. In this vision heaven opened, and a vessel like a great sheet descended, in which were all the four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of heaven. Then a voice charged Peter to rise up, slay, and eat, but Peter refused and said that he had never eaten anything common and unclean. The voice came to him again a second time, saying that the things God has cleansed must not be made common. This occurred three times (Acts 10:11-16). According to this vision, Peter was to contact the Gentiles. Because the Jews regarded the Gentiles as unclean dogs and pigs, they were not willing to contact the Gentiles or eat with them. However, Peter received a special leading from God to contact the Gentiles. As a result, the Jewish believers disputed with him. Those Jewish believers were saved and knew that salvation does not depend on keeping the law (Gal. 2:15-16), but they were still inclined to keep the law and its ordinances.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXAMPLE OF THE GENTILE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>The second example is the believers in Galatia. The Galatians were Gentiles who, after hearing of the gospel, believed into Christ. The Old Testament law was not given to them. However, due to the influence of the Jewish believers, the Galatians began to keep the law after their salvation. It is easy to fall into keeping the law because the natural man has a tendency to keep the law. It is difficult for people to believe in the gospel, but it is very easy for them to try to keep the law. Even though we stress turning to the spirit and walking by the spirit, it is still difficult for us to grasp this point. It is easier for us to follow a method or to keep a regulation.</p>
<p>Suppose we had a regulation of being quiet in the meetings. There would be no need to remind the saints; everyone would be quiet. Similarly, if we had a regulation of calling and praying audibly in the meetings, the saints would receive it after being reminded a few times. We could easily turn from a method of being quiet to a method of calling and praying out loud. However, when we say that we should walk by the spirit, turn to the spirit, and exercise our spirit, it is not easy for us to respond. It is rather easy to try to keep the law and the ordinances because we know what is required, but when we speak of the Spirit, we do not know what to do. The Spirit is like the wind that blows where it wills (John 3:8). The wind may blow toward the east today and toward the west tomorrow. It may even blow as if it is coming from all four directions. The wind is difficult to grasp.</p>
<p>The Galatians did not know anything about the law prior to their salvation. After they believed in the Lord, they had contact with certain Jewish believers who may have said, &ldquo;Brothers, it is right to follow Jesus. However, there is a commandment in the Old Testament that says we should be circumcised, so we should keep this commandment.&rdquo; The Galatians received this word to keep the law and to be circumcised. They were willing to keep the law. Many ordinances are easy to understand. However, it is not easy to grasp the things of the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EXAMPLE OF PETER, THE APOSTLE TO THE JEWS</h2>
<p>Peter was one of the apostles. The Lord knew that Peter was entrenched in his concept and habits and that it would not be easy for Peter to break away from the law. For this reason, the Lord showed him a vision three times. The Lord also arranged the environment so that Cornelius sent men to invite Peter. These factors subdued Peter to contact the Gentiles.</p>
<p>Later, while Peter was in Antioch, he ate with the Gentile believers. But when some Jewish believers came from Jerusalem, he shrank back and separated himself from the Gentiles. Not only did Peter shrink back, but Barnabas also joined Peter in this hypocrisy (Gal. 2:11-13). It is difficult to believe that Peter would do such a thing. He was an experienced apostle and had received special leading from the Lord through a heavenly vision, yet he separated himself from the Gentile believers.</p>
<p>There is a tendency within us to keep the law. This does not refer to the moral laws. In the New Testament age God has no intention for us to keep the ceremonial laws. God does not want us to keep the ordinances of the law.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXAMPLE OF PAUL, THE APOSTLE TO THE GENTILES</h2>
<p>The fact that Peter was influenced by the Jewish believers indicates that he was not fully delivered from the law and its ordinances. For this reason, Paul opposed Peter to his face (v. 11). We would think that since Paul opposed Peter, wrote the book of Galatians, and knew grace according to the New Testament, he should have been fully delivered from the bondage of the law and its ordinances. However, Paul also became weak. On his last trip to Jerusalem he was subdued by the Jewish believers. Paul went to see James and the elders in Jerusalem. He greeted them and related to them the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. After listening to Paul&rsquo;s report, they glorified God and said that thousands of Jews had believed and were zealous for the law (Acts 21:18-20). The Jewish believers in Jerusalem not only kept the law but were also zealous for the law. The elders felt that Paul did not have a good reputation among the Jews, because he taught the Jews to abandon the rituals of the law (v. 21). They therefore advised Paul, saying, &ldquo;We have four men who have a vow on themselves; take these and be purified with them, and pay their expenses that they may shave their heads. And all will know that there is nothing to the things that they have been informed of concerning you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the law&rdquo; (vv. 23-24).</p>
<p>Should Paul have followed their advice? It was true that Paul acted contrary to the law by contacting the Gentiles. He told the Gentiles and the Jews that they did not need to be circumcised or keep the ordinances. Since this was Paul&rsquo;s teaching, would it not be hypocrisy for him to follow the proposal of the elders? Would he not be lying? Paul should not have agreed.</p>
<p>By this time, Paul had already written Galatians and Romans. In these books his words are very strong. In Galatians 3:1-2 he says, &ldquo;O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed crucified? This only I wish to learn from you, Did you receive the Spirit out of the works of law or out of the hearing of faith?&rdquo; These words are surely strong. Based on these words, we would assume that Paul would not listen to the elders in Jerusalem. However, Paul became weak. This shows the power of the law. We should never think that we are completely delivered from the law. When we enter into a certain environment, we may also become weak and succumb to the law.</p>
<p>Not only did Paul participate in the rite of purification and pay the expenses for the other brothers, but he even had the priests make offerings for them. This is hard to believe. In Hebrews Paul says that the Old Testament offerings were over (10:5-9). In Galatians he says, &ldquo;You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace&rdquo; (5:4). By following the proposal of the elders in Jerusalem, Paul was rebuilding what he had torn down. When Paul was about to conclude the rite of purification, God stirred up a turmoil so that Paul was arrested by the Jews and subsequently sent to Rome to be imprisoned. He never returned to Jerusalem. Then in A.D. 70 God sent the Roman prince Titus with the Roman army to destroy Jerusalem. They tore down the holy temple and destroyed the holy city; they did not leave one stone upon another. God destroyed Jerusalem, the center of Judaism, and scattered the Israelites among the nations. That was two thousand years ago. Since that day, Jerusalem has been under the devastation of the Gentiles. The Lord did this in order to destroy the center of Judaism.</p><h2 class="head1">FALLING INTO LAWS AND ORDINANCES</h2>
<p>The believers in the Bible are not the only ones who were subdued by the law. We also have laws, and we probably have more laws than Moses enacted. For example, our meetings have a set procedure that we have practiced for nearly twenty years. For the past twenty years this procedure has not changed. Our way of meeting has become an established rule that cannot be changed. This is what we call regulations, rules, customs, habits, and practices. This is the law.</p>
<p>We praise the Lord that He came in to disturb us. In the United States He led us to call, &ldquo;O Lord! Amen! Hallelujah!&rdquo; When the saints began to call on the Lord in a released way, they were enlivened. This &ldquo;wind&rdquo; gradually blew to other places, and it also blew to Taiwan. Many religious and law-keeping saints could not take this practice. They said that this cannot be called Sunday worship and that in order to have proper worship, everyone should be quiet. They could not tolerate the noise. As a result, some saints are for being quiet, and others are for being loud.</p>
<p>According to church history, believers are divided into sects and groups because they have differing laws. For example, when some believers in a group insist on worshipping in a certain way, but others in the same group insist on worshipping in a different way, the result is division. In the past there was a Christian group in which some of the believers would shake when they met to worship. There were also believers in that group who were opposed to shaking, so they told those who wanted to shake to go somewhere else. This is the way that the Society of Friends, or Quakers, was formed.</p>
<p>Here is another example. In a Christian group in the United States there were believers who responded with Amen when others prayed. This disturbed other believers in the group. Instead of asking the believers who said Amen to leave, they set aside a corner and named it the &ldquo;Amen corner.&rdquo; Those who wanted to say Amen had to sit in that corner.</p>
<p>When we began to practice calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name, problems arose among the churches. Some saints said that they did not agree with the noise. They could not agree, because they had a concept concerning our practice; they had a law. However, calling on the Lord loudly has gradually become a kind of law. It seems as though some saints are not satisfied unless they call on the Lord loudly. They are not happy to call quietly. As a result, among us a quiet group and a loud group have emerged. The quiet ones keep the law of being quiet, and the loud ones keep the law of being loud. This is a problem.</p>
<p>Everything we handle can become a law. Even in the matter of serving the Lord, we attempt to use methods. These methods are a kind of law. When I fellowship with the co-workers and elders, I often ask, &ldquo;How should we do this? What should we do?&rdquo; It seems as though I am asking for methods. We simply cannot stay away from methods. Even our pray-reading has become a method. Formerly, we read the Bible in one way, and now we read the Bible in another way. In every locality the saints pray-read in the same flavor, following the same procedure. We need to release our spirit. However, I am concerned that the way we release our spirit has become a law.</p>
<p>It seems as though whatever we practice becomes a law. Formerly, our prayers were lengthy. The long prayers could be compared to writing a long essay with beautiful words. This intimidated the new believers, and they dared not pray. The long prayers also put the saints to sleep. Few saints attended the prayer meeting because the saints could not endure long prayers. Now the long prayers are gone, and the saints are released. Everyone is praying short prayers, such as &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; &ldquo;I want to be released!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Every saint should be released!&rdquo; However, it would not be wrong to have some longer prayers in addition to the short prayers. This would help us to further touch our spirit. But we are concerned that it would be easy for us to fall into the practice of always having long prayers.</p>
<p>We are surely difficult people who always have the habit of keeping the law. It seems as though we either pray only short prayers or only long prayers. Once a brother said to me, &ldquo;The brothers and sisters in Taiwan are very receptive to your leading. They will follow whichever way you lead.&rdquo; This is true; however, we should not follow in a military way. If a commanding officer says to stand straight, everyone stands straight, and if he says to march, everyone marches with complete uniformity in their steps. This is the law. You may ask, &ldquo;What should we do?&rdquo; We should not do anything. We should not ask for a method.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Galatians 3:3 says, &ldquo;Having begun by the Spirit.&rdquo; This points to the fact that our Christian life is altogether a matter of the Spirit. Therefore, we do not need to read the Bible in a certain way; rather, we should be living and have various ways of reading the Bible, just as the wind blows wherever it wills. When we come to the meeting, we should forget about regulations and methods and let the Spirit occupy our being. If we are reading the Bible in the meeting, and a brother feels to stand up and read, he should do so. Some may say that if every saint does this, there will be chaos. If we would all stand up according to the leading of the Spirit, there would not be chaos.</p>
<p>When we are bound by the law, the spirit of the meeting is also bound. Our spirit should be free. When the brothers lead the Scripture reading, every saint should feel free to stand up to read. In this way the meeting will be living. Instead of forms, methods, or rules in our meetings, we should exercise our spirit, fellowship with the Lord, and be prepared to function. Not only should the brothers be prepared to function, but also the sisters should be prepared. There should not be set procedures in the meetings. The meetings should be entirely according to the leading of the Spirit. The meetings should always be different. We do not want methods, nor do we want chaos.</p>
<p>We do not need to use the same procedure to pray-read. There can be many ways to pray-read. Likewise, we do not always have to sing a hymn from the first stanza to the last stanza. We can sing only two stanzas or three stanzas. It may be that while we are singing, a brother stands up and reads a portion of the Scriptures. After he reads, everyone can continue singing. Sometimes a saint can stand up and share a testimony. Our meetings should not follow set rules; instead, everyone should follow the leading of the Spirit. We must all be according to the Spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE REALITY OF THE CHURCH AND OUR SPIRIT</h1>
<p>The reality of the church is in our spirit. This is a simple statement, yet it is very profound. The majority of Christians know the Holy Spirit, but they do not know the human spirit. The reality of the church is not only in the Holy Spirit but also in our spirit. If the reality of the church were only in the Holy Spirit, the church would be abstract and far away from us. The reality of the church must also be in our spirit in order for the church to be practical. The church as the reality is in your spirit and also in my spirit. It is in the spirit of every person who is saved, loves the Lord, and lives in his spirit. In relation to the reality of the church, Ephesians presents four main points concerning the human spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In order to have the reality of the church, we must be filled in our spirit with the Spirit of God. Human beings have a physical body, and they have a spirit within them. Our body needs water and at least three meals a day. Some people like to drink wine. When they drink too much wine, they become drunk. Ephesians 5:18 shows a contrast between being filled with wine and being filled in spirit. The first part of this verse says, &ldquo;Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness.&rdquo; This means that we should not fill our body with wine; that is, we should not allow our body to be filled with wine. The second part of the verse says, &ldquo;But be filled in spirit.&rdquo; This means that our spirit should be filled with God.</p>
<p>This word corresponds to other portions of the Bible that speak of God as our spiritual wine. In the Bible wine symbolizes God as the One who can quench our thirst, make us joyful, cause us to be excited, and give us power (Matt. 9:17). We should not be drunk with physical wine, but we should be filled with God. On the day of Pentecost the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit. Those who saw them said, &ldquo;They are full of new wine!&rdquo; (Acts 2:13).</p>
<p>God can fill us because God is Spirit. In His economy God was incarnated and came to the earth as our Redeemer, Jesus Christ. After His death and resurrection, as the last Adam, He became the life-giving Spirit. Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord as the Spirit can fill our inward being, just as air fills a container.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Way to Be Filled in Spirit</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Calling on the Lord&rsquo;s Name</h2>
<p>There is a simple way to be filled in spirit. Acts 2:17 says, &ldquo;It shall be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out of My Spirit.&rdquo; Verse 21 says, &ldquo;It shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo; God has poured out His Spirit, but how can we be filled with this Spirit? The way to be filled with the Spirit is to call on the name of the Lord: &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; In order for air to enter a room, we need to open the window. As soon as a window is open, air comes in. Likewise, in order for the Spirit to fill us, we need to open up the window of our being. The window of our being is more complicated than the window in a room. The window in a room has only one layer, but the window of our being has three layers. The first layer is our body. The way to open this layer is to open our mouth. When our mouth is open, our body is open. The second layer is the soul, or our heart. We have to open not only our mouth but also our heart. It is not enough to open only these two layers. There is a third layer, which is our human spirit. Our spirit also needs to be open. Sometimes when we call on the Lord, our mouth is open, but our heart is not open. In order to call on the Lord from the deepest part of our being, we must open our mouth, our heart, and our spirit.</p>
<p>Some do not agree with calling on the Lord. It is not a matter of whether or not we agree, because calling is just as necessary as breathing (Lam. 3:55-56). The most profitable exercise for our body is deep breathing; likewise, the most profitable exercise for our spiritual life is deep breathing. For the first ten years of my life as a Christian, I was a dumb believer. I was dumb even when I prayed. Gradually, I realized that it makes a difference whether a Christian prays audibly or inaudibly.</p>
<p>About forty years ago in Shanghai, someone asked Brother Nee what he should do in order to prevent himself from falling asleep when he prayed. Another person asked how to stop his mind from wandering when he prayed. Brother Nee replied, &ldquo;If you pray audibly, you will not fall asleep, and your mind will not wander.&rdquo; This is truly effective. Even if we are sleepy, we will not fall asleep when we pray audibly. Similarly, when we pray audibly, our mind does not wander. Hence, praying audibly is useful.</p>
<p>I discovered calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name in the Word. The Greek word for <em>call on</em> implies calling out with an audible voice or calling out loudly, just as Stephen did (Acts 7:59-60). Before Paul was saved, he persecuted Christians. He even received authority from the chief priests to bind those who called on the Lord&rsquo;s name (9:14; cf. v. 21). This indicates that he did not have to search a house in order to find and arrest the Christians. The Lord&rsquo;s disciples were callers; they called on the name of the Lord. Everyone knew that they called on the Lord&rsquo;s name. This is also the situation in the church in Los Angeles. More than two hundred saints live around the meeting hall, and all the neighbors know that the saints are believers, because from morning to night the saints always call, &ldquo;O Lord! Jesus is Lord! Hallelujah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s disciples called on the Lord&rsquo;s name because calling on the Lord is equivalent to breathing the Lord. When we call, &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; the Lord comes into us. This is the way to be filled with the Lord. The Lord has given us a very simple secret: we need only to call on His name in order to be filled with Him. However, when we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, we must allow Him to do a burning work within us. When we call on the Lord, He may touch a certain sin or something of the world in us, or He may touch the self. When He touches something, we must deal with it and confess it. This is the way to be filled with the Lord by calling on His name.</p>
<p>When we are filled with the Lord, we become the fullness of God (Eph. 3:19b). The Lord is the Spirit, and the Lord is God. Hence, to be filled with the Spirit is to be filled with the Lord, to be filled with the Lord is to be filled with God, and to be filled with God is to be filled with the riches of God unto the fullness of God. The result of our calling on the Lord is that we are filled with all that God is. In order to have the reality of the church, we need to be filled with all that God is. Many of us are not filled with God in our spirit. Some of us open our mouth when we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, and some do not. It is difficult to be filled in our spirit when we do not open our mouth to call on the Lord.</p>
<p>There is a difference in our experience between calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name and not calling. We should not think that it is all right for the young ones to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name but that this is not so proper for the older ones. Some may say that it is unbecoming for the saints who are professors or managers to call on the Lord when they come to the meeting. If we take care of outward appearances, we will not gain the Lord or have His fullness. Those who call on the Lord&rsquo;s name know that it is a great blessing to call on His name. If we are sad when we call, we become happy; if we are afraid, we become bold; and if we are in darkness, we receive light. When we call on the Lord, we must open up our mouth, our heart, and our spirit and call from deep within.</p>
<p>We cannot force anyone to call on the Lord. However, we can pray for him to open his mouth and call on the Lord. I would like to speak a frank word. We do not want calling to become a religion. When we call, we should take care of others. Once there was a group of saints singing while another group of saints stood beside them calling on the Lord. This made the meeting chaotic. Whether we call on the Lord or sing, we should take care of the meeting.</p><h2 class="head3">Pray-reading the Word</h2>
<p>Pray-reading the Word is another way to be filled in spirit (5:18-19; Col. 3:16). In the meetings we need to avoid the flavor of being noisy when we pray-read. It is good to release the spirit, but if we are loud, we will lose the flavor of prayer and of reading. Sometimes we may utter longer sentences in order to improve our pray-reading, but the sentences should not be too long. Sometimes we may utter three to five short sentences. In this way we will have a rich flavor when we pray-read.</p>
<p>We should avoid taking the easy way and being methodical. We should not turn a practice into a procedure. That is to follow rules. We need to exercise our spirit in order to avoid being methodical. Whether we are reading the Bible, pray-reading, or singing, we should avoid following a procedure. Instead, we should always open to the Lord and allow the Holy Spirit to flow freely. What we do must be in spirit, not according to the letter. We must have an open spirit, and we must be in spirit because the reality of the church is in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In order to have the reality of the church in our spirit, we must first be filled with God. When we are filled with God, our mind will be occupied with the Spirit, and we will be renewed in the spirit of our mind (Eph. 4:23). In order to have the reality of the church, we also need to put on the new man. When we are renewed in the spirit of our mind, we put on the church as the new man (v. 24) and live in the church. The new man is the church; hence, to put on the new man is to put on the church and to live in the church. When we have our living and walk in the spirit, we are in the church life. This is what the Lord desires to gain.</p>
<p>The Lord does not want merely a group of people who are saved and who pursue Him by reading the Bible, praying, and attending meetings. This will not satisfy His heart. We must be filled in our spirit with the Spirit and allow Him to occupy our whole being. This is the way that we are renewed in the spirit of our mind, and we put off our old manner of living, old society, and old relationships. This is also the way that we put on the new man, which is the church. The new man is a matter of our living. Hence, when we put on the new man, we are in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING THE DWELLING PLACE OF GOD IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>To have the reality of the church is to be the dwelling place of God in spirit (2:22). Our spirit is the dwelling place of God. This means that we are built together in spirit, not only in the Holy Spirit but even more in our human spirit, to be the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit. Then God will have a resting place on earth, and He will make His home in our hearts (3:17). Our living will be God&rsquo;s dwelling place, that is, His resting place. God is in heaven, but He is longing to gain a dwelling place on earth. When we are God&rsquo;s dwelling place, we will not be occupied with sins, nor will we love the world or care for our self. We will be built together in the new man to be a dwelling place of God in spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BECOMING THE ARMY OF GOD IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When we have the reality of the church, we will not only be God&rsquo;s dwelling place but also His army, and we will fight the spiritual warfare (6:10-20). This spiritual warfare will be fought in our spirit by means of all prayer and petition, taking the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God. We should pray at every time in spirit. This does not refer to praying for ordinary things but to spiritual warfare, that is, dealing with God&rsquo;s enemy with prayer and using prayer to deal with the authority of darkness. On the one hand, the church is God&rsquo;s dwelling place for Him to make His home, and on the other hand, the church is an army that fights for God in order to hasten the coming of His kingdom.</p>
<p>This is the reality of the church. This reality is Christ, and it is Christ being mingled with us. The reality of the church is our living together in spirit to become the dwelling place of God and the army of God. The reality of the church is entirely a matter of the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DROPPING METHODS AND REGULATIONS AND<br />
DOING ALL THINGS ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>May the Lord open our eyes to see that the reality of the church is in our spirit. We need to drop our procedures, methods, rituals, regulations, and practices. In our daily life we must live in the spirit and allow the Lord to be our person. Instead of following methods or ordinances in the meetings, every saint should function according to the Spirit. We do not need to sing first or to pray first or even to read the Bible first. When we read the Bible, we do not need to follow a particular method. All our activities should be in our mingled spirit. Then the Lord will be expressed, and He will gain a dwelling place and an army. This is what the Lord desires to gain today.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we should not read the Bible or pray. We should read the Bible with our spirit, and we should pray with our spirit. We must do everything in our spirit. Then our meeting life and our daily life will be one living rather than two detached lives. Our meetings will be the expression of our living. Then our meetings will not be a performance; they will be a testimony.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us, and may His precious blood cover us so that we learn to turn to our spirit and practice dropping everything old. If we exercise to live in our spirit in our daily life, everything we do in the meetings will be according to the Spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING IN SPIRIT, NOT IN LETTER</h1>
<p>As human beings, we are still in the old creation. We exercise to walk according to the spirit, but we are still in the old creation, and our spirit is not so strong. Consequently, it is easy for us to depend on methods. Even when we drop an old method, we look for a new method. Whether the method is old or new, it is nonetheless a method that we depend on and are reluctant to drop.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOLLOWING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>It is easy to adopt a method. Even though we have dropped the old methods, we adopt new methods, and as long as we depend on a method, it can become an ordinance. For example, calling on the name of the Lord loudly has become a popular method for exercising the spirit. Our meetings can be considered to be calling meetings. This seems to be our practice. We should not criticize this calling, because it is beneficial, just as it is beneficial for those who box to punch with their fists. However, a person who knows only how to punch will not be a skillful boxer. Our spirit is much more agile than our body, and the exercise of our spirit should not be limited to calling loudly.</p>
<p>The Spirit is like the wind that blows where it wills. Sometimes the wind is fierce, and at other times it is gentle. A hurricane can tear a steel roof off a house, but a gentle breeze is pleasant. Sometimes the wind blows from the south in the morning, from the north in the afternoon, and from the west or the east in the evening. Likewise, the Spirit blows as He wills.</p>
<p>We tend to take the easy way to release the spirit. We want the Spirit to blow from only one direction. It is not easy for us to follow the Spirit when He blows from different directions. Our spirit is not limited to calling loudly. The Spirit will not lead us to call only in this way in every meeting, including the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting. Calling loudly has become a method we use to exercise our spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit leads us in many ways. For example, in Psalms sometimes there is a cry of &ldquo;O Lord&rdquo; (35:17; 57:9). Some psalms are long, some psalms are short, and some psalms have a selah, which is a pause, a quiet interlude. This shows that the saints in the Old Testament expressed their inspiration in different ways. In the New Testament the believers prayed, praised, called on the Lord&rsquo;s name, and sang. We need to practice exercising our spirit in many ways. Calling loudly and short prayers of three to five words have become a regulation.</p>
<p>The Spirit blows where He wills. He can lead us to be loud, to cry, or to be quiet when we praise or pray. We must be freed from ordinances. We should not keep any ordinance when we sing the hymns. In the meetings we usually sing an entire hymn. After we sing a hymn, we also pray it. We do not need to follow a set procedure. We can pray a few phrases from a hymn before we sing it. After we sing one stanza, a brother or a sister may give a testimony. Then another saint may suggest that we sing the stanza again. After singing there may be further prayer. There is no need for us to wait until we sing the entire hymn before we pray. We can pray after singing one stanza, and we do not have to follow the lyrics of the hymn rigidly when we pray. We can use the lyrics to develop our prayer.</p>
<p>We are human beings; we are not robots. A robot is mechanical. We do not need to call on the Lord or call mechanically in the meetings. We do not need to be rigid. We were rigid with our old practice, and now we are rigid with the new practice. Formerly we were rigid in a dead practice, and now we are rigid in a living practice. After a period of time, however, being rigid in this way will become unbearable. May the Lord have mercy on us, and may we receive His mercy.</p>
<p>Some saints may say that we are Chinese and that our character is conservative. We should not be too considerate of ourselves or say that the Chinese character is conservative. If we hear that there will be an explosion, we will run for safety faster than anyone else. The Chinese people who went to the United States to mine gold were able to endure much hardship.</p>
<p>Within us there is a new life with a new nature. The Lord&rsquo;s Spirit dwells in our new spirit, but we limit the Lord. It is as if we are in a room with many windows, but we always open the same window. Today we open the window that faces east, and tomorrow we open the same window even though we could open any window. Since the wind does not blow from only one direction, we should open all the windows.</p>
<p>In whatever we do, we should be flexible; we do not need regulations. The churches should no longer have regulations. Every saint should be released. This does not mean that we practice anarchy. As long as the citizens of a country observe the law, no one interferes with their freedom. As soon as they commit a crime, however, the police enforce the law. This can be applied to our meetings. As long as the saints live in the spirit and walk by the spirit, there is freedom (2 Cor. 3:17). However, if anyone causes trouble in the meetings, the responsible ones should stop them.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM DEGRADATION</h2>
<p>Even though we are Christians, we are degraded in many ways. First, we are fallen by nature, and our spirit is deadened. We were born with a fallen nature, we grew up in a family with a fallen nature, and we live in a society with a fallen nature. We did not know how to use our spirit or how to fellowship with God. We have a fallen nature.</p>
<p>Second, Christianity is deformed and has become a religion without the Spirit and without life. In its practices, regulations, and system, Christianity is void of the Spirit. Whether or not we were in a denomination, we have been influenced by Christianity. Before we were Christians, we did not care for the things of the Lord, but now that we are Christians, we cannot escape the influence of Christianity. Whether consciously or unconsciously, we are influenced by the rituals, regulations, methods, organization, and even the atmosphere in Christianity.</p>
<p>Third, although we cannot say that there is no exercise of the spirit in our meetings, our exercise has decreased. We also lack a full understanding of the truth, even though our understanding of the truth is greater than our exercise of the spirit. Nevertheless, we have also developed methods and traditions.</p>
<p>These three aspects of degradation and oldness make it difficult for us to have a change of concept. If we want to be delivered from degraded concepts, from the influence of Christianity, and from our old situation, we need to be taken up to a &ldquo;high mountain,&rdquo; like the apostle John was, in order to see that God&rsquo;s economy, His redemption, His dealings with us, and His work on us are absolutely a matter of the spirit.</p>
<p>God has no intention to give us regulations and methods, which can only serve a temporary purpose. Circumcision in the Old Testament is a good example. God&rsquo;s focus was not on cutting off a piece of flesh. Circumcision is a picture of the New Testament believers&rsquo; need to deal with the flesh. This temporary matter in the Old Testament expressed a deeper truth in the New Testament. The Sabbath is another example. In the New Testament God is not interested in our keeping a special day. Whether or not we keep the Sabbath makes no difference. For this reason, when the Lord Jesus was on earth, He did not care for the Sabbath. God used the Sabbath to indicate that we must rest in Him. There are many examples in the Old Testament that bear New Testament significance.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CARING FOR THE SPIRIT AND REALITY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Head Covering</h2>
<p>There are several matters in the New Testament that God is not focused on, such as baptism, breaking bread, head covering, and foot-washing. These items should not be mere practices to us; rather, we should stress the spiritual reality behind them. God does not care whether or not there is a piece of cloth on the head of a sister. He does not care for this practice; rather, He uses it to indicate a spiritual reality. God does not care for ordinances, rituals, ceremonies, or practices. However, this does not mean that an outward practice is wrong. When a sister wears a head covering, she should remember that it is worthless if her head covering is merely outward. She needs to be in the reality of the experience of head covering. By itself, head covering is merely a sign. Let me illustrate. Suppose I am invited to dinner and served a delicious meal with beautiful dishes. The dishes are needed to serve the meal, but I have not been invited to eat the dishes. When I receive an invitation for dinner, I am not concerned about the dishes; I care for the meal. As long as I am fed, I will be happy. Whether the dishes are made of porcelain, gold, or wood does not matter to me, because I cannot eat them. My focus is on the food, which is the reality. In the same way God does not care whether or not a sister wears a head covering. He cares for the reality, which is the Spirit. Without the Spirit there is no reality. God cares only for the Spirit. This is the concept we need.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Baptism</h2>
<p>Baptism is another example. Some saints still regard baptism as a regulation. Their concept is that baptism is a procedure for a person to join the Christian religion or to be admitted into the church. They say that a person who is not baptized has not completed the procedure to join the church. This concept comes from Christianity. It is a pity that God&rsquo;s children have such a concept concerning an item of truth. As a result of this concept, they oppose a person&rsquo;s being baptized a second time in order to bury his oldness, because they think that being baptized a second time is against the truth. Although we cannot find a statement or an example in the Bible of a person being baptized a second time, there is the type of the children of Israel crossing the Red Sea and the river Jordan.</p>
<p>The New Testament ministry is of the Spirit, not of the letter (2 Cor. 3:6). The Old Testament says that we should keep the Sabbath (Exo. 20:8). A person who did not keep the Sabbath was stoned to death (Num. 15:32-36). However, Romans 14:5 and 6 say, &ldquo;One judges one day above another; another judges every day alike...He who regards that day, regards it to the Lord.&rdquo; The principle in the New Testament is that we should not criticize or despise one another.</p>
<p>The New Testament says, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them&rdquo; (Matt. 28:19), and &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved&rdquo; (Mark 16:16). These are clear statements. The New Testament does not state whether a person should be baptized only one time or several times. However, believers make baptism a regulation because they have the tendency to keep regulations. Needless to say, if baptism is regarded as a ceremony to join the church, it should be conducted only once. How can a believer join the church more than once? Baptism is not a ceremony to join the church. It is not easy for us to break away from this concept.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Quiet or Calling Loudly</h2>
<p>Worshipping quietly has become another regulation. Many saints prefer to be quiet in the meetings; they do not like to call loudly. This is a religious concept from Sunday worship in Christianity because a person who enters a chapel has to be quiet.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:1-2 says, &ldquo;Concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant. You know that when you were Gentiles, you were always being led away to dumb idols, whenever and however you were led.&rdquo; Before we were saved, we served dumb idols, and as a result, we were also dumb; that is, we did not speak. Dumb people worship dumb idols, and their worship is dumb worship. Now that we serve a speaking God, we must open our mouth and let our voice be heard. The concept of having quiet Sunday worship is a Christian tradition. Today the Lord is taking the way of recovery. May we all receive mercy to drop our ordinances.</p>
<h2 class="head1">METHODS IN OUR SERVICE</h2>
<p>We often want to use methods in our service. These methods are ordinances. The co-workers often ask me for methods. We do not want to base our service on methods. Even though it seems that we cannot do anything without a method, we need to give up and drop the methods.</p>
<p>It is difficult for us to come out of our fallen situation, because we are always looking for methods in whatever we do. It seems as though we do not care for anything other than having a method. Many saints want to visit the church in Los Angeles because they want to see if there are any good methods there. We should never bring a method back to our locality and expect the church to follow it. We must have a change in our concept. Our service is not a matter of methods but of the Spirit. The Lord is the Spirit, and our spirit is our most precious and valuable possession. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; Our service is altogether a matter of the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EMPHASIZING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>This does not mean that we do not use methods. In these meetings there are rows of benches. The sisters sit on one side, and the brothers sit on the other. We also have a podium with a microphone, and behind the podium is a blackboard. These items can be considered as methods, but we do not focus on them. Our main purpose is to have a training meeting so that the saints may learn to exercise and release their spirit and thereby grow in life. In order to meet this need, we have to put the benches in rows, prepare the microphone, and clean the blackboard, but we do not meet for these things. We can forget about them, but we must know our spirit. If instead of exercising our spirit, we focus on whether the writing on the blackboard is neat or whether the saints are sitting in an orderly manner, the cart is pulling the horse.</p>
<p>Some brothers may say that if we should give up methods, we do not need the elders and deacons anymore. Dropping methods does not mean that we do not need the elders and deacons. This is the age of the stars, and we should all be stars. Every saint can be a star. The elders will not stop the saints from being shining stars. We still need the elders and the deacons. If there are no elders and deacons, who will make arrangements for the meetings and who will give announcements? We thank the Lord that there are elders and deacons in the churches who make arrangements for the church and announce things. If the elders and deacons do not shine brightly, the saints should be strengthened and shine in their spirit.</p>
<p>May the Lord change our concept from emphasizing arrangements to emphasizing our spirit. This does not mean that we should reject or oppose arrangements. A person who is against outward things is not in the spirit. When a person is in the spirit, the outward things do not matter to him. The stars in the sky do not care whether the earth is flat or has valleys or whether the mountains are high or low. The stars care about whether they shine in the sky. The stars shine whether or not the earth is flat. Even if there is a storm, the stars still shine. Nothing affects them; they simply continue to shine. In the same way, we should not care for any methods or regulations; rather, we should care only for our spirit being strong, fresh, and living. We should transcend the earth and shine like a star. Others may be in darkness, but we shine forth light. No matter what the condition of the elders is, if a brother releases his spirit in a meeting, the sky will be clear, and the other saints will all begin to shine. Then that brother is a star. This is the age of the Spirit, and God cares for the Spirit. We should not focus on whether or not we should be quiet in a meeting or whether we should be baptized once or twice.</p>
<p>The ordinances belong to the Old Testament. Circumcision, keeping the Sabbath, and dietary regulations belong to the Old Testament, not the New Testament. When the Lord Jesus came, He did not keep the Sabbath. In Acts the Lord led Peter to give up the ordinance concerning dietary regulations. In the Epistles Paul put aside circumcision.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE UNCHANGEABLE PRINCIPLES</h2>
<p>There are some basic principles that cannot be changed. In the Old Testament the children of Israel were commanded not to bow down to idols, and in the New Testament we are charged not to worship idols. This commandment concerns God&rsquo;s person. There is a commandment against worshipping idols. We should not say that we will not keep this commandment because we are in the New Testament. Once we remove this item, we violate the Godhead.</p>
<p>One of the Ten Commandments says that we should keep the Sabbath, and another commandment says that we should not commit adultery. When the Lord Jesus came, He broke the commandment concerning keeping the Sabbath, but instead of abolishing the commandment related to adultery, He strengthened it. The Old Testament charges us not to commit adultery, but the Lord Jesus charges us not to have even a lustful thought (Matt. 5:27-28). When the Pharisees asked why Moses commanded them to give a certificate of divorce, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Moses, because of your hardness of heart, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so&rdquo; (19:7-8). Instead of abolishing the commandment concerning adultery, the Lord Jesus strengthened it.</p>
<p>When we read the Bible, we see that there is only one God; hence, man should not bow down to idols. Furthermore, God values man; hence, man should not commit adultery, murder, or steal. Since God values man, He does not allow anything that violates the basic rights of a human being. In the Old Testament God did not allow man to steal, and in the New Testament He does not allow man to steal. Fornication, stealing, extortion, and lying are not permitted among the children of God (1 Cor. 6:9-10; 5:9-11). These regulations were not abolished in the New Testament; instead, they are strengthened. God does not allow man to worship idols, because this offends His person, and He does not allow man to do anything that offends the rights of others. These two principles cannot be changed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, God never allows division among His children. For this reason, the New Testament says, &ldquo;A factious man, after a first and second admonition, refuse&rdquo; (Titus 3:10). God cares for the Body of Christ. God cares for Himself, man, and the church, which is the Body of Christ. God does not allow man to offend His person, to violate others&rsquo; rights, or to divide the Body of Christ. In the Old Testament God did not permit the children of Israel to establish a second worship center. They had only one center of worship, which was Jerusalem. God repeatedly charged the Israelites that when they entered the land of Canaan, they could not offer sacrifices and worship Him in the place of their choice; they had to go to the place designated by God (Deut. 12; 14&mdash;16). This was to keep the oneness among God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s person, man&rsquo;s rights, and the oneness of the church are three matters that we must not offend or change. Besides these three matters, God does not care for anything else. We must take care not to worship an idol, which offends God&rsquo;s person, not to commit a sin that violates others&rsquo; rights, and not to form a division, which causes the Body of Christ to suffer loss.</p>
<p>There is another condition that we must take care of; we should not go against an explicit statement in the Bible. If the Bible says that we should be baptized only once, we should adhere to this. If there is no such statement, it is not necessary to establish an ordinance. On which day should we break the bread? Acts 20:7 says, &ldquo;On the first day of the week, when we gathered together to break bread,&rdquo; but in Acts 2:46 the disciples met and broke bread every day. When they first came into the church, many saints in Taiwan broke bread every Lord&rsquo;s Day evening. For this reason, to break bread on Lord&rsquo;s Day evening has become an ordinance. It may be that we will change this practice and break bread on Saturday morning. This would train us not to keep any ordinances.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING BOUND BY ORDINANCES<br />
BUT BEING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us so that instead of being bound by rituals and ordinances, we would be in our spirit. If a sister feels burdened to cover her head, she should cover her head. If she covers her head but does not have the burden to do so, it has become an ordinance to her. If I feel that I would like to be baptized again in order to bury my oldness, others should not criticize me. We do not have any rituals or ordinances; we only have the spirit. There is no formality in our meetings. We should not say that it is correct to be quiet or that it is correct to be loud, nor should we say that it is correct to sing a hymn first, pray first, or give a message first. We know only to follow the Spirit. What matters is that we are in spirit, not in ordinances. In order to avoid chaos and not be bound by ordinances, we must learn to exercise our spirit. Then we will be free in the spirit and will be the one Body.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXERCISING THE SPIRIT IN OUR LIVING<br />
AND IN THE MEETINGS</h1>
<p>The Lord wants to lead us out of rituals, ordinances, doctrines, and methods. Therefore, we should follow the spirit and not methods. At present we still depend on methods. We have dropped an old method and turned to a new method. Thus, the nature of our meetings has not changed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEETINGS BEING THE EXPRESSION OF OUR LIVING</h2>
<p>A change in nature makes a change in concept, not a change from one method to another method but rather a change from methods to the Spirit. Whether we use an old method, a new method, a wrong method, or a right method, we are still using and depending on methods, not on the Spirit. We know that we are not depending on the Spirit, because in the meetings our spirit is not living; the condition of our meetings is not ideal. Some meetings may seem like a performance. Calling on the Lord and praising Him in order to have a released and uplifted spirit should be our living, not a performance. We should have a released and uplifted spirit not only when we are in the meetings. Hence, calling on the Lord and praising Him should be our daily practice.</p>
<p>It is easier to pray and call on the Lord&rsquo;s name in a meeting than to pray and call on His name in other places, such as on the street or in a bus. Our spiritual condition should match our living; they should be the same. Although it may not be suitable to call loudly upon the Lord&rsquo;s name when we are in a bus, we can still exercise our spirit. We can call softly, not loudly. If we spend our time looking around instead of fellowshipping with the Lord when we are in the meeting, our calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name will be a performance. This situation indicates that our meeting life is separate from our daily living. This is wrong. We truly need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to save us.</p>
<p>Since our meetings are the expression of our daily living, there is no need to consider which method we should use. Breathing is not a matter of method. We do not need to stand in a particular way in order to breathe, nor do we need to make a conscious effort to breathe. We breathe spontaneously in every place. However, in some places we can practice deep breathing, but in other places this is not suitable. Our meetings should be an expression of our daily living. Some Christians argue and fight in their daily life but are well behaved when they gather to worship. This is a performance. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we have a change in our concept. We are not changing methods; we are changing our concept.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOLLOWING THE SPIRIT IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>In the meetings we should not rely on any method but should follow the Spirit. It is not wrong to call loudly on the name of the Lord, but this kind of calling has become a new method. It seems as if we do not know how to pray anymore, because calling has replaced praying. Surely, this kind of calling is not exercising the spirit or following the Spirit. Does the Spirit lead us only to call in a loud way? Good music has a beautiful melody with high and low notes; it should not have only one note. We may be used to this kind of calling, but the new believers are not accustomed to the noise, and it is unpleasant. We need a change in concept.</p>
<p>Formerly, in our meetings we followed a routine and ordinances. Every week our meetings followed the same routine. We have condemned that way of meeting and put it to death. Now we are learning to follow the Spirit. However, while following the Spirit, we picked up the method of calling loudly. This is another method. Some saints said that without a method, they do not know what to do. To follow a method is to not follow the Spirit. The Spirit does not move like a train that follows tracks. The Spirit is like wind that blows where it wills (John 3:8). The wind may blow from the east in the morning, blow from the south in the afternoon, and be a whirlwind in the evening. The Spirit is like wind that has no set direction and no set method.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, in the New Testament age Christian meetings should not have any rules. The Bible does not say how Christians should meet, nor does it give rules for Christian meetings. We need to be led by the Spirit. When we do not know how to follow the Spirit, we pick up methods. The Baptist denomination has the Baptist method, the Presbyterian denomination has the Presbyterian method, the Methodist denomination has the Methodist method, and the Lutheran denomination has the Lutheran method. Every denomination has its method. We also have found a method. However, instead of following a method, we should live by the Spirit. Our meetings are not a performance; they are the expression of our daily living. We walk according to the Spirit in our daily life so that when we come to the meetings, we will continue to walk according to the Spirit.</p>
<p>If we live by the Spirit in our daily life by fellowshipping with Him, praising Him, and looking to Him, we will have inspiration in the meetings. The Spirit may lead a brother to say, &ldquo;Lord, we worship You!&rdquo; There is no need to wait for someone to call a hymn. When the brother says, &ldquo;Lord, we worship You!&rdquo; the meeting begins. Immediately another brother may say, &ldquo;Yes, Lord, You are truly worthy of our worship.&rdquo; Then spontaneously a sister may begin singing a hymn of worship, and everyone joins her. In this way, no specific person is designated to call a hymn or to open the meeting. After the singing, a brother might give a testimony, and another brother might read a few verses. Although our activities are different, we are following the Spirit.</p>
<p>This is the flow of the Spirit, and every saint should follow this flow. This can be compared to a team playing basketball. When one member begins playing, the rest of the team should be ready. When one person receives the ball, he should pass it to another person. There is no rule concerning who should pass and who should receive the ball.</p>
<p>In the meetings we tend to be strict when we pray the hymns; there is no flow, and the prayers are not connected. We do not listen to the prayers of the other saints. As a result, we do not water each other&rsquo;s spirit, and we cannot touch the supply of the Spirit by following the sense in our spirit.</p>
<p>In order to be saved from these shortcomings, we need to live in our spirit daily. Otherwise, instead of being able to participate in the meetings, we will be spectators. We will be like spectators in a basketball game who, because they do not practice with the team, cannot dribble, pass, or catch the ball. Some saints do not exercise their spirit regularly. They have proper conduct, love the Lord, and are concerned for the church, but they lack the exercise of their spirit. Such ones are like members in the denominations. Thus, they do not participate in our meetings, because in our meetings everyone must exercise their spirit to carry out their priestly ministry.</p>
<p>Some may say, &ldquo;I cannot play ball. If you force me to play, you will cause me to suffer. I can watch you and cheer you on, but do not force me to play.&rdquo; In the church life there are no spectators or observers; everyone must be a participant. Those who want to be spectators and not participate are bringing in the clergy-laity system because the saints who participate will become the clergy, and those who are spectators will become the laity. There should be no such distinction in the churches. We are all priests, and we all must participate in the meetings.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament a priest could not say, &ldquo;I will offer sacrifices, but please do not ask me to burn incense. I can bring the sacrifices for you to kill and skin, and I can carry them to the burnt-offering altar, but I cannot enter the tabernacle to burn incense. We each have our own function. Do not force me to do that service.&rdquo; It is true that we each have our own function, but there are some things that we cannot do for another person. For example, we cannot ask someone to drink water or to eat for us. Everyone has a service, such as sweeping the floor or dusting the window. However, we all need to breathe, drink, and eat for ourselves. When we meet, we come to eat and drink spiritually; hence, no one can participate on our behalf.</p>
<p>In the denominations it is not possible for everyone to participate in the preaching, praying, and singing, so there is the need for some to study in the seminaries in order to carry out these functions. Some study how to give sermons or how to preach the gospel, and some study music. A person who studies music will lead the singing in a denomination when he graduates. He cannot speak or visit the saints. This is not our way. The divine life within us is a priestly life, so we cannot say that we do not know how to serve. Any person who is saved has the capacity to serve, but his actual service depends on the daily exercise of his spirit. Therefore, we all need to diligently practice exercising our spirit.</p>
<p>We must not be idle in the meetings. Since we come to a meeting to function, when the meeting begins, we should be ready to function. Hence, we must be alert. If we are idle, it will be difficult to have a meeting.</p>
<p>Since the Lord does not lead us according to set rules or methods, we need to exercise our spirit daily in order to be living, and we need to live before the Lord. Furthermore, when we come to a meeting, we must be alert and ready to minister as priests by offering our portion of Christ at the opportune moment.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF MEETING IN FIRST CORINTHIANS</h2>
<p>The Bible does not give a definite way for Christians to meet, but it does say what the early Christians did in their meetings. In the entire New Testament, only 1 Corinthians 14 says something concerning how to meet. The Gospel of Matthew says that only two or three can be gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name (18:20). Acts speaks of the meetings of the believers, but it does not give the specifics of how they met. Only 1 Corinthians says something concerning how to meet.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Our Portion</h2>
<p>First Corinthians contains several basic points. The first basic point is that Christ is the allotted portion given to us by God (1:2). God has given Christ to us as our portion. When the children of Israel entered the land of Canaan, everyone was allotted a portion of the land. The Lord Jesus is our good land, and we have a share of the allotted portion (Col. 1:12). Hence, Christ is &ldquo;theirs and ours&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:2); He belongs to all the believers. He is our portion. God has made Christ, who is our portion, to be our power and our wisdom (v. 24). He also became our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (v. 30). He is our Passover (5:7), our foundation (3:11), and our spiritual food, spiritual water, and spiritual rock (10:3-4). Christ is also our Head (11:3). As our portion, He is our everything. Christ was the last Adam to be our Redeemer, and then He became the life-giving Spirit (15:45). Christ, who is our portion, is the Spirit who gives life to us. This is the first basic point in 1 Corinthians.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing the Spirit and Exercising Our Spirit</h2>
<p>The second basic point is that we must know and exercise our spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; We must be spiritual persons who walk in the spirit and live by the spirit. In 2:1 Paul says, &ldquo;I, when I came to you, brothers, came not according to excellence of speech or of wisdom.&rdquo; Then in verse 4 he says, &ldquo;My speech and my proclamation were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.&rdquo; The word <em>demonstration</em> indicates expression. Paul&rsquo;s speaking with the saints was not according to excellence of speech or persuasive words of wisdom. His speaking was a demonstration of the Spirit so that the Spirit would be manifested, expressed. Believers in the Pentecostal movement say that the Spirit is expressed when they speak in tongues. However, we need to combine 2:4 with 14:6, which says, &ldquo;Brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy or in teaching?&rdquo; By combining these two verses, we can see that the demonstration, or expression, of the Spirit does not refer to speaking in tongues but to clear, ordinary words. The Spirit is expressed in clear words.</p>
<p>The first main point in 1 Corinthians is that Christ is our portion, and the second point is that we should exercise our spirit in order to enjoy this Christ. For this reason, in our meetings we should do nothing but exercise our spirit in order to present the Christ we have enjoyed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Prophesying in the Meetings</h2>
<p>Christ being our portion and exercising our spirit in order to enjoy Christ as our everything are the main points in 1 Corinthians. These two main points should also be our living. What, then, should we do in the meetings? The meetings are for the exhibition of the Christ we have enjoyed in our living. In our daily life we exercise our spirit and enjoy Christ as our everything. Then in the meetings we exercise our spirit as a demonstration of the Spirit. When we exercise our spirit to present the Christ whom we have enjoyed to the saints, we are prophesying. In 1 Corinthians prophesying does not refer to predicting but to speaking for the Lord.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 1:2 says that Christ is theirs and ours. He is the last Adam who became the life-giving Spirit (15:45), and we have been joined to Him as one spirit (6:17). We do not need to go to heaven in order to be joined to Him. After His ascension, He descended in order to be joined to us in our spirit. Christ is in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). Hence, we can experience Him in our daily living when we exercise our spirit, and we can release our experiences of Christ with our spirit when we come to the meetings. This is very simple. This is what it means to prophesy, to speak for Christ. Since prophesying is so easy, we all can prophesy. However, we should not have long-winded speeches. We should be brief so that everyone has an opportunity to speak.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT IN OUR DAILY LIVING<br />
AND USING OUR SPIRIT IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>We need to be delivered from the influence of degraded Christianity. Then it will be easy to live the Christian life as well as to meet. It will be an ordinary thing for us to love the Lord, fellowship with Him, and live in our spirit. The Lord is our portion. He is the Spirit who lives in our spirit, and we exercise our spirit to contact Him. This is the way to have experiences of Christ. Then when we come to a meeting, our spirit will be living and released, and we will be ready to speak concerning our experience of Christ. If every saint would do this, our meetings would be rich. We can also use the Bible and our hymnal to receive inspiration and speak in the meetings. It is easy for our meetings to be fresh and rich.</p>
<p>Although the Christian life is a mystery, it is not difficult to comprehend. We need a change in concept. Once our concept is changed, our meetings will be different. We love the Lord, but we are still influenced by Christianity. I am burdened to pull the saints out of the influence of Christianity.</p>
<p>We are saved, and we love the Lord and pursue Him. Hence, we should daily use our spirit to call on Him and to contact Him. When we call, &ldquo;O Lord,&rdquo; we will experience Him. We can prove this in our experience. Our Lord is not a doctrine, nor is He nebulous. He is real and practical, and He is living in us. Not only so, He has given us the Bible, which contains His words. These words are not doctrine; they are spirit and life. If we pray-read these words regularly, we will touch and enjoy Him. Then every day and all day long we will have many experiences of the Lord.</p>
<p>If we practice touching the Lord every day, our spirit will be fresh and living. When we come to the meeting, our spirit will be ready, uplifted, and released. When our spirit is exercised, it will be released and manifested. Our spirit is manifested so that we can display the Christ we have experienced. When fifty to sixty saints display their portion of Christ, they supply one another, and the meeting is very rich. Then when we pray, praise, sing hymns, and pray-read, the meeting will be rich and fresh. There will be no need to follow old procedures or always have a message. In such a fresh and living meeting, we pave the way for the Lord to move.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING OUR SKILLS IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Our present need is to practice, and this is a matter of learning skills. Everything we do requires skill. On the one hand, in our daily life we need to live by the spirit by enjoying the Lord and experiencing Him. On the other hand, in the meetings we need to coordinate with others in our singing, praising, testifying, and pray-reading. In the meetings we need to function as a team. For this reason, we need to learn some skills. When someone is praying, I should refrain from praying. When no one is praying, I should release a prayer. When I hear another voice, I should stop. When he stops, I should continue from where he left off in a meaningful way. When we sing and pray the hymns, sometimes we can proceed sequentially from one stanza to the next, sometimes we can skip a stanza or two, and sometimes we can select certain stanzas. These matters require skill. When we pray over a stanza, there should be continuity in our prayer and the release of our spirit. Moreover, our voice should not be so loud that it hurts others&rsquo; ears or so soft that others cannot hear us. We need to take care of these matters. We should not be indifferent. Whatever we do needs skill. Without the proper skills, we cannot do a good job. Hence, we need to practice.</p>
<p>If we are willing to practice regularly, over time we will become skilled, and gradually our spirit will be able to flow where the Spirit wills. When the practice of exercising our spirit in the meetings is built up among us, it will become our family tradition, and it will be easy for new believers to join us. A child who is born into a Chinese-speaking family does not need a Chinese teacher to teach him the Chinese language; the child spontaneously learns to speak Chinese. Pray-reading has not yet been built up among us; hence, we must continue to practice. We have thrown away the old way of meeting, but if we are not able to build up the skill of using our spirit, we will be in a state of suspension. Some old things are gone, but new things have not been built up in their place. Of course, we do not want the old way, but we need to quickly learn the new way of doing everything according to the Spirit.</p>
<p>Doing things according to the Spirit is not an individual matter. All the serving ones must rise up and practice. When the serving ones are skilled, they can lead the whole church to practice in small groups. Gradually this practice of worshipping in the spirit will be established and become the practice in the churches.</p>
<p>We truly need to make this turn. Otherwise, we will limit the Lord. If we do not let the Lord work out this way among us, He will work it out with another group of people. The age has turned. If we let the Lord move among us, we will be blessed. However, if we do not let the Lord move, He will find another group of people. The Lord will take His way. He will not continue in the situation of Christianity any longer, nor will He allow the situation of oldness among us to continue.</p>
<p>Hence, we must endeavor to change our concept. In our daily living we must exercise our spirit to experience Christ. We must also endeavor to practice our skills in the meetings. We should look to the Lord and ask Him to give us the patience to practice. As believers, we are priests, and we need to learn how to serve and how to meet.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WORSHIP OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL<br />
IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h1>
<p>Let us read some verses in Psalms that describe the children of Israel on their way to worship God in Jerusalem. &ldquo;We walked with the throng in the house of God&rdquo; (55:14). &ldquo;I rejoiced when they said to me, / Let us go to the house of Jehovah&rdquo; (122:1). &ldquo;I passed through with the throng; / I led them to the house of God / With the voice of a joyous shout and praise, / The festal multitude&rdquo; (42:4). &ldquo;Make a joyful noise to Jehovah, all the earth. / Serve Jehovah with rejoicing; / Come before His presence with joyful singing. / ...Enter His gates with thanksgiving, / His courts with praise; / Give thanks to Him; bless His name&rdquo; (100:1-2, 4). &ldquo;I will come into Your house with burnt offerings; / I will pay my vows to You&rdquo; (66:13). &ldquo;Bring an offering, and come into His courts&rdquo; (96:8). The condition of the children of Israel in the Psalms was better than the condition of our meetings. We must confess that we are in degradation because the condition of our meetings is not as good as that of the children of Israel on their way to worship God in the holy temple.</p>
<p>While the children of Israel were on their way to keep the feasts and worship God, they were not silent. They were rejoicing, shouting, and praising. They went up in throngs, rejoicing and praising all the way. &ldquo;I led them to the house of God / With the voice of a joyous shout and praise&rdquo; (42:4). That was a joyous situation. Hence, while we are on our way to the meetings, we should sing hymns or call on the Lord&rsquo;s name. We should not be silent and wait to begin our &ldquo;performance&rdquo; in the meeting hall. We must have a living in which we sing in our homes, sing on the way to the meeting, and sing while we enter the meeting hall. If the children of Israel worshipped God in this way, we should do the same, if not more. Otherwise, we have fallen from God&rsquo;s standard. There are many Christians in Taipei who attend meetings or services on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. But none sing joyfully on the street or call on the Lord&rsquo;s name. This is a fallen situation.</p>
<p>The children of Israel rejoiced to go to the temple of Jehovah. They went up in throngs, and some would lead with shouts of joy and praise. Psalm 100:2 says that we should &ldquo;serve Jehovah with rejoicing; / Come before His presence with joyful singing.&rdquo; <em>Joyful singing</em> implies singing with exultation. As they were going toward Mount Zion in Jerusalem, the children of Israel were exulting, rejoicing, shouting, and singing; they were beside themselves. In the church in Taipei there are at least two to three thousand saints who meet on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. It would be wonderful if these two to three thousand saints were rejoicing and singing on their way to the meeting. When only one person is singing, the sound is not loud, and the effect is minimal. However, it would be glorious for throngs of saints to call, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; and &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! Visit the people in Taipei!&rdquo; and to sing, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the life, life, life that makes us want to shout, / Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!&rdquo; As we are on our way to the meeting, we should be praising and exulting. Then there would be no need for us to follow any methods in the meetings, because everyone&rsquo;s spirit would come forth.</p>
<p>We cannot say that the children of Israel received more grace than we have. We have received much grace. Therefore, as Psalm 100:4 says, we should &ldquo;enter His gates with thanksgiving, / His courts with praise.&rdquo; The Israelites went in throngs to the house of God, and some led with shouts of praise. They rejoiced and entered into the presence of God with singing. When we compare our situation with theirs, we are short of such praising.</p>
<p>Psalm 66:13 says, &ldquo;I will come into Your house with burnt offerings; / I will pay my vows to You,&rdquo; and Psalm 96:8 says, &ldquo;Bring an offering, and come into His courts.&rdquo; According to these verses, the Israelites were not empty-handed when they worshipped God. They brought an offering with them. We also should bring an offering with us to the meetings. Our offering is Christ. We should bring Christ with us to the meetings. We should ask ourselves whether this is our situation. Subconsciously, we feel that our going to a meeting is for the purpose of listening to a sermon. Hence, we do not practice living in our spirit, nor do we express the spirit on our way to the meeting. As a result, we have no choice but to do things according to a method. The old method was to be silent, and the new method is to either call a hymn or call on the Lord. Whatever method we follow, however, is merely a performance because it is not the move of the Spirit.</p>
<p>We are attending these meetings in order to be trained. However, I am afraid that some saints merely want to hear some messages and learn a method. My method is to cause the saints to go before the Lord. The co-workers and elders need to go to the Lord and ask for His mercy. We have many methods, but our spirit does not move. We say that we have changed, but only our method has changed; we have not changed. We do not know how to use our spirit. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p>
<p>The Lord has revealed His way to us. We need to be rescued out of Christianity and out of our old ways. The Lord wants us to take the way of daily living in our spirit so that we enjoy and experience all the riches of Christ. Then we will become normal people who live a proper life, and our meetings will be the outflow of our living; there will be no ordinances, methods, rituals, or rules in our meetings; our spirit will be strong and living; and we will have the riches of Christ. Furthermore, instead of waiting until we are in the meeting hall to begin the meeting, we will begin meeting while we are still at home. When we arrive at the meeting hall, we will still be in our spirit. We will display Christ by offering Him to God and supplying Him to others, and we will also enjoy Him. This is our way, and this is the real worship in spirit and in reality. This is what it means to worship in our spirit and in Christ as the reality (John 4:24). When we exercise our spirit to bring Christ as an offering to God and as a supply to others, we will be full of enjoyment. This is the worship that God desires. This is the purpose of our meetings.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">MEETING AND WORSHIPPING</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BEARING RESPONSIBILITY IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>It is not easy to change the atmosphere in the churches, because we have been entrenched in old concepts for many years. Our need is to change our concept. We are not aware of the influence Christianity has upon us. For example, every believer has the concept that they should attend a worship service. They may not use the phrase <em>worship service,</em> but they have this concept. They also have the concept that a worship service consists of singing hymns, praying, listening to the Scriptures, and listening to a sermon. If we do not drop this concept, every change that we make will be superficial. For example, we can paint a podium a different color. Even though the color has changed, the nature of the podium has not changed. It seems as though we still want a meeting with singing, praying, reading the Scriptures, and one person giving a message. Hence, when we encourage everyone to participate by calling and pray-reading, we still may be changing only our method.</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the influence of Christianity we do not bear responsibility in the meetings. We know that there will be some brothers to lead the meeting. Therefore, we do not come to the meeting with a sense of responsibility. Our meetings should not be led by some designated brothers. If anyone is designated to lead the meeting, it should be everyone. All the brothers and the sisters who come to the meeting should bear responsibility for the meeting. If we all have the attitude that others should bear the responsibility for the meeting, our meetings will have no impact.</p>
<p>We subconsciously have the concept that Christians do not have to bear any responsibility when they meet. Christians in the denominations have pastors who bear the responsibility for the meetings. We also have brothers, such as elders or co-workers, who bear the responsibility for our meetings. When we go to a district meeting, there are brothers who bear the responsibility. I would advise the responsible ones in the districts not to sit on the first row; instead, they should sit on the last row. If the brothers and sisters do not function, the responsible brothers should not function in their place. If the responsible brothers resign, the meetings will still continue. The meetings are not for the responsible brothers. The meetings are for all the saints. Hence, the elders and co-workers should sit in the back rows. At the end of the meeting an elder can go to the front and give the announcements. The meeting is the responsibility of the saints, not the elders.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRISTIANS FUNCTIONING MAINLY IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>The concept that we attend a meeting but are not responsible for the meeting is a fundamental error. It is a ploy of Satan to render the members of the Body of Christ useless so that they cease to function. As members of the Body, we function mainly in the meetings (1 Cor. 14:26). We should never think that we have a &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; function, such as sweeping the floor, cleaning the windows, or visiting the saints, that excuses us from functioning in the meetings. These are good services, but they are not our main function. Our main function is to offer up our portion in the meetings. The main function of the members of a basketball team is to play basketball, not to run errands or buy sports shoes. Running errands and buying shoes cannot compare to playing basketball. As Christians, we are members of Christ, and our most important service is to meet. The meetings are the best opportunity for us to exhibit Christ. As Christians, we are commissioned to exhibit Christ in the meetings. If our meetings do not exhibit Christ, they are a failure. Whether a local church is strong or weak depends on its meetings. If the meetings are good, the church is strong, but if the meetings are poor, the church is weak. We overlook the importance of the meetings because we have been blinded by Satan.</p>
<p>Some believers are blinded to the extent that they are indifferent toward the meetings. They think that it is good enough to fear God, love the Lord, fellowship with Him, and love others. This kind of attitude is a proof of the success of Satan&rsquo;s scheme. Everything that a Christian does on earth is for the cultivation of the meetings. A basketball team exists to play basketball. If there were no basketball games, there would be no need to have a basketball team. Similarly, if there are no meetings, there is no need to have the church. The church exists for the meetings. Our concept needs to be changed. We must understand that the meetings are the main place for Christians to function.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MEETINGS BEING AN EXHIBITION<br />
OF OUR CHRISTIAN LIVING</h2>
<p>The way we function in the meetings depends on the way we live our life. First Corinthians says that Christ is the portion given to us by God (1:2), and Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God (v. 24), who became righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us (v. 30). He is everything to us. Christ is the First and the Last. He is the first One raised from among the dead, and He is also the last Adam (15:20, 45). He is also the second man (v. 47). After He accomplished redemption, He became the life-giving Spirit so that we may be joined to Him as one spirit (v. 45; 6:17). Now we are learning to live by our mingled spirit. Our living is to experience and enjoy Christ in our spirit. This is to live by our spirit. Our meetings are an exhibition of this living. Christian meetings are the exhibition of our Christian life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEETINGS NEEDING A STRONG SPIRIT<br />
AND HAVING CHRIST AS THE CONTENT</h2>
<p>The meetings are an exhibition of our living when we use a strong spirit to exhibit the Christ we have experienced. Christ is the &ldquo;harvest&rdquo; that we exhibit. Hence, we must pay attention to two important points: our spirit must be strong, and Christ must be our content. We need a released spirit, and we must be filled with the riches of our experience of Christ. This is a basic principle.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 2:1-2 shows how Paul was among the Corinthians: &ldquo;I, when I came to you, brothers, came not according to excellence of speech or of wisdom, announcing to you the mystery of God. For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s speech and proclamation were &ldquo;not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power&rdquo; (v. 4). He did everything according to the expression and demonstration of the Spirit. His speech was simple, not eloquent, but it expressed the Spirit. His speaking was the expression and demonstration of the Spirit and of power.</p>
<p>When Paul was with the Corinthians, his spirit was strong, but his speech was not eloquent, nor did he express human wisdom. When he opened his mouth, his spirit came forth. He did not express eloquence, literary attainments, or philosophy; rather, he demonstrated his spirit. The content of the demonstration of his spirit was not mathematics, science, or philosophy; it was Christ. Christ was Paul&rsquo;s content. This should be a pattern for our meetings.</p>
<p>When Paul was with the Corinthians, he demonstrated a strong spirit, and Christ was his content. In the same principle, we should have a strong spirit, and Christ must be our content in our meetings. Our spirit must be strong, and it is released through our speaking. The content of our speaking should not be stories about our daily affairs, nor should we relate how gracious God has been to us or how we have received His care. The content of our speaking should be Christ, the mystery of God. We should minister Christ with a strong spirit. This is the meaning of prophesying. Our speaking in the meetings is to exhibit, to display, the Christ we have experienced. In this way we present Him as our offering to God and, at the same time, supply Him as food to others. Furthermore, we also enjoy Him. This is the meaning of prophesying.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROPHESYING NEEDING A STRONG SPIRIT<br />
AND HAVING CHRIST AS THE CONTENT</h2>
<p>To prophesy is to declare Christ with human words. It is to speak forth Christ as the mystery of God. According to chapter 14, the most important matter in a Christian meeting is to prophesy. Prophesying is the most important element in the Christian meeting. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.&rdquo; Verse 12 says, &ldquo;Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church.&rdquo; Prophesying is the gift that builds up the church. Verses 23 through 25 say that if an unbeliever is present in our meetings and we speak in tongues, he will say that we are insane because he cannot understand us, but if an unbeliever is present and we all prophesy, he will be convicted and examined by all. Furthermore, he will worship God and declare that God is among us. Verse 31 says, &ldquo;You can all prophesy one by one.&rdquo; The above verses show that prophesying is the main activity in the Christian meeting.</p>
<p>In order to prophesy, our spirit must be strong, and Christ must be the rich content of our speaking. These two matters&mdash;a strong spirit and Christ as the content&mdash;are the conditions for prophesying. We should prophesy whenever we meet.</p><h2 class="head1">PRESENTING OFFERINGS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>Christians meet for the expression and exhibition of Christ. Although we say this, we still want to attend a Sunday service and listen to a sermon. According to our natural concept, the purpose of a Christian meeting is to worship God quietly and listen to a sermon. This is what religion teaches. Christians go to a chapel to render such worship to God, and then a pastor gives a sermon with some teachings. This is the practice in religion. It is not what God desires.</p>
<p>The types in the Old Testament show the worship that God desires. Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible, the Pentateuch. The main content of these books concerns how to worship God. Moses did not say that to worship is to kneel down and prostrate oneself. He did not use such terms in his books. Rather, he said that worshipping God consists of presenting offerings. When we worship God, we should bring offerings to God so that He can enjoy the offerings with us. This is worship. The offerings are types of Christ. Hence, the worship that God wants from us is for us to exhibit Christ. When we all bring Christ, we worship God.</p>
<p>Three times a year in the Old Testament, at the Feast of the Passover, the Feast of Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles, the children of God gathered together before God and worshipped Him. They did not worship for an hour. They worshipped for seven to eight days. Their worship was based on God&rsquo;s commandment, that is, His ordination, His requirement. God did not say, &ldquo;When you worship Me, prepare your heart and be somber and full of sincerity. When you come to My temple, you should be quiet and prostrate yourselves before Me.&rdquo; There are no such commandments in the Pentateuch or in any other books of the Bible. In the Pentateuch Moses said that the children of Israel had to bring offerings when they worshipped God. They could not appear before God empty-handed (Deut. 16:16).</p>
<p>The offerings were the produce of the land of Canaan. Some Israelites brought offerings from the herd or the flock, some brought grains, some brought fruit, and some brought new wine, oil, or flour. These were the produce of the land of Canaan. In order to gain the produce of the land, the Israelites had to labor on the land of Canaan for at least a year. They had to till the land, plant seeds, turn the soil, and water the plants, or they had to tend cattle. Eventually, there was a harvest. The Israelites put aside one-tenth of their harvest. This was the best portion of the land. When it was time for the Feast of the Passover, the Feast of Pentecost, or the Feast of Tabernacles, they brought the best portion of the land to God (12:17-18; 14:23).</p>
<p>God does not want us to worship Him by praying somber prayers, bowing down, or even being quiet. He wants us to bring offerings of Christ to Him. After we bring our offerings, we still need to learn how to offer them. We need to learn how to offer Christ as the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, the trespass offering, the wave offering, and the heave offering. Some portions of the offering are for us to enjoy, some portions are to be enjoyed with the other saints, and some portions are for God to enjoy. When we bring our offerings and enjoy them in this way, God is satisfied, others are satisfied, and we are also satisfied. This is our worship to God. The worship that God wants is for us to offer Christ to Him.</p>
<p>God does not want us to devoutly sing a hymn of praise and kneel before Him. This is a religious ritual. God does not want it. God wants Christ from us. Christ is our good land. We should regularly labor on Him. As long as we labor on Christ, we will have experiences of Christ. Then when we come to a meeting, we should bring our experiences of Christ&mdash;the produce of the good land&mdash;for God to enjoy, for others to be supplied, and for us to be satisfied. In this way, we enjoy Christ together with others before God, and we also enjoy Christ together with God. Thus, God has the worship that He desires.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WORSHIPPING IN THE NEW TESTAMENT<br />
BEING IN SPIRIT AND TRUTHFULNESS</h2>
<p>To prophesy is to use our living, strong, and fresh spirit to speak forth the Christ we have experienced. Religion may not consider this to be worship, but this is true worship to God.</p>
<p>In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.&rdquo; <em>Truthfulness</em> denotes Christ, and <em>in spirit</em> refers to our strong, fresh, and living spirit. The Lord Jesus said that true worship is in our spirit and in truthfulness. God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must do so in spirit, not in the Holy Spirit but in their human spirit. They must also worship in truthfulness, which is the Christ they have experienced. This does not refer merely to singing hymns or to praising, much less to bowing down or kneeling. It is entirely a matter of having a strong spirit to exhibit Christ. This is worship.</p>
<p>It seems as though Paul did not say much concerning worshipping God, but the prophesying he spoke of is true worship. The worship that God desires is for us to bring our experience of Christ so that both God and man can be satisfied. God desires that His Son would be appreciated among men. This is one of the commissions that the church has on earth. The church must display Christ for others to appreciate. The more people there are who appreciate Christ, the more God is satisfied. This is the way to worship God.</p>
<p>Our meetings do not emphasize singing, praising, praying, giving a sermon, or listening to a sermon, because God wants us to appreciate Christ. In our meetings we display Christ with the demonstration of the spirit by prophesying. This is the principle of our meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Since our meetings are the exhibition of our daily living, they are based on our living and supported by our living. Our meetings should not differ from our daily living; they should match each other. We should daily live in our spirit, exercise our spirit, and use our spirit to contact Christ who is the Spirit. When we fellowship with Him, experience Him, and enjoy Him, we will have rich experiences of Christ. Then when we come to the meetings, our spirit will be strong, released, uplifted, and fresh, and we will be able to sing, pray, testify, or read the Bible. Whatever we do should be in our spirit. In such a demonstration of our spirit, the content of our speaking will be the Christ we have experienced. This is our speaking for Christ, our prophesying.</p>
<p>Our present need is to have a change in concept. We also need the skills that enable us to function with others. We need to be trained so that we know when to call loudly and when to be quiet. As soon as we hear another person speaking, we should listen. When a person speaks, he should speak clearly so that others can hear him. These points require practice. We should be flexible in our practice; otherwise, we will have a method, a regulation.</p>
<p>We can no longer depend on the methods we used in the past. A method deals with only one need, but there are many needs in a meeting. We must open to the Lord in every meeting and not follow the procedures we used in the past. In order to do this, we must practice. If we want to follow the Lord in this age, we must have a change in concept and learn the skills that are needed in order to meet in spirit and in truthfulness.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIFE BEING A MATTER OF THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE BEING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Lord came so that we may have life (John 10:10). If He had become flesh and died on the cross as the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world without becoming the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), He would have been able to redeem us, but He would not have been able to give us life. After His death and resurrection, the Lord stood in the midst of His disciples in the evening of His resurrection, and He breathed into His disciples and said to them, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (John 20:22). The Spirit gave them life. Life is a matter of the Spirit. The Lord said, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life;...the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (6:63). The Lord is the Spirit who gives us life, and His words, the words in the Bible, are spirit and life.</p>
<p>We should not receive the Bible as a book of teaching. The words in the Bible convey the Spirit. The Lord is the Spirit, and the words in the Bible are spirit and life so that we may have life. The Lord became the Spirit to give us life, and when we receive His word into us, it becomes the Spirit to give us life.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 15:45 says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; <em>The last Adam</em> refers to the Lord as the Lamb of God, as the Redeemer, and as a man. As the last Adam, the Lord redeemed us. Then He became a life-giving Spirit. Redemption is a procedure, and its goal is to give us life. We receive life when we receive the Spirit, because it is the Spirit who gives life. Romans 8:2 combines the Spirit and life and speaks of the Spirit of life. The life we receive from the Lord is altogether in the Spirit.</p>
<p>It is in this life that we are being saved in our daily living. Eternal salvation, which refers to our being saved from God&rsquo;s punishment, from perdition, and from the lake of fire, is accomplished through the redemption of the Lord Jesus on the cross. However, we need to be saved daily in our living by the Lord&rsquo;s life. Our daily salvation is through the Lord&rsquo;s life and in His life. We are not only saved in His life, but we also reign in His life (Rom. 5:10, 17) until all our actions are in newness of life (6:4). Hence, we should walk in the Spirit and by the Spirit (Gal. 5:25).</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE BEING NOT SELF-CULTIVATION BUT FRUIT-BEARING</h2>
<p>Even though we have followed the Lord for many years, we need a fresh view of the divine life because in our concept life is something outward. We do not have a deep appreciation of life being a matter in the Spirit. Our outward changes are not life. The changes we help others make are not life. For example, a brother with a bad temper, who regularly attends the meetings, listens to messages, and contacts the saints, will spontaneously be influenced to improve his temper. This desire to improve his temper is not life; it is the cultivation of his character. It is the issue of being in an atmosphere of spending time before the Lord, fellowshipping with the Lord, and reading His Word. Such an atmosphere naturally subdues his anger so that he does not readily vent his anger. However, this is not life. This is the result of an outward influence on the cultivation of his character.</p>
<p>Life is in our spirit, where the Spirit of life dwells. The Lord is the Spirit, and the Spirit is life. This life is in the deepest part of our being; hence, we need to call on the Lord and breathe His Spirit. This is the life that subdues our anger. Even if everything in our environment is provoking us to anger, the anger vanishes when we call, &ldquo;O Lord! Amen!&rdquo; This is life.</p>
<p>If we are still focused on helping others to improve their behavior and their character, we have not seen that life is entirely a matter of the Spirit; it has nothing to do with outward things. When we receive life, there is a result. Although the result may be visible, it is an expression of the life within us.</p>
<p>We have been speaking concerning this truth for more than twenty years, but we have still not entered into the reality of this truth. We are still helping others, correcting others, and advising them to improve. This is the cultivation of character. This is also the reason that in recent years we have rarely given messages concerning outward matters related to improvement or cultivation of character. We must speak concerning the Spirit. There is no need for us to speak of outward changes, because they are not life.</p>
<p>As members of the Lord who serve Him for the testimony of His church, our urgent need is the divine life. May the Lord have mercy on us and give us a vision of life. Life is not outward, nor is life an activity. Life is the Spirit. Life is the Lord lived out of us. In all the churches we must turn away from methods and turn to life so that we lead and supply the saints in life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRAY-READING BEING THE EASIEST WAY<br />
TO ENJOY THE LORD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">READING THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD WITH AN OPEN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Pray-reading is the easiest way to enjoy the Lord. Hence, when we read the Bible, we need an open spirit. We should not care for our past experiences of the Lord or for doctrines. Rather, we should pray over the words we read. This kind of prayer is simple, brief, genuine, and fresh. We should not use old, stale words, nor should we ponder or wait. We can simply take the words in the Bible as the words for our prayer, praying with the words in the Bible.</p>
<p>For example, Romans 8:2 says, &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.&rdquo; We can use this verse to pray, &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me. Here is a law, and this law is the law of the Spirit of life. This is life, this is the Spirit, and this is also a law. Praise the Lord.&rdquo; When we pray with an open spirit in this way, we touch the Lord with our spirit through the words of the Bible, and we pave the way for the Holy Spirit to operate within us. When we pray-read with other saints in this way, they become inspired and pray according to their inspiration. We can even repeat one another&rsquo;s prayer in order to be enlivened. When we pray in this way, our prayers will always be fresh, because we use different portions of the Bible and pray with the words that we read. Even if we come to a verse that we do not understand, we can still use it for our prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEING IN THE WORD,<br />
AND THE LORD&rsquo;S WORDS BEING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>This new way of reading the Bible is very effective because the Lord is in the words of the Bible, and the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit and life (John 6:63). The Holy Spirit and the Lord&rsquo;s words are mingled together (Eph. 6:17). Hence, by praying over the Word, we can touch the Spirit through prayer. When we pray-read the Word, our spirit is mingled with the Spirit. Pray-reading is not for knowledge or doctrine, nor is it to pray for something or for someone. Pray-reading is to open our spirit to touch the Lord&rsquo;s words so that we can touch the Spirit and gain the Lord.</p>
<p>When we touch the Lord&rsquo;s word through pray-reading the Word, the Holy Spirit, our spirit, and the Lord&rsquo;s words are mingled together, and we enjoy the Lord. We do not need to pray according to our old ways, according to what we were taught, or according to our knowledge. We should simply open the Bible and open our spirit to read two or three verses. Then we can pray over what we read, that is, use the words we read to pray. While we pray-read, the Holy Spirit will operate and express His thoughts within us. When we pray-read corporately, the Holy Spirit will operate within all the saints who are pray-reading, and they will be inspired to continue to pray. This inspiration is a response within the saints to one another. As we continue to practice, our pray-reading will become rich, and we will touch the Lord and enjoy Him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">CORPORATE PRAY-READING</h1>
<h2 class="head1">FOCUSING ON A FEW POINTS</h2>
<p>There are several points that require our attention when we pray-read corporately. First, our spirit needs to be stirred up. Just as every member in a basketball team is stirred up and ready to play, our spirit must be stirred up and ready to move when we come to a meeting. We are not merely attending a meeting. We must practice coming to the meeting with a spirit that is stirred up. When a basketball game begins, the players do not know to whom the ball will be passed; hence, everyone must be prepared to receive the ball at any time.</p>
<p>Second, we need the instant utterance. Our utterance should be living, not old. We do not pray-read from our memory or from our knowledge. We need new utterances with new inspiration. The more we practice pray-reading the Word, the more we will receive new things.</p>
<p>Brother Nee said that in order to speak for the Lord, we need two kinds of material: stored material, which is what we have prepared, and instant material. When we speak, the instant material is more powerful than the stored material. Some believers have only what is stored, that is, what they have prepared; they do not have the instant material. Some believers are ready to receive new material. They may have prepared enough material so that they can speak for an hour, but as they begin to speak, they have the feeling that they cannot depend on what is stored within them. Hence, they are open to receive new utterances and use new material. This should be our practice. While we are learning to meet according to the Spirit, we should not depend on old material. We should be prepared to receive new light, make new discoveries, and have new utterances. A brother may be able to recite many verses, but no matter how familiar the verses are to him, every verse that he pray-reads should be fresh and new. Instead of praying old prayers, he should be open to receive new light.</p>
<p>Third, we need the skill of functioning with one another. This is the skill of cooperating with one another. On a basketball team the members play as one person. In our meetings there should be one ball. Sometimes our meetings can be likened to a basketball team that plays with many balls. One player dribbles the ball and drops it; he does not care for the next player, and the other players dribble the ball and then drop it. They do not pass the ball to one another, and there is no cooperation. We need a spirit of cooperation and the skill to cooperate.</p>
<p>No matter how many saints there are in a meeting, we need an attitude of cooperation, and we should closely follow the Spirit. When a brother prays, he should allow others to follow. We must practice the skills needed for meeting together.</p>
<p>Fourth, we should not stray from the main subject but should fellowship according to the verses given in the meeting. This does not mean that we should be legal. We are free in our spirit, but we should not disregard the subject of the meeting. For example, if the subject of the verses is the Spirit of life, our testimonies should follow this central line. When our speaking is related to the subject, the meeting is not scattered.</p>
<p>We must lay a good foundation in our practice so that we meet in spirit, coordinate with one another, and follow the flow of the meeting. The Lord is bringing us into a new flow. We must practice to lay a good foundation and set up a good pattern.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAY-READING</h2>
<p>When we pray-read, we should not be too loud. Pray-reading should have the flavor, atmosphere, and spirit of prayer, but our pray-reading still lacks the flavor, atmosphere, and spirit of prayer. It is not difficult to enter into a genuine spirit of prayer. We only need to spend time and practice. Pray-reading should have the flavor of prayer; otherwise, it cannot be called pray-reading.</p>
<p>For example, we may read John 14:7 and then pray-read: &ldquo;O Lord, we know You, so we know the Father. To know You is to know the Father.&rdquo; This kind of reading has the flavor of prayer. When we pray-read, we can say, &ldquo;O Lord.&rdquo; This indicates our calling on the Lord.</p>
<p>I exhort all the saints to practice pray-reading according to our fellowship. When we are by ourselves, we should practice turning the words of the Bible into our prayer, rather than merely declaring them as a slogan. This is the way to use our spirit and touch the Lord. When we pray-read, we should also thank, praise, and worship the Lord. When it is time to speak in the meeting, we should use our spirit and testify concerning what touched us. Even though we release our spirit when we speak, we also use our mind and our eyes.</p>
<p>We should no longer read the Bible in a natural way. Otherwise, we will become old and not grow. We must read with our spirit. We can pray-read the Bible with our spirit in our morning watch. We can pray-read the Bible with our spirit when we come together with other saints. We can also pray-read the Bible with our spirit in the meetings. If we would practice this, we will make much progress in one month.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us. We are in the age of the church, and the Lord is taking the way of recovery. There are no clergy and no laity in the churches, for all the saints are priests. Hence, we must learn to be priests. Pray-reading is a crucial matter in the age of the church. We need to lay a good foundation in this practice. May we all rise up and lay a good foundation in order to build up pray-reading as our family practice. Then it will be easy for the new ones to participate.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">ENTERING INTO THE HOLY OF HOLIES<br />
BY TURNING TO THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOLY OF HOLIES AND THE EXPIATION COVER<br />
IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>Hebrews says that we should enter into the Holy of Holies (10:19) and that we should come forward to the throne of grace (4:16). In order to understand what this means, we must know the types in the Old Testament. The first section of both the tabernacle and the temple was the outer court. After passing through the outer court, a person entered the second section, the Holy Place. The innermost section of both the tabernacle and the temple was called the Holy of Holies. Inside the Holy of Holies was the Ark, and the lid of the Ark was called the expiation cover (Exo. 25:17, 21). The law was inside the Ark (v. 16). Every year on the Day of Expiation the blood of the sin offering was brought into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled upon the expiation cover of the Ark (Lev. 16). The expiation cover on the Ark in the Holy of Holies equals the throne of grace. This is where God gives grace to man, meets with man, abides with man, and speaks with man (Exo. 25:22). This is the type in the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOLY OF HOLIES AND THE THRONE OF GRACE<br />
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>The types in the Old Testament are depictions of New Testament realities. Some Bible scholars say that the Holy of Holies refers to heaven, where the Lord is today. Although this is not wrong, the New Testament shows that the Holy of Holies is in us. First Corinthians says that the believers are the temple of God (3:16; 6:19). God&rsquo;s temple has three sections: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. Our body can be likened to the outer court, our soul can be likened to the Holy Place, and our spirit, the deepest part of our being, can be likened to the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>The Ark, which typifies Christ, is in the Holy of Holies. This signifies that the Lord Jesus Christ is in our spirit. The Holy of Holies refers to our spirit, and the throne of grace is Christ, the place where we meet with God.</p>
<p>When someone in the Old Testament wanted to fellowship with God, he went to the temple. The temple had three sections: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. The Ark, which was inside the Holy of Holies, was the place where God appeared to man. God did not dwell in the outer court or in the Holy Place. God dwelt in the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>The Lord is with us; He dwells in us. In which part of our being does the Lord dwell? Does He dwell in our body, our soul, or our spirit? Second Timothy 4:22 says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; The Lord is in our spirit. Hence, if we want to draw near to Him, we must be in our spirit. Our spirit is the Holy of Holies, where God dwells.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENTERING THE HOLY OF HOLIES<br />
AND COMING TO THE THRONE OF GRACE<br />
BY TURNING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Suppose I live with a brother, and there is friction between us. Perhaps I think that he is always impolite and that he should not be so rude to me. When I remember the things that he has done to me, I am turning to my mind. Eventually, my emotion is stirred up so that I become unhappy. The more I remember the things he has done to me, the unhappier I become. When I become angry, my will is in turmoil. However, since I am a believer, I can pray in the morning in order to draw near to the Lord. When I touch the Lord, I turn to my spirit. The more I contact the Lord in my spirit, the more I am saved from my mind and also from my emotions. By touching the Lord and being enlightened by Him, I am saved from rebuking my brother. This illustration shows that our spirit is the Holy of Holies. Whenever we turn to our spirit, we are in the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament not everyone could enter into the Holy of Holies. Not only were the Levites not allowed to enter the Holy of Holies, but even the priests were not allowed to enter the Holy of Holies. Only the high priest could enter into the Holy of Holies (Heb. 9:7). Therefore, when we turn to our spirit, we are one with the High Priest. There are many Levites who are doing outward activities, but we should turn to our spirit. When we want to argue with someone, we should tell the devil, &ldquo;I will not fall into your trap. I will not follow you in outward activities. I will enter into the Holy of Holies.&rdquo; I hope that this will not become doctrine among us. May it become our experience.</p>
<p>The Lord is not merely our Savior, nor is He merely the Lord of all sitting on the throne. Today He is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit. In order for us to be Christians, it is not enough for us merely to worship Him outwardly. In order to experience the Lord, we must turn to our spirit. The Lord is the Spirit, and He is in our spirit. &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 6:17). The Lord is the Spirit, and we also have a spirit. Moreover, the Spirit is in our spirit. Therefore, we can experience the Lord. These two spirits&mdash;our spirit and the Spirit&mdash;have become one spirit. This mingled spirit is the place where we can experience, contact, and enjoy the Lord.</p>
<p>The cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s blood that He shed for our redemption gives us the ground to be one with the High Priest. Even a new believer can enter into the Holy of Holies, into his spirit. Every time we turn to our spirit, we enter into the Holy of Holies where we can touch the Lord. The Lord is the Ark, and the cover of the Ark is the throne of grace. This is where God gives grace and where we can receive grace. Hence, we should come forward continually to the throne of grace in order to receive mercy and find grace for timely help (Heb. 4:16).</p></body></html>
