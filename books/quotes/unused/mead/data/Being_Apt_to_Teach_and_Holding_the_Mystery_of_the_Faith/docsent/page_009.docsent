   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE HOW TO LEAD THE NEWLY SAVED ONES THE NEWLY SAVED ONES NEEDING TO ADVANCE IN THREE MATTERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A newly saved one should steadily advance in three matters.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, he must learn the lessons of life for his advancement in life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second, he must diligently read the Bible for his advancement in the divine Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Third, he must learn to preach the gospel for his advancement in leading people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These three matters are fundamental lessons that a Christian should learn and steadily develop.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, under normal circumstances, a person who has been baptized and has entered into the church life must be perfected in these three matters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the church it is rather easy to arouse people and stir them up to be zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Encouraging people by stirring up a kind of atmosphere is not a difficult thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The difficult thing is helping the newly saved ones to advance in life, to become rooted in the Word, and to labor in the service and the propagation of the gospel step by step and in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not an easy or ordinary task.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This kind of service is special and can only be carried out by those who have been taught and trained to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Such ones must experience the things that they teach.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, they must live in fellowship with the Lord, continually learning how to carry out this service in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only then can they help others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, let us look at how to lead and help the newly saved ones in the aspect of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>ADVANCING IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we want to help people advance in life, first we need to help them have an accurate understanding of the matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although a person may have already been baptized and received into the church, he still must begin with the matter of knowing his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a person does not have a thorough understanding of his salvation, then it will be difficult for him to advance in life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not think that all Christians are one hundred percent assured of their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some have been saved and may even realize that they have already been saved, yet when others challenge their salvation, they may say, "I am probably not saved."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are easily shaken because they lack the knowledge of the assurance of their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, we need to help them establish such a firm foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Helping People to Practically Establish a Foundation in Life</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How do we help others have a proper understanding of salvation based upon the holy Scriptures so that they may establish a firm foundation?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First we must have a basic knowledge of the Bible, and then we must lead them to the proper understanding step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, suppose we meet someone who somewhat doubts his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order to help him, we may open to Mark 16:16 and ask him to read it: "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After he reads it, we may ask him, "Who said this?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He would say, "The Lord Jesus said it."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We then may ask him, "Are the words of the Lord Jesus false?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Can they be changed?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He would say, "The words of the Lord Jesus are true and unchangeable."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must continue to ask, "How do we know that the Lord's words are unchangeable?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then we can ask him to read Matthew 24:35, where the Lord Jesus said, "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At this point we can ask him if he is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If he says that he is clear, then we have to ask again, "The Lord said that He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.'</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Have you believed?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He will answer, "Yes, I have believed."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we should ask, "Have you been baptized?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He will then reply, "Yes, I have been baptized."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then we can tell him, "Since you have believed and have also been baptized, are you saved according to the Lord's word?"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He might say that according to the Lord's words he is saved, but he does not feel that he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then we can ask him again, "Did the Lord say here that he who believes and is baptized and who feels it shall be saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He will answer, "No."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then we can ask again, "Then are you saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Finally, he will say, "Yes, I am saved."</S>
