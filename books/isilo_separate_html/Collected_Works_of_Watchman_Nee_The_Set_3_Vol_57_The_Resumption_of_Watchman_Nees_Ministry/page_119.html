You have to speak honest words to others. In the past a certain person may have been loose, and you may have let it go. But you cannot do that any longer. If a person does not do his job, you cannot let him go; you have to compel him to work. After he has agreed to work, you still have to ask, "Why are you so loose? Why would you not be careful in taking care of the things of God? You need to learn. Who told you to hand over yourself to be a child of God in the first place? As long as you are His child, you have to serve, and you have to serve in a conscientious way.''</p><h2 class="head2">The Perfecting of the New Believers</h2><h2 class="head3">Conducting the New Believers' Meetings by Districts</h2><p>We have to conduct the new believers' meetings in the districts. This is because many live too far away and cannot otherwise attend this meeting. Presently, we consider everyone to be a new believer, and we are giving make-up lessons to all. Among the brothers we have selected twenty to do the teaching work in the thirteen districts. The subjects covered in the thirteen districts are the same, and their contents are the same. This meeting is set up specifically for the perfecting of the new believers.</p><h2 class="head3">Those Who Are Absent<br />Needing to Receive Make-up Lessons</h2><p>The ones who are responsible for visiting the new believers should go out on Friday evening to give make-up lessons to those who were absent the previous week. In giving the make-up lessons, you have to do a detailed job. Then a person will receive the same teachings, whether or not he comes to the meeting. For example, Brother Cheng may give a message for two hours with sweat all over him. After he finishes, he still has to go to the home of a brother who is absent from the meeting to give him a make-up lesson. Someone may say, "Brother Cheng has put in so much effort to give his message already. When others do not come to the meeting, he still has to spend time to give make-up lessons.'' By saying this, the one who has been absent from the meeting will say, "That is not right. Next time I think I have to come to the meeting.''</p><p>This kind of work is most definite and fine. Everywhere we go, we will find out right away the things that are wrong with that place, and we will be able to make up the lack. If we practice this, our work will not be as confused and uncoordinated as it is today.</p><h2 class="head2">Caring for the Poor</h2><h2 class="head3">The Lord's Commandment</h2><p>There are three kinds of people among us: first, sinners; second, new believers; and third, the poor. The church is never free from having a relationship with the poor people. If anyone feels happy about offering money to the Lord but unhappy about giving money to the poor, he is wrong. It is wrong to leave the ointment in the alabaster box; we should offer it up to the Lord. It is right for us to take care of the Lord and His work first. But after the alabaster box is poured out, the Bible tells us to sell everything we have and give it to the poor. Caring for the poor is also a commandment of the Lord (Luke 12:33).</p><h2 class="head3">A Practice of the Church in the Time of Revival</h2><p>In church history we see that whenever there was a revival, there was the practice of caring for the poor. Strictly speaking, it is a small thing for a poor person to eat more or eat less, to have more clothing or less clothing. But it is a serious thing for a Christian to become narrow in his heart. If you want to spend all your money and do not want it to become a hindrance to you, the way is very simple; all you have to do is catch the time of a church revival and go to the Lord and offer up all you have. If you do this, your money will not become a hindrance any longer.</p><h2 class="head3">The Normal Work of the Church</h2><p>Caring for the poor is not just the work of the church at the time of revival; it is also the normal work of the church. It is part of a Christian's daily life. We hope that the brothers and sisters would go home and bring back what they have to the church. We want everything, new and old. We have brothers and sisters who can wash, sew, and mend these things, and who can distribute them. Every time the church receives some money from the offering box, it should set aside a certain amount for the poor. We need one brother and one sister who are designated for this relief work. It is good if some can give good messages. But if you cannot give a good message, it is equally good if you can give away your belongings.</p><p>We have to learn to be those who are led away to the lowly. If the ones who receive our help are saved, that is an additional blessing. But even if they are not saved, you will still receive the benefit. All the things in the brothers' and sisters' homes that they do not need should be sent away to the church. If your house is cleared of all these things, you may end up having fewer burdens to bear. Some people may have their backs bent over by the burden of these things.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_118.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_120.html">Next</a> </body></html>
