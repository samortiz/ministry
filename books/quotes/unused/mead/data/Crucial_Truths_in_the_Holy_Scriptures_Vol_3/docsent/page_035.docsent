   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer, like reading the Bible, is a practice that Christians should not lack.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In a Christian s spiritual life reading the Bible is like eating, and praying is like breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A person can go for several days without eating, but he cannot live even a few minutes without breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a Christian does not pray, his spiritual life will be deadened, and he will not be living and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Breathing is necessary for the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a person wants an active body, his breathing must be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the same way, prayer is a necessity for a Christian s spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a Christian wants to be fresh in spirit and strong in life, he must pray.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The life within every Christian is a praying life, and every life has a capacity and a desire to function in certain ways.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The life within us has a praying capacity which enables us to pray and which also causes us to desire to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This inward capacity requires us to pray and causes us to have a desire to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we respond to this praying capacity and pray often, this capacity will be developed, and its desire will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then the life within us will be strengthened to grow, and it will not be grieved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we do not obey this life, it will be impossible for it to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we must pray and practice praying.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let us carefully look into different aspects of prayer according to the record of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE IMPORTANCE OF PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus command in this verse shows the importance of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Prayer keeps us from temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>While we live in the world today, the devil tempts us with many things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He has the opportunity to tempt us in matters related to food and clothing, occupations, money, marriage, and many other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is constantly looking for an opportunity to tempt us.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must pray constantly concerning every matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whatever we do, we must pray.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether our actions involve making friends, getting married, spending money, working, or dealing with friends and relatives, we must pray and diligently seek the Lord s will.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must ask God what we can do and what we cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should also ask how we should do something and to what extent we should do something.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must have this kind of prayer in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must pray even when we write a letter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should ask God whether or not we should write and what we should write.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we watch and pray in every matter, we will be preserved by the leading of God and will not enter into the temptation of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When a ship sails on the ocean and encounters fog, it sounds a foghorn.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the one hand, this sends out a warning, but on the other hand, it receives an echo which directs its course.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today we are sailing in the vast ocean of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sometimes we come across a patch of fog that makes it difficult for us to know the direction that we should take.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At these times we should pray, as if we are sounding a foghorn, so that we can avoid danger and know how to move forward.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we do not, we will become lost in the fog, leave the proper course, and fall into error and danger.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to stand against him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must put on the whole armor of God and have much prayer and petition to stand against him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must rely on the armor of God to stand against the enemy through prayer and petition.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Prayer and petition are the way to utilize the armor of God and to cause the armor of God to have an effect upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to withstand the enemy, we must put on the armor of God by means of all prayer and petition.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The devil is the enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, God does not deal with the devil by Himself; He wants us to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He wants us to pray and ask Him to deal with the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God deals with the devil according to the prayers that we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God deals with the enemy to the extent of our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we do not pray, God will not and cannot deal with the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, the devil fears our prayer and hates our prayer to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brothers and sisters, the devil is afraid of our prayer!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our prayer causes the devil to tremble because our prayer can bind him and cast him out.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When he sees us bend our knees to pray, he trembles in fear.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He dislikes, even hates, our prayer to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, he uses every means to block our prayer and to disturb us while we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many times he takes away our interest in prayer and even depresses our heart of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He makes us unable to pray and causes us to have no desire to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He knows that once we pray, he will be dealt with and suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should see through his stratagems and stand against our indifference, our depressed spirit, and any outward distractions in order to pray and petition so that he would be bound and suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The work that God wants us to do on the earth today, whether it is preaching the gospel, saving sinners, building the church, or building up the saints, involves casting out the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In order to be effective, these must be carried out with much prayer and petition.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must pray to deal with and cast out the devil so that we can carry out these works for God.</S>

   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Spiritual warfare must be fought through prayer in order to be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Prayer is necessary for spiritual warfare; it is also necessary for spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Everyone who asks receives ; You do not have because you do not ask Matt 7:8; James 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>These verses speak of a principle: He who asks receives, and he who does not ask does not receive.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This shows the importance of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Prayer is necessary for us to receive God s grace and blessing.</S>

   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We should touch God and His will in everything.</S>

   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>5.</S>

   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As children of God living on earth today, we need God s mercy and grace for timely help.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We must come to the throne of grace frequently through prayer to obtain this grace and mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Timely help is help that arrives when it is needed.</S>

   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It is difficult for people who do not pray much to see visions and receive revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Visions and revelations are of God.</S>

   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>36:37; see also Jer 29:10-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>Ezekiel 36 not only speaks of God s determination to increase the number of the house of Israel but also of the house of Israel s need to inquire of Him in order for Him to accomplish His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>Jeremiah 29 speaks of God s determination that the captivity of Israel would last for seventy years and of how He would care for them and cause them to return to their own land.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>However, they had to pray in order for Him to accomplish this.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>These two passages of the Word reveal a principle: Even when God determines to do something for man, man still must pray before God will act.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>Whatever God does among man and for man comes out of His determination, but it must pass through man s prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>God s determination alone is not enough; man s prayer must be added.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>Therefore, when God determines to do something, His determination is anointed through the Holy Spirit into those who love Him and draw near to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>Then His determination becomes a burden in them that can be turned into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>When His determination becomes man s prayer, He hears and accomplishes it.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>If it does not become prayer, He cannot act.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>For example, if God determines to save a particular person, but cannot find someone to pray for him, His desire to save will be frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>But if someone comes to God and contacts Him, His Spirit will anoint God s will into him and cause him to have a feeling and a burden to pray for this person s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>When he prays, God will listen and save the person whom He has determined to save and who has been cared for through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>This is a great principle of how God works for man.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>When God works for man, He works according to His heart s desire and determination.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>He causes His heart s desire to become the feeling and burden of those who are close to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>He causes them to pray for the matter that He has determined in His heart, and then He hears their prayer and accomplishes the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>This shows the importance of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>If God is going to do anything for man today, there must be some who are praying.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>God s determination must be matched by man s prayer before it can be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>14.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>I sought a man...who would build up the wall and stand in the breach before Me Ezek.</S>

   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>God sought a man among the Israelites who would stand in the breach before Him for the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>It is the same in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>Those who are standing in the breach before Him for His people are those who are praying for His people.</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>Only those who pray before Him can stand in the breach among His people.</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>Many times a breach between the brothers and sisters, such as a problem in the church, requires prayer in order for the breach to be filled.</S>

   <S PAR='185' RSNT='1' SNO='185'>Commanding God is the highest kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='186' RSNT='1' SNO='186'>This kind of prayer is the highest right that we enjoy before God.</S>
   <S PAR='187' RSNT='1' SNO='187'>God needs us to exercise this right and pray, commanding Him for His work on His children.</S>
   <S PAR='188' RSNT='1' SNO='188'>When God wants to work on His children, He needs people to command Him to do what He desires according to His heart s desire and determination.</S>
   <S PAR='189' RSNT='1' SNO='189'>Prayer that commands God concerning His work can and should be practiced by those who know Him and His heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='190' RSNT='1' SNO='190'>Often this kind of prayer is necessary for God s work.</S>
