   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE THREE CHOSEN TO BE HOLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to God s selection 1:4 , to the matter of our being chosen to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I. THE FIRST ITEM OF GOD S BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians 1:4 says, According as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish before Him, in love.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Following verse 3, verses 4 through 14 present a list of all the spiritual blessings with which God has blessed us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God s choosing is His first blessing bestowed upon us; it is the first item of God s well-speaking concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s choosing is His selection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From among numberless people, He has selected us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>IN HIM</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God chose us in Him, that is, in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ was the sphere in which we were selected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Outside of Christ we are not God s choice.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 4 says that God chose us before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God chose us according to His infinite foresight before He created us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The book of Romans begins with fallen men on earth, whereas Ephesians begins with God s chosen ones in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God s selection was not made in time, but in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before the foundation of the world, God chose us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Among millions of people, He foresaw us before we were even born and selected us before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The expression, before the foundation of the world, implies the entire universe, not only the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that the universe was founded for man s existence to fulfill God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without such a universe, it would be impossible for man to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man s existence is for the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, man is the focal point of God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The universe was founded so that man could exist to fulfill God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THAT WE SHOULD BE HOLY</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God chose us that we should be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The words holy and holiness have been spoiled by today s Christian teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Your understanding of holiness is probably influenced by these teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the Bible the word holy should not be understood according to our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many think that holiness is sinlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to this concept, someone is holy if he does not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This thought is absolutely mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Holiness is neither sinlessness nor perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Holy not only means sanctified, separated unto God, but also different, distinct, from everything that is common.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only God is different, distinct, from all things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, He is holy; holiness is His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The way God makes us holy is to impart Himself, the Holy One, into us so that our whole being may be permeated and saturated with His holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For us, God s chosen ones, to be holy is to partake of His divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 and to have our whole being permeated with God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is different from mere sinless perfection or sinless purity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This makes our being holy, like God Himself in His nature and in His character.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A. God Being Holy</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To be holy is to be separated from everything other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It also means to be different, distinct, from all that is not God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, we should not be common, but different.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the universe God alone is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is different from everything else and is distinct.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, to be holy means to be one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To be sinless or perfect is not the same as being holy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To be holy we need to be one with God because only God is holy Lev 11:44; 1 Sam 2:2 .</S>
