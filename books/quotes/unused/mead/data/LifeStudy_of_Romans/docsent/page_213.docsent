   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MORE SANCTIFICATION, THE MORE GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The glorification of the church that began at Pentecost has not yet reached its consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the contrary, the process of glorification is still taking place.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the condition of the church, there may be more glory at certain times than at others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How much glory is manifested in the church depends upon our degree of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The spectators at the basketball game may be very enthusiastic.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, with them there is no glory; there is only excitement, because there is no sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more we are sanctified through Christ s saturating our being with His holy nature, the more we shall express God when we come together as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sanctification is primarily an individual matter, whereas glorification is mainly a corporate matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Suppose I lose my temper with my wife during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This damages my personal sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although I confess to the Lord and receive His cleansing, I may have no sense of the glory in the meeting that night, even though everyone else is conscious of it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because I am short of sanctification, I cannot sense the glory which others can sense.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I do not have the sanctification in my personal life to give me a sense of glory in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, suppose I stay in fellowship with the Lord all day, even when my wife gives me a difficult time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everything that happens during the day only helps the process of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, in the meetings, I will be able to sense the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This illustrates the fact that the more sanctification we experience, the more we shall participate in the glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Glory, the expression of God in the church, is God s goal in His dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, sanctification is the process, and righteousness is the supporting ground.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, the dispensation of the Triune God is according to His righteousness, through His holiness, and unto the goal of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE LIFE OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>DISPENSED INTO OUR WHOLE BEING</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we come to the very precious matter of the life of the Triune God dispensed into the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How marvelous that God is triune and that we are tripartite!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Romans 8:2 speaks of the life of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 10 reveals that this life has been dispensed into our spirit and has caused our spirit to become life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, according to verse 6, this life can be dispensed into our mind and can cause our mind to be life also.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ultimately, as verse 11 discloses, the divine life can even be imparted into our mortal bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In these verses we see the three parts of man: the spirit, the soul represented by the mind , and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The spirit is the center, the body is the circumference, and the mind is in between.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From the center through the middle to the circumference, the life of the Triune God is being dispensed into our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE LIFE THAT IS DISPENSED INTO US</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The life that is to be dispensed into the three parts of man is the life of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 8:2 Paul speaks of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this phrase the Triune God is implied.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Spirit and Christ, the Son, are mentioned explicitly, whereas God the Father is implied by the fact that the Spirit is the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, here we have God, Christ, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, the main point is not the Triune God, but life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To speak of the Spirit of life is actually to say that the Spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The life here is the very life of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we were regenerated, we received another life, a life in addition to our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There are various kinds of life: plant life, animal life, human life, and divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As humans, we all have a physical life and a psychological life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The physical life and the psychological life are indicated by the Greek words bios and psuche respectively.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Paul speaks of life in Romans 8, however, he uses still another Greek word, the word zoe.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Bible zoe denotes God s life, the divine, infinite, uncreated, eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the life we receive by believing in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As John 3:36 says, He who believes in the Son has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In verses 2, 6, 10, and 11 of Romans 8, Paul uses this Greek word for life to indicate that the dispensation of God is to dispense zoe into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In other words, God desires to dispense Himself as zoe into all three parts of man s being.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The dispensation of the divine zoe into us began when we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to 8:2, this life is the Spirit and it is in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But now, through God s dispensation, it also has something to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Without this life, we are doomed to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Praise the Lord that when we were regenerated, zoe was dispensed into our spirit!</S>
