   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX THE TEACHINGS OF JEZEBEL INTRODUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the epistle to the church in Thyatira in Revelation, there is a self-proclaimed prophetess called Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She teaches God's servants and leads them astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Who is this Jezebel?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>She was the wife of Ahab, a king of Israel in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ahab married a woman from the Gentile land of Sidon.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She seduced the people of God to worship Baal 1 Kings 16:30-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Baal is a Gentile god, not the God of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jezebel not only taught the people about idolatry but turned Baal into their god and told the people to worship him v. 31 . Ahab was joined to the world through the help of Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The present-day Jezebel is the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Catholicism is the self-proclaimed prophetess Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It has joined itself to the world and has filled itself with idolatry and heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Everywhere we go, we can see the heretical teaching of the Catholic Church and its alliance with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The teaching of the Scriptures is clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the parable of the leaven in Matthew 13:33, the Lord said that the kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The three measures of meal refer to the genuine word of God, the woman signifies the Catholic Church, and the leaven signifies heretical teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When leaven is added to the word of God, its nature changes and becomes corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord did not say that the meal has been cooked with the fire; rather, it says that the meal has been mixed with leaven, and the whole lump is leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is what happened to the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Heretical teachings are mixed in with God's word, and the word is leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>CONCERNING BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us consider various heretical teachings in the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First, there is baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Article five of the decree of the Council of Trent fifth session says, "Through baptism, a man's original sin is forgiven."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Based on this teaching, a man becomes sinless, clean, guileless, and loved by God through baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He becomes an heir of God together with Christ, and no one can deny him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Church believes that as soon as a man is baptized, he is regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But this is not what the Bible teaches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ananias said to Paul, "And now, why do you delay?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rise up and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on His name" Acts 22:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was baptized only after he had believed in the Lord and was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is contrary to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Church says that even a baby can be baptized and thus be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Council of Trent's catechism says, "All babies, whether born of Christian or non-Christian parents, will suffer eternal pain and perdition, unless they are regenerated and consecrated to God through the grace of baptism."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Church teaches that a man can wash away his sins and receive the Lord through baptism, but the Bible says that a man receives baptism only after he has received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is totally different from the Catholic teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>CONCERNING JUSTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Second, concerning justification, the Catholic Church emphasizes human work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It says that works justify a man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Its priests exhort men to do good works.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Of course, this teaching is not written down in black and white.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The theology expounded at the Council of Trent represents that held by the Catholic Church as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It says that anyone who says that good work does not guarantee the enhancement of the grace of justification or who says that good work is the mere fruit or evidence of justification must be anathematized.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the justification that the Lord has granted us has to be enhanced through our labor, this justification from the Lord is no longer complete.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We know that the gift from God is complete and eternal justification.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is no need to add anything to it, and man cannot add anything to it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When some told the Galatians to enhance their fruit by good work, Paul pronounced that such teachers should be accursed Gal 1:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Bible does not have a teaching of justification by work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In addition to many heresies found in its theology, the Catholic Church contains many heresies touching the matter of justification by work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It believes that a man can be absolved of his sins through prayer, fasting, almsgiving, self-mortification, and purgatory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It does not understand the salvation of Christ at all.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We can find positive and explicit verses on justification in the Bible such as Romans 3:22 and 28 and Galatians 3:8 and 11.</S>
