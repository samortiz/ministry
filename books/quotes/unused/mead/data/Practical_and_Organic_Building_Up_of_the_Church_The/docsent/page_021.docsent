   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT TO PROPHESY Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:12, 4-5, 31, 24, 1, 39a</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous chapters, we have seen our need to help sinners to be saved and become the organic members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the first thing we must do for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After the sinners have been saved, we should continue to take care of them by nourishing and cherishing them continually.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we do this, the newly saved ones will be fully established.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we do not nourish and cherish a newborn babe and take good care of him, it will be very difficult for him to remain alive.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order for a little one to survive, we must have an adequate care for him that he may be established.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To establish the new ones means to qualify them to learn something more.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A mother knows that before a baby is three months old, she cannot tell him many things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She needs to feed, nourish, and cherish him, and let him grow for three months.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After growing for three months, the baby will have more capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The mother will have the opportunity to instruct the baby, and he will be able to receive her instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>PERFECTING THE NEWLY SAVED ONES</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>IN THE SMALL GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After the new ones are established, we should bring them together with other saved ones in small groups of fifteen to twenty or twenty-five.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For only one or two to be saved is not adequate to form a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we need to help more new ones to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Two or three brothers or sisters can join together to bring several newly saved ones to form a group.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These brothers and sisters can then work together.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Much work will be required to perfect the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Greek the word perfect mainly means to equip.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perfecting may be illustrated by the training young people receive in the military service.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The new believers have to be equipped.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This involves instructing them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to teach them, and we have to feed them, not just with milk, but with solid food.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some may wonder how the new ones could go on so quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many teachers have found that little ones have a great ability to apprehend things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every kind of life has its ability.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the human life there is an ability to grasp and understand many things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The newborn Christians have the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With the divine life there is also the divine ability.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to believe that the saved ones have received something divine within them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, they have the capacity, the ability, to understand what we say.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should bring the new ones out of their homes to join with other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is to bring them into the habit of not simply existing by themselves in their own homes but coexisting with other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now that we have brought meetings to them, we have to bring them out of their homes to gather with other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They can rotate their meetings in different homes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This will make them happy, build them up, and provide contact and togetherness with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This togetherness brings much benefit to their Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Children learn a lot by being together.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When they come together, they teach each other.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Quite often I have seen little ones tutoring each other, and sometimes those little tutors do a better job than their mothers can do.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They have their way to talk about things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They have their own language and new vocabulary.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They understand each other even when their mothers do not.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why we have to bring the new ones together with some new saints.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>CHERISHING, ENTREATING, AND CONSOLING</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>IN THE SMALL GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As we have seen, we must first help sinners to be saved and become living members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Secondly, we have to go to them quite often to nourish, cherish, and encourage them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then we must form groups of these believers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have discovered that the small groups are crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The cherishing, entreating, and consoling of the believers for their perfecting takes place in the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 1 Thessalonians 2:7 Paul firstly said, But we were gentle in your midst, as a nurse would cherish her own children.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is not easy to be so patient, gentle, and tender in caring for little babes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Without grace one cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then in 2:11 Paul also likened himself to an entreating and consoling father.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Entreating, or exhorting, implies a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Sometimes it implies a warning, and sometimes it implies rebuking, but with it is also the consoling.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Martin Luther said that in disciplining children we sometimes must first spank them and then give them an apple.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is wise.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many parents have learned that if they only charge their children, the children will not receive the charge.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After rebuking, parents must console and warm up their children.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then they will do what they were told.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Paul said he was a nursing mother, feeding the believers with milk, and an exhorting father, disciplining, teaching, instructing, and charging.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In Acts 20, Paul told the elders of the church in Ephesus that he had stayed with them for three years vv.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>17-18, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Acts 20:20 says, How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and to teach you publicly and from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Paul taught and admonished them publicly in big meetings and also from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>One by one he had many home meetings with them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This building work was done day and night, without ceasing, and with tears vv.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>31, 19 .</S>
