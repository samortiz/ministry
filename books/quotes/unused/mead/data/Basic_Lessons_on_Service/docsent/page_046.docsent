   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Cakes</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Besides the meat of the cattle, the offerer also enjoys three kinds of cakes as his portion 7:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 Unleavened Cakes Thin Cakes with Holes</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Mingled with Oil</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, there are unleavened cakes mingled with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Darby points out in a note on Leviticus 2:4 that these cakes are very thin with holes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Their being thin and perforated makes them easier to eat and digest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a type of Christ as the One who is easy to eat and digest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is mingled with the Spirit, and He is unleavened, without any sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2 Unleavened, Hollow Wafers Anointed with Oil</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The second kind of cake is the unleavened, hollow wafers anointed with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These wafers are also easy to eat, digest, and enjoy because they are empty, hollow, within.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The unleavened cakes are mingled with oil, whereas the unleavened, hollow wafers are anointed with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ was always hollow within; to be hollow means to be poor in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, He was pierced on the cross, that is, He was perforated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many Christians today are like a cake twelve inches thick, without one hole.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No one can eat of them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But Christ was not that thick.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ made Himself so humble.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was hollow, poor in spirit, and perforated, pierced, for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>3 Cakes of Fine Flour Saturated and Mingled with Oil</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The third kind of cake is of fine flour saturated and mingled with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be mingled is one thing, to be saturated is another thing, and to be anointed is still another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For the cake to be mingled with oil is something within.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For the cake to be saturated with oil is for it to be soaked with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For the cake to be anointed with oil is for the oil to be poured upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These cakes were to be offered with the sacrifice of thanksgiving, which is something we add to what God requires.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is satisfied with the required ox, the required sheep, the required lamb, or the required goat.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But when we are so grateful for what we have enjoyed of Christ, we have something to give to God for our thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is an experience of Christ in addition to what God requires and is initiated by us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because we are so grateful to God for Christ, we bring something additional of Christ to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Of course, what Christ has done for us in His redemption is altogether included in the cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot add anything to this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But still the cattle does not include Christ's behavior, Christ's human life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to read the four Gospels to realize Christ's human living on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is typified by the cakes of the peace offering, which were thin and hollow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we are grateful to God, we bring something of Christ in the aspect of His human living as our gratitude to God.</S>
