   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MANIFESTATION OF THE SPIRIT IN THE FIVE CASES IN ACTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We may now come back to the five cases of receiving the Spirit outwardly in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the first case, all the disciples were powerful on the day of Pentecost, and they had the release, boldness, and encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They dared to speak as the Lord led.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They also had the gifts; they spoke in tongues, in different human languages.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Peter and the others also had the gift of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before the day of Pentecost, Peter spoke foolishly many times.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only once, in Matthew 16:16, did Peter speak clearly according to the heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He recognized the Lord as the Christ, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was the clearest and most accurate word he spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Besides this, whatever he spoke was often foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, his message on the day of Pentecost was wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was clear, powerful, and given in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At that time he received the gift of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He had not only the power to preach but also the gift to present the gospel in a good, effective, prevailing, and brief way in a good order.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was the sermon, the message, given by Peter, an unlearned fisherman, who received a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the second case, the case of the Samaritan believers in Acts 8, there is nothing concerning speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, people could see that the believers had the Holy Spirit upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There must have been certain signs which people saw that indicated that the Spirit was upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some today may insist that what they saw was speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, the Holy Spirit in composing Acts 8 does not mention speaking in tongues, and what the Scriptures do not say may be more meaningful than what they do say.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is nothing mentioned by the Spirit about speaking in tongues, yet people saw that the Holy Spirit came down upon the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many times I have seen people receive the Holy Spirit upon them without speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is some kind of sign by which we know the Holy Spirit is upon a person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The third case is concerning Saul, who later became the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Shortly after he was saved, a disciple, a believer by the name of Ananias, came to him and laid hands on him, and Saul received the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this case, nothing more is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Scriptures in Acts 9 only tell us that the Holy Spirit came upon Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Later, the apostle Paul said that he spoke in tongues more than others 1 Cor 14:18 , but when he received the Holy Spirit upon him, the record of the Scriptures says nothing about speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we should not insist that speaking in tongues is the initial evidence of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have at least the two cases of the Samaritan believers and of Saul, in which the Scriptures do not mention speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fourth case is concerning the house of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This case is very wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the time the people in that house were regenerated, they all received the Holy Spirit upon them, and they spoke in tongues Acts 10:44-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The people there received almost everything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They received the Holy Spirit within as life, and at the same time they received the Holy Spirit without as power.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They received life, they received power, and they received a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the normal case.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the normal condition, a person is saved in the way of the house of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At the same time the Holy Spirit comes into him as life to regenerate him, He comes upon him as power.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then this person has life within and power and gift without.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, the experience of many believers is not normal.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The fifth case is concerning a small group of believers in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the apostle Paul came to them, he laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues 19:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They had speaking in tongues as the manifestation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have the Holy Spirit within as life and without as power and gift.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are truly filled with the Holy Spirit within, we have the riches of the life of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do not have the riches of the spiritual life, this proves that although we have the Holy Spirit dwelling within us, we are not filled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the same way, if we have the Holy Spirit upon us, we have power and a certain kind of gift.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We cannot say that we have the Holy Spirit upon us if we are not powerful and are unable to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must have power and gift.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All of the above show us the two aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, we must realize that these are not aspects of the work of two Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They are different aspects of the work of the one Holy Spirit.</S>
