   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LINKED TO THE COMPLETED CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first major item in the divine economy is the completion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When God created the present universe, He spent only six days.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But for God to complete Christ, He spent thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God went through a long process to finish the completion of His Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today our Savior is such a completed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He has been completed in incarnation, in human living, in crucifixion, in resurrection, in becoming the essential Spirit of life, in ascension, and in becoming the economical Spirit of power.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we go out to knock on doors, we are persons linked to this One.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This Christ has linked us to Himself, and by this linking He sends us to people as His ambassadors.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the heretical Mormons and Jehovah s Witnesses go to knock on people s doors, they are not linked to this Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no incarnation, human living, all-inclusive death, wonderful resurrection, essential Spirit of life, ascension, or economical Spirit of power in their knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But when we go out, we go out with all the equipment of the completed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I was told that when some young saints first went out to visit people by knocking on their doors, they were shaking with fear.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you go out to visit people by knocking on their doors and you shake, that means you have never received the vision that you are linked to the completed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a vision is imparted into us through the fellowship in this message, our hand and our arm will not shake when we knock on the door, but will be stronger than steel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The hand with which you knock on people s doors is not a common hand but a hand with incarnation, human living, the all-inclusive death, the wonderful resurrection, the becoming of the essential Spirit, the ascension, and the becoming of the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our knocking on people s doors is a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some told me that they were amazed when they went out to knock on doors and the people whom they visited were baptized within a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although this may be surprising to us, it is not surprising to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He told us that all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth, and He charged us to go with this universal authority Matt 28:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This universal authority is composed of and with Christ s deity, Christ s incarnation, Christ s human living, Christ s death, Christ s resurrection, Christ s being the life-giving Spirit, Christ s ascension, and Christ s being the economical Spirit of power.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are going out with this authority composed of all these items.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This authority makes you a great person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the President of the United States were to come to your home, his prestige would become his authority and his power to subdue you to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You would be subdued by his presidency.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In like manner, you have to realize that when you go out to knock on people s doors, you are the greatest person on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You are a person who is linked to the completed Christ with all the authority in heaven and on earth entrusted to you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To knock on people s doors, preach the gospel to them, and lead them to be baptized is the way of authority, the God-ordained way to spread the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I received some negative reports from some, telling me that knocking on doors does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One person told me that he went out for twenty days without one being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is like Peter going fishing for the whole night, and not catching one fish John 21:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For Peter to fish all night at the right time for fishing and catch nothing was amazing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If he had caught one hundred fish, that would not have been amazing but normal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For us Christians, the ambassadors of Christ, to go out and knock on people s doors for twenty days without one being baptized is amazing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When I was in Taipei, some were ecstatic when they told me that they baptized five in one evening.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such an occurrence, however, should be normal to us because we are great persons who are linked to the completed Christ, the processed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To visit people by knocking on their doors and getting many baptized may be a wonder to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To the Lord, however, it is not.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To Him it is normal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Who is going to visit people by knocking on their doors so that millions can get baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to be the ones to bear this responsibility, but we need to ask ourselves what kind of persons we are.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Are we linked to such a completed Christ or are we linked to ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to go out as persons linked with this completed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Without completing this Christ, God could do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can see how God s anointed One was being completed in the four Gospels in incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the end of the four Gospels He came back with all these qualifications as the life-giving Spirit to breathe Himself into His disciples, who received Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then this Christ entered into ascension so that He could clothe the believers with Himself as the economical Spirit of power.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God needed to complete Christ so that He could carry out His eternal purpose through this Christ, in this Christ, and with this Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ has gone through such a marvelous process, and today we are in the processed Christ, the completed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have the burden to pass this vision on to every Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some have said that knocking on people s doors may work in Taiwan, but not work in other countries and areas of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I do not agree with this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our success depends upon whether or not we have been linked to this completed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we are linked to this completed Christ, we can break through any barrier.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All the authority in heaven and on earth has been given to this Christ, and He commissioned us to go to disciple the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The completed Christ of God is in us and with us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By being linked to this wonderful One, we can fulfill His commission.</S>
