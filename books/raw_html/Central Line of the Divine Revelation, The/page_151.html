<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The New Jerusalem Being<br>the Consummation of Newness</H2><P>In the Bible the New Jerusalem is the consummation of newness (Rev. 21:2). The New Jerusalem is a living composition of all the renewed believers. No unrenewed person is qualified to be there. Adam was made of clay, the dust of the ground (Gen. 2:7). But the New Jerusalem is not a composition of clay; it is a composition of gold, pearl, and precious stones (Rev. 21:18-21). Every part of the New Jerusalem is transformed and renewed. Today I do not have the confidence that I have been thoroughly renewed. But when we enter into the New Jerusalem, all our clay and dust will be gone. Only gold, pearl, and precious stones will remain. Everything will be renewed; thus, the city is called the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Renewing by the Dispensing of the<br>Processed Triune God</H2><P>Renewing is a matter of the dispensing of the processed Triune God. The God whom we have received is the God who has passed through a process. In eternity He was only God, but through incarnation He became a man named Jesus. This Jesus is God with the human nature. We are not able to receive the God who was before incarnation, but we are able to receive the God who has become a man, who has passed through human living on this earth, who has entered into death by crucifixion, and who has entered into resurrection. He is no longer merely God alone; He is God plus humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Experiencing the Renewing</H2><P>The processed Triune God who has passed through incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection is for our experience. As we experience Him, we are renewed. He renews us by touching us in all the details of our human living. He is concerned about what kind of shoes or necktie we wear. He is also concerned about the way we comb our hair and even about what kind of buttons we have on our clothing. If you wear a certain kind of button on your clothing, you may not have the peace to eat or sleep. You may say, "Lord Jesus, I do not believe that You are concerned about such details of my human living." But the more you say this, the more the Lord Jesus will touch you until you lose your freedom and your peace to do many things. The younger a person is, the freer he can be. But the more the young people grow in the Lord, the more the Lord will touch them. Eventually, their freedom will be greatly reduced.</P><P>One time I purchased a necktie. There was nothing wrong with the necktie, but every time I put it on, I did not have peace and I could not pray freely. When I took off the necktie, I had peace and I could pray in an unhindered way. This is the experience of renewing.</P>
