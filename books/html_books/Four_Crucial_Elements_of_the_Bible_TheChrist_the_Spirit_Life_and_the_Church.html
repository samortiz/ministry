Compared to God, man is simple; hence, the way that the Bible was written is also simple. In particular, the Bible presents the divine and mystical matters in a way that is easily understandable to us. For this reason, the Bible seems to contain some &#8220;bark&#8221; and &#8220;branches.&#8221; In their reading of the Bible, many Christians often touch only these superficial things. They do not penetrate the Bible to touch its kernel. They do not touch the spirit and life in the depths of the Bible nor know the real, crucial elements in it. We must go beyond the superficial branches and bark and enter into the depths of the Bible in order to touch its spirit, its kernel, and to know its crucial elements.<p>A nut consists of a shell, the meat, and the kernel, which is the center. Man is also of three parts: the outer part-the physical organs; the inner part-the soul; and the innermost part-the spirit (1 Thes. 5:23). Of these three parts-spirit, soul, and body-the most important part is the innermost part, the spirit, which is the breath of life in man (Gen. 2:7). Without such a breath of life, it is not possible for man to exist, and man thus ceases to be man. Likewise, the Bible has its kernel, its life, its center, which is constituted with the church, Christ, the Spirit, and life. These four items are the contents of the true substance of the Bible. The revelation of the Bible, particularly the New Testament, stresses these four matters: the church, Christ, the Spirit, and life. If we remove these four items from the New Testament, all that remains would merely be dead letters. These four crucial elements are also the four important items in the Lord&#8217;s recovery today. Hence, we must all have a deep impression, a fresh light, and a renewed understanding concerning these four crucial elements.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH-THE EMPHASIS BEING THAT THE BELIEVERS ARE ON THE GROUND OF ONENESS TO BE THE TESTIMONY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><h2 class=head2>The First Significance of the Church Being People Called Out by God</h2><p>The first crucial element of the Bible is the church. The Greek word for church is ekklesia, which is composed of two words: ek, meaning &#8220;out of,&#8221; and kaleo, meaning &#8220;call.&#8221; Hence, in Greek, the word for church means the called-out ones. The early translators of the Chinese Bible rendered this word as a religious assembly. This term fits man&#8217;s natural thought, but it spoils the original meaning. Ekklesia does not denote a religious assembly; it refers to a called-out congregation. Therefore, the most precise rendering is assembly. We are a group of people called out by God; we are the church.<h2 class=head2>The Church Being the Life of God Himself</h2><p>God has called us out of the world, out of every nation, tribe, people, and tongue (Rev. 7:9) and has gathered us together to be the church. Today, regardless of our nationality or race, we have been called to become the people of the kingdom of the heavens. Hence, we have the heavenly citizenship. An American of Chinese descent is Chinese according to birth, but he becomes an American citizen by naturalization. Today we have become the people of the kingdom of the heavens by &#8220;naturalization,&#8221; by being called by God, and also by birth, by being regenerated by God. God not only has called us but also has regenerated us with His life. We were not adopted by God; we were begotten of Him with His life. We all have God&#8217;s divine life in us, and we are brothers and sisters of one another because we have been born of the same Father. Regardless of our color, race, or nationality, God has called us and regenerated us that we may become people of the kingdom of the heavens and brothers and sisters in His universal family. This is the church.<p>God&#8217;s life is God Himself. Therefore, when God regenerates us with His life, He begets us with Himself. Furthermore, He is within us today. The church is an entity of life, and as such, it has a life and a person. The church is not an organization; it is a life entity, an organism, with a life and a person. This life and this person are the Triune God Himself. He is the element of the oneness of the church (Eph. 4:1-6); hence, the church cannot be divided. Since we all have one God, one life, and one person, there is no factor that can divide us.<h2 class=head2>The Church Life Being to Live and Walk by the Person within Us</h2><p>Since we have the Triune God in us as our life and person, we must live and walk by Him in our daily life (Gal. 5:25) and grow up in all things into Him, who is the Head (Eph. 4:15). It is difficult for husbands and wives not to quarrel in their married life. By the Lord&#8217;s grace, I have been with my wife for close to thirty years, and although I dare not say that we have never disagreed, I can say that I have never quarreled with her. This is because I have another person in me, the heavenly God Himself who is my person. When I am displeased or unhappy and try to speak something unpleasant, this person who is in me says, &#8220;You may speak, but I won&#8217;t speak; you may go to quarrel, but I won&#8217;t go.&#8221; Thus, I can only say, &#8220;Lord, if You won&#8217;t go, then I won&#8217;t go either.&#8221; Then the Lord may say, &#8220;Wonderful! Since you won&#8217;t go, stay here and I will be with you.&#8221; In this way I have a sweet fellowship with the Lord. Instead of quarreling, there is only prayer, the prayer of two persons praying together. I pray and He prays with me; He prays in my prayer. What an enjoyment this is! This is to live and walk by the person in us.<p>According to what we are naturally, we are from different countries and different races. We may even be enemies of one another because of our cultural backgrounds or for historical reasons. However, in the church life all enmities have been resolved. Regardless of what kind of people we are naturally, we all have one life and one person through regeneration. We have all been born of the heavenly Father; therefore, we are one. This is a characteristic of the church. In the church there are no differences among colors or races, and neither is there any separation due to language or culture. We have all become one in Christ. We were all baptized into one Body, and we all have one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father (1 Cor. 12:13; Eph. 4:4-6). Now we must stand on the ground of oneness in each locality to be the unique testimony of the Body of Christ and live the practical church life.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST-THE EMPHASIS BEING THAT CHRIST IS THE BELIEVERS&#8217; LIFE AND IS UNITED AND MINGLED WITH THE BELIEVERS</h2><p>The second crucial element of the Bible is Christ. Generally, the initial knowledge of Christians concerning Christ is that He is the Savior (Luke 2:11), the One who is full of love and compassion to save them from hell. After a little reading of the Bible, they may know Him further as the Redeemer (Matt. 20:28), who died and shed His blood on the cross as a ransom for many to satisfy God&#8217;s righteous requirements (1 Pet. 1:18-19; Rev. 1:5b). However, it is not enough to know Christ only to this extent. In addition to knowing Christ as the Savior and Redeemer, we must know Him to a deeper degree, that is, that He is our life and He is also in us to be united and mingled with us. In John 15:5 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit.&#8221; It is a mystery that we abide in the Lord and He abides in us. It is difficult for human language to describe this mysterious union. Just as we abide in the air, and the air also abides in us, today because the Lord is the Spirit, we can abide in the Lord and the Lord can also abide in us. What a miracle! What a mystery! The Lord abides in us and is united and mingled with us! Stanza 1 of Hymns, #233 says, &#8220;O what a miracle, my Lord,/That I&#8217;m in Thee and Thou in me,/That Thou and I are really one;/O what a wondrous mystery!&#8221;<p>The Bible clearly reveals that the Triune God not only coexists but also coinheres; the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son (John 14:10-11). Likewise, we also coinhere with the Lord; we abide in the Lord, and the Lord abides in us (v. 20; 17:21). This is the mingling of the Lord with us. This is a matter not only of the divine life but also in the divine life. Our being united and mingled with the Lord can transpire only in our spirit. Hence, this mingling results in our being joined to the Lord as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). We need to know Christ to such an extent. Eventually, He becomes us and we become Him-He and we are one. He is the Head of the Body, and we are the members of the Body (1 Cor. 12:12-13; Eph. 1:22-23). After His resurrection Christ ascended to the heavens and sat down on the right hand of God (Heb. 1:3; 10:12). Moreover, today He is also the Spirit dwelling in us. He is our life (Col. 3:4a) and our person and is always united and mingled with us. He is also working in us to transform us until He becomes us and we become Him (2 Cor. 3:18). This is the Christ revealed in the holy Word.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT-THE EMPHASIS BEING THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT OF GOD HAS BEEN COMPOUNDED WITH CHRIST&#8217;S DIVINITY, HUMANITY, CRUCIFIXION, AND RESURRECTION TO BE THE COMPOUND, LIFE-GIVING, INDWELLING, SANCTIFYING, TRANSFORMING, AND SEVENFOLD INTENSIFIED SPIRIT</h2><h2 class=head2>The Spirit as the Consummated Triune God</h2><p>The third crucial element revealed in the Bible is the Spirit. Traditional Christianity holds an inaccurate concept concerning the Holy Spirit, considering the Holy Spirit merely to be a power or an inspiring force. It was not until the nineteenth century when the Brethren were raised up in England that some went further to see that the Holy Spirit is not merely a power but God Himself. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery, after many years of studying the Bible, we have seen clearly that the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God after passing through various processes. Therefore, in the Spirit there are the elements of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>The Spirit as the Compound Spirit</h2><p>The holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30:23-25 typifies the Triune God being processed and eventually consummated as the Spirit. The holy anointing ointment contained not only one element; it was compounded with a number of elements. Exodus 30 says that the olive oil and the four kinds of spices added to it were mingled together and compounded to become the holy anointing ointment for the anointing of the tabernacle and all its furniture so that the tabernacle with all its furniture might become most holy, fit to be God&#8217;s dwelling place.<p>In the Bible, olive oil typifies the Spirit of God, God Himself. The four kinds of spices signify humanity in God&#8217;s creation, and oil signifies divinity in the Godhead. Four kinds of spices being mingled with the olive oil to become the holy anointing ointment indicates that the Spirit of God does not merely possess divinity but has been mingled with certain elements. Concerning this, in John 7:37-38 the Lord cried out, &#8220;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&#8221; Then verse 39 explains, &#8220;But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&#8221; At the baptism of the Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit was already present (1:32), but when the Lord cried out to the people, the Spirit was not yet. In the type, the olive oil was already there, but the holy anointing ointment was not yet. It was not until the Lord Jesus was glorified in His resurrection (Luke 24:26) that the Holy Spirit became the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and life-giving Jesus Christ, having both the divine element and the human element, including Christ&#8217;s divinity and humanity with all the essences and realities of His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. All these items were compounded in this Spirit. Hence, this Spirit is now the flowing, living water for us to receive.<p>Today the Spirit is the reality of all spiritual things. The reality of God is the Spirit; without the Spirit, we do not have God. The reality of resurrection is also the Spirit; without the Spirit, we do not have the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ. The Spirit was ultimately consummated by Christ through His processes. As God in eternity with divinity, Christ became a man with humanity and lived the human life on earth for thirty-three and a half years. Then He entered into death, came out of death in resurrection, and ascended to the heavens. These are the processes that He passed through. By passing through all these processes, He became the consummated life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). We may illustrate the compound Spirit with a beverage that is a compound of water with honey, lemon, tea, and salt. When we drink this beverage, we take in not only the water but also the honey, lemon, tea, and salt. Likewise, today the Spirit is the compound Spirit, compounded with the Holy Spirit of God and Christ&#8217;s two natures-the divine nature and the human nature-with His death and resurrection to be the compound, life-giving, indwelling (Rom. 8:11), sanctifying (15:16b), and transforming (2 Cor. 3:18) Spirit. Such a Spirit has the bountiful supply and even is the bountiful supply for our experience and enjoyment (Phil. 1:19). Eventually, this compound Spirit has even become the seven Spirits of God to supply us in a sevenfold intensified way that we may accomplish God&#8217;s divine economy concerning the church in this age of degradation (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6). Today the Triune God is in the church as a person, and Christ is in the believers as a person. The Triune God as a person in the church and Christ as a person in the believers are nothing less than the Spirit. Hallelujah, we have such an all-inclusive Spirit!<h2 class=head1>LIFE-THE EMPHASIS BEING THAT GOD IN CHRIST AS THE SPIRIT OF REALITY IS THE BELIEVERS&#8217; LIFE THAT THEY MAY LIVE HIM OUT AS THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>The fourth crucial element revealed in the Bible is life. Life is the Spirit, of whom we have spoken previously and who is the Triune God Himself. Furthermore, this life is also Christ. God in Christ passed through His various processes and was consummated as the Spirit. Now as the Spirit of reality (John 14:17) He is life to the believers that they may live Him out as the processed Triune God. When we believe in the Lord, this Lord in whom we believe immediately comes into us to be our life and person and to live and move with us. Once we believe in the Lord and receive Him, He also expects us to hand ourselves over to Him. Hence, as the Lord and we receive one another, He and we are mingled with one another. Before we were saved, we were alone in ourselves, but after being saved we are no longer merely ourselves but are united and mingled with the Lord as one. This may be likened to a married life. Before a person is married, he is alone, but after he is married, he is no longer one person living alone but two persons living together. However, a couple living together is an outward matter; the Lord Jesus and we live together by being united and mingled as one. Hence, this is a great mystery (Eph. 5:31-32).<h2 class=head1>LIVING, WALKING, AND BUILDING BY THE SPIRIT</h2><p>We all must clearly see these four crucial elements-the church, Christ, the Spirit, and life. The church is a group of people with the Triune God, having His life. Christ is our Savior and Redeemer, who has come into us to be our life and to be united and mingled with us. The Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God comes into us to be our reality. When we have Him, we have Christ&#8217;s divine nature and human nature, and we also have Christ&#8217;s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Such a One is now in us as our life.<p>Therefore, concerning our living today, we should be able to say as Paul said, &#8220;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God&#8221; (Gal. 2:20). The life we live today is not a life we live by our natural old man. Instead, it is a life we live by faith, a life we live by believing that the invisible Triune God is in us as our person and our life so that we may become members of the church as the Body of Christ, coordinating with all the saints on the ground of oneness as the testimony of the oneness of the Body of Christ.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 15:4; Col. 1:27; Eph. 3:17; Gen. 1:26; 2:9; John 16:12-13; 6:56; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Heb. 1:8; Col. 2:9; John 14:9-10; 3:34; 6:63; 14:23, 25-26; 15:26; 2 Tim. 4:22; John 4:24; Rev. 22:17</h1><h2 class=head1>THE REVELATION OF THE BIBLE BEING NOT FOR DOCTRINE BUT FOR EXPERIENCE</h2><p>Concerning the person of Christ, who is a mystery, we must not merely have objective knowledge in doctrine. Rather, we must have the subjective experience in life. In Christianity, there is the bad habit, the bad influence, of considering everything in the Bible to be merely a doctrine. When preaching God, many merely preach a doctrine, and when preaching Christ, many also merely preach a doctrine. In today&#8217;s Christianity nearly all the truths concerning God and Christ have become theology and are presented altogether in the way of doctrine and theory, and very few people stress experience. However, the purpose of the biblical revelation is not to give us doctrines. The ultimate purpose of the Bible in speaking about God and Christ is for our experience. We may speak about God thoroughly and speak about Christ fully, but if we do not have the experience, both God and Christ have nothing to do with us.<p>Both in the Far East and in the West, there are some, including even former &#8220;co-workers&#8221; among us, who say that we teach heresy. What is the point of their deviation? It is in their paying attention only to doctrines. They say that in our teachings we neglect doctrines and only care for experiences, which are entirely dependent upon and according to feelings. Therefore, some have even published books to slander us, saying that our teachings are &#8220;sensuous&#8221; and are altogether not according to proper doctrines. What we stress, however, is that doctrines are for our experience. Some have argued, saying, &#8220;It is not logical for you to say that Christ lives in you. Consider how big Christ is and how small man is. How can Christ abide in man who is so small? Furthermore, Christ is the great sovereign Master sitting on the throne in heaven. How can man who is so small let Him come into him to abide in him? This is impossible.&#8221; In their consideration, Christ, who is sitting high above in the heavens, has only a representative on earth, who is the Holy Spirit.<p>Nevertheless, the New Testament tells us clearly that the Lord Jesus definitely abides in us. In the Gospels, John 14:23 says, &#8220;Jesus answered and said to him, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; In 15:4 the Lord Jesus goes on to say, &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you.&#8221; Then in the Epistles, Christ&#8217;s indwelling us is a very great and important truth. Colossians 1:27 says, &#8220;Christ in you, the hope of glory.&#8221; Romans 8:9 says, &#8220;The Spirit of God dwells in you. Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.&#8221; Here the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ are used interchangeably; both refer to Christ in verse 10. Ephesians 3:17 goes on further to say, &#8220;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.&#8221; In these verses abide, dwells, and make...home are different words in Greek. The word abide in the Gospel of John denotes something ordinary. In Romans, the word dwells is the verb form of house; it means to reside and is more than to abide. Make...home in Ephesians means more than dwell in Romans. The prefix of this word is a preposition of emphasis, kata. The whole word denotes &#8220;to be deeply rooted down.&#8221; Hence, it is not merely to reside but even more to settle down in a home, to deeply make home. A couple may stay in the home of their relatives or friends, but that is a temporary residing not a settling down. It is not until they move into their own house that they settle down and deeply make their home there without having to move again.<p>In Ephesians 3 Paul prayed that the Father would grant us to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith (vv. 16-17a). Christ&#8217;s making His home in our hearts means that He settles down deeply in our hearts and will never leave. During conferences people come from different places and stay with us only for a while without making their home here. I have been in the Lord&#8217;s ministry for fifty years and have always been traveling. During all this time, I do not know how many people&#8217;s homes I have stayed in, yet I never made my home in any of their homes. It is only when I come back to my own dwelling place that I can make my home there. The Lord Jesus not only dwells in us but also makes His home in our hearts-in our mind, emotion, and will. From this we can see where the mistake of today&#8217;s Christianity is. They preach God only as an objective God; they do not preach Him as the subjective God who dwells in us.<h2 class=head1>MAN BEING A VESSEL TO CONTAIN GOD</h2><p>The Bible begins with God and man. Genesis 1 tells us that after creating the heavens, the earth, and all things, God created man on the sixth day. He had a particular way in creating man; He created man in His image and after His likeness. Image and likeness indicate that man was created not only to be exactly like God but also to be a vessel to contain Him. Romans 9 says clearly that we are God&#8217;s vessels. We were created not as God&#8217;s instruments but as His vessels. A vessel, a container, is not for doing things or for working but for holding something. We may use a glove as an illustration. A glove is made according to the shape and likeness of a hand. Even if you did not know how a glove should be used, as soon as you saw one you would clearly realize that it was made to contain your hand. A glove is made exactly like a hand for the purpose of containing the hand. Likewise, God created man exactly as He is for the purpose of containing Himself.<p>Genesis 1:26 speaks of God&#8217;s creation of man, and then 2:9 speaks of the tree of life. The former deals with the container, and the latter deals with the content. After the creation of man, God planted a garden eastward in Eden and put man there. The tree of life was in the midst of the garden. Moreover, there was a river flowing out to water the garden, and in the river were gold, pearl, and onyx stone. We can illustrate the purpose of God&#8217;s design in creation by a table arrangement. When we have guests coming to visit us at our home, we first arrange the table, then we set a pitcher of water on it, and finally we set the cups out. With one look the guests can readily tell that the cups are for holding the water. Likewise, man was the &#8220;cup&#8221; created by God and the tree of life was the &#8220;water.&#8221; When God put man in front of the tree of life, that indicated that He wanted to be received as life into man as a vessel. The Bible opens with this matter, and as the Bible progresses it also stresses this matter.<h2 class=head1>THE FALLACY IN CHRISTIANITY</h2><p>Some people in Christianity today have only a shallow understanding of biblical truths, yet they slander us, accusing us of teaching heresy. A certain group issued a statement declaring that the fundamental doctrines in the Bible are only the words spoken by Jesus Christ to His twelve disciples on the earth; everything else is not fundamental. They speak boldly and confidently as if they have all reason on their side, but in actuality this exposes their ignorance. Not only has this group made such a statement; some in a major Eastern denomination have also said nearly the same thing. Some among them have said, &#8220;We care only for the four Gospels; we do not care for the Epistles.&#8221; This shows us that in facing such a situation, the Lord&#8217;s recovery is definitely fighting the battle for the truth.<p>In John 16:12-13 the Lord Jesus clearly said to His disciples, &#8220;I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality.&#8221; If the fundamental teachings include only the words spoken by Jesus Christ to His disciples on the earth, would not the Lord&#8217;s word here be self-contradicting? The speaking of the Lord Jesus indicates that He had yet many important things which He could not say to His disciples at that time because they could not understand. They had to wait until later when the Spirit of reality would come and tell them. According to the Bible, after the Spirit had come, through whom did He speak? It was mainly through Paul. The New Testament consists of twenty-seven books, and Paul alone wrote fourteen Epistles. If only what Jesus Christ spoke to His disciples on the earth is counted as fundamental teachings while Paul&#8217;s fourteen Epistles are not, then the New Testament would be reduced by half and thus be incomplete.<p>For the sake of defending the truth, we have published a booklet, What a Heresy-Two Divine Fathers, Two Life-giving Spirits, and Three Gods. In this booklet we have pointed out that, concerning the Triune God, many Christians care only for traditions; they do not care for the plain, accurate words of the Bible. In order to keep the traditions, they even believe in two divine Fathers, two life-giving Spirits, and three Gods. First, Isaiah 9:6 says plainly that the Son is called the eternal Father. Yet some twist this verse by saying that, according to the Hebrew, eternal is not an adjective but a noun; therefore, the eternal Father means the Father of eternity, just as we say that George Washington is the father of the United States and Thomas Edison, the father of electricity. Hence, the eternal Father is another Father, they say, not the Father among the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Second, in 1 Corinthians 15:45b Paul says, &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&#8221; The last Adam, who is Christ, became a life-giving Spirit in resurrection. However, some also twist this verse, saying that it refers to a life-giving Spirit, not the Holy Spirit. In other words, in addition to the Holy Spirit, they believe that there is another life-giving Spirit. Third, concerning the truth of the Triune God, they say that the Father is a God, the Son is a God, and the Spirit is a God, and that the three are separate from one another because They are three persons. This shows us that their knowledge of the truth is altogether shallow and even erroneous. Due to their ignorance concerning the truth, they even ask, &#8220;How can Christ, who is the great sovereign Master, abide in the believers? How can our body, which is so small, contain Him?&#8221; It is evident that these people simply do not know the truth.<p>In Chinese theology there is the teaching of &#8220;three persons, but one body.&#8221; Generally, people understand this phrase as denoting three persons with only one physical body. In a major Eastern denomination, some display a picture depicting a figure with one body and three heads; this is their so-called Trinity. According to the theological history of earlier days, the Western missionaries, in their translation of theological terminology, created the phrase &#8220;three persons, but one body&#8221; through the help of their Chinese teachers. However, body does not refer to a physical body but to substance. Hence, &#8220;three persons, but one body&#8221; should be understood as &#8220;three persons, but one substance.&#8221; Colossians 2:16-17 says that eating, drinking, feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths are all shadows, but the body (substance) is of Christ. This is the proper usage of the word body in the expression &#8220;three persons, but one body.&#8221; I have the confidence to say this since I have thoroughly studied the Bible and searched through theological history.<p>There are also others who say that teaching people to eat the Lord Jesus is a heresy. However, the teaching concerning eating the Lord Jesus is not my teaching; it was taught by the Lord Himself in John 6:57. He said, &#8220;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&#8221; The translators of the Chinese Mandarin Union Version did not dare to translate this verse literally, so they rendered it as &#8220;He who eats My body.&#8221; Their basis is that the Lord twice says, &#8220;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood&#8221; (vv. 54, 56), and that He also says, &#8220;And the bread which I will give is My flesh&#8221; (v. 51b). However, to render verse 57 as &#8220;He who eats My body&#8221; creates a problem because it leads people to believe that the Lord&#8217;s physical body is edible. They do not see that in verse 63 the Lord explains, saying, &#8220;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing.&#8221; This means that the Lord does not give His physical body for people to eat because that profits nothing. What He gives to people is the Spirit who gives life, that is, Himself in resurrection. Not only so, but the Lord&#8217;s word in verses 54 and 56, &#8220;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood,&#8221; implies His death. The separation of blood and flesh indicates that the Lord gave His body and shed His blood for us that we may have eternal life. We have also pointed out that eating the Lord is a figurative way of speaking; it means to receive the Lord into us to be our life supply. This is the true meaning of eating the Lord. Without looking into this matter, however, the opposers are quick to say that eating the Lord is a heresy. Actually, the real heresy is to say that we eat the Lord&#8217;s physical body. That is a lie by which Satan deceives people in his operation in Christianity.<h2 class=head1>TWO STEPS TAKEN BY THE TRIUNE GOD IN ORDER TO BECOME OUR EXPERIENCE</h2><p>We need to see the pure truth in the Word. The Bible shows us that God is triune not for our doctrinal understanding but for our experience and enjoyment. In order to become our experience, the Triune God had to pass through two steps. First, He had to solve the problems in us relating to sin, the self, the natural man, the corrupt nature, Satan, the world, and the ordinances. As fallen people, we have been contaminated by these things. We may be compared to a cup that has become dirty and must be cleaned within and without. Since the Triune God desires to come into us to be our enjoyment, He first needed to go through a procedure to accomplish redemption. This step was carried out by the Lord Jesus Christ. Then, after accomplishing redemption, He can come into us. This is the second step of His process.<p>The teachings taught by many in Christianity today are fragmentary. They teach the Christ who was crucified on the cross but not the Christ who comes into us. They teach that Christ died for us, but they do not teach that Christ lives in us. Christ dying on the cross for us was for redemption, whereas Christ living in us is for being our life. For Christ to solve our problems, He had to be the Redeemer, but for Christ to come into us as our life, He has to be the life-giving Spirit. If Christ were not the Redeemer, He could not solve our problems, but if He were the Redeemer but not the life-giving Spirit, He could not come into us to be our life. Hence, the Bible twice speaks of His &#8220;becoming&#8221; something. First He became flesh (John 1:14), and then He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b).<p>John chapter one says that in the beginning was the Word, the Word was God, and the Word became flesh to be the Redeemer. This is His first &#8220;becoming.&#8221; The first step taken by God was to become flesh that He might have blood to shed for solving all our problems, the main one of which is the problem of sin. Hebrews 9:22 says, &#8220;Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.&#8221; For God to have blood required Him to become flesh. The Lord Jesus was God who became flesh, and in His flesh He was crucified for us on the cross. He said that His blood was poured out for us for the forgiveness of sins (Matt. 26:28). He shed His blood and died, He was buried, and on the third day He was resurrected. Following this, He ascended to the heavens. According to the teaching of certain ones in Christianity, after Christ came down from His throne to redeem us, He returned to His throne and is no longer among us. Nevertheless, the New Testament clearly reveals that in His resurrection Christ, on the one hand, ascended and returned to His throne and, on the other hand, became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). This is the second &#8220;becoming,&#8221; the second step taken by God.<p>In Greek the word became in these two passages of the Bible is an emphatic word; it points to a specific purpose to attain a definite goal. God is a God with an economy, and He has His definite steps to attain a definite goal. God&#8217;s becoming flesh was not a small thing but a great thing; it was a definite step taken by God to arrive at a definite goal, on the negative side to redeem us and on the positive side to release His life. Then the incarnated Christ, the last Adam, took another step with a definite purpose; that is, He became the life-giving Spirit that He may dispense into us the life that He released, which is Himself.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST BEING THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>The Triune God is intimately related to our experience of Christ. Actually, in our proper experience, this Christ is the Triune God. John 1:1 says, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#8221; According to flesh, Christ came out of Israel, out of the tribe of Judah, yet Romans 9:5 says that He &#8220;is God over all, blessed forever.&#8221; He is man, and He is also God. He is God the Son, and He is also the Triune God blessed forever. Hebrews 1:8 says, &#8220;But of the Son, &#8216;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom.&#8217;&#8221; This proves that the Son is God, even the God who sits on the throne. God is triune, including the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. When we say that the Son is God, we do not mean that He is merely one-third of God; rather, we mean that He is the Triune God Himself. This is difficult to explain in doctrine but very easy to understand in experience. When we experience the Son, we experience the Triune God. Not only so, in our experience, God the Father is the Triune God, and so is God the Spirit. We cannot separate the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. All doctrinal problems regarding the Triune God arise out of our subjective mentality.<p>Colossians 2:9 says, &#8220;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&#8221; The fullness of the Godhead, which is the Triune God Himself, dwells in Christ bodily. This means that Christ is the embodied Triune God; the Triune God dwells in Christ in a bodily way. This also means that Christ is the complete Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Hence, Christ is the embodiment of the complete Triune God. This is why we say that, according to the New Testament, our Lord Jesus is the complete Triune God, the entire God.<p>John 14:9 says, &#8220;Jesus said to him, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father.&#8221; Concerning this verse, Christianity has two kinds of explanations. One school says that Christ is the Father, while another school says that He is not the Father but only represents the Father. Both sayings are not completely accurate. To say that Christ only represents the Father is a great mistake, and to say that He is the Father is too direct. The accurate way is to say that Christ is the expression of the Father; therefore, when we see Him, we see the Father. This is why this matter is so marvelous and mysterious. When we see the Son, we see the Father because the Son is the expression of the Father.<p>We cannot separate the Son from the Father. To say that to see the Son is to see the Father means that the Son is here and the Father is also here. Hence, in verse 10 the Lord went on to say, &#8220;I am in the Father and the Father is in Me.&#8221; This indicates that the Lord Jesus is the complete God, and that He is also the embodiment of the complete God. The Father is in Him, and He is in the Father. Hence, when we experience Christ, we are fully involved with the Father. This Christ whom we experience has the Father in Him, and He is also in the Father; They two cannot be separated. When we experience and enjoy Christ, we experience and enjoy the Father who is in Christ and in whom Christ is. By this we can see that the Triune God is not for doctrinal debate but for our experience and enjoyment.<h2 class=head1>THE TRIUNE GOD BEING INSEPARABLE IN OUR EXPERIENCE</h2><p>Christ is the One who is the embodiment of the complete Triune God, who is inseparable. When we have the Lord Jesus, we have God because Christ is God. At the same time, when we have the Lord Jesus, we have the Father because the Father is in Him and He is in the Father. Furthermore, since Christ has become the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection, when we have Him, we have the Spirit also. John 3:34 says, &#8220;For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for He gives the Spirit not by measure.&#8221; He whom God has sent is Christ. He has been sent by God not only to speak the words of God to us but also to give us the Spirit not by measure. He can do this because the words which He speaks to us are spirit and are life (6:63). Every word which He speaks to us is spirit; hence, He gives to us the Spirit not by measure. If we want to receive the Spirit given by Him, we must listen to His words. This indicates that the Spirit is Christ Himself. Hence, when we experience Christ, we experience the Triune God; when we experience Christ, we experience the Father and the Spirit.<p>John 14:23 says, &#8220;Jesus answered and said to him, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; This verse tells us that the Father and the Son will make an abode in the believers. Verses 25 and 26 continue to say, &#8220;These things I have spoken to you while abiding with you; but the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things.&#8221; Verse 26 mentions the Father and the Son, and it also speaks of the Father&#8217;s sending the Holy Spirit in the Son&#8217;s name. This means that when we experience the Son, we experience the Father and the Spirit simultaneously. In our experience the three-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-are one. Unfortunately, under the influence of the traditional theology of Christianity, many people today consider that when they experience Christ, they experience only the Son without involving either the Father or the Spirit. However, if our experience does not involve the Triune God, it is not the genuine experience of Christ. The Bible clearly reveals that Christ is intrinsically involved with the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Christ does not come alone; He comes with the Father. Furthermore, the Father sends not only Christ but also the Spirit in the name of the Son. Anyone who knows the Bible realizes that a name denotes a person. Hence, the name of the Son denotes the person of the Son. The Father sending the Spirit in the Son&#8217;s name means that the Father sends the Spirit in the Son.<p>John 15:26 says, &#8220;But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality, who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me.&#8221; In Greek, the sense of from the Father is that the Spirit of reality, who is sent by the Son, comes not only from the Father but also with the Father. John 14:26 says that the Father sends the Spirit in the Son, and 15:26 says that the Son sends the Spirit from the Father, and when the Spirit comes, He comes with the Father. When we put these two verses together, we see clearly that when the Spirit comes, the Father does not remain in heaven but comes with the Spirit; moreover, the Father does not come alone, but He comes in the Son. This proves that the Son also comes with the Father. This shows us that when Christ comes, the Triune God comes. When we experience Christ, we experience the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.<p>Today&#8217;s problem lies in the fact that we often have preconceived ideas concerning the truth. Due to our subjectivity, we may not enter into the revelation of the Bible, even though we have read it many times. We need to be poor in spirit and ask the Lord to open the eyes of our heart so that we can see clearly that the Triune God is inseparable in our experience. <p>When the Spirit comes, the Triune God comes. The Spirit does not come alone and leave the Father in heaven. John 15:26 says that the Spirit comes from the Father and with the Father. The Father is the source, and when the Spirit comes from the source, He does not leave the source but comes with the source. Similarly, 14:10 says that the Father is in the Son and the Son is in the Father. Hence, when the Father comes, He does not leave the Son but comes in the Son. Furthermore, verse 26 says that the Father sends the Spirit in the Son&#8217;s name, that is, in the Son&#8217;s person. Since the Son and the Father are one (10:30) and They coinhere mutually, the Holy Spirit who is sent comes not only from the Father but also from the Son, and He comes with the Father and with the Son. This proves that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one God, the Triune God, who reaches us to dispense Himself into us as our life and all our supply. Today, Christian theology has completely separated the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. This is due to the lack of the knowledge concerning the Divine Trinity. Actually, it is not possible for us to experience the Son without also experiencing the Father and the Spirit. The Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-cannot and should not be separated.<p>We have seen that in order to be experienced by us, the Triune God needed to pass through two steps. The first step was the Son&#8217;s redemption and the second step is the Spirit&#8217;s application. Hence, Ephesians 2:18 says, &#8220;For through Him [the Son] we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.&#8221; It is impossible to be through the Son but not have access unto the Father. It is also impossible to be through the Son and have access unto the Father but not be in the Spirit. This indicates that if we experience Christ, this will result in our being brought into the experience and enjoyment of the Triune God. If we want to experience the Triune God, we need to experience Christ. Hence, we teach the truth concerning the Trinity not for us to debate with others but for our subjective experience. We all need to have our eyes opened to see that only when we experience the Triune God can we have the real experience of Christ. Our Christ today is not only Christ the Son. He is the all-inclusive Christ, and He is the Triune God.<p>John 14 says that the Father sends the Spirit in the Son, while chapter fifteen says that the Son sends the Spirit from the Father and with the Father. John wrote both the Gospel of John and Revelation, and Revelation 22:17 speaks of the Spirit and the bride. The Spirit is one with the bride, the church. Since verse 17 is at the conclusion of the entire New Testament, the Spirit here refers not merely to the Holy Spirit but to the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. In the Spirit are the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. When the Spirit comes, the Triune God comes. This is the conclusion of our many years&#8217; study of the Word.<h2 class=head1>THE SECRET OF EXPERIENCING CHRIST</h2><p>For us to experience Christ we need to see that Christ has become the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection. First Corinthians 15:45b says, &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&#8221; Here became indicates a process with many things involved. If we link this verse with John 14:26 and 15:26, we can see that the life-giving Spirit is the Spirit who is sent by the Father in the Son and who is also sent by the Son from the Father and with the Father. Furthermore, the Son and the Father come with the Spirit. Therefore, became refers not only to the Son&#8217;s becoming the Spirit through His death and resurrection but also to the Father&#8217;s sending the Spirit in the Son and the Son&#8217;s sending the Spirit from the Father and with the Father.<p>The Lord Jesus was the Word who became flesh. Since the Word was God, the Word&#8217;s becoming flesh was God&#8217;s becoming flesh. The procedure of God&#8217;s becoming flesh was that He entered into Mary&#8217;s womb, being conceived of the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:20). The man Jesus was God becoming flesh with the divine essence and the human essence; hence, He is both God and man. This is truly a mystery. In incarnation, it was God who became flesh, yet He who was born was the Son, whose name was Emmanuel, that is, God with us. Therefore, the Son is God, even the Triune God. This shows us that incarnation involved the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In the two &#8220;becomings&#8221; of the Triune God-His becoming flesh and His becoming the life-giving Spirit-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit all went through a process. For this reason, we say that we cannot experience Christ without involving the Father and the Spirit.<p>Because Christ is the life-giving Spirit, He can enter into us. But which part of our being does He enter? To be sure, it is not our mind. The most our mind can do is help us to apprehend Christ, but it cannot contain Christ. Second Timothy 4:22 says, &#8220;The Lord be with your spirit.&#8221; The Lord is the life-giving Spirit, and we have a regenerated spirit within us. Today the Lord as the life-giving Spirit enters into our regenerated spirit to be with us. Hence, in order to experience Christ we need to exercise our spirit. There may be a table spread with an abundance of food and drink, but unless we eat and drink them, all the abundance has nothing to do with us. If we want to enjoy the rich food on the table, we need to open our mouth to eat and drink. Likewise, Christ our Lord is the One who is God over all, blessed forever. He is God who became flesh to be our Redeemer, and He is the all-inclusive One. However, if He were only on the throne, He would have nothing to do with us. Thank the Lord, today He is the life-giving Spirit, and we also have a spirit within that can contact and receive Him. Hence, by exercising our spirit we can obtain Him, receive Him, and enjoy Him. When we experience Him, at the same time we also experience the Father and the Spirit who are in Him. Hence, we experience the Triune God.<p>In John 20:22 the Lord appeared to His disciples on the evening of the day of His resurrection, and He breathed into them, saying, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit.&#8221; This was the Spirit as the Comforter whom the Lord had promised in chapters fourteen and fifteen. After the Lord promised His disciples in those two chapters, He indicated that He would go to die, be buried, and come back in resurrection. Through His death and resurrection the Lord became the life-giving Spirit, and on the evening of the day of His resurrection He came to His disciples to breathe Himself into them to be their life and everything for the fulfillment of His promise. Likewise, He is in us today as the life-giving Spirit. Simply by exercising our spirit we can experience Him subjectively.<h2 class=head1>TWO ASPECTS OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</h2><p>All the aforementioned matters are related to the essential aspect of the Triune God, concerning His being and His person. The person of God is what Christ is; this is the essential aspect. The Divine Trinity has another aspect, which is the economical aspect. According to the essential aspect, when the Son died on the cross, the Father in Him also passed through death with Him (Acts 20:28b), and the Spirit in Him also participated with Him in crucifixion (Heb. 9:14). However, according to the economical aspect, it is the Son who died on the cross for us to accomplish God&#8217;s purpose. The Father planned, the Son worked to accomplish God&#8217;s plan, and the Spirit applies what the Son accomplished. At the Lord&#8217;s table, as the Son&#8217;s redeemed ones, we first remember the Son and then worship the Father under the leading of the Son. Therefore, what the Lord&#8217;s table involves is not mainly the essential aspect but the economical aspect of the Divine Trinity.<p>All the things mentioned above are crucial and profound truths in the holy Scriptures. The Father is in the Son and the Son is in the Father; this is the essential aspect of the Divine Trinity. On the other hand, the Gospels show us repeatedly that the Son prayed to the Father and even lifted His eyes to heaven while praying (John 11:41; 17:1); this is the economical aspect of the Divine Trinity. If there were only the essential aspect of the Father&#8217;s being in the Son and the Son&#8217;s being in the Father, the two could speak intimately together without the Son praying to the Father. Since the two coinhere and therefore are one, why did the Son still need to pray to the Father by lifting His eyes to heaven? This shows that there is definitely another aspect, which is the economical aspect.<p>Furthermore, the Lord Jesus was conceived and born through the Holy Spirit&#8217;s entering into Mary&#8217;s womb. Hence, the Holy Spirit is the essence of what He is (Matt. 1:20). The man Jesus not only had the human essence; He also had the Holy Spirit in Him as His divine essence. Hence, He is a God-man. However, when He was being baptized in the Jordan River, why did the Holy Spirit descend upon Him like a dove (Matt. 3:16)? He was born of the Holy Spirit so that He had the element of the Holy Spirit within Him (Luke 1:35); this is a matter of essence. But the Holy Spirit&#8217;s descending upon Him in His baptism was as His power for His ministry; this is a matter of economy. The essential aspect concerns His inward being, whereas the economical aspect concerns His outward power. At the birth of the Lord Jesus the Spirit was within Him as His divine being, and when He was baptized to carry out His ministry for God, the same Spirit still had to descend upon Him outwardly to be His power. The same Spirit was first within Him as the Spirit of life and then upon Him outwardly as the Spirit of power. Likewise, when we were regenerated, we received the Spirit of life. Then when we are filled with the Holy Spirit and have the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, we receive the Spirit of power. The Spirit of life within is the essential aspect, whereas the Spirit of power without is the economical aspect.<p>We already have the Spirit within us essentially, but we still need to exercise our spirit daily and pray unceasingly that we may receive power economically. First Thessalonians 5:17 says, &#8220;Unceasingly pray.&#8221; Many people, having a wrong concept, wonder how they can possibly have so many things to pray for unceasingly. Actually, prayer is our spiritual breathing for exercising our spirit to enjoy the Lord. We do not breathe only when we have problems and stop breathing when we have no problems. Likewise, we do not pray only when we have problems. Rather, we contact the Lord all the time. This Lord is the Triune God who is in us as the Spirit. When we pray and exercise our spirit, we touch the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-and we receive the life supply. In our experience these three are inseparable. This is the truth concerning the Divine Trinity. We need to experience this truth richly and subjectively and bear a strong testimony for it.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 9:5; 1 Tim. 2:5; 2 Cor. 3:17; 1 Cor. 1:30; Col. 3:4; Eph. 3:8; Gal. 2:20; 4:19; Phil. 1:20, 21a; 3:8, 10a</h1><h2 class=head1>CHRIST, THE SPIRIT, LIFE, AND THE CHURCH BEING THE EXTRACTS OF THE BIBLE</h2><p>Each of the twelve verses listed above in the Scripture reading contains an extract. These twelve verses may be divided into two sections. The first six verses tell us what Christ is. Romans 9:5 says that Christ is God, who is above all and blessed forever. First Timothy 2:5 says that Christ is man, while 2 Corinthians 3:17 says that Christ is the Spirit. First Corinthians 1:30 tells us that Christ is wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption. Colossians 3:4 says that Christ is our life, and Ephesians 3:8 says that Christ is One who is unsearchably rich. The latter six verses give us the way to experience and enjoy Christ. Galatians 2:20 says that Christ lives in us, and 4:19 says that Christ is being formed in us. In Philippians 1:20 Christ will be magnified, as always, in our body, and in verse 21a for us to live is Christ. Philippians 3:8 speaks of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord, and verse 10a refers to knowing Christ and the power of His resurrection. These are all very sweet experiences.<p>Among the human race, the Bible is a precious book that has its particular position. It has now been translated into many different languages. In human history, there have not been as many books written about any science, theory, or other topic as there have been about the Bible, a book that is truly comprehensive and exhaustive. For two thousand years there have been innumerable books discussing and interpreting the Bible. The Bible speaks not only of God but also of the origin and creation of the universe. It covers astronomy and geography, as well as the beginning and destination of man. In addition, it covers human culture, the conditions among the human race, and everything pertaining to human life. In it we can find science, philosophy, history, and prophecy. By this we can see that the Bible is truly a comprehensive book.<p>The most particular characteristic of the Bible is that it contains many indescribably sweet terms. In human society we cannot find another book that contains so many sweet terms, such as light, life, love, grace, righteousness, and sanctification. Unfortunately, many Bible readers study the Bible according to their own inclination. Those who are inclined toward science study science in the Bible. Those who are inclined toward geology try to learn geology from the Bible. Confucius&#8217;s disciples, who care for propriety and justice, discover ethics in the Bible. In their study of human history, those who love history must study the historical records in the Bible; otherwise, they cannot become experts in their field. Those who study theology surely must scrutinize the Bible thoroughly because it contains many theological doctrines. Throughout the generations many teachers of theology have studied the Bible devotedly and have written profusely. However, what did God intend when He gave us the Bible? Was it for us to study astronomy or geography? Was it to research science, philosophy, or theology? Did He intend to teach us history and ethics? Moreover, why did God give us so many sweet terms in the Bible?<p>I have been saved for sixty years, and in these sixty years there has not been one day that I did not read the Bible. I also have been writing expositions of biblical truths for over fifty years. After this year, I will have finished writing the notes on the entire New Testament. I can say that not only do I have a general view of the Bible, but I have also studied the Bible in a penetrating and thorough way. In these many years I have spoken a great deal on the crucial subjects in the Bible. I have been constantly considering what this comprehensive Bible talks about and what its essence or extract is. When I first went to Taiwan, I studied the Bible with the brothers and sisters every day. In one year we studied sixty topics, which are the sixty topics in The Fundamental Truths in the Bible. However, after studying that many topics, eventually I have to admit that the extracts of the Bible are nothing other than these four items: Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church. In the beginning is Christ, at the end is the church, and in the process are the Spirit and life. These four items-Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church-constitute the biblical science as well as biblical philosophy, astronomy, geography, ethics, history, and theology. Everything spoken of in the Bible is for these four items. Only Christ is the reality; He is the body of all things (Col. 2:17). If there is no Christ, there is no Spirit, and neither are there life and the church. If there is Christ, there is reality and substance. Christ is the Spirit, the Spirit is life, and life produces the church. Without Christ, there is no Spirit; without the Spirit, there is no life; and without life, there is no way to produce the church. Hence, these four items are the extract, the cream, the essence, of the Bible.<h2 class=head1>WHAT CHRIST IS</h2><p>In 1961 I led the saints in Taipei in a study of the riches of Christ to make a list of all the titles of Christ in the Bible. Eventually, we found close to three hundred items. Actually, the names and titles of Christ are not limited to only three hundred; they are unsearchable and inexhaustible. Therefore, in this message we will try to bring out the main points and draw out the extracts, using the twelve verses in the Scripture reading to thoroughly cover so many mysteries.<h2 class=head2>Christ Being God</h2><p>On the side of truth, Romans 9:5 says that Christ is God, who is over all and blessed forever. Confucius of China was very good and was revered as the greatest sage, yet he never dared to say, nor has anyone else ever said, that he was above all and was God blessed forever. Rather, he said, &#8220;Anyone who sins against heaven can no longer pray to heaven.&#8221; This indicates that he admitted that he was man, not God. But when Christ was on the earth, He not only lived out God, but He also told people plainly that He was God. Furthermore, He proved that He was God by signs and wonders and by the words of life.<p>The words spoken by Christ were simple yet mysterious. They were not only lofty but also full of life supply. He said, &#8220;I am...the life&#8221; (John 11:25; 14:6). We have life, but we are not life; Christ, however, is life. Our life is fragile, but His life is transcendent. In Him is life (1:4); only He is life. This word which was spoken by Him is truly high and great. Furthermore, He said, &#8220;I am the light&#8221; (8:12); &#8220;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger&#8221; (6:35); and &#8220;Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever&#8221; (4:14). Besides God, who can speak such words? The sages throughout the ages could not speak such words. In their mind there were even no such concepts as &#8220;the light of the world,&#8221; &#8220;the bread of life,&#8221; and &#8220;the water of life.&#8221; If we search through the writings of the sages, we cannot find such thoughts or concepts. In the six thousand years of human history, only the Lord Jesus repeatedly referred to life, light, the bread of life, and the living water, because He is all these things. What the Lord Jesus is, is the bread of life, the water of life, and the light of life. Therefore, often when He opened His mouth, He referred to these things. Men do not have these concepts in their mentality, so they cannot speak them. About two hundred years ago a French philosopher said that if the Jesus recorded in the four Gospels was a fabrication, then the fabricator was qualified to be Jesus. This is because the words spoken by Jesus were unparalleled before that time or since then. This is especially true in the matter of life. Therefore, His disciples testified, &#8220;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men&#8221; (1:4). What Confucius could speak at most was concerning man&#8217;s &#8220;bright virtue,&#8221; but he could not say that in him was life and that the life was the light shining on people. However, the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life&#8221; (8:12). No philosopher or sage can utter such words. That the Lord Jesus was able to speak such extraordinary words that were unequaled before or after that time proves that He was not ordinary.<p>The Lord Jesus also did many miracles, or signs, on the earth to prove that He was God. However, He did not perform the miracles in a careless way. While He was on the earth, people often challenged Him to perform a miracle for them. He answered, &#8220;An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet&#8221; (Matt. 12:39). However, if necessary He would perform a miracle. The record in Luke 7 tells us that there was a widow in the city of Nain, whose only son died. During the funeral, she was weeping while she walked. She did not ask for a miracle but only wept. Perhaps she felt that neither heaven nor earth would respond to her cry. She never imagined that the Lord of heaven and earth would come at that very moment. When the Lord passed through the city and saw that situation, He was moved with compassion for her. Immediately He came near and touched the bier, saying, &#8220;Young man, to you I say, Arise&#8221; (v. 14), and the dead man became alive and sat up. The Bible shows us many such miracles. He even calmed the winds and the sea (Matt. 8:23-27). All these cases adequately prove that He is the life and the sovereign Master.<p>The Lord Jesus is the life, the light, and the sovereign Master. Therefore, His disciple John wrote in the very beginning of his Gospel, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being&#8221; (1:1-3). He is the Creator, the sovereign Master of heaven and earth, and the real and living One. Hence, no one who believes in the Lord has the sense of being cheated. Rather, nearly everyone regrets that they believed in Him only belatedly. I am glad that I believed in the Lord before I reached the age of twenty, and my faith has become stronger and stronger because the One in whom I believe is the Lord and God.<p>There are many religions in the world, and there are also numerous founders of religion. There are many philosophers as well as ancient teachers and sages. However, among so many notables, none have referred to themselves as the Lord, the sovereign Master, or God. Not only so, but nearly no religion requires people to believe in its founder as a lord. For instance, to believe in Buddhism is to believe in Buddha, not in a lord. But to believe in Jesus is to believe in the Lord because Jesus is the Lord. The universe has a Lord, and every creature in it has a Lord. Perhaps some would say that our parents who gave birth to us are our &#8220;lords,&#8221; but if our parents become sick, they cannot even be their own &#8220;lords.&#8221; Do not consider that the husband is the lord of a family, because when he encounters many situations, he is unable to act as the lord. There is only one Lord in the universe, and He is Jesus Christ. Only He can be our Lord because He is the life. He is the Lord of all, who is able to rule over all the environment. The Lord Jesus is the Lord and the life, and He rules over all things. Hence, He is God over all, blessed forever!<h2 class=head2>Christ Being Man</h2><p>First Timothy 2:5 says that Christ is also man. It is more difficult to speak of Christ as man than to speak of Him as God. Man is very ordinary; there is almost nothing special about being a man. However, the apostle Paul said, &#8220;For there is one God and one Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus.&#8221; This means that the Lord Jesus is not only God but also man; hence, He is qualified to be the Mediator, the go-between, of God and men. This does not mean that He tired of being God and became a man instead, after which He became God again. Rather, in eternity He was God and not man, but two thousand years ago He was born of the virgin Mary through the Holy Spirit to be a man. Since then He is both God and man; He is the God-man.<p>As a man, the Lord Jesus was not remarkable in appearance; He was an ordinary man. One time He entered the city of Jericho, and people crowded around to see Him. Zaccheus was there too, but being small in stature, he climbed up in a sycamore tree in order to see Jesus. As He came to that place, Jesus looked up and spoke to Zaccheus (Luke 19:1-5). If the Lord Jesus had been tall in stature, Zaccheus would not have needed to climb a tree in order to see Him. Moreover, verse 5 indicates that the Lord may have recognized Zaccheus before Zaccheus recognized Him. If the Lord Jesus truly had a remarkable appearance, Zaccheus should have recognized Him first. The Israelites have a wrong concept in thinking that the Messiah is One who is excellent in appearance. The prophet Isaiah said, &#8220;His appearance was marred more than that of any man,/And His form more than that of the sons of men....He has no attracting form nor majesty that we should look upon Him,/Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him&#8221; (Isa. 52:14; 53:2). This is the man Jesus!<p>It is remarkable that in the record of the four Gospels we rarely find expressions such as benevolent, just, moral, and good, which are used to describe the sages. We see, however, a man whose living was a human living, yet it was so wonderful, extraordinary, and perfect that even expressions used by the followers of Confucius for human relationships, morality, and benevolence cannot fully depict it. Although He lived a human life, His living far exceeded benevolence and morality; it is indescribable with human vocabulary. We always create an appropriate vocabulary to express what we have in our human culture, but in human society no one has ever lived a life that was like the one lived by the Lord Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels. Hence, there is no human vocabulary to express that kind of living.<p>In Luke 10 a certain lawyer of the Pharisees stood up and put Jesus to the test. He was elated, considering himself to be wise, unashamed to be a teacher of the Mosaic law, who understood the essence of God&#8217;s law, that is, to love God and to love one&#8217;s neighbor. Wanting to justify himself before the Lord Jesus, he asked Him, &#8220;Who is my neighbor?&#8221; (vv. 25-29). Then the Lord Jesus told a story, a parable that was marvelous yet easy to understand (vv. 30-35). It seems that He used that story to tell the lawyer, &#8220;You are elated and self-justified, yet you do not realize that you are the man who fell from Jerusalem to the place of curse and who was beaten on the way. The Jewish religionists have beaten you half dead, stripped you, and left you alone, and the priests and the Levites, the moralists, have passed by and ignored you. Only a good Samaritan, who was journeying, was moved with compassion toward you and has cared for you in a detailed way. Do you still remember that formerly you said that I am a Samaritan and have a demon (John 8:48-49)? I do not have a demon, but I am definitely a &#8216;Samaritan,&#8217; a lowly person whom you have despised and slandered. I am your neighbor, and only I can take care of you by pouring oil and wine on your wounds to anoint and heal you. I am the very neighbor who loves you.&#8221;<p>This story implies some deep matters. It shows us that we were fallen people &#8220;beaten half dead&#8221; and &#8220;stripped of our clothing.&#8221; Neither the religionists nor the moralists can save us. However, the Lord is the good Samaritan. He was God who became a despised man to pass through human life for us and journey through human life as we do. When He came, He not only saved us but also healed and soothed us with oil and wine. Furthermore, He carried us on His own beast, not in an impressive car or on a big horse but on a little donkey. He brought us to the inn, the church, not in a way to show off His mightiness but in a lowly manner. The Lord did not use a big hotel but a small inn as a type of the church. He entrusted us to the care of the small inn. He also promised that He will return and repay for us all the necessary expenses. Oh, what a sweet and lowly One He is! Actually, good is not adequate to describe the sweetness of His conduct. His kindness, which is far beyond what man can measure, is more than just sacrificing oneself for others. We cannot find any expression on earth to adequately describe His beauty. This is our Lord, the One who is altogether pleasant. He is truly a man, the Man among all men and the Man above all men, outstanding and unequaled in beauty. However, His excellence is not in His appearance or merely in His great actions, but in many small things.<p>In the record of the four Gospels the Lord Jesus twice fed, in a miraculous way, the crowds who followed Him (Matt. 14:14-21; 15:32-39; Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:1-13). On the first occasion there were five thousand, counting only the men. At that time John the Baptist had been beheaded. The Lord Jesus withdrew to a deserted place, but a great crowd followed Him. He was moved with compassion for them and healed their sick. He also spoke the word of God to them all day until evening. The disciples came to Him, saying, &#8220;This place is deserted and the hour is already late. Send the crowds away that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves&#8221; (Matt. 14:15). However, the Lord had mercy on the crowds and told the disciples to prepare food for them. The disciples were troubled, saying, &#8220;We do not have anything here except five loaves and two fish&#8221; (v. 17). The Lord told them to bring the five loaves and the two fish to Him, and He commanded the crowds to recline in companies, by hundreds and by fifties. Then the Lord &#8220;took the five loaves and the two fish and, looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before them; and the two fish He divided among all. And they all ate and were satisfied&#8221; (Mark 6:41-42). The disciples took up what was left over of the broken pieces, which were twelve full handbaskets. This shows us that the Lord Jesus conducted Himself in a way that was not only wise, skillful, fine, and dignified, but also extraordinary and excellent beyond the description of any human language.<p>Today those of us who have some amount of experience of the Lord can testify that when we love Him, pursue Him, and fellowship with Him, we spontaneously live in a condition that is beyond human description. We can endure what others cannot, and we can live a life that others cannot, even a life that goes beyond humility and meekness. We can live such a life because we live by the Lord. The Lord Jesus was a great mystery when He was on the earth. Hence, as the followers of Jesus, we also become a mystery which is incomprehensible to others. At times they think that we should lose our temper, yet we behave as if nothing has happened. At other times, they think that we should jump with joy, yet we act as usual. When they think that we should weep, we still can praise, and when they think that we should exult, we bow down in worship. We live not according to the environment but according to the Lord&#8217;s moving and leading within. Sometimes our environment is very good, and apparently we should be happy and rejoicing. Nevertheless, within we feel that we have fallen short of the Lord&#8217;s glory, that we have not sufficiently caused those who are around us to know the Lord, and that we have not adequately expressed Him and lived Him out before them; therefore, we weep in self-reproach. This is the mystery of being a Christian, which is incomprehensible to the Gentiles.<p>The Lord Jesus appeared before men truly as a genuine man. He was not only transcendent and unparalleled but also full of emotion. When He went to the tomb of Lazarus, He wept in front of the people. The Jews said, &#8220;Behold how He loved him!&#8221; (John 11:35-36). The Lord Jesus wept, however, not because Lazarus had died but because no one there knew God or God&#8217;s heart, and no one was truly united with God to live with God and live out God. Not only the Jews, but even the disciples and the family of Martha, Mary, and Lazarus, who were with the Lord for such a long time and were very much acquainted with Him, did not know God&#8217;s doings. Being grieved in spirit and unable to utter anything, He wept. There are many illustrations in the Gospels showing us that the Lord lived a human life, yet it was a life that surpassed humility, meekness, kindness, and holiness. His life was transcendent yet truly human.<h2 class=head2>Christ Being the Spirit</h2><p>The Lord Jesus not only lived a human life but was eventually crucified for our redemption. Moreover, He was resurrected from death and became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45b). Therefore, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, &#8220;The Lord is the Spirit.&#8221; If the Lord were not the Spirit today, He could not have an organic relationship with us. The Lord&#8217;s intention is not only to live by Himself but to enter into us that we may become His members to be His corporate Body for His expression. However, for Him to enter into us He has to be the Spirit. Both in Greek and in Hebrew the word spirit may also be rendered breath. The Spirit is like the breath, the air. This does not mean, however, that the Lord as the Spirit is no longer a person. As the Spirit, He is still God, and He is also man as a person. Today the God-man Jesus Christ is the Spirit. This is truly a mystery.<p>None of the religions on earth is like Christianity. The true power of Christianity altogether lies in the inner life; this is why Christianity is able to spread worldwide. We are insignificant people, but we can testify that since we believed into the Lord Jesus, we have had an intrinsic power in us that enables us to live out a transcendent life. This is the intrinsic power of Christianity and the story of the life of Christians. We may use sowing as an illustration. If you sow a stone into the earth, there will be no reaction. However, if you sow a seed into the earth, it will sprout after a short while. The soil of the earth may be thick and hard, yet the seed still will sprout and grow because it has the intrinsic life power. Once the intrinsic life power operates, it can break through the limitation of the hard soil. Likewise, within a Christian there is the life power. The source of this power is the Christ who is in us. Now He as the Spirit is with our spirit. If we pray in spirit for just ten minutes, the life power within us immediately begins to operate. This is what is lacking in religion. This also proves that the Jesus in whom we believe, the Lord upon whom we call, is not only the God-man but also the Spirit dwelling in our spirit.<h2 class=head2>Christ Being Our Wisdom: Both Righteousness and Sanctification and Redemption</h2><p>This Christ who is in us is wisdom to us from God (1 Cor. 1:30). Wisdom here does not refer to cleverness; it denotes righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Righteousness is to be proper, accurate, and without mistakes; this is mainly toward others. Sanctification is to be absolutely for God, without any human mixture; this is mainly toward God. Redemption implies that we cannot have wisdom, righteousness, and sanctification by ourselves but by Christ&#8217;s divine life; this is mainly for ourselves. Christ as the God-man is in us as the Spirit, and He is also our wisdom. The more we trust in Him and pray to Him, the more we have wisdom. Once we have wisdom, our walk, our conduct, will be proper, and thus we will have righteousness. Moreover, our actions and attitudes will be sanctified, wholly separated unto God. At the same time, Christ in us is our redemption to save us from anything in which we fall short. This is the excellent One within us. He is God, man, and the Spirit for our wisdom: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.<h2 class=head2>Christ Being Our Life</h2><p>As the Spirit, Christ is not only our inner power but also our life. Colossians 3:4 says that Christ is our life. We live and move on earth because we have life; once we die, we cannot move any longer. As Christians we have not only the human life but also the Lord Christ in us as our surpassing life. He is the Spirit to be our life, by which we may live and walk and be transcendent and excellent, as He is.<h2 class=head2>Christ Having the Unsearchable Riches</h2><p>Christ is God, man, and the Spirit. He is wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption. He is also our life. Hence, He is the all-inclusive One with the unsearchable riches. He is our kindness with justice, our morality, and our virtues. What He is, which far exceeds the kindness, justice, and morality taught by the Chinese sages, cannot be expressed by human language. How rich He is! Whatever we need, He is, and He is abundantly. If we need power, He is our power; if we need patience, He is our patience; if we need virtues, He is our virtues; if we need love, He is our love; if we need consolation, He is our consolation; if we need the leading of light in darkness, He is our light and leading. He is everything, and He is rich and all-inclusive in us. The apostle Paul saw this; therefore, he said that grace was given to him that he might announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel (Eph. 3:8).<h2 class=head1>EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST</h2><p>Christ is not merely our Savior. Rather, He is God, man, the Spirit, our wisdom-righteousness, sanctification, and redemption-our life within, and the One who is all-inclusive and unsearchably rich. Such a One is in us today to be our life and everything that we may experience and enjoy Him.<h2 class=head2>No Longer We Living, but Christ Living in Us</h2><p>Paul said that Christ is the treasure that we contain as earthen vessels, vessels that are worthless and fragile (2 Cor. 4:7). We are earthen vessels, yet within us, the earthen vessels, is Christ as the treasure. Therefore, to experience and enjoy Christ, we first must not live by ourselves but let Christ live in us (Gal. 2:20).<h2 class=head2>Christ Being Formed in Us</h2><p>In Galatians 4:19 Paul says, &#8220;My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you.&#8221; This means that we need to pass through a period of travailing in order for Christ to be formed in us. When we were newly saved, the life in us was like an infant in the beginning stage of pregnancy. Christ is our life, but at first we do not have much inner sense of life and do not know how to live by Him. It takes nine months of pregnancy for a baby to be fully formed in the mother&#8217;s womb. Likewise, we need to continually practice living by Him and thus pass through a time of travailing that Christ may be formed in us.<p>What kind of life should we live today as Christians? Is it merely a life of normal human relationships or a life of morality? We should live a life of having Christ formed in us. This is not an easy thing because we are too natural and too accustomed to living by our natural life. Unconsciously we still live a proper life, a righteous life, but not a life of having Christ formed in us. If we do not live by Christ, we still cannot have Christ formed in us even if we have no faults. To have Christ formed in us and to be faultless are altogether two different things. Copper and gold may be very much alike in appearance, but their inner content is altogether different, and their degree of preciousness is also quite distinct. We may live by our natural life and even become perfect men, but we are still human beings; we are merely copper, not gold. Only a life that allows Christ to be formed in us is a life of gold. We all need to endeavor and strive that Christ may be formed in us.<h2 class=head2>Magnifying Christ</h2><p>In Philippians 1:20 Paul said, &#8220;According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.&#8221; What Paul hoped for here was not that morality, kindness, normal human relationships, or patience may be magnified, but that Christ may be magnified. Our problem today is that after we are saved, we keep trying to be a proper Christian living a pure and faultless life. Whereas formerly we had an irritable temperament, now we hope to be gentle; whereas in the past we had a wrong attitude, now we hope to be proper. However, even if we become faultless, that is still not Christ. The question is, What do we express? Whether we express temper or patience, both are wrong because neither is Christ. The only One whom we should express is Christ.<h2 class=head2>&#8220;To Live Is Christ&#8221;</h2><p>Like Paul, we should hope that we magnify Christ, as always, whether through life or through death. This means that, instead of letting others see our patience, humility, sanctification, goodness, and perfection, we should let them see Christ being lived out in us. We live Him out to such an extent that for us &#8220;to live is Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:21a).<h2 class=head2>Gaining Christ</h2><p>In order to live and magnify Christ, Paul said that he suffered the loss of all things and counted them as refuse that he might gain Christ (Phil. 3:8). The &#8220;all things&#8221; to which Paul refers are not the worldly, material things; rather, they are the things implied in verses 5-6, things of lofty thoughts and profound logic, such as religion, philosophy, culture, morality, and especially the law given by God through Moses. Paul was zealous for the law to such an extent that he said that he was blameless according to the righteousness which was in the law. However, after he was saved, the things in which he trusted in his flesh, including the righteousness of the law, he counted as loss because they became replacements of Christ that distracted him from Christ and made it impossible for him to experience Christ, live Christ, and magnify Christ. Hence, he cast all those things aside completely, counting them as refuse on account of the excellency of the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. He aspired to experience Christ, gain Christ, and be found in Christ (v. 9).<h2 class=head2>Knowing Christ and the Power of His Resurrection</h2><p>To know the excellency of Christ is one thing, while to experience Christ is another thing. Paul first received the revelation to know the excellency of Christ. Then, because of such knowledge, he was willing to pay the price by considering all things to be loss, refuse, that he might gain Christ. He desired Christ to such an extent that he longed to &#8220;know Him&#8221; and &#8220;the power of His resurrection&#8221; (v. 10). Such knowledge is not objective doctrine but subjective experience. To know the excellency of Christ Jesus is by revelation, but to know Christ is by experience. It is to have the experiential knowledge of Him, to experience Him in the full knowledge of Him. Eventually, Paul experienced and enjoyed Christ; that is, he had the experiential knowledge of Him and experienced Him in the power of His resurrection. To experience Christ requires us to be in the power of His resurrection, not in our natural life. We can know, experience, and enjoy Christ by the power of His resurrection.<h2 class=head1>A CONCLUDING WORD</h2><p>In conclusion, from the preceding twelve items we can see clearly that in actuality to be a Christian is to believe not in a religion but in Christ. What Christianity should offer to people is not religion but Christ. This Christ is excellent, living, and pleasant. He is God, He is man, and He is the Spirit who enters into us. Subjectively, He is in us to be our wisdom: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption; He is in us to be our life; and He is in us as the One who is all-inclusive and unlimitedly rich with the bountiful supply to be everything to us.<p>Toward such a One our reaction should be that it is no longer we who live, but it is Christ, who is God, man, and the Spirit, who lives in us. He is waiting to be formed in us, He wants us to live Him out and express Him, even to the extent that for us to live is Christ. We should consider the knowledge of Christ as something excellent and aspire to know such a Christ and the power of His resurrection. Thus, the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection will operate in us so that our living is full of the experience and enjoyment of Him.<p>Dear brothers and sisters, this is the complete gospel. When we believe in the Lord Jesus, we receive Him into us not only as our Savior but also as the real and living One to be our life and everything. I hope that our eyes will be opened so that we can see this, be inclined to this, and therefore have more prayer and practice. I also hope that more people will receive this grace and enjoy this blessing.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 7:37-39; 14:16-20; Acts 16:7b; Rom. 8:9b; Phil. 1:19; 2 Cor. 3:17; Rom. 8:16; Rev. 2:7; 3:22; 14:13; 22:17; John 6:63b</h1><p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You as the fountain of living water for our satisfaction. Lord, we come to drink of You again. May You satisfy us more and more. Open Your word to us, Lord, and wash and renew us with the water in Your word. May You, as the cleft rock, flow forth the living water again to us that we all may be refreshed, satisfied, and rejoicing in our heart. We desire to praise You aloud and bear Your testimony forever. Amen.<h2 class=head1>THE CENTER OF THE BIBLE BEING CHRIST</h2><p>In order for us to love a certain thing, that thing must be lovable. Actually, we love something not because we are capable of loving; rather, it is because a certain thing is lovable and we are drawn to love it. We are very reluctant to love something that is not lovable, but it is difficult for us to refrain from loving something that is lovable. Likewise, we love the Lord because we are attracted by His loveliness. He is very attractive. In the past two thousand years, innumerable people have been attracted and charmed by Him, and we are among them. Sometimes our relatives and friends rebuke us, saying, &#8220;Why do you believe in Jesus so blindly?&#8221; We do not know why and we cannot explain it, but we are simply charmed by the Lord Jesus because He is truly full of attractiveness.<p>This Christ who is full of attractiveness and rich in magnetism is the essence of the Bible. The Bible covers thousands of items and deals with a great number of doctrines, but it has only one center-Christ Himself. Let us use the human body as an illustration. We can see skin and hair on the surface, touch the flesh and bones within, and examine the internal organs through dissection or by an x-ray. However, the center, the essence, of man, which is man&#8217;s life, is neither visible nor touchable, yet it is real and crucial. Likewise, the Bible has its &#8220;skeleton&#8221; and &#8220;skin.&#8221; If we touch or see only these things in our reading of the Bible, we are not different from the unbelievers in their reading of the Bible. We must realize that the Bible also has its life, its essence. The life, the essence, of the Bible is Jesus Christ.<p>The Bible consists of two sections: the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Old Testament speaks of Christ with a great part in types and a considerable part in prophecies but nearly with no plain words. This may be compared to the teaching material in kindergartens that consists of very few plain words but many pictures. The teaching material in graduate schools, however, contains very few pictures; instead, it contains many classical writings. Although the Old Testament, like the teaching material in kindergartens, consists mostly of pictures with very few plain words, it is not simple to understand the meaning of the pictures. Therefore, concerning the types in the Old Testament, we need to understand their significance.<h2 class=head1>THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2><p>There are six major categories of types in the Old Testament. The first category is human beings; the second, animals; the third, plants; the fourth, minerals; the fifth, offerings; and the sixth, foods. All these six major categories contain types of Christ.<h2 class=head2>Human Beings</h2><p>Some examples from the category of human beings are Adam, typifying Christ as the head of the human race; Isaac, typifying Christ as the seed of Abraham; and Solomon, the son of David, typifying Christ as the seed of David. Christ is not only the head of the human race but also the seed of man and the seed of woman. He is the King, the Priest, and the Prophet. As the King, He is typified by Judah and David; as the Priest, He is typified by Melchisedec and Aaron; and as the Prophet, He is typified by Isaiah and Jonah. Hence, to understand all the portrayals of Christ in the aspect of human beings, we have to study Adam, Abraham, David, Solomon, Melchisedec, Aaron, Isaiah, Jonah, and others.<h2 class=head2>Animals</h2><p>Now we come to the category of animals. This is even more mysterious. Christ is a lamb, an ox, a lion, an eagle, a dove, and a turtledove. As a lamb, He became an offering to deal with our sins for our redemption. As an ox, He was not only made an offering but also became lowly to bear our burdens as a slave of God for us. As a lion, He is the victorious One overcoming Satan on our behalf. As an eagle, He is the transcendent and heavenly One who carries us that we may rise above everything. As a dove, He is beautiful and guileless, and as a turtledove, He is lowly and poor. Furthermore, these types have their sequences. First there is the dove and then the eagle; first there is the Lamb which was slain and then the overcoming Lion of the tribe of Judah. Christ is not only the cattle and the fowl, but He is even the bronze serpent. He told Nicodemus, &#8220;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up&#8221; (John 3:14). This means that when He was crucified on the cross, He was the bronze serpent, which had the form of the serpent but was without the serpent&#8217;s poison. He had the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3) but was without the reality of sin (Heb. 4:15; 2 Cor. 5:21). Christ is One who is truly rich.<h2 class=head2>Plants</h2><p>Among the plants, there are even more types concerning Christ. The Lord said that He is the true vine (John 15:1). There is only one vine in the universe that is true, and this true vine is Christ. Song of Songs 2:3 says that He is the apple tree. Moreover, the Old Testament tells us that the different parts of a tree are also types of Christ: Christ is the root (Isa. 11:10; Rev. 5:5), the stem, and the stump; He is also the branch (Isa. 11:1) and the fruit (4:2; Rev. 22:2). Furthermore, the New Testament tells us that He is the fruit of Mary&#8217;s womb (Luke 1:42). The most mysterious thing is that Christ is the tree itself. He is the unique tree of life in the universe. He is also the acacia wood, which signifies that His humanity is noble and strong in quality and lofty and superior in standard. He is truly marvelous!<h2 class=head2>Minerals</h2><p>Now we come to the types seen in the minerals. Christ is the pure gold, silver, brass, and iron (Deut. 8:13, 9). He is different kinds of stone: the living stone (1 Pet. 2:4), the rock (1 Cor. 10:4; 1 Pet. 2:8), the cornerstone (v. 7; Matt. 21:42), the topstone (Zech. 4:7), and the foundation stone (1 Cor. 3:11). If we study the gold, silver, precious stones, and different kinds of stone that are mentioned in the Old Testament, we can see that Christ is not simple.<h2 class=head2>Offerings</h2><p>Furthermore, there are the types seen in the offerings, which are even more difficult to explain. We have covered these to a great extent in the life-studies of the Pentateuch. In the Old Testament, Exodus is an introduction to the offerings, Leviticus is the text, and Numbers and Deuteronomy are the supplements. There are five main offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. In addition, there are the wave offering, the heave offering, the voluntary offering, and the drink offering. These are all types of Christ.<h2 class=head2>Foods</h2><p>There are also the foods that are types of Christ. As food, Christ is the bread of life (John 6:35), the manna descended from heaven (v. 51), and the hidden manna (Rev. 2:17). He is also various kinds of choice fruits-grapes, figs, pomegranates, and olives (Deut. 8:8). He is the fruit of the tree of life (Rev. 2:7), as well as wheat, barley, milk, and honey (Deut. 8:8; 6:3), to be man&#8217;s supply and nourishment.<p>These six major categories in the Old Testament are all types of Christ. Even if you have read through the entire Old Testament, you do not understand it unless you know these six categories. If we thoroughly study these matters, the Old Testament will be transparent and open to us.<h2 class=head1>THE REALITY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><h2 class=head2>The Forerunner and His Whole Family Being Filled with the Holy Spirit</h2><p>In the New Testament, the One who is portrayed, typified, and prophesied in the Old Testament came. His coming began by the Holy Spirit. Prior to His coming, His forerunner, John the Baptist, was filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother&#8217;s womb (Luke 1:15). Holy Spirit is the first divine title ascribed to the Spirit of God in the New Testament. Such a title is not used in the Old Testament. The Old Testament refers only to the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jehovah but not to the Holy Spirit. In Psalm 51:11 and Isaiah 63:10-11, Holy Spirit should be translated Spirit of holiness. It was at the New Testament time, for the initiation of the gospel of God to prepare the way for the Savior&#8217;s coming and to prepare a human body for Him, that this divine title of God&#8217;s Spirit was used. The preparing of the way for the Savior&#8217;s coming required that His forerunner be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother&#8217;s womb.<p>One day, in the sixth month of the conception of John the Baptist in his mother&#8217;s womb, Mary went to visit John&#8217;s mother. At that time the conception of Christ the Savior had just begun in Mary&#8217;s womb. Upon hearing Mary&#8217;s greeting, John was filled with the Holy Spirit and leaped in his mother&#8217;s womb. Elizabeth his mother was also filled with the Holy Spirit and blessed Mary greatly (Luke 1:39-45). After the birth and naming of John, Zachariah his father was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied with praise to God (vv. 57-79). In this family of three, first the child was filled with the Holy Spirit in the mother&#8217;s womb, then the mother was filled with the Holy Spirit, and then, after the birth of the child, the father was filled with the Holy Spirit. This was a family filled with the Holy Spirit, with the child taking the lead and the parents following. The families in the world are mostly led by the parents to be filled with all kinds of worldly amusements and matters. Sometimes a father plays mah-jongg, the mother follows, the son helps, the daughter joins in, and the daughter-in-law and son-in-law also come. The whole family, from the old to the young, are filled with mah-jongg. The household of John the Baptist, however, was filled with the Holy Spirit, from the young to the old. How wonderful this is!<h2 class=head2>Born as the God-man in the Flesh through the Holy Spirit</h2><p>John the Baptist was filled with the Holy Spirit to such an extent that when he grew up, he did not serve as a priest, live with the priestly family, eat the priestly food, or wear the priestly garment. Instead of staying in Jerusalem, he went into the wilderness to be far from human religion and culture and thus became a &#8220;wild&#8221; person. He wore a &#8220;wild garment&#8221;-a garment of camel&#8217;s hair; he ate &#8220;wild food&#8221;-locusts and wild honey; and he did a &#8220;wild thing&#8221;-baptizing the repentant people in the Jordan River. Even so, John the Baptist was only filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly. The Holy Spirit was the One poured upon him outwardly, not the One entering his human nature with the divine nature to produce a mingling of divinity with humanity. In John the Baptist we cannot see divinity entering into humanity to be mingled with humanity; we can only see the Holy Spirit being poured upon him.<p>The conception of John the Baptist was strikingly different in essence from that of the Lord Jesus. In the conception of John, the Holy Spirit was poured upon him, but in the conception of the Lord Jesus, there was the mingling of the Holy Spirit with the human essence. Matthew 1:18 and 20 say of Mary that she &#8220;was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit&#8221; and &#8220;that which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; This indicates that the Holy Spirit, with whom John the Baptist was filled, entered into Mary&#8217;s womb and begot in her the divine essence and thus caused her to conceive. Such a conception of the Holy Spirit in the human virgin, accomplished with the divine and human essences, constituted a mingling of the divine nature with the human nature, which produced a God-man, One who is both the complete God and the perfect man, possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctly, without a third nature being produced. This God-man is truly God and truly man. On the one hand, He is the Son of the Most High God (Luke 1:35); on the other hand, He is the Son of Man, the seed of woman. Although the divine nature and the human nature were mingled in Him, they were not confused. This may be likened to the blending of tea and water to become a drink, without either element losing its nature. At this stage, through incarnation God was mingled with man and divinity was brought into humanity that God might be manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16) and might be a Man-Savior (Luke 2:11) to live on earth for thirty-three and a half years.<h2 class=head2>Living the God-man Life by the Holy Spirit</h2><p>The Lord Jesus began to minister at the age of thirty. As soon as He was baptized, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him, that is, was poured upon Him. We may use the baking of cakes for the meal offering as an illustration. In some cases, the oil was poured upon the cakes; in other cases, the oil was first mingled with the fine flour to make the cakes, and then the oil was poured upon them (Lev. 2:4-5). John the Baptist may be likened to the former, and the Lord Jesus to the latter. John merely had the Holy Spirit poured upon him as his power; he did not have the divine nature in him. The Lord Jesus, however, was conceived of the Holy Spirit; such a conception was essential and was related to the divine being of Jesus. The Holy Spirit accomplished the mingling of divinity and humanity in Jesus. The essence of the Holy Spirit&#8217;s divine element was unchangeable and irremovable. On the other hand, the Holy Spirit descended upon Jesus at His baptism as His power for His ministry. This power could be removed from Him when there was the need for it (Matt. 27:46). Hence, when He came out to minister, He not only had the Holy Spirit outwardly as power, but He already had the Holy Spirit in Him as the essence.<p>We cannot compare with the Lord Jesus even in His human nature, not to mention that the divine nature was in His human nature. This is why we stress repeatedly that the vocabulary of the human race cannot adequately describe the Lord Jesus. In human history and culture there has never been another one like Him. He was most extraordinary. In addition to His sweet humanity, He possessed divinity. He was like a great magnet attracting people to Him. At the seashore of the Sea of Galilee, seeing Peter, Andrew, James, and John, He spoke only a brief word: &#8220;Come after Me.&#8221; And they immediately quit their fishing, cast off their nets, and left their boats and their fathers to follow Him (Matt. 4:18-22). Many of us have also been attracted by Him and therefore follow Him willingly.<h2 class=head2>Bringing Humanity into Divinity and Being Glorified to Become the Spirit through His Death and Resurrection</h2><p>One day, on the last day of the Jews&#8217; Feast of Tabernacles, the great day of their feast, this One who was God mingled with man stood up and cried out, saying, &#8220;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink&#8221; (John 7:37). We may not marvel at such a word at first, but after some careful consideration, we may wonder what it means. Confucius could not say and dared not to say, &#8220;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.&#8221; Yet the Lord Jesus called people to come to Him and drink. If someone who was thirsty came to Him, what kind of drink would He give him? How would He quench his thirst? Hence, the Lord Jesus explained, saying, &#8220;He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&#8221; (v. 38). This indicates that to come to Him and drink is to believe into Him. Once we believe into Him, not only is our thirst quenched, but there are even rivers of living water flowing out of our innermost being. The Lord Jesus is attractive to us because He can quench our thirst. He gives us the living water when we come to Him. Once we drink this water, we are glad and are beside ourselves. Moreover, we even have living water flowing out of our innermost being. This is truly a mystery.<p>How can this be? The apostle John told us, &#8220;But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive&#8221; (v. 39a). We know the Spirit of God, we can understand the Spirit of Jehovah, and we know a little concerning the Holy Spirit, but what is &#8220;the Spirit&#8221; referred to here? In Greek, there is a great emphasis in using the definite article. The presence of the article the before Spirit is emphatic in Greek, indicating that the Spirit referred to is a very particular Spirit. What is &#8220;the Spirit&#8221;? John went on to say, &#8220;The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified&#8221; (v. 39b). We have seen that the conception of the Lord Jesus was the issue of the Holy Spirit&#8217;s entering into humanity. Therefore, at that time the Holy Spirit was already there. But at the time the Lord Jesus spoke this word, &#8220;the Spirit&#8221; was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified. Therefore, in order to know what &#8220;the Spirit&#8221; is, we must first find out when the Lord Jesus was glorified and what the issue of His glorification was.<p>According to John&#8217;s writing, the Lord Jesus was God incarnated to be a man (1:1, 14). He was the God-man living the human life on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. Then He went to the cross and was crucified for us, shedding His blood for our redemption and releasing His divine life (19:34). After three days He was resurrected from death. His resurrection was His glorification (Luke 24:26; 1 Cor. 15:43a). No one may be able to recognize the seed of a flowering plant, but when it is sown into the soil, it sprouts, grows, and blossoms. This is the seed&#8217;s being glorified and thereby being manifested to people. The Lord Jesus was such a seed. He was man, yet He had God in Him; He was God who became flesh. His human living was incomprehensible to the Jews (John 10:24). Even those in His family could not fully understand Him; they were only able to tell that He was subject to them (Luke 2:48-51). When He came out to preach in His ministry at the age of thirty, He attracted a group of people, especially the twelve disciples, to follow Him. The twelve disciples were attracted by Him, and they followed Him daily, yet they did not know Him that well (Matt. 8:23-27). They only knew that it was truly wonderful to follow Him, and they expected that for their whole life they would follow this Jesus who was in the flesh.<p>However, those good circumstances did not last long. One day, after they had been following the Lord Jesus for less than three years, suddenly He indicated to them that He was going to die. He said, &#8220;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day. For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink&#8221; (John 6:54-55). Here the Lord spoke of flesh and blood being separated, clearly indicating His death, that is, His being slain. When the disciples heard this word, they may have known that He spoke of death. Because they were unable to bear it, they said, &#8220;This word is hard; who can hear it?&#8221; (v. 60). Moreover, no one understood what the Lord subsequently said concerning His resurrection and ascension: &#8220;Then what if you saw the Son of Man ascending to where He was before?&#8221; (vv. 61-62). From that time many of His disciples went back to what they had left behind and no longer walked with Him.<p>On the last day of the feast, the Lord Jesus told the crowd, &#8220;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified&#8221; (7:37-39). When the people heard this word, many of them, including the disciples, may have gathered together for a discussion, saying, &#8220;What is the Spirit? In the Old Testament there were only the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jehovah. What does it mean to be glorified? Does it mean to be enthroned as a king?&#8221; Not only the Jews and the disciples in the ancient days were perplexed; many Christians throughout the generations have felt the same way.<p>After our many years of studying the Word and of experience, and after our reading the writings of many people, the Lord has opened our eyes to see that God&#8217;s becoming flesh brought divinity into humanity. However, this human part had not been made divine but remained human. It still needed to go through the process of resurrection. Through His death and resurrection His humanity was brought into divinity. The resurrection of the Lord Jesus was His glorification because His humanity was brought into divinity through resurrection and was thus glorified.<p>According to the Scriptures, the Lord Jesus had two births. The first was His birth in incarnation. He was God, but He came out of the womb of a virgin and was born to be a man. This was divinity being born into humanity. Therefore, the Lord Jesus was a man with divinity. He was truly a man, a genuine man, a perfect man, yet He lived with divinity in Him. However, His humanity was still humanity and had not entered into divinity. He still needed to pass through the process of death and resurrection. Crucifixion brought Him into death, and death ushered Him into resurrection. Through such a process His humanity was brought into divinity. This was His second birth. Hence, Acts 13:33 says, &#8220;You are My Son; this day have I begotten You.&#8221; This day refers to the day of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. This means that in resurrection the humanity of the Lord Jesus was born into divinity.<p>Since the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, there has been a God-man in the universe with His divinity brought into humanity and His humanity brought into divinity. This One became the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45). Then on the night of His resurrection He came into the midst of His disciples and breathed into them, saying, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; (John 20:19, 22). The Holy Spirit here is the Spirit referred to in John 7:38-39, because this is the Spirit whom the Lord has become in His glorification through resurrection that the believers may receive Him into them and that He may flow out of them as rivers of living water.<h2 class=head1>THE ESSENCE AND SPHERE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT BEING THE SPIRIT</h2><p>The Old Testament speaks of Christ by way of allegories and types. Although this makes it easy for people to comprehend, they still cannot easily have a full understanding. A picture is always better than a thousand words. When we look at the pictures in the Old Testament, we can right away understand their apparent, superficial, and literal side. However, unless the Lord opens the understanding of our mind, we really cannot understand the intrinsic, deep, and essential significance contained in them. As we have seen, the Old Testament speaks about Christ with types in six major categories: human beings, animals, plants, minerals, offerings, and foods. The New Testament continues by speaking of Christ altogether in plain words. In speaking about Christ, the New Testament does not mainly use types, such as human beings, animals, plants, minerals, offerings, and foods. Instead, it speaks of Christ as the Spirit. In the New Testament, Christ is presented altogether with the Spirit as the center, the element, and the sphere. Hence, the Spirit is the essence, the factor, of the New Testament. The New Testament opens with a revelation showing us that John the Baptist was filled with the Holy Spirit even when he was in his mother&#8217;s womb, and then his mother and father were also filled with the Holy Spirit. Then it goes on to show that Jesus was altogether conceived and born through the Holy Spirit&#8217;s entering into humanity. He was One who had humanity with divinity and who lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, died on the cross, and resurrected, through which He brought humanity into divinity. In resurrection He became such a wonderful One, One who is divinity in humanity and humanity in divinity.<h2 class=head2>The Lord Being the Spirit</h2><p>First Corinthians 15:45b says, &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&#8221; The last Adam is the One who brought divinity into humanity. Then through death and resurrection He brought humanity into divinity, and He became the life-giving Spirit. Most Christians dare not touch this verse because it does not fit in with their theology and tradition. In a certain part of Christianity, the Father is pictured as an old father sitting down, the Son as a young man standing beside Him, and the Holy Spirit as a dove soaring in the air. This picture represents the Trinity in today&#8217;s Christianity. The Scriptures, however, indicate that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not separate. When the Son came, the Father came with Him (John 8:16, 29; 16:32). Moreover, the conception of the Son was of the Holy Spirit; He was begotten by divinity entering into humanity. When the Son came out for His ministry, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him as His power. Then, through His death and resurrection He brought humanity into divinity. He is such a mysterious and marvelous One. After passing through these mysterious and marvelous processes, He became the life-giving Spirit. The apostle Paul saw such a revelation clearly and boldly declared, &#8220;The Lord is the Spirit&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:17). This means that Christ in resurrection is not only the life-giving Spirit but also &#8220;the Spirit.&#8221;<h2 class=head2>The Spirit Coming into Existence after a Process</h2><p>In creation there was only the Spirit of God (Gen. 1:2). In the Old Testament, in God&#8217;s relationship with man and in His dealings with man, there was the Spirit of Jehovah (Judg. 3:10). In the beginning of the New Testament, the Holy Spirit came to carry out the work for the preaching of the New Testament gospel. First, He prepared a forerunner, John the Baptist, and then He entered into the womb of a virgin to bring divinity into humanity, thereby producing a God-man. This God-man lived a human life in His humanity mingled with divinity for thirty years. Afterward, when He came out for His ministry, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him to anoint Him. However, in John 7 we are told that the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified. This means that at that time the Lord Jesus had not yet died and resurrected. Eventually, He passed through death and resurrection and brought humanity into divinity. Thus, His entire being is divinity in humanity and humanity in divinity. Such a One became the life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit is all-inclusive, having divinity, humanity, human living with divinity in humanity, the all-inclusive death, the effectiveness of the redemption accomplished on the cross, the all-overcoming resurrection, and the power of resurrection. All these elements are in the life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is all-inclusive, yet His title is very simple-the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>The Content of the Entire New Testament Being the Spirit</h2><p>The sequence of the four Gospels is wonderful. At the beginning Matthew says that Mary conceived through the Holy Spirit and brought forth a God-man; at the end John says that this God-man became the Spirit and was breathed into His disciples. At the conclusion of the Gospels, the God-man Jesus, who brought divinity into humanity through incarnation and who also brought humanity into divinity through death and resurrection, became the Spirit. As such, He breathed Himself into His disciples as their life and everything and sent them with His commission, qualifying them to represent Him with His authority for the carrying out of His commission (John 20:22-23; Matt. 28:18-20).<p>After the four Gospels, there is the book of Acts. Acts is altogether a story of the Spirit. Many Bible readers recognize that the Acts of the apostles is the Acts of the Spirit and the biography of the Spirit. In Acts 16:7 we see a new term, the Spirit of Jesus. Do not think that the Spirit of Jesus is different from the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Holy Spirit. The Spirit of Jesus and the Holy Spirit in the preceding verse are used interchangeably, revealing that the Spirit of Jesus is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a general title of the Spirit of God, while the Spirit of Jesus is a particular expression concerning the Spirit of God and refers to the Spirit of the incarnated Savior who, as Jesus in His humanity, passed through human living and death on the cross. This indicates that in the Spirit of Jesus there is not only the divine element of God but also the human element of Jesus and the elements of His human living and His suffering of death. When Paul and his company of co-workers went out preaching in their ministry, they were led and controlled by the Spirit of Jesus.<p>After the book of Acts, there are the Epistles, and the first book of the Epistles is Romans. Romans 8:9 says of the Spirit of Christ, &#8220;If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.&#8221; The Spirit of Jesus is related mainly to the Lord&#8217;s humanity and human living with its sufferings and death, while the Spirit of Christ is related mainly to the Lord&#8217;s resurrection and power of life. Then in Philippians 1:19 we see the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the Spirit mentioned in John 7:39, the Spirit related to death and resurrection, in whom is the bountiful supply, having the element of death, the effectiveness of death, the element of resurrection, and the effectiveness of the resurrection power. Such a Spirit has the bountiful supply and even is the bountiful supply. The fourteen Epistles of Paul all speak at some length concerning this Spirit.<p>In Revelation, the last book of the Bible, the Holy Spirit is not mentioned at all. The term the Holy Spirit cannot be found anywhere in the entire book of Revelation. Rather, it speaks of &#8220;the Spirit.&#8221; In chapters two and three it is the Spirit speaking to the seven churches: &#8220;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches&#8221; (2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). Then 14:13 says, &#8220;Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.&#8221; It does not say here &#8220;says the Scripture&#8221; but &#8220;says the Spirit.&#8221; Where does the Spirit say such a word? It is not in the air or on the throne in the heavens but in the believers. After the believers see and hear the matter of suffering martyrdom for the Lord, there is a voice out of heaven, saying, &#8220;Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.&#8221; At that time the Spirit responds and acknowledges in the believers, saying, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;<p>At the end of the Bible, Revelation 22:17 says, &#8220;The Spirit and the bride say, Come!&#8221; It does not say &#8220;the Spirit and the bride both say,&#8221; but &#8220;the Spirit and the bride say,&#8221; indicating that the Spirit and the bride have become one. In the beginning of Revelation it was the Spirit speaking to the churches; then it was the Spirit speaking in the church, the believers; and at the end it is the Spirit and the bride, the church, speaking together as one. This indicates that the church&#8217;s experience of the Spirit has advanced to such an extent that she has become one with the Spirit. Hence, the entire Bible consummates with the Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. The Triune God came through incarnation and passed through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.<h2 class=head1>THE SPEAKING SPIRIT BEING OUR ONLY NEED</h2><p>The processed and consummated Spirit, who is within us today, is our unique need. Often we have a natural concept, thinking that if we love the Lord, we need to be taught more through His oracle to know how to be proper parents, children, husbands, or wives and how to speak to others with a proper tone and attitude. Yes, in the Bible there are proverbs and ethical maxims for our daily living, such as husbands needing to love their wives and wives needing to be subject to their husbands. Nevertheless, the kernel of the Bible is the Triune God. What is spoken of mainly in the Bible is that the Triune God went through a process that He might work Himself into us to be our life, element, and substance, thereby living in us and being expressed through us.<p>In the record of John chapter three, a ruler of the Jews named Nicodemus, who was a man of the Pharisees, the moralists among the Jews, felt that men needed more teachings. Therefore, he came to seek the Lord Jesus, saying, &#8220;Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher&#8221; (v. 2). This is exactly our condition. Like Nicodemus, we are filled with religious concepts. We may wish that the Lord&#8217;s holy words could teach us, as the words of Confucius, Mencius, and Wang Yang-ming of China did, concerning how to develop our &#8220;bright virtue&#8221; that we may behave as moral men and gentlemen. However, this is not the essence of the Bible. The center and the essence of the Bible are the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; the all-inclusive Christ; and the consummated Spirit.<p>For this reason, I have a heavy burden within. I have discovered that many among us are still old and are still what they used to be. Our real need is to experience the Spirit in our daily living. Family matters that cannot be resolved, environments that give us difficulties, and brothers and sisters who are intolerable are not the real problems. The real problem is that we do not know the Spirit. Circumstances are not our problems; not knowing how to experience Christ is our real problem. God has never promised us a smooth environment that we may sail smoothly from the earth to heaven and from this age all the way into the kingdom age. Human beings will always have problems. However, the difference between Christians and unbelievers is that we Christians can still rejoice in our afflictions and not be anxious. Actually, it is not that we can rejoice; rather, it is the Spirit in us who rejoices. To have a life that is anxious for nothing but always rejoicing, we need to experience Christ and know the Spirit. The Spirit is our only need.<p>Many people consider that the Spirit is too abstract. We thank the Lord that He has given us the Bible, which is very precious. Its essence and sphere are Christ, and this Christ of whom it speaks eventually became the Spirit. Therefore, the Spirit is not abstract. Romans 8:16 says, &#8220;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit.&#8221; This means that the Spirit is in us and speaks together with us. Revelation 2:7 says, &#8220;The Spirit says to the churches,&#8221; and 22:17 says, &#8220;The Spirit and the bride say.&#8221; The Spirit is the speaking Spirit. Therefore, the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&#8221; (John 6:63). This indicates that the Lord&#8217;s words, the Lord&#8217;s Spirit, and the Lord Himself are one and can never be separated. Today we should not learn ethics and morality or study the Lord&#8217;s words in a natural way. We should learn only one thing; that is, we should daily exercise our spirit to pray-read the words of the Lord and take in the rich supply from Him, because His words are spirit and are life. Dear brothers and sisters, we should not read the Bible with our mind. Whenever we come to the Lord&#8217;s word, we should open up our entire being and exercise our spirit to draw from the riches of the Spirit in the Bible. If we pray-read the word of God in this way, every word of the Bible becomes spirit and life to us. Then we can realize that the Spirit is definitely speaking in us. The speaking Spirit who dwells in us will lead us through every circumstance to encounter every person, event, and matter and deal with every problem. The speaking Spirit is our only need.<p>Today this speaking Spirit is Christ. To know Christ, we need to earnestly study the six major categories of types in the Old Testament-human beings, animals, plants, minerals, offerings, and foods. These types are very rich. How blessed we are today! We have already received all these riches in reality. The elements of the reality of all the types are in the Spirit, and the Spirit transfuses and dispenses all these riches into us through the Lord&#8217;s words. Therefore, day by day we need to eat the Lord&#8217;s words and receive the Spirit&#8217;s dispensing. This is like breathing, drinking, and eating, which are things that we do not once for all but day by day and moment by moment. Furthermore, we also need to exercise our spirit and release our spirit before the Lord regularly for our cooperation with the Lord. Thus, our spiritual life will be healthy and will continually grow in a normal way.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SPIRIT-THE HOLY SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:10, 13, 16-20, 23, 26; 20:22; 15:26; 2 Cor. 3:17-18</h1><p>Bible readers all know that the Bible speaks of God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the Holy Spirit is one of the three major subjects of the Bible. Throughout the centuries Bible readers have studied a great deal about Christ. However, they have not been thorough enough, and might even be considered negligent, in their study of the Holy Spirit in the biblical record. In this message we want to see the Holy Spirit, &#8220;the Spirit,&#8221; from the viewpoint of the entire Bible.<h2 class=head1>THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE SPIRIT</h2><h2 class=head2>The Spirit of God</h2><p>At the very beginning, in Genesis 1, after telling us that God created the heavens and the earth, the Bible goes on to say that the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters (v. 2, ASV). The Hebrew word for moved means something like the brooding of a hen over its eggs. A hen broods, stretching its wings over its eggs for the purpose of producing something living, that is, its chicks. Therefore, some good English versions of the Bible have translated this word into was brooding, with the sense of life-producing. Bible readers all know that Genesis 1 speaks about God&#8217;s creation of the heavens and the earth, but many have neglected the fact that God&#8217;s act of creation was performed by the Spirit of God, that is, carried out by the Spirit of God brooding over the face of the waters.<h2 class=head2>The Spirit of Jehovah</h2><p>After speaking of the Spirit of God, the Old Testament refers to the Spirit of Jehovah numerous times. The Spirit of Jehovah indicates the reaching of God to man. The book of Judges frequently says that certain judges rose up to fight for the children of Israel because the Spirit of Jehovah had come upon them (3:10; 6:34; 11:29; 13:25; 14:6). Furthermore, the prophets rose up to speak for God because the Spirit of Jehovah had come upon them also (2 Sam. 23:2; Isa. 61:1). Elijah became a prophet because the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him; later, Elisha, following Elijah, put on Elijah&#8217;s mantle. That mantle is a type of the Holy Spirit descending upon the believers in the New Testament as the economical Spirit, the Spirit of power. In Luke 24:49 the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, &#8220;And behold, I send forth the promise of My Father upon you; but as for you, stay in the city until you put on power from on high.&#8221; This is what the mantle of Elijah and Elisha typifies. Hence, this Spirit is also called &#8220;the mantle Spirit.&#8221;<p>In Joel 2:28-29 God promised, saying, &#8220;And afterward I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh,/...Indeed even upon the servants and the maids / In those days I will pour out My Spirit.&#8221; In the Old Testament the pouring out of the Spirit is typified by rain, as in Hosea 6:3, which says that God would pour out His Spirit at two times as the fulfillment of the autumn, or former, rain and the spring, or latter, rain. On the day of Pentecost, the pouring out of the Spirit was the former rain; at the end of this age, God will again pour out His Spirit upon the children of Israel, and all Israel will repent and be saved. This is the latter rain, as prophesied in Zechariah 12:10. The Old Testament speaks of the Spirit of God only to this extent, concluding at the end with a promise, which is that God will pour out His Spirit as rain upon His elect.<h2 class=head2>The Holy Spirit</h2><p>In the New Testament the Holy Spirit is the first divine title ascribed to the Spirit of God. Matthew chapter one says that the Holy Spirit entered into the womb of Mary, a human virgin, causing her to conceive and give birth to a child, Christ. At the time of the New Testament, for the initiation of the gospel of God, the preparing of a human body for the Savior required that the Holy Spirit impart the divine nature into humanity, making man holy for the carrying out of God&#8217;s plan of redemption. Hence, the mention of the Holy Spirit in the beginning of the New Testament is related to the conception of Christ.<h2 class=head2>The Essential Spirit and the Economical Spirit</h2><p>When Christ came out to minister at the age of thirty for the accomplishing of the commission which He had received from God, the Spirit of God descended upon Him (Matt. 3:16). Matthew 1:18, 20 and Luke 1:35 unveil to us that Jesus was born of the Holy Spirit as His essence. Then at His baptism, the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, descended upon Him again. This was related to His ministry, His work. These are not two Spirits but two aspects of one Spirit. The Holy Spirit as the essence of Jesus in His conception and birth was His divine life, and He lived by this Spirit as His essence and life. The essence of the divine element of the Holy Spirit, who was His life and nature, was unchangeable and irremovable. However, the Holy Spirit also has the economical aspect, the aspect of power, which was for the ministry of Jesus (Luke 4:14, 18; Matt. 12:28) and could be removed from Him when there was the need for it (Matt. 27:46).<p>Jesus had the Holy Spirit in the essential aspect as His intrinsic nature from His conception and birth, but it was at His baptism that the Holy Spirit in the economical aspect descended upon Him as His outward power. The Bible clearly records that the Lord Jesus ministered not by His own strength but by this Spirit. Within, He was constituted and filled with the essential Spirit; without, He was anointed and empowered by, as well as filled with, the economical Spirit. He was a person altogether wrapped up with the Spirit. Hence, His move was the Spirit&#8217;s move, and His work was the Spirit&#8217;s work.<h2 class=head2>Another Comforter</h2><h2 class=head3>The Promise of the Comforter</h2><p>On the last night of His three-and-a-half-year ministry, the Lord Jesus had a long discourse with His disciples which is recorded in John 14-16. This section was a word of farewell from the Lord Jesus to His disciples on the night of His betrayal. In this parting word, He first said that He is the expression of the Father; when people see Him, they see the Father. He is in the Father, and the Father is in Him, and He and the Father are one (14:9-10). Then in verses 16 and 17 He said, &#8220;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality.&#8221; Nearly every Christian knows that what the Lord Jesus spoke of here was the promise to give us a Comforter, but they do not understand how the Father gave us the Comforter.<h2 class=head3>Another Comforter, the Son Who Was in Them</h2><p>The Lord went on to say that this Comforter, the Spirit of reality, would abide with the disciples and would be in them (v. 17). The Lord had been with the disciples for three and a half years, they truly enjoyed His presence, and He was their Comforter, but now He was going to leave them. When they heard this, they were very sorrowful. Therefore, the Lord wanted them to know that at that time He could only be with them outwardly, but He could not enter into them. Although the Lord in the flesh could be with the disciples and could walk, stay, and abide with them, He was not satisfied with this. He desired to enter into the believers that He might live in them as their life. Moreover, He wanted to be their bread of life and life supply. In other words, He wanted to be the &#8220;another Comforter.&#8221; Therefore, the &#8220;another Comforter&#8221; was Christ entering into them to be their life and life supply. Since He was to be life to them, He could not be merely outside of them but had to be inside of them. Since He was to be their bread of life and life supply, He had to be received into them that He might minister to them. Hence, although the disciples were delighted with the Lord&#8217;s outward presence, that was not good enough; the Lord aspired to enter into them.<h2 class=head3>In Resurrection the Son Entering into the Disciples as the Comforter That They Might Experience the Son in the Father</h2><p>How could the Lord enter into the disciples, and how could He be with them forever? In 14:19-20 the Lord said, &#8220;Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live. In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&#8221; That day was the day when the Lord lived and His disciples also would live; this refers to the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection (20:19). After His resurrection the Lord lived in His disciples, and they also lived by Him, as referred to in Galatians 2:20. Moreover, in that day the disciples were able to know that the Lord is in the Father. This is not a mere mental knowledge, because our mind cannot understand such a thing. What the Lord referred to here was an experiential knowledge. In John 14:10 the Lord said, &#8220;Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?&#8221; The Lord was asking the disciples whether they believed, not whether they had the experience. Then in verse 20 the Lord went further and said, &#8220;In that day you will know.&#8221; Therefore, know here refers to experience-not only believing but also experiencing that the Lord is in the Father. In the initial stage of my experience of Christ, I considered that Christ and the Father were separate. Whenever I prayed, I was bothered, because in my mind I had always understood that Christ was in me and the Father was on the throne in heaven. Colossians 1:27 says that Christ in us is the hope of glory, but I could not understand how this Christ was related to the Father. At that time I did not have any feeling or experience telling me that Christ is in the Father. It was not until after I had been a Christian for thirty years that I began to realize that it is altogether impossible to experience Christ apart from the Father.<p>As far as the truth of salvation is concerned, John 3:16 is the top verse. However, as far as the enjoyment of Christ is concerned, John 14:20 is the top verse. This verse says, &#8220;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&#8221; The order here cannot be reversed. What the Lord&#8217;s word here means is that in resurrection He would enter into His disciples, but instead of entering into them alone, He would enter into them in the Father. Therefore, on the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, the disciples would know that Christ not only was related to the Father and was the expression of the Father, but that He was also in the Father. Moreover, the disciples would know that they were in the Son and the Son was in them.<p>Why is it that in this section concerning the other Comforter, instead of speaking concerning the Comforter, the Lord spoke of Himself being in the Father, us being in Him, and Him being in us? In actuality, it is because this refers to our experience of the other Comforter. It was on that day, the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection when this other Comforter came to the disciples and breathed into them; He was inhaled by them and received into them. In 20:22 in His resurrection the Lord came to the disciples and breathed into them and said to them, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit.&#8221; This Holy Spirit is the &#8220;another Comforter.&#8221; When the disciples received Him, they knew that Christ was in the Father. Then He could live in them and they could also live because of Him and with Him. The disciples could even live in Him, and He could also live in them. Hence, in John 14:10 there is merely a revelation, but in verse 20 the revelation becomes an experience. This experience began on the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, in which the Son came as another Comforter and breathed the Holy Spirit, who is His transfiguration, into His disciples. When this Comforter, the other Comforter, had entered into the disciples, they realized that the Son was in the Father, they were in the Son, and the Son was in them. The disciples could have such a realization because the other Comforter had entered into them and was experienced by them practically.<h2 class=head3>Another Comforter Being the Holy Spirit Whom the Father Sent in the Son&#8217;s Name</h2><p>John 14 contains many revelations. Verse 6 says that Christ is the way, the reality, and the life; verse 9 says that he who has seen the Son has seen the Father; verse 11 says that the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son; and verses 16 and 17 say that another Comforter, the Spirit of reality, would be given to the disciples not only to abide with them but also to be in them. However, the four most important verses in John 14 are verses 10, 20, 23, and 26. Moreover, the revelation in these four verses is progressive. Therefore, to study the experience in verse 20, we need to go on to study verse 23. In verse 23 the Lord said, &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him.&#8221; This is truly wonderful. Why is it that when one loves the Lord, the Father loves him? Why did the Lord say that the Father would love him, instead of saying that He Himself would love him? Would not the Lord also love him? Then the Lord continued, &#8220;And We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; We here refers to the Father and the Son. According to our thinking, if a person loves the Son, the Son will love him and will enter into him with rejoicing to abide in him. But why did the Lord say that when one loves the Son, it is the Father who would love him, and the Father and the Son would come to him and make an abode with him? In order to explain this verse, we must go on to study verse 26.<p>As we have seen, verse 20 says that the Son abides in the disciples, and it is through the Holy Spirit, whom the Father sent, that the Son is able to abide in the disciples. Then, verse 26 says, &#8220;But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things and remind you of all the things which I have said to you.&#8221; This verse says that the Holy Spirit is sent by the Father in the Son&#8217;s name. According to grammar, in My name is a modifier; to be in His name is to be in His person. However, when we read this verse, it is very difficult to say whether in My name refers to the Father sending in the Son or to the Spirit being sent in the Son, that is, whether this phrase modifies the Father or the Spirit. Actually, in My name modifies the Father. Therefore, the Father sending the Holy Spirit in the Son&#8217;s name is equivalent to the Son sending the Holy Spirit; that is, the Father&#8217;s sending of the Holy Spirit in the Son&#8217;s name is the Son&#8217;s sending of the Holy Spirit from the Father (15:26). In other words, the Son sent the Spirit from the Father and with the Father. This does not mean that the Son sent with the Father but that the Spirit comes with the Father.<h2 class=head3>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit Being One, and the Son Being the Spirit</h2><p>John 14:26 says that the Father sent the Spirit in the Son, and the Father and the Son are one because the Father is in the Son. Then, 15:26 shows us that the Son sent the Spirit from the Father and with the Father; hence, the Spirit is with the Father. The former indicates that the Father and the Son are one and that the Father is in the Son, while the latter says that the Spirit came from the Father and with the Father. The former tells us that the Father is in the Son, especially in the sending of the Spirit, while the latter tells us that it was the Son who sent the Spirit. Does this mean that there were two Senders? The Father and the Son are two, but in the sending of the Spirit They are one, because it is the Father sending in the Son. Hence, the Father&#8217;s sending is the Son&#8217;s sending. When we study these two verses together, we can conclude that the Spirit who is sent comes with the Father, and the Father sends the Spirit in the Son&#8217;s name. Therefore, the Spirit comes with the Father and the Son. This proves that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one and cannot be separated.<p>Hence, to experience Christ, we need to see that Christ is the Spirit. If He were not the Spirit, we could not experience Him, and He could not come into us. Ephesians 3:17 says, &#8220;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.&#8221; The chorus of Hymns, #309 says, &#8220;Since Jesus came into my heart!&#8221; If Christ is not the Spirit, how can He come into my heart and make His home in my heart? We should not merely repeat what others say. Perhaps we do not understand this mystery, but we must know this fact and experience this reality. Since Christ as the Spirit lives in our heart today, we can sing, &#8220;Floods of joy o&#8217;er my soul like the sea billows roll.&#8221; Throughout the generations, Christians who love the Lord all have experienced the joy of the Lord&#8217;s making His home in their hearts by their having intimate fellowship with the Lord and touching His Spirit in their spirit. Although many of them can neither understand nor speak this truth, they have experienced the reality. Every word of the Lord is established. Hence, we may not understand why, but if we just &#8220;amen&#8221; His word, we will have the reality.<p>We can use calling on the Lord&#8217;s name as an illustration. Romans 10:13 says, &#8220;For &#8216;whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&#8217;&#8221; We are now able to explain this truth because we have studied the Bible for a few decades, examined and compared others&#8217; writings, and experienced it ourselves (Acts 2:21, footnote 1 in the Recovery Version). However, today, if we release our spirit to call on the name of the Lord, immediately we experience being saved from all kinds of people, events, and matters. Likewise, we can experience Christ&#8217;s making His home in our hearts through faith. How can Christ make His home in our hearts? It is because He is the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Some say that Christ abides in our hearts not directly but through the Holy Spirit or in the Holy Spirit. However, regardless of whether we say &#8220;through&#8221; or &#8220;in,&#8221; Christ and the Spirit are actually one in our experience.<p>Putting John 14:26 and 20 together, we see that in that day, the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, the Father sent another Comforter that the disciples may know that the Son is in the Father and also in them. Verse 17 says that another Comforter would come to abide with the disciples and be in them. Are there two persons in us, one who is the Son and the other who is the Spirit as another Comforter? These two are one in our experience. Hence, the Son who is in us, mentioned in verse 20, is the Spirit who is in us, mentioned in verse 17. Then as to the Father, the first half of verse 20 says, &#8220;In that day you will know that I am in My Father.&#8221; This &#8220;I,&#8221; who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17, is in &#8220;My Father.&#8221; Therefore, when the Spirit comes, the Son comes, and when the Son comes, He comes in the Father. This corresponds with the revelation in 14:26 and 15:26.<h2 class=head3>Another Comforter Coming by Being Given</h2><p>John 14:18 says that the Lord would come to the disciples. How did the Lord Jesus come as another Comforter? He came first by becoming the life-giving Spirit through death and resurrection; this was the first step of His coming. Then, on the day of His resurrection, in the evening, the Son who became the Spirit came to breathe Himself into the disciples; this was the second step of His coming. Similarly, verse 16 says that the Father would give the Comforter to the disciples. Verse 16 says, &#8220;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever.&#8221; How did the Father give the disciples another Comforter? The first step was by resurrecting the Son, who passed through death (Acts 2:24, 32; Rom. 8:11), and then by sending the Son who had become the Spirit to breathe into them (John 14:26). When the Son breathed into them, the Father&#8217;s giving was accomplished. The Lord&#8217;s breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise that the Father would give them the Spirit of reality as another Comforter. Hence, the Lord&#8217;s breathing accomplished not only His coming as another Comforter but also the giving of the Comforter by the Father. In other words, the Lord&#8217;s breathing is the Spirit&#8217;s coming and the Father&#8217;s giving. Therefore, John 20:22, where the Lord breathed into the disciples, is the fulfillment of 14:16-17, 26, and 15:26.<h2 class=head3>Another Comforter, the Spirit of Reality, Being the Consummation of the Triune God</h2><p>John 14:19 says, &#8220;Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me.&#8221; This word was spoken by the Lord to His disciples on the night of His betrayal. Then on the third day He was resurrected from death, and in the evening of that day He went to the disciples and breathed into them, saying, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit,&#8221; who is the Spirit of reality. The Lord&#8217;s word of promise to His disciples was fulfilled in just three days and was therefore &#8220;a little while.&#8221; At that time, the Lord became the Spirit and breathed Himself into the disciples. Hence, the world beheld Him no longer, but the disciples beheld Him. The Lord&#8217;s breathing was the Father&#8217;s giving and the Spirit&#8217;s coming. This is the reaching of the Triune God. Hence, the Spirit of reality, the Holy Spirit who was breathed into the disciples, is not only the third of the Triune God but the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God. In this Spirit are the Son and the Father. For this reason, for Christ to come into us to become our experience, He must be the Spirit. Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God.<p>Hence, the Triune God is not for theological doctrines but for our experience. If we do not understand this, in our experience it may seem that we have only the Son without the Father and the Spirit. Actually, when we experience Christ, this Christ is the Spirit, and this Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God. Therefore, when we experience Christ, we also experience the Father with the Spirit. We may say even more plainly that the Christ whom we experience is the Spirit. For this reason, many of the great Christian teachers throughout the ages eventually acknowledged that Christ is the Spirit in the Christians&#8217; experience. Because of this, we have created the term the pneumatic Christ. Paul was clear about this matter and therefore said, &#8220;The Lord is the Spirit&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:17). This kind of speaking is not doctrinal but experiential because he went on to say, &#8220;Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&#8221; Furthermore, he said, &#8220;But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit&#8221; (v. 18). This means that in our experience the Lord is the Spirit, the consummation of the Triune God. The Lord Spirit, who is transforming us within, is with the Father and in the Son.<h2 class=head1>THE SON BEING IN THE FATHER, WE IN THE SON, AND THE SON IN US</h2><p>John 14:20 says, &#8220;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&#8221; Now we can understand the sequence here. On the evening of the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, the Son breathed the Spirit into the disciples. Then 15:26 says that when the Spirit comes, He brings the Father with Him. Moreover, 14:10 indicates that since the Son is in the Father, the Father has the Son in Him. Hence, after the Spirit was breathed into the disciples, when they experienced the Spirit, they realized that the Spirit had brought the Father with Him and therefore the Father and the Spirit are one. Furthermore, because the Father has the Son in Him, the disciples also knew that the Father and the Son are one. It is the same with us; when the Spirit comes into us, the Father also comes with Him, and the Son is in the Father for us to experience and to know.<p>Because the Spirit is in us for our experience, we are brought into the Son to live by Him, because of Him, and with Him (14:19). Moreover, since we live in the Son, the Son also lives in us (15:4). Therefore, there are not only three in one but four in one; the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and the believers have all become one. When the Spirit comes, He comes with the Father, who is in the Son and in whom also is the Son, and lives in us so that we are in the Son. As a result, because we are in the Son, the Son is also in us. This is the Triune God becoming our experience and our blessing.<h2 class=head1>TO EXPERIENCE CHRIST BEING TO EXPERIENCE THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>The Triune God has been consummated as the Spirit, who enters into us with the Father, in whom is the Son. Because of the Spirit&#8217;s entering into us, we are in the Son and consequently, the Son is also in us. This is the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-in us to be experienced by us as our blessing and to become our enjoyment, which is Christ in us as the hope of glory. Therefore, to experience Christ is to experience the Triune God. Unfortunately, many Christians today neither understand this matter nor have the light concerning it, much less experience it.<h2 class=head1>CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD TO TOUCH THE HOLY SPIRIT AND ENJOY THE RICHES OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>Let us use prayer as an illustration. Christians&#8217; general concept about prayer is that we pray and ask the Lord to do something for us only when we have problems. However, this is not accurate. It was only after groping for a long time that I have realized that the prayers of Christians are actually their calling on the name of the Lord. The biblical word for call means to cry out. When we pray, we surely cry out the name of the Lord Jesus. If we call out the name of the Lord Jesus from deep within, our spirit is stirred up. Sometimes even when we call on the Lord&#8217;s name softly, our spirit is stirred up. Romans 10:12-13 says, &#8220;For the same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him; for &#8216;whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&#8217;&#8221; Therefore, it does not matter whether our voice is loud or soft; what matters is that we call. The Lord is rich for our enjoyment. In order to enjoy the riches of the Lord, we need to call upon His name. Calling on the name of the Lord is the secret not only to our salvation but also to our enjoyment of the Lord&#8217;s riches. When we call upon the name of the Lord, we breathe in His riches.<p>Every day we need to exercise our spirit and call on the name of the Lord to enjoy Him. Whenever we are about to lose our temper, we should exercise to call on the Lord. Once we call on the Lord, our temper is gone, and when we call again, we feel peaceful inside and we rejoice exultingly. Sometimes when we are tired from working, we can call, &#8220;O Lord Jesus!&#8221; and we feel relaxed. Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. When we call, we are filled with &#8220;air.&#8221; The Lord is the Spirit. In Greek, the word for spirit is the same as that for breath or air. For Christians, to call on the name of the Lord is to be filled with air. If we call sufficiently, we are &#8220;inflated&#8221;; if we do not call, we become &#8220;deflated.&#8221; Every morning you need to first call on the name of the Lord to be filled with &#8220;air,&#8221; and then go to your office. Every office is a place that deflates people. It is needless to say that you are often deflated after working hours are over; even by noon you have nearly been deflated already. Therefore, you need to call on the Lord at noon so that you may be filled with &#8220;air&#8221; again. After leaving your office, on your way home, you must again call on the Lord&#8217;s name and get fully inflated. Then when you return home, you will not feel dejected but instead be overflowing with joy. When we call on the Lord, we experience Christ, who is the Spirit. By calling on the name of the Lord, our spirit touches the Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God. As a result, we can enjoy the Lord&#8217;s riches. This is to experience Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE HOLY SPIRIT BEING THE REALITY OF ALL SPIRITUAL THINGS</h2><p>After I was saved, I enjoyed reading spiritual books and magazines, especially the writings by Brother Watchman Nee. In two of his books, The Normal Christian Life and The Overcoming Life, based on Romans 6, Brother Nee said that every Christian should know how to reckon (v. 11). For example, we should reckon that we have been crucified with Christ. At that time, although my mind was clear, regardless of how much I tried to reckon, it did not work. According to time, Christ was crucified two thousand years ago, while I was born two thousand years after Him. How can I be crucified with Him? Moreover, according to space, He was born in the land of Judea, while I born in China in the Far East. Again, how can I be crucified with Him? Brother A. B. Simpson, the founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance, wrote a hymn with a chorus that says, &#8220;Let us reckon, reckon, reckon, / Let us reckon, rather than feel; / Let us be true to the reck&#8217;ning, / And He will make it real&#8221; (Hymns, #692). Since this is based upon the Bible, I accepted this doctrine, and I tried my best to reckon. However, regardless of how much I tried, it did not work. Without reckoning, I was better off; the more I reckoned, the worse off I was. Without reckoning, it seemed that my natural self was dead, but once I began to reckon, it became alive and everything went wrong. Later, Brother Nee added a word saying that the reckoning in Romans 6 must be done along with the experience in Romans 8. Romans 6 merely gives us the fact, whereas Romans 8 brings us into the experience.<p>Romans 8:13 says, &#8220;For if you live according to the flesh, you must die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.&#8221; This verse tells us clearly that it is not that we can reckon ourselves to death, but that by the Spirit we put to death the practices of the body. How do we do this by the Spirit? It is by calling on the name of the Lord. We simply need to call on the Lord. Then our spirit is stirred up and executes the Lord&#8217;s death within us. Christ in us is the Spirit, who contains the element of His death with its effectiveness. Therefore, the Lord&#8217;s death is in the Spirit, not in our reckoning. For this reason, after his speaking in Romans 6, Paul spoke about being according to the spirit, walking according to the spirit, and being led by the Spirit of God (8:4-5, 14). It is only by the Spirit that we can put to death the practices of the body. If the Lord were not the Spirit, He could not come into us, and His death would have nothing to do with us. The Lord passed through the processes of death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit. In this Spirit are the elements of the Lord Himself, His death, and His resurrection. Since the Lord is the Spirit, He can come into us, and all His riches can be subjectively experienced and enjoyed by us. The Lord is the Spirit as the reality of all spiritual things.<h2 class=head1>THE SEVEN SPIRITS FOR GOD&#8217;S MOVE ON THE EARTH</h2><p>When the Trinity is referred to in the beginning of Revelation, the last book of the Bible, the Spirit is called &#8220;the seven Spirits who are before His throne&#8221; (1:4). The seven Spirits are moving and speaking in the church today. At the beginning of each of the seven epistles in Revelation chapters two and three, it is the Lord who speaks, but at the end of each epistle, it is the Spirit who speaks to the churches. This indicates that the Lord who speaks is the Spirit, even the seven Spirits. Revelation 22:17 says, &#8220;The Spirit and the bride say, Come!&#8221; This shows us that the Spirit, who is Christ as the Bridegroom, and His bride sound the call together.<p>In the Gospel of John, the Spirit is likened to the Son&#8217;s breath. In John 20:22, the Son breathed into the disciples and said to them, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit.&#8221; This indicates that the breath breathed out by the Son was the Holy Spirit. In Revelation, the seven Spirits are the eyes of Christ as the Lamb. Breath is for living and denotes man&#8217;s essence, whereas eyes are for moving and denote man&#8217;s activities. In other words, the breathing of breath is for the essential aspect, whereas the eyes&#8217; observing and shining are for the economical aspect. In the Gospels the Spirit is the breath, while in Revelation the Spirit is the eyes.<h2 class=head1>THE THREE OF THE DIVINE TRINITY BEING UNDIVIDED AND INDIVISIBLE</h2><p>Whether essentially or economically, the Spirit cannot be separated from the Son. In the essential aspect, the Spirit is the Son&#8217;s breath, while in the economical aspect, the aspect for moving, the Spirit is the Son&#8217;s eyes. Likewise, we can neither divide the Son from the Father nor divide the Father from the Spirit. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are absolutely undivided and indivisible; these three are one. Isaiah 9:6 says that the Son is called the eternal Father, and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says that the Son is the Spirit. Hence, these three are one. Regardless of which one we experience, we experience all three.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO EXPERIENCE THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>There is a way to experience the Triune God. Ephesians 2:18 says, &#8220;For through Him [Christ] we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.&#8221; We cannot experience the Father directly; we must come to the Father in the all-inclusive Spirit through the Son. Therefore, the Gospels reveal that we need to believe in the Son. To believe in the Son is to receive the Son. The Son, who is the Spirit, enters into us by our receiving Him. As a result, we have access to the Father to experience God and His riches. This is the sequence of experiencing the Triune God, not three kinds of experiences but one experience in three aspects. We need to have a subjective and rich experience of this kind.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SPIRIT-THE HOLY SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:20; 20:22; 14:16, 23, 26; 15:26; Col. 1:27; 2:9; Eph. 2:18; 3:16-19; 4:4-6; 2 Cor. 13:14</h1><h2 class=head1>HYMNS CONCERNING THE SPIRIT WITH OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>It is not easy to select a proper hymn. The English hymnal that we compiled has 1,080 hymns of which more than two hundred were written by us. The remaining eight hundred or so hymns were collected from among more than ten thousand hymns. We can say that the best of the hymns written throughout the centuries, including certain Pentecostal hymns, are almost entirely included in our hymnal. The table of contents at the beginning of our hymnal shows that our knowledge of the truth is very inclusive.<p>In October 1934, when Brother Watchman Nee was giving the fourth Overcomers&#8217; Conference in Hangchow, he felt that a certain hymn from the Pentecostal movement was very good and suggested that the brothers translate the chorus for singing in the meetings. I picked up that burden. The chorus of that hymn, Hymns, #551, says &#8220;Hallelujah! Hallelujah!/I have passed the riven veil,/Here the glories never fail,/Hallelujah! Hallelujah!/I am living in the presence of the King.&#8221; Singing a hymn like this was a new thing in the Lord&#8217;s recovery because up until then our meetings had been very structured. We had never sung a short chorus like this. It is worth remembering that just after that conference, we had Brother Nee&#8217;s wedding meeting, and we sang this short hymn there. My burden in saying this is that you would see that when we put out our hymnal, we had a focus and an emphasis, and we did not cut ourselves off from any truth. Today there is no other collection of hymns like ours that includes all the major truths. When we put out our English hymnal, an elderly American sister, who had spent many years in China, read the table of contents and told us that it was very precious because all aspects of the truth were included there. We did this because we wanted the brothers and sisters to know that our knowledge of the truth is many-sided, but we still have an emphasis and a focus. This is particularly manifest in the more than two hundred hymns written by us, many of which exclusively concern the Spirit with our spirit and the two spirits becoming one spirit. This is a very important point.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT BEING THE BREATH OF THE SON</h2><p>John 14:20 says, &#8220;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&#8221; This verse is very difficult to understand. In contrast, verse 6 is not difficult to understand. The Lord says, &#8220;I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.&#8221; The revelation in verse 20, however, is very deep. Why does it say that it was in that day, that is, in the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, that the disciples would know? It is because another Comforter, who was sent by the Father, came on the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection. In 20:22, the Lord came to His disciples on the evening of the day of His resurrection, and He breathed into them, saying, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Most Christians understand that the Holy Spirit is the third of the Divine Trinity. In his Gospel, however, John reveals that the Lord Himself indicated that the Holy Spirit, the &#8220;another Comforter&#8221; sent by the Father, was the breath breathed out of His mouth. This is truly mysterious.<p>In the past, Western missionaries came to China and taught people that the Holy Father, the Holy Son, and the Holy Spirit were &#8220;three persons with one body&#8221; and that the persons should not be confused and the body should not be divided. However, the Lord Jesus, the Son, breathed the breath out of His mouth as the Holy Spirit into the disciples. How could the Holy Spirit as the third of the Divine Trinity become the breath which was breathed out of the mouth of the Son as the second of the Divine Trinity? How could the third become a part of the second? This is the mystery of the Divine Trinity. In the books in Christianity today you can hardly find one volume that tells people that John 20:22 reveals that the Holy Spirit is the breath breathed out of the mouth of the Son. No one has dared to say such a thing, but the Lord has raised up His recovery that we may preach the pure revelation according to the Bible.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT OF REALITY GUIDING THE BELIEVERS INTO THE SPIRITUAL REALITY</h2><p>On the evening of the day of His resurrection, the Lord breathed into the disciples. His breathing was the Spirit&#8217;s coming and the Father&#8217;s giving. With respect to the Son, it was a breathing; with respect to the Spirit, it was a coming; and with respect to the Father, it was a giving. When the Son breathed in this way, the Father&#8217;s giving of the Holy Spirit was accomplished, and the Holy Spirit&#8217;s coming was fulfilled. Once the Holy Spirit had been received into the disciples, He began to operate. When the Holy Spirit operated, the disciples had an inward sense, and they understood the words that the Lord had spoken to them on the night He was betrayed, because the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of reality, entered into them and guided them into the subjective experience of the Lord (John 14:17).<p>The Spirit of reality as the other Comforter came into the disciples and led them to realize what the Lord had said: &#8220;I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&#8221; (v. 20). First, the disciples realized what the Lord had said in chapter fourteen about His being in the Father (vv. 10-11). Through the Holy Spirit they knew that the Lord was truly in the Father. Then they also realized what the Lord had said in chapter fifteen concerning their abiding in Him and His abiding in them (vv. 4-5). Through the Holy Spirit they knew that they were in the Lord and that the Lord was in them. Thus, they knew all these things because of this Spirit. This is why the disciples had to wait until that day before they could understand the three items spoken of in John 14:20. It was in that day that the Spirit of reality, who had been promised by the Son, entered into the disciples. When the Spirit entered into them, the disciples knew that what the Son had spoken on the night of His betrayal concerning His being in the Father was true. Moreover, they knew that what the Lord had spoken in chapter fifteen concerning their abiding in the Son and His abiding in them was also true.<h2 class=head1>THE COMING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT BEING THE COMING OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>Now we must go a step further to ask how it was that once the Spirit entered them, the disciples knew the three items mentioned in John 14:20. How do we know that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us? John 14:26 says that the Father sends the Holy Spirit in the Son&#8217;s name, and 15:26 says that the Son sends the Holy Spirit from the Father and with the Father. When the Spirit comes, the Father also comes; that is, the Spirit comes with the Father. Furthermore, the Father being in the Son&#8217;s name is His being in the Son; hence, when the Father comes, the Son comes also. When the Holy Spirit comes, the Father comes and the Son also comes. This shows us that the coming of the Holy Spirit is the coming of the Triune God.<p>John 14:26 says that the Father sends the Spirit, and 15:26 says that the Son sends the Spirit. In actuality, how many senders are there? Moreover, in 14:23 the Lord said, &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; When we love the Son, our love also involves the Father. Not only so, when we love the Son, the Father and the Son come to us and abide with us. What does this all mean? The answer to all these questions is in verse 20, which says that the Son is in the Father, we are in the Son, and the Son is in us. However, we still need the Holy Spirit to come and teach us before we can understand this.<p>John 14:26 speaks of &#8220;the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name.&#8221; This means that the Father is the Sender and the Spirit is the sent One. Yet the Father is in the Son and with the Son. This proves that the Father and the Son are one and that the Father&#8217;s sending is the Son&#8217;s sending. Thus, 15:26 says that the Holy Spirit, whom the Son sends from the Father, is the Spirit of reality who proceeds from the Father. This is to say that the Son sends the Holy Spirit from the Father and with the Father. The Holy Spirit is related to the Father in that He comes from the Father and with the Father. This means that the Spirit and the Father are one. When we put these two verses together, we can see that when the Holy Spirit comes, He comes with the Father, who is in the Son and with the Son. Thus, when the Holy Spirit comes, not only the Father comes but also the Son comes. In other words, the coming of the Holy Spirit is the coming of the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. When the Lord breathed into the disciples on the evening of the day of His resurrection, He breathed the Holy Spirit into them, and when the Holy Spirit entered into them, both the Father and Son were also in them. The result was that in the disciples&#8217; experience they realized that not only the Spirit but also the Father was in them. In this way, they realized that the Son was in the Father, they were also in the Son, and the Son was in them.<h2 class=head1>THE TRIUNE GOD NOT BEING FOR DOCTRINE BUT FOR THE BELIEVERS&#8217; EXPERIENCE</h2><p>I was saved in 1925, and in 1931 I experienced a revival. At that time, I would go to a nearby mountain early every morning to draw near to the Lord. Sometimes I would call upon the name of the Lord, and sometimes I would sing hymns of praise and shed tears of thanksgiving. At that time I did not know the teaching concerning calling on the name of the Lord, but I was greatly inspired within. I sensed that God&#8217;s love was so deep and so high and the Lord&#8217;s grace was so rich, so I called and sang. As I look back now, I see that at that time I was in spirit, and the Spirit was in me, inspiring me with the feeling that God&#8217;s love was truly deep, wide, high, and great and that the Lord&#8217;s grace was truly rich and abundant. I was filled inwardly with joy unspeakable and full of glory. All saved believers have had some kind of experience like this, although some experiences are deeper while some are shallower, and some are lighter while some are weightier.<p>According to the truth, the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection was the day of our salvation (1 Pet. 1:3). According to the fulfillment of the fact, we were not saved until the time we believed and were baptized. According to our experience, however, we do not experience the reality of salvation until we touch the Lord in our spirit. Whenever we touch the Lord in our spirit, we have an inward spiritual sense, which is simply the Holy Spirit. Even though we may not be clear about doctrine at that time, we truly sense the reality and feel that there is a breath within us. This causes us to sense the Spirit, the Father, and the Son, that is, to sense God. When we rejoice and pray, we cry, &#8220;O God, O Father, O Lord Jesus.&#8221; These kinds of experiences tell us that the Triune God is not for doctrine but for our experience.<p>Some Bible teachers teach that we should not confuse the three of the Divine Trinity: the Father is simply the Father, the Son is simply the Son, and the Holy Spirit is simply the Holy Spirit. Therefore, when we pray, we should pray in the name of the Son, through the power of the Holy Spirit, and to the Father. We must not confuse this order, and we must not pray loosely. When I was young, I was taught in this way, and when I practiced to pray in this way, I was full of fear and trembling. I was afraid that if I called wrongly, I would have to repent and confess my sin. However, no matter how careful I was, I could never distinguish the persons of the Triune God when I prayed, and I always had a question within me. Later, I gradually understood from my experience that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one; that is, the Lord, God, and Christ are one. How can we divide Them? We have only one God. Although He has the aspect of three-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-these three are simply one.<p>The Lord Jesus has at least three titles: the Lord, Jesus, and Christ. He is one person with three titles because He has three aspects. The Lord is one aspect, Jesus is another aspect, and Christ is still another aspect. This does not mean, however, that because He has three aspects, He can be divided into three parts. These three titles all refer to the same person. Likewise, God has the aspect of three-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-but cannot be divided into three parts. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three; the Father and the Son are distinct, and the Son and the Spirit are also distinct. However, they are distinct but not separate. The Three are one.<p>I did not receive this revelation before I experienced this reality. I was born into Christianity, grew up in Christianity, and was educated in a Christian school, but I was unable to confirm their teachings in my experience. What they taught was one thing, but what I experienced was something else. I spent much time to study the Bible because I wanted to know the real situation. Through my research I discovered that the record of the Bible matched my experience. Isaiah 9:6 says, &#8220;A son is given to us.../And His name will be called.../Eternal Father,&#8221; and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, &#8220;The Lord is the Spirit.&#8221; This proves that the Triune God is one person who is focused on the Son as the center. Strictly speaking, the Bible does not say that the Father is the Son or that the Spirit is the Son. Rather, it says that the Son is the Father and the Son is the Spirit. Furthermore, the essence of God is Spirit, so the Bible also says that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all Spirit, and this God who is Spirit is triune. If we have the clear light concerning the truth, we will see that there is only one God, yet there is the aspect of three-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.<p>Due to the influence of traditional Christianity, we may think that Jesus Christ and the Father are separate and that the Spirit is also separate. Because of this, our understanding of Colossians 1:27, which says that Christ in us is the hope of glory, may be that it is not related to the Father or the Spirit because it only speaks of Christ. This kind of understanding is incorrect. This Christ who is in us as the hope of glory is the very Triune God. In Colossians 2:9 Paul continues to say that in this Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. The Godhead here is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Therefore, all the fullness of the Godhead is all the fullness of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. All this fullness dwells bodily in Christ, and Christ is in us. Therefore, this Christ who is in us is nothing less than the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT OF REALITY BEING THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>The Lord&#8217;s recovery is a recovery of the truth. From the messages in this book, people can see how deep and scientific our reading of the Bible is. I believe that there may never have been a group of people who read the Bible in the way that we read the Bible. In Christianity, the general understanding concerning Colossians 1:27 is that it speaks of Christ in the believers but does not speak of the Father or the Spirit in us; that is, Christ is related neither to the Father nor to the Spirit because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three separate persons. Many have not seen that 2:9 in the same book says that in this Christ is not only the Godhead-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-but also all the fullness of the Godhead-the fullness of the Father, the fullness of the Son, and the fullness of the Spirit. The Christ in us is the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells. Therefore, on the evening of the day of His resurrection, the Holy Spirit whom the Lord breathed into His disciples was simply Himself, the Triune God. This is why we say that the Spirit, who entered into the disciples to be their life, is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.<h2 class=head1>FOUR BIBLICAL PASSAGES WHICH SPEAK CLEARLY CONCERNING THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><h2 class=head2>Ephesians 2:18</h2><p>In the New Testament there are four main passages which speak in a clear way concerning the Triune God. The first passage is Ephesians 2:18: &#8220;For through Him [the Son] we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.&#8221; This verse clearly mentions the Son, the Spirit, and the Father. In general, Christians understand this in a natural way to mean that we were fallen sinners, and the heavenly Father loved us, so He sent the Son to save us, the sinners. When the Son comes to us, we believe in Him and are saved. God forgives us through our faith in the Son, and therefore we can be in the Spirit. Once we are in the Spirit, the Son has finished His work, and we have access unto the Father, thanking Him and saying, &#8220;Heavenly Father, You really love me; thank You.&#8221; Our natural, human mind understands this verse as if there were three steps in which first we are through the Son, then the Spirit comes, and eventually we have access unto the Father. In actuality, this kind of understanding is seriously mistaken.<p>What does it really mean to experience having access through the Son in the Spirit unto the Father? In a sense Ephesians 2:18 is much deeper and more mysterious than John 3:16. John 3:16 says, &#8220;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.&#8221; Most Christians think that this verse is very easy to understand; that is, it speaks about believing in the Lord and not perishing but having eternal life. But they do not deeply research what &#8220;eternal life&#8221; is, thinking only that it relates to our going to heaven to enjoy eternal blessings unto the age of the ages without end. This kind of understanding is not correct. It is not easy for the natural, human mind to understand the truth of the Bible. Simply the matter of &#8220;eternal life&#8221; requires us to spend much time in study. If we want to understand what Ephesians 2:18 says concerning our having access through the Son, in the Spirit, and unto the Father, we must have an even deeper study of the Bible.<p>First, we must see how the Son came. The Gospel of John says that when the Son came, He did not merely come from the Father, but He came from and with the Father. The other Gospels show us that the conception of the Son was of the Holy Spirit. The Son came to the earth from and with the Father, but He was conceived and born of and through the Spirit as His essence. Thus, the Son did not come alone; instead, the Father and the Spirit came with Him. This is why when the Son was on the earth, He said that He was not alone because the Father never left Him. The Father who had sent Him had come with Him and was continually with Him (John 8:16, 29; 16:32). Furthermore, His essence was Spirit because He was conceived and born of the Holy Spirit, and when He came out to minister, the Spirit descended upon Him as His power. Therefore, the Son who came to the earth was the Father and the Spirit as well. This corresponds with what is said in Colossians 2:9: &#8220;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&#8221; In this incarnated One there are the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Therefore, this One is the Triune God.<p>It is true that the Triune God is one God, but there is the aspect of three-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. As the Son, He came to die to redeem us from our sins. However, this does not mean that while the Son was dying, the Father and the Spirit were not there. The New Testament clearly indicates that when the Son was dying on the cross, the Father and the Spirit were both passing through death (Acts 20:28; Heb. 9:14). Therefore, redemption was accomplished by the Triune God, but it was accomplished by the Triune God in the Son; that is, it was the Son who accomplished redemption. Through our repenting and believing, the Son&#8217;s redemption is applied to us sinners for the forgiveness and purification of our sins. Thus, it is through the Son, that is, through the effectiveness of the Son&#8217;s redemption, that we are qualified to come before God.<p>To be through the Son is to pass through the Son, to pass through the Son is to believe in the Son, and to believe in the Son is to receive the Son (John 1:12). When we receive the Son, we call upon the name of the Lord Jesus. When we call on the Lord, passing through the Son, we are in the Spirit because the Son and the Spirit are one and because the Spirit is the reality of the Son&#8217;s name. Then, when we are in the Spirit, we have access unto the Father, because the Father is in the Son&#8217;s name and the Father and the Son are one. According to the truth, these are three steps: we have access through the Son, in the Spirit, and unto the Father. In our practical experience, however, these are three aspects of one experience. Once we believe in the Lord, we are in the Spirit and we have access unto the Father. The explanation given to us in the Bible is that we have access through the Son, in the Spirit, and unto the Father, but in our experience these things all happen simultaneously. Once we call on the Lord&#8217;s name, we immediately have access in the Spirit unto the Father, because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one. Thus, it is impossible for us to experience Christ without experiencing the Triune God, because whenever we call on the Lord&#8217;s name, we are in the Spirit and we have access unto the Father. This may be compared to the flow of an electrical current that first comes out of the power plant, then passes through the wires, and is finally transmitted into our homes. In practicality, however, we simply turn on the switch and immediately use the electricity.<p>When Ephesians 2:18 speaks of these three steps, it is telling us not that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three different persons but that they are one God in three aspects: the aspect of His redeeming us, the aspect of His applying redemption to us, and the aspect of His coming into us for our enjoyment. This is to have access through the Son, in the Spirit, and unto the Father. Through the Son is through the Triune God, in the Spirit is in the Triune God, and unto the Father is unto the Triune God. This is how we enjoy all the fullness of the Triune God. We cannot experience Christ without experiencing the Triune God. It is an enormous mistake to say that we experience Christ without experiencing the Triune God. It is unfortunate that in today&#8217;s Christianity this mistaken concept still exists due to two thousand years of the influence of tradition. Even among the saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, there may still be some who unconsciously hold this mistaken concept. We must clearly and thoroughly see that to be in Christ is to be in the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Christ cannot be separated from the Father or the Spirit because Colossians 2:9 clearly says that all the fullness of the Godhead, that is, all the fullness of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, dwells in Christ bodily. Since the Bible reveals this, how can we experience Christ without experiencing the Father and the Spirit?<p>Despite the clear revelation in God&#8217;s Word and our bold preaching concerning this matter, the two thousand year-old influence of Christianity is still deeply implanted in people&#8217;s hearts and is extremely difficult to get rid of. As a result, not only do some in Christianity think that I speak heresy, but even some of the saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery deny the truth of the Divine Trinity in their experience, although they confess it with their mouths. Because of the influence of Christianity, many brothers and sisters only care for their subjective feeling while ignoring the revelation of the truth. In their feeling they experience only one person, who naturally must be Christ, and since He is one person, they have neither the Father nor the Spirit. Little do they realize that this is a grave error. Some brothers and sisters make this kind of mistake for several reasons. First, they are deeply influenced by the theology of traditional Christianity; second, they do not deeply research the truth; third, they do not check with their own experience; and fourth, they may purposely ignore the truth in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. We all need to come out of these errors. We need to come out from under the influence of Christianity&#8217;s erroneous, superficial theology. Moreover, we need to earnestly study the Lord&#8217;s Word and the truths in the Lord&#8217;s recovery and carefully check them with our experience. In this way, we will have a proper, deep, subjective knowledge of the truth concerning the Divine Trinity.<h2 class=head2>Ephesians 3:16-17</h2><p>The second passage in the New Testament that speaks of the Triune God is Ephesians 3:16-17, which says, &#8220;That He [the Father] would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ [the Son] may make His home in your hearts through faith.&#8221; This is the apostle Paul&#8217;s prayer that the believers may experience the fullness of God according to the riches of the Father&#8217;s glory that they may be filled unto all the fullness of God (v. 19b). The Father hears Paul&#8217;s prayer and grants the believers to be strengthened through the Spirit into the inner man. Then, Christ can make His home in the believers&#8217; hearts. It is truly marvelous that Paul prays to the Father, but when the Father answers his prayer, He comes through the Spirit; yet the One who makes His home in the believers&#8217; hearts is the Son. The result is that the believers are filled unto all the fullness of God-not merely the fullness of the Son or of the Father or of the Spirit but the fullness of God. If we probe into this matter, we can see that it is truly mysterious.<p>First, we must ask why Paul prayed to the Father. Since the Father, Son, and Spirit are just one, why could he not pray directly to the Son asking Him to make His home in our hearts? Charles Wesley wrote the hymn that begins, &#8220;Hark! the herald angels sing&#8221; (Hymns, #84), and in its fourth stanza he said, &#8220;Come, Desire of nations, come!/Fix in us Thy humble home.&#8221; The second line was written according to Ephesians 3:17. However, Paul did not pray directly to the Son; he prayed to the Father that we would be strengthened through the Spirit that Christ might make His home in our hearts. If we understand the scriptural principle, we will see that whatever goes from us to God begins with Christ, and whatever comes from God to us begins with the Father. In several passages, when referring to the Divine Trinity, the Bible does not speak of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, but instead it speaks of the Son, the Spirit, and the Father, or the Father, the Spirit, and the Son. The three parables in Luke 15 speak of the Son, the Spirit, and the Father; God comes in the Son as the Shepherd, then the Spirit comes as the woman to illuminate and to seek, and eventually the Father receives. Ephesians 2:18 also refers to the Son, the Spirit, and the Father-having access through the Son, in the Spirit, unto the Father. Luke 15 and Ephesians 2 both speak of our going to God. Ephesians 3:16-17, however, speaks of God coming to us to make His home in our hearts. Therefore, the direction is reversed; it begins with the Father, it is through the Spirit, and finally the Son comes to make His home.<p>I am afraid that very few people in Christianity are able to obtain such light in their reading of the Bible. Christianity has made a careful study of biblical geography and history and has thoroughly researched the original meanings of the words in the biblical languages, both in Hebrew and Greek. However, much energy has been expended studying the wrong areas, and they have not obtained much light. We must research the geography, history, and original word meanings, but these are only to help us to study more deeply to know the central truths of the Bible. We must have the proper study if we are to receive light.<p>If we want to enter into God to enjoy and experience Him, we must begin with the Son and have access in the Spirit unto the Father. Then, if we want to let the Triune God enter into us, we cannot begin with the Son but must begin with the Father and pass through the Spirit that the Son may come and make His home in us. The result of His making His home in this way is that we are filled with God, that is, the Triune God, so that we become the fullness of the Triune God to be the expression of the Triune God. This is the truth concerning the Divine Trinity in Ephesians 3:16-17 for the believers&#8217; experience.<h2 class=head2>Ephesians 4:4-6</h2><p>The third passage in the New Testament which speaks of the Triune God is Ephesians 4:4-6, which says, &#8220;One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.&#8221; Here we see the Spirit, the Son, and the Father, because these three verses speak of the Body of Christ. When we speak of the Body of Christ, we must begin with the Spirit, because it is the Spirit who is in the Body. Hence, it is &#8220;one Body and one Spirit.&#8221; How does this one Spirit come to us? It is by our being put into Him through our believing in the Lord and being baptized (Mark 16:16; 1 Cor. 12:13). Thus, it is &#8220;one Lord, one faith, one baptism.&#8221; The result is that we are regenerated to become the children of God, and God is gained by us. This means that this God is not only the God who created us but also the Father who regenerated us. He is our God and Father, who is over us and through us and in us. This is how the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-become our reality and experience in our living as the foundation and element of all our living.<p>If we have not clearly seen that the Triune God is one, then we will never be able to clearly explain these passages. If these three verses are explained according to the traditional teachings of Christianity, then some may say that there are three different Gods, and some may even say that God is not only three in one, but five in one: one is the Spirit, another one is the Lord, and still another one is composed of &#8220;three Gods,&#8221; one who is over us, another who is through us, and still another who is in us. This verse does not say that this One who is over us passes through us and now abides in us; this would involve three steps. Here Paul clearly says that these aspects are simultaneous. The one God and Father is over us and at the same time is through us and again at the same time is in us. Since He is one, how can He simultaneously be over us and through us and in us? This is the mystery of the Triune God, but it is a reality in our experience. In our experience this profound, mysterious God is over us and through us and in us. What Christianity sees is very shallow, but what we believe and experience are the divine mysteries in the Bible. We have discovered these profound points in the Bible in order to help the saints, hoping to give everyone a key to open this treasure store. I hope the young brothers and sisters would pick up the burden to continue to seek out the riches in the Bible.<p>Ephesians 4:4-6 speaks of the Body of Christ. In the Body of Christ there is one Spirit. This Spirit is simply the Lord, and the Lord is the Father. The Spirit is the Son, the Son is the Father, and the Father is the Triune God, who can be over us and through us and in us. Here the words over, through, and in prove that God the Father is the Triune God. This Triune God is the Father and the Son and the Spirit. If He were only the Father, He could only be over us; if He were just the Son, He could only be through us; and if He were simply the Spirit, He could only be in us. But God the Father is the Father and the Son and the Spirit, so He can be over us and through us and in us. This also shows us that we can neither experience only the Spirit, as taught by Pentecostalism, nor only Christ, as taught by &#8220;orthodox&#8221; theology and the inner life teachers. When we experience the Spirit, we experience the Triune God, and when we experience Christ, we experience the Triune God. This is very clear.<h2 class=head2>Second Corinthians 13:14</h2><p>The fourth passage in the New Testament which speaks about the Triune God is 2 Corinthians 13:14, which says, &#8220;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&#8221; Are these three steps or one step in three aspects? Are these experienced simultaneously or in succession? Do we first experience the grace of Christ, then the love of the Father, and finally the fellowship of the Holy Spirit? Actually, these are three aspects which we experience at the same time. In the fellowship of the Holy Spirit there is the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ brings the love of the Father to us. Grace and love in reality are one. Love is the hidden source; when love is expressed, it becomes grace. The fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the pouring out, the transmission, and the application, which applies to us the love that the Father manifests and that is expressed in the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus, love, grace, and fellowship are actually one. These are not three separate items but three aspects of one item, just as the Lord Jesus Christ, God, and the Holy Spirit are not three separate Gods but three hypostases of the one undivided and indivisible God. Therefore, we cannot have the fellowship of the Holy Spirit without the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God.<h2 class=head1>THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST BEING THE EXPERIENCE OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>The preceding four passages of the New Testament clearly reveal the Triune God, and all prove to us that both the experience of Christ and the experience of the Holy Spirit are in reality the experience of the Triune God. We all need to rid ourselves of our natural concepts and of the influences of Christianity, receive the pure revelation of the Bible, and correctly and diligently check with our own experience. If we fail to do these things, we will not be able to thoroughly and completely experience the Triune God.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SPIRIT WITH THE HUMAN SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 20:22; 16:13-15; Col. 1:18; 1 Cor. 11:3; Matt. 28:19; John 3:6; 2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 1:9; Eph. 1:17b; 2:22; 3:16b; 4:23b; 5:18b; 6:18a; 1 Cor. 6:17</h1><h2 class=head1>TWO HYMNS ON THE EXPERIENCE OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>As we have seen, the Holy Spirit, who is the consummated Triune God, is of two aspects-the essential aspect and the economical aspect. This is not for doctrine but for our experience. We have at least two hymns on this matter, Hymns, #609 and #501. Hymn #609 not only speaks of our spiritual experience but also has many references to the Bible. Stanza 3 says, &#8220;The Triune God the Spirit is,/And comes as breath and wind to me.&#8221; In John 20:22 the Holy Spirit as breath is of the essential aspect, while in Acts 2:2-4 the Holy Spirit as wind is of the economical aspect. Essentially, the Holy Spirit as breath enters into us as life; economically, the Holy Spirit as a rushing violent wind is poured upon us as power. Therefore, the Holy Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God is as breath and wind.<p>Stanza 4 of Hymns, #609 says, &#8220;All that the Father is and has/In His beloved Son doth rest,/And all the riches of the Son/Are by the Spirit now possessed.&#8221; This is based on John 16:15, which says, &#8220;All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you.&#8221; Verses 13-14 say, &#8220;But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming. He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you.&#8221; The &#8220;He&#8221; in verse 15 is clearly the &#8220;Spirit of reality&#8221; in verse 13. The Spirit&#8217;s declaring to the disciples is His glorifying of the Son in verse 14 and His guiding of them into all the reality in verse 13. Therefore, the meaning of verses 13 through 15 is that all that the Father has is the Son&#8217;s, and all that the Son has is received by the Spirit, and after the Spirit receives, He declares everything to the Son&#8217;s disciples. Such a declaring is the glorifying of the Son, and it is the guiding of the disciples into all the reality. This reality is all that the Son has and all that the Father has. Therefore, stanza 3 of Hymns, #501 says, &#8220;All things of the Father are Thine;/All Thou art in Spirit is mine;/The Spirit makes Thee real to me,/That Thou experienced might be.&#8221;<p>Stanzas 8 and 9 of Hymns, #609 say, &#8220;The Father purposed that the Son/Should be the first in everything;/The Son the Father takes as Head;/And over all His headship brings. / The Spirit perfectly desires/That Christ, the Son, be glorified,/And He reveals Him unto me,/That He be fully testified.&#8221; The Father&#8217;s purposing for the Son to be the first in everything is according to Colossians 1:18, which says, &#8220;And He is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things.&#8221; The Son&#8217;s taking the Father as Head is based upon what 1 Corinthians 11:3 says, &#8220;But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ.&#8221; Therefore, in the Gospel of John, the Son often indicated that He was obedient to the Father. Everything that He did, He did by the Father and not by Himself because He took the Father as His Head (5:19, 30; 4:34; 17:4; 14:10, 24; 7:18). Stanza 9 of Hymns, #609, as quoted above, is derived from John 16:14. Not one item of human idea or concept can be found in this hymn. Rather, it was written altogether according to experience and by putting together different points of the revelation of the Bible.<h2 class=head1>THE BELIEVER&#8217;S EXPERIENCE OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>Matthew 28:19 is another verse on the believer&#8217;s experience of the Triune God. It says, &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; This is the commandment that the Lord Jesus gave to His disciples, telling them to go and preach the gospel for the discipling of all the nations and to baptize the believing ones into the name of the Triune God. In Greek, the word name is singular. Apparently, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit as three persons should have three names. However, in reality the three have only one name, which is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. In other words, the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit denotes the Triune God.<p>Among both the Chinese and Americans, most names are composed of three words. God&#8217;s name also has three parts. The name of the Triune God is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This is not a light matter. Anyone among all the nations who believes in the Lord must be baptized into one name-the name &#8220;Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&#8221; Perhaps many of us have never considered that our Triune God has such a special name. We believers worship God, but have we ever wondered what the name of the God whom we worship is? Jehovah is God&#8217;s name in the Old Testament, but today we are no longer in the Old Testament but in the New Testament. What is God&#8217;s name in the New Testament? &#8220;Man&#8221; is not man&#8217;s name but denotes man himself. In the same way, &#8220;God&#8221; is not God&#8217;s name but denotes God Himself. As man has a name, so God has a name. In the New Testament God&#8217;s name is not only Jesus. Jesus is the name of God as our Savior but not the New Testament name of the Triune God. The name of our Savior is Jesus Christ, but the name of our God is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Hallelujah, what a revelation this is! The name of the God whom we worship, serve, love, and experience is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<p>In the Gospel of Matthew, the Lord told His disciples to baptize the believing ones into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. However, in Acts and the Epistles the apostles told the people that they needed to &#8220;be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ&#8221; (Acts 2:38), that is, to be &#8220;baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus&#8221; (Acts 8:16; 19:5), &#8220;into Christ Jesus&#8221; (Rom. 6:3), and &#8220;into Christ&#8221; (Gal. 3:27). As Christians, we all know that we are baptized into the Lord&#8217;s name. At the end of the Gospel of Matthew, we are told to baptize the believers into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, which is the name of God. However, in Acts and the Epistles we are told to baptize people into the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. In other words, with respect to the truth, to baptize people is to immerse them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, but with respect to practice, to baptize people is to immerse them into the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are God, and the Lord Jesus Christ is the Savior. To baptize a person into God, we must immerse him into Christ. This also indicates that our Savior Jesus Christ is God. Therefore, the Lord Jesus Christ is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit-the Triune God.<p>Whenever many of us call upon the Lord Jesus, we may have the feeling or understanding that He is only the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, and not the Father or the Spirit. Because our natural concept is often governed by tradition, whenever we speak of the Lord Jesus, we exclude the Father and the Spirit. Christianity has been on the earth for nearly two thousand years. From the time that the Nicene Creed was established by the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325 until the present day, Christians have inherited the concept that the Father is the Father, the Son is the Son, and the Holy Spirit is the Holy Spirit; the Father is God, the Son is the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God. Hence, Christianity teaches us that when we pray, we should pray to the heavenly Father and not to the Lord Jesus and that we should conclude our prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus. In addition, since we do not have sufficient power when we pray, we need to depend on the power of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, when we pray, we should pray to the heavenly Father, in the name of the Son, and by the power of the Holy Spirit. Today this traditional concept has continued to affect people subconsciously. Consequently, all who believe in the Lord spontaneously have this understanding without being taught.<p>Apparently, the Bible seems to teach this way. However, John 16:15 says, &#8220;All that the Father has is Mine [the Son&#8217;s]; for this reason I have said that He [the Holy Spirit] receives of Mine and will declare it to you.&#8221; Since all that the Father has, has become the Son&#8217;s, does this mean that the Father no longer possesses it? Moreover, since all that the Son has, has been received by the Spirit, does this mean that the Holy Spirit has everything and the Father and the Son have nothing? We have seen clearly from the revelation in John 14 and 15 that the Father is in the Son and that the Son comes in the Father with the Spirit. Since the Father is in the Son, all that the Father has spontaneously becomes the Son&#8217;s. Since the Son comes in the Father with the Spirit, all that the Son has, has been received by the Spirit. Furthermore, 1 Corinthians 15:45b says, &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit,&#8221; and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, &#8220;And the Lord is the Spirit.&#8221; This means that the Son has become the Spirit and, therefore, all that the Son has, has been inherited by the Spirit. However, when the Son became the Spirit, He did not leave the Father in the heavens because the Father is in Him. The result is that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit become God&#8217;s name. For this reason, whenever we call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, the One we experience is the Triune God, because the Father is in the Son and the Son has become the Spirit.<p>In summary, John 14:10 shows us that the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son. Hence, all that the Father has belongs to the Son. First Corinthians 15:45b and 2 Corinthians 3:17 reveal that the Son has become the Spirit. Hence, all that the Son has, has been inherited by the Spirit. Once we have the Spirit, we have the Son and the Father because the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one. Therefore, Matthew 28:19 says that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit have only one name. This name has three parts; the first part is Father, the second part is Son, and the third part is Holy Spirit. In principle, this is like Chinese names, which have three parts.<p>What we have stressed again and again is not the doctrine but the rich experience of the Triune God. We cannot possibly experience Christ without experiencing the Father God and the Holy Spirit. We must realize that to experience Christ is to experience the Triune God. Colossians 2:9 says that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily. Therefore, in Acts and the Epistles, the apostles taught the believers to baptize people into the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because this is equal to baptizing people into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE TRIUNE GOD IN 2 CORINTHIANS 13:14</h2><p>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, &#8220;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&#8221; Apparently, these are three items, but they are actually three aspects of one item. Love is in the heart and is altogether a matter of the heart. Grace comes out of a loving heart. When love in the heart is stirred and manifested, that is grace. For example, when we see a lovable person, our heart loves him, and we may give him a gift. This gift, which is the manifestation of love, is grace. When that person receives the gift, he comes into fellowship and contact with us. Eventually, love, grace, and fellowship are just three aspects of the same thing.<p>Likewise, God&#8217;s heart loves us; this is God&#8217;s love. Out of God&#8217;s love there is a manifestation, which is to give us His only begotten Son (John 3:16). John 1:14 says that this only begotten Son became flesh to tabernacle among us, full of grace. Verse 14 does not say full of love but full of grace. God&#8217;s giving us His Son is love, and the Son&#8217;s coming is full of grace. Thus, love becomes grace. Grace is not wages but a free gift through love. The love that is in the Father becomes grace in the Son. Therefore, when the Father&#8217;s love is expressed, it is the Son&#8217;s grace. However, the reaching of grace for us to receive and enjoy is accomplished by the Holy Spirit. Thus, John 20:22 and Acts 2:4 show us that the Triune God reaching us is the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit reaches us, He transmits the Father&#8217;s love and the Son&#8217;s grace for our enjoyment and experience. The result is that we have fellowship with the Triune God.<p>Hence, when love is manifested, it becomes grace, and when grace is received by us, it becomes fellowship. These are three aspects of one thing. Likewise, when God is expressed, He is Christ, who is God becoming flesh. When this Christ is received by us, He is the Spirit because what we receive is the Holy Spirit. Therefore, there is no way that we can experience Christ without experiencing the Father and the Spirit. The Christ whom we experience is the Triune God; the God whom we enjoy is the Triune God; and the Holy Spirit whom we have received is the Triune God. The Father is the Triune God, the Son is the Triune God, and the Spirit is the Triune God. The Three should not and cannot be divided. This is greatly different from the teaching concerning the Trinity in traditional theology.<h2 class=head1>VERSES IN THE SCRIPTURE REFERRING TO THE SPIRIT AND THE HUMAN SPIRIT</h2><h2 class=head2>John 3:6</h2><p>The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are the Triune God, and the Triune God reaches us as the Spirit. We thank the Lord that He reaches us as the Spirit, and we humans also have a spirit. The ultimate expression of the Triune God is the Spirit-the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit first came to us to sanctify us that we might be saved (1 Pet. 1:2). Then, when we are saved, He comes into us to be our life. The Holy Spirit comes into us by coming into our spirit. This can be proven by several verses in the Scriptures. First, John 3:6 says, &#8220;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&#8221; In this verse there are two spirits. The first is the Spirit, the Holy Spirit, and the second is that which is born of the Spirit, which is the human spirit. When we believe into the Lord by repenting and confessing our sins to Him, we are forgiven and saved. Once we are saved, God&#8217;s Spirit immediately comes into us to regenerate our spirit. Thus, we are regenerated when the Spirit of the Triune God enters into our spirit to be our life. To be saved is not to believe in a religion; rather, it is to receive another life into us in addition to our original human life. This other life is the divine life, which is God Himself. The Spirit comes into us to regenerate our spirit with the divine life. Therefore, that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.<h2 class=head2>John 4:24</h2><p>In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.&#8221; God is Spirit; therefore, when we worship Him, we must worship in our human spirit. God is Spirit, and He created a spirit for man that man may worship Him. Animals and plants do not have a spirit. Only human beings have a spirit. This is not a small matter.<h2 class=head2>Zechariah 12:1</h2><p>Zechariah 12:1b says, &#8220;Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him.&#8221; This verse speaks of three things created by God: the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man. In God&#8217;s eyes there are three important items in the universe: the stretching forth of the heavens, the laying of the foundations of the earth, and the forming of the spirit of man within him. This verse does not speak of the heavens, the earth, and man but the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man within him. In God&#8217;s view this spirit is as important as the heavens and the earth.<h2 class=head3>The Human Spirit Being for Containing and Worshipping God</h2><p>We have a mouth and a stomach in our body to contain food. Without food we humans cannot exist. However, what God considers most important in our being is not our physical organs or psychological faculties but our spirit. Our spirit is our spiritual &#8220;stomach&#8221; to contain God Himself. The Lord Jesus said that He is the bread of life and that He who eats Him will live because of Him (John 6:48, 57). How can we eat Him, and where is He after we eat Him? We receive Him with our spirit into our spirit. God created man with a mouth and a stomach for man&#8217;s physical existence. At the same time, He also created a spirit for man to receive Him. Therefore, the Lord Jesus said that God is Spirit and that when we worship and contact Him, we must be in our spirit and exercise our spirit.<h2 class=head3>The Secrets of Exercising Our Spirit</h2><p>One of the secrets of exercising our spirit is to call on the name of the Lord. We may consider calling on the name of the Lord as the best secret of exercising our spirit. For example, the secret of exercising our feet is to walk. For walking, we use our feet; for seeing, we use our eyes; for hearing, we use our ears; and for praying, we use our spirit. Whenever we pray, we need to use our spirit. Some may have the feeling that when they pray they are often in their mind and not in their spirit. Praying in spirit requires much exercise. This may be likened to a child learning to walk. Before he can walk, he must first learn to crawl and later to stand. After he can stand, then he learns to walk. Once he learns to walk, he no longer needs to crawl or hold on to something. Perhaps when you first start to pray, you are in your mind; but after much practice in praying, you will gradually be in spirit. After further practice, you will reach a point that whenever you pray, you pray in your spirit and with your spirit. Prayer is not just for petitioning God but even more for contacting and fellowshipping with God. Therefore, the best way to pray is to call on the name of the Lord. The Bible even tells us to pray unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17). The only way to pray unceasingly is to call on the name of the Lord.<p>Besides praying, we need to read the Bible. Reading the Bible is not for gaining more knowledge and doctrines but for receiving spiritual supply. The Bible contains profound truths that are not for the believers&#8217; objective knowledge but for their subjective experience. To dive into these profound truths, we need to use our spirit because the Lord said that His words are spirit and are life (John 6:63). To touch the spirit in the Lord&#8217;s words, we need to use our spirit. When we use our spirit, we dive into these profound truths, which are able to help open up our prayers, making them more penetrating and richer. Whether our prayers are deep and rich depends totally upon our knowledge of the truth.<p>Therefore, there are two secrets of exercising our spirit: prayer and pursuing the truth. These two matters complement each other. We must pray, and we must also dive into the truth. Praying can help us get into the truth. The more we get into the truth, the deeper and richer our experiences will be. Even the sense we have when calling on the name of the Lord becomes deep, rich, and weighty. In this way our taste and feeling for the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit will be very different from that in the past.<h2 class=head2>Romans 8:16</h2><p>The fourth passage that speaks of the human spirit with the Spirit is Romans 8:16, which says, &#8220;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.&#8221; John 1:12 says that as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name. Being a child of God is not something which we imagine with our mind or feel with our emotions. How do we experience being children of God? It is by the Spirit&#8217;s witnessing with our spirit. The Spirit as the Spirit of the consummated Triune God comes to witness with our spirit. In other words, since the Spirit of the Triune God is in our spirit, He can witness with our spirit that we are children born of God. This verse strongly indicates that the Spirit of the Triune God is in our spirit.<h2 class=head2>2 Timothy 4:22</h2><p>Paul says in 2 Timothy 4:22, &#8220;The Lord be with your spirit.&#8221; As we have seen, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, &#8220;The Lord is the Spirit.&#8221; The Lord is the Spirit; therefore, He can be with our spirit and is even in our spirit.<p>Putting these five verses from the Scriptures together, we can see a clear picture that the Triune God as the Spirit today is in our spirit. When we worship God, we must worship Him in spirit; when we testify, we testify in our spirit; and when we enjoy the Lord, we enjoy Him in our spirit.<h2 class=head1>SERVICE TO GOD NEEDING TO BE IN SPIRIT</h2><p>Since God as the Spirit is in our spirit, we must serve Him in spirit. The apostle Paul says in Romans 1:9, &#8220;God...whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son.&#8221; This indicates that we must serve God in spirit. Our service to God should not be in letter, rituals, or teaching but in our spirit. Whatever we are and have must be in spirit. Therefore, 7:6 says that we serve God in newness of spirit, and 12:11 says that we must be burning in spirit, serving the Lord.<h2 class=head1>THE HUMAN SPIRIT IN EPHESIANS</h2><h2 class=head2>The Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation</h2><p>Ephesians has six chapters, and in every chapter our spirit is mentioned. In 1:17 the apostle asks God to give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation. In Greek, spirit here refers not to the Holy Spirit but to our regenerated human spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God. Our spirit within our being is a spirit of revelation, a heavenly &#8220;window&#8221; that is capable of receiving light from heaven. God&#8217;s revelation and light enter into our entire being through our spirit. Therefore, before he spoke concerning the profound truths in Ephesians, Paul first prayed that God would make our spirit a spirit of revelation.<h2 class=head2>The Reality and Building Up of the Church Being Only in Our Spirit</h2><p>Ephesians 2:22 says that the church is built up into a dwelling place of God in spirit. Apparently, the church being God&#8217;s house means that God has a house among the saints. Actually, the church as God&#8217;s house is in the believers&#8217; spirit. If the believers in a local church do not know their spirit nor serve and live in spirit, but rather live and walk according to their mind, opinions, and emotions, how can there be the house of God? Such a church is only a church in name; it does not have the reality of the church. The reality of the church is in our spirit. If every one of us walks in spirit and worships God in spirit, the church has the reality and is the dwelling place of God.<p>For us to be built up together in the church, we must be in our spirit. When we are in our mind, we have only opinions and divisions. When we are in our emotion, we have only contentions and murmurings. Very often those whom we love the most are also the ones with whom we are angry the most. If we do not have any dealings with others, there are no arguments, but once we make friends with others, we begin to have quarrels. The same is true even between husbands and wives. The building up of the church is a spiritual matter. When we exercise our emotions, the church is gone. When we exercise our emotions, we open the door to the flesh, opinions, and quarreling; thus, the building work is finished. We may not quarrel outwardly, but if we still exercise our emotions inwardly, there cannot be the building up because we are still outside the spirit. The building up of the church is a matter in spirit.<p>Hence, whether we are young or old, we must be in spirit. Only in the spirit can we have the building and the church. Everything depends on the spirit, not on whether it is good or bad, or right or wrong. It is not that if we are gentle, then there is the church, and that if we are hot-tempered, then there is no church. Rather, only when we are in spirit can there be the church. Therefore, if we are not in spirit, we should not speak, exercise our emotion, or become angry. We should be in spirit not only when we praise or sing hymns but also when we are angry. It is not enough to be in spirit when we pray. If we are in spirit even when we are angry, the church will surely be built up. When we are in spirit, even if we become angry, we are angry for the Lord and not for ourselves. Therefore, when we are angry, we must first return to our spirit, and if it is not of the Lord, we should not become angry. In this way we can be built up together in spirit.<h2 class=head2>Needing to be Strengthened into the Spirit</h2><p>Ephesians 3:14-16 says, &#8220;For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father,...that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.&#8221; Our entire being, including our mind, emotion, and will, must be strengthened into the inner man, which is our regenerated spirit. Paul prayed for us, asking the Father to strengthen our being through His Spirit to such an extent that we would be strengthened into the inner man. In the meetings you may feel that you are very much in spirit and exercising your spirit. However, your being in the spirit may be compared to reeds that cannot withstand the blowing of the wind. Therefore, when you go back to your daily living, a word from the elders or an attitude of your spouse can cause you to become enraged and corrupted. In the meetings your heart is burning, but right after you get home, you are &#8220;doused by cold water.&#8221; If you are this kind of a person, you need Paul&#8217;s prayer, bowing your knees to the Father and asking Him to strengthen your entire being into the spirit. When you are thus strengthened into your spirit, Christ is able to make His home in your heart (v. 17).<h2 class=head2>Being Renewed in the Spirit of Our Mind</h2><p>Ephesians 4:23 says, &#8220;And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind.&#8221; When we were the old man, all of our thoughts were old and corrupted, but now through the renewing of the spirit of our mind we have become the new man. This indicates that there has been a great improvement with our spirit because even our mind is now filled with the spirit, which is the spirit of the mind. When our mind becomes a mind in the spirit, our spirit becomes a transforming spirit that is able to transform our entire being.<h2 class=head2>Being Filled in Our Spirit</h2><p>Ephesians 5:18 says, &#8220;And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit.&#8221; To be drunk is to be filled in the body with physical wine, whereas to be filled in our regenerated spirit is to be filled with Christ unto God&#8217;s fullness (3:19). The spiritual wine, which is God Himself, fills and infuses our spirit. Instead of being drunk in our body with physical wine, we are &#8220;drunk&#8221; in our spirit with God Himself as the divine wine. The result is that we are filled unto the fullness of God to become His expression and flowing out.<h2 class=head2>Praying at Every Time in Our Spirit</h2><p>Ephesians 6:18 says, &#8220;Praying at every time in spirit.&#8221; This indicates that the main organ which we should use in prayer is our regenerated spirit, which is indwelt by the Spirit of God. To pray every time in spirit indicates that we ought to exercise our spirit moment by moment, always living in spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOD AND US BEING A MATTER OF TWO SPIRITS BECOMING ONE SPIRIT</h2><p>When we put together these verses in the six chapters of Ephesians, we can see a clear picture. Chapter one speaks of our receiving revelation in spirit; chapter two, of our being God&#8217;s dwelling place in spirit; chapter three, of our being strengthened into our spirit that Christ may make His home in our hearts; chapter four, of our mind being renewed in spirit that we may be transformed; chapter five, of our being filled with God in spirit; and chapter six, of our praying in spirit. These are altogether a matter of the spirit, a matter of enjoying the Triune God. Therefore, to experience the Triune God and enjoy the fullness of God, we must be in spirit.<p>Today, not only are the doctrines in Christianity too objective, not being able to touch people&#8217;s spirit, but even among us much of our speaking is objective doctrine that cannot touch people&#8217;s spirit. Any doctrine that does not touch our spirit is comparable to the theories of the moralists and philosophers. The teachings of the philosophers, moralists, and religionists have no spirit, nor do they speak concerning the spirit and thus cannot touch people deep within. Therefore, there is no need for people to pray after hearing and seeing something from them. However, in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, what we release and speak must touch people&#8217;s spirit. Therefore, after seeing and hearing something, you need to pray with your spirit. If you do not pray and digest with your spirit, what you have seen or heard is merely an objective doctrine or theory. Once you pray with your spirit, the objective doctrine is turned into a subjective supply. Likewise, when you read the Word, you need to do so with prayer. Pray-read the Word instead of merely reading it. In reading, you use your eyes to see and your mind to understand. However, in prayer, you use your spirit to take in and digest what you have understood, making it your subjective supply in spirit. In this way the Word of God becomes the bread of life supplying us in our spirit.<p>I hope that we can clearly see the matter of the two spirits becoming one spirit. The Triune God has been consummated as the Spirit, and we have a God-created human spirit within us. Today this spirit is the regenerated spirit indwelt by God&#8217;s spirit. Therefore, 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, &#8220;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&#8221; This indicates that through our believing into the Lord and having an organic union with Him, He has entered into us to become our life. However, this may still be an objective teaching; in experience, our union with the Lord in resurrection can only be in our spirit. Through resurrection the Lord has become the life-giving spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), and He is with our spirit now (2 Tim. 4:22). Therefore, to have the experience of being united with the Lord, we must experience being one spirit with the Lord.<h2 class=head1>PRACTICING TO BE ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD THAT WE MAY BE BUILT UP TOGETHER AS THE REALITY OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>How do we know that we are one spirit with the Lord? This is not difficult. Perhaps we do not know if we are one spirit with the Lord, but we know when we are not one spirit with the Lord. It is an amazing thing that when we are one spirit with the Lord, we may not have any feeling, but when we are not one spirit with the Lord, we are quite clear within. When a member of our body is functioning normally, we do not have much consciousness of it, but when it has problems, we immediately have a definite feeling about it. Therefore, to experience being one spirit with the Lord, we need only to practice to avoid not being one spirit with Him. This is sufficient.<p>To be one spirit with the Lord is the greatest salvation and the highest experience for a Christian. Only by being one spirit with the Lord can we enjoy God, experience the Lord, and be sanctified, spiritual, and overcoming. Only in this kind of experience can we have the growth and maturity in life and be transformed and built up together. Eventually, the issue of this kind of experience is the church.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>LIFE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 3:14-15; 1 John 5:12; 2 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 5:10; 8:2, 6, 10-11; John 6:63b; Rev. 2:7; 22:14a, 17</h1><h2 class=head1>THE ESSENCE OF THE BIBLE BEING CHRIST</h2><p>The first mysterious matter in the Bible is Christ, who is God and also man. Therefore, the extract, the essence, of the entire Bible, from the Old Testament through the New Testament, is Christ. Matthew, as the first book of the New Testament, speaks of Christ&#8217;s coming, and at its very beginning it gives a genealogy to show us His origin. A genealogy is a brief introduction to a person&#8217;s origin. Therefore, if we want to understand the genealogy of Christ, we need to know the entire Old Testament, because the genealogy of Christ is a miniature of the entire Old Testament. Following this, the second mysterious matter in the Bible is that this Christ as the God-man passed through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST BEING ONE WHO IS GOD YET MAN</h2><p>The Bible&#8217;s record of the Christ in the Gospels is altogether a story of the Spirit. His conception was of the Holy Spirit. We may say that the Holy Spirit who entered into the womb of the virgin Mary was the &#8220;gene,&#8221; the life factor, of Christ&#8217;s conception. The Holy Spirit was the &#8220;gene&#8221; that came out from God, entered into the womb of the virgin, and became the factor of Christ&#8217;s conception. On the other hand, Christ still had the factor of humanity, which came from His fleshly mother. These two factors mingled together to produce a marvelous One, Jesus Christ, who is God yet man.<p>When He was thirty years old and about to come out for His ministry, the Holy Spirit was poured upon Him so that He was completely anointed by the Holy Spirit. Thus, He as a man was born of the Holy Spirit and anointed by the Holy Spirit. He was saturated by the Holy Spirit inwardly, and He also had the Holy Spirit poured upon Him outwardly. Therefore, He had the Spirit within and without. During the three and a half years of His ministry, this was how He lived, how He moved, and even the more how He worked. He was saturated with the Spirit inwardly and had the outpouring of the Spirit outwardly. This One is our Savior, who is God and also man.<h2 class=head1>THE CHRIST WHO PASSED THROUGH DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2><p>Since Christ is One who is God yet man, He has not only divinity but also humanity. When He was born, He put on humanity, the virgin&#8217;s factor, but this humanity had not yet been uplifted into divinity. It was for this reason that He still needed to pass through death and resurrection. When 1 Corinthians 15 speaks of the definition of resurrection, it uses a seed, in particular, a grain of wheat, as an example to describe what it is to die and be resurrected. In 1936 I was in Peking working for the Lord. One day I went to National Tsing Hua University to preach the gospel. After I had preached there, a person whom I knew and who was studying there came to see me in the evening and said, &#8220;Brother Lee, I was born into a Christian family, but until now I cannot believe in resurrection. When someone dies, how can he be resurrected? This is superstitious. Today everything is scientific, and to be scientific, we must have proof. However, you simply tell people that Jesus died, was buried, and rose again. How can you prove this?&#8221; At that time we two were standing by the window of the faculty lounge in the university. As we looked out the window, we could see a green wheat field. In northern China, wheat is planted in the fall, and it passes through the winter buried under much snow. Then it grows until April or May of the following year before it is harvested. I pointed to that field of green wheat and said to him, &#8220;Can you see? That wheat field outside the window is a matter of resurrection. How can you say resurrection is superstition? Grain after grain of yellow wheat seeds are planted into the earth, and after a few months the wheat grows up. Isn&#8217;t this resurrection? The seed of wheat dies to bring forth the seedlings, then the seedlings grow to produce many grains as fruit. This is a picture of resurrection.&#8221; Because of this word, he immediately became clear. He believed in the Lord and was saved.<p>The first stanza of Hymns, #482 says, &#8220;I am crucified with Christ, / And the cross hath set me free; / I have ris&#8217;n again with Christ, / And He lives and reigns in me.&#8221; We have been crucified with Christ, and now it is Christ living out of us. The third stanza says, &#8220;This the secret nature hideth,/Harvest grows from buried grain.&#8221; This refers to resurrection. A living seed does not have any glory at first; it is neither green nor gold, but once it is planted into the field, it grows up and becomes green. Then as it matures, it becomes rich with golden grains. This is a picture of resurrection. In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus refers to Himself as a grain of wheat, saying &#8220;Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&#8221; This refers to the Lord Jesus&#8217; death and resurrection. When the Lord died, Satan was happy, thinking that the Lord Jesus would be finished after His death and burial. However, Satan did not know that the death of the Lord Jesus as a grain of wheat gave Him the opportunity to enter into resurrection to produce many grains.<p>Even if a grain of wheat remained on a table for one thousand years, it would still abide alone, but if you plant that grain of wheat into the ground, you give it a great opportunity to resurrect and bring forth many grains. It is the same with the Lord Jesus. Even if He had lived on the earth in His physical body for one thousand years, He would have remained alone. When He was &#8220;sown&#8221; into the ground by being killed and buried, apparently He was finished. Who could have guessed that this actually gave Him a great opportunity to be able to resurrect? Nothing could be better for Him as a grain of wheat than to be sown into the earth. Therefore, when He spoke the word in John 12, on the one hand, He was sorrowful, but on the other hand, He was happy. Apparently a grain of wheat that is sown into the ground is broken, but in actuality it is given a great opportunity to resurrect.<p>Concerning the definition of resurrection, 1 Corinthians 15 reveals to us that the body which is sown is different from the body in resurrection (vv. 35-44). Once it passes through resurrection, it is transfigured. When a grain of wheat is sown, it is a bare seed, but what grows up is a green sprout with no trace or shape of the original seed. Christ as One who is God yet man is glorious and divine, but He had the outward shell of His body. He was like a grain of wheat which has life inside but is enclosed by the shell outside. It is only when the shell is broken that the life within the seed can be released in resurrection. Christ&#8217;s crucifixion was to break the shell of His body to release the glorious, divine life within Him so He could enter into resurrection. When He came out of death, His original body, His original shell had changed forever. With the grain of wheat, what comes out is a sprout; with Christ, what came out is the Spirit. A grain of wheat grows into a sprout and then produces many grains with an increase of thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and even a hundredfold. Likewise, when Christ was resurrected as the Spirit, He also produced the believers as the many grains to be His increase. This is the resurrection of Christ and the Christ in resurrection.<p>The revelation of the Bible is very mysterious and is not something we can understand simply by reading it two or three times according to our natural mind. We thank the Lord that although what is revealed is a mystery, it is a fact. In the universe, there is the fact of resurrection. We may not understand it, but we must remember this fact, which is entirely scientific. Do not think that the teachings of the Bible are not scientific. No philosophy or doctrine is more scientific than the biblical teachings.<h2 class=head1>THE MANY ASPECTS OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s coming among men through incarnation was entirely a story of the Spirit. If He had not been conceived and born of the Holy Spirit, and if He had not had the Spirit poured out upon Him, He could never have had those three and a half years of ministering and living. All those who read the four Gospels acknowledge that among the millions of biographies in the world, only the four Gospels are unique, being different from all other biographies in flavor, color, and style. In reading the biography of any person, we are never at a lack for words to describe him, but in reading the four Gospels, everyone admits that no words can adequately describe this Lord Jesus because He is too marvelous and transcendent, and His living is too sublime. There is the fact, but there is not the utterance; there is such a person, but there is no way to describe Him. Man can only say, &#8220;He is too wonderful!&#8221; There are no better words to describe Him. This marvelous and transcendent One is altogether a story of the Spirit in every aspect. After three and a half years of living and ministering, this One who is God yet man and is altogether a story of the Spirit, willingly walked into death and allowed Himself to be sown into death. However, His death was not the end. After three days, He grew out of death, rose again, and became the sprouting Spirit, the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is equivalent to the sprout from a wheat seed that is able to bear many grains.<p>First there was Christ, then the Holy Spirit, and finally &#8220;the Spirit.&#8221; Romans 8:2 says that this Spirit is the Spirit of life. This shows us that after the church was formed and established, the revelation of the Spirit progressed to the Spirit of life. Genesis 1:2 says that the Spirit of God brooded over the death waters. The Spirit of God was present in creation. According to the record in chapter two, after God created man, the name Jehovah is used in the relationship between God and man. In the record of the Bible after this and until the end of the Old Testament, the divine title the Spirit of Jehovah is used in the relationship between God and man. At the beginning of the New Testament, first there was the coming of John the Baptist. Then Christ was conceived and born, and He was anointed at the age of thirty. In all these events the term the Holy Spirit is used. In John 7 when the Lord was ministering, He called people to come to Him and drink, that is, to receive the Spirit, but at that time &#8220;the Spirit was not yet&#8221; because Jesus had not yet been glorified (v. 39). This means that the physical body of this God-man had not yet entered into glory. It was not until He rose from the dead that He was glorified (Luke 24:26). When a grain of wheat is sown into the earth and grows, that is the glorification of the seed, the seed&#8217;s entering into glory. In the same way, when the Lord entered into resurrection and was glorified, there was &#8220;the Spirit.&#8221;<p>It was after this God-man had passed through death and resurrection that there was the Spirit. Therefore, the Spirit is not merely the Spirit of God before incarnation but the Spirit after the Lord&#8217;s resurrection. Now the Spirit is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7), the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9), and the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19). The Spirit of life mainly refers to the reality and element of the divine life, while the life-giving Spirit is mainly for dispensing this divine life into us. The Spirit of Jesus is mainly for the Lord&#8217;s humanity and human living, the Spirit of Christ is mainly for the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ is mainly for experiencing the Lord&#8217;s sufferings in His humanity and His resurrection. Finally, in Revelation, the Spirit becomes the seven Spirits of God-the sevenfold intensified Spirit (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6). Thus, the Lord is the Spirit, and the Spirit today has become the seven Spirits for God&#8217;s move in His administration. Finally, in the ultimate consummation of God&#8217;s administration, the Spirit and the bride speak together as one (22:17). This is the story of the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT BEING LIFE</h2><p>Romans 8:2 reveals that the Spirit is the Spirit of life and that this Spirit of life has a law. This indicates that the Spirit Himself is life because a life is a law. Since the Spirit has become one with life and contains the element of life, He of course is life. Therefore, the Spirit of life is life.<p>John 3:14-15 says, &#8220;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that every one who believes into Him may have eternal life.&#8221; Here it does not say &#8220;the Son of God&#8221; but &#8220;the Son of Man.&#8221; The Son of Man is Jesus in the flesh who was lifted up on the cross as the brass serpent in order that every one who believes into Him may have eternal life. In Greek the word here for life is zoe, which denotes the eternal life. This life is in the Lord Jesus (1:4), and it is the Lord Jesus (John 11:25; 14:6; Col. 3:4). Thus, the Lord Jesus and life are one and cannot be divided. For this reason, 1 John 5:12 says, &#8220;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&#8221; When I was young and read 1 John 5:12, it was hard for me to believe this verse in the Word. I felt that before I believed in the Lord, I already had life. How can this verse say that I did not have life? At that time a pastor taught me, saying, &#8220;Before you were saved, you had life, but the life which you had was not very good. After you were saved, your life became good. This is what this verse means.&#8221; I was not satisfied with this kind of teaching. Later in the Brethren Assembly, I was taught by an elderly brother who had been a student of Benjamin Newton. The Brethren had published a book which purported to be a true explanation of regeneration, and I was very happy when I saw the title of that book. After reading it, however, I was even more confused because the book explained that the teaching of regeneration was the same as the Chinese saying that everything in the past died yesterday, and everything henceforth is born today. I thought that if this were the case, then why did Western missionaries need to come to China to preach this religion? Since we Chinese knew about this long ago, why did we still need missionaries to come teach us? This old brother who taught me understood much about the types and was able to logically and clearly explain them, so I was drawn to him and learned from him for seven and a half years. I truly respected him in this matter. However, I did not feel satisfied with his explanations concerning life.<p>Later I became clear that there were three Greek words for life. In 1 John 5:12 life is zoe, which denotes the eternal life. In John 10:10, the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly.&#8221; The life here is the zoe life. Verse 11 goes on to say, &#8220;I am the good Shepherd; the good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.&#8221; The Greek word for life in this verse is psuche, which denotes the psychological life, that is, the soul-life. Every person has the psuche, the soul-life. The word psuche is the root of the English word psychology. Before we were saved, we all had the psuche life, but we did not have the zoe life, the divine, eternal, and uncreated life of God. In our biological aspect, we also have the physical life, bios. Without the Son of God, we can have the psuche life and the bios life, but we do not have the zoe life, the eternal life of God. When the Lord Jesus died for us on the cross, He laid down His soul, His psuche life, His human life, that we may share His zoe life. Thus, when we have the Son of God, we have the zoe life.<p>All the verses listed at the beginning of this message refer to the zoe life. The zoe life is the divine life, the uncreated life, the eternal life. This life is God Himself. In John 14:6, the Lord Jesus said that He is zoe; He is the life. Therefore, if we have Him, we have the life, but if we do not have Him, we do not have the life. Apart from Him, no other person, matter, or thing is zoe. In the whole universe, only He can say, &#8220;I am zoe; only I am life. Besides Me, no other person, matter, or thing is life.&#8221; How do we gain Him as the zoe life? It is through His death and resurrection. He died and rose to become the life-giving Spirit, and this life-giving Spirit is also life. Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is life. This Spirit is in us as the life in us, that is, the Spirit of life is in us (Rom. 8:2) because this Spirit dispenses God&#8217;s life into us. Therefore, Romans 8:11 says, &#8220;And if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&#8221;<p>Today Christianity has been on this earth for two thousand years, but many people continue to grope in the dark as if they still lived in the age before the apostle Paul. In John 10:7-8, the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I am the door of the sheep. All who came before Me are thieves and robbers.&#8221; The robbers here mainly refer to the Pharisees because they did not come into the sheepfold through the Lord Jesus. These robbers beat people half to death (Luke 10:30) and still felt that they were not bad. Before the apostle Paul was saved, he was such a robber (Phil. 3:5b-6a). All the Pharisees were robbers, not wild robbers with knives and guns, but cultured robbers speaking of love, justice, and morality. Because they only spoke of kindness, justice, and morality instead of Christ, they did not give Christ to people but instead required things of them. In this way they stripped people and became robbers.<p>Since the nineteenth century, many saints have touched the matter of life and have left us many writings concerning life. Today we are standing on their shoulders to put their writings together, compare them, and add to them our own knowledge and experience of the truth of the Bible. Undeniably, what the Lord has shown us is clearer than what other saints have seen throughout the centuries. We are not boasting; since we are standing on the shoulders of those who have gone before, we can see things more clearly. Today a small electrician knows more about electricity than Thomas Edison, the father of electricity, did because today&#8217;s electrician is standing on Edison&#8217;s shoulders. We are not proud, but we are truly standing on the saints from earlier centuries, and we should thank them for this. On the other hand, the Lord has given me a heart to research. In my library there are various versions of the famous, authoritative translations and expositions of the Bible. By the Lord&#8217;s mercy, today we can know that Christ is life and that Christ became the life-giving Spirit, who is the Spirit of life. Today this Spirit dwells in us mainly as life (Rom. 8:11).<p>In general, people&#8217;s greatest fear is of death because death is the end of life. When life is over, everything ends. We thank the Lord that John 3:15 says that we who believe into the Lord have the zoe life, the eternal life, that is, the divine, uncreated, unlimited life. The word eternal here in Greek is related both to space and time and refers to something without the limitations of space and time. This is the true meaning of eternal. Thus, the zoe life which we believers have received is very precious. Today this life is within us. This life is the Spirit, the Spirit is Christ, and Christ is God, not the &#8220;raw&#8221; God but the processed God, the One who is divinity mingled with humanity. This is life.<h2 class=head1>THE LIFE OF DIVINITY MINGLED WITH HUMANITY</h2><p>Hymns, #113, stanza 5 says, &#8220;Though angels praise the heavenly King,/And worship Him as God alone,/We can with exultation sing,/&#8216;He wears our nature on the throne.&#8217;&#8221; This hymn was written by Thomas Kelly and was translated into Chinese by Brother Watchman Nee. The phrase, &#8220;He wears our nature on the throne,&#8221; is a wonderful expression. Since Christ&#8217;s resurrection and ascension, there have been many debates among Christians concerning the person of Christ, and one of those debates is whether or not Christ truly has humanity. This was the reason the apostle John wrote his first Epistle. In 4:2-3 he tells us, &#8220;Every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God; and this is the spirit of the antichrist.&#8221; At that time there was a school of Greek philosophy called Gnosticism, which taught that all physical matter was filthy and essentially evil, and since the human flesh is physical, it also is filthy. The influence of Greek philosophy entered the church, and a great heresy called Docetism rose up. Following the teachings of the Gnostics, this heresy advocated that since Christ is holy, He could never have had the defilement of human flesh, and therefore His body was not real flesh and blood but was merely a deceptive, transient phantasm. Such a heresy undermines not only the Lord&#8217;s incarnation but also His redemption and resurrection. According to what the apostle John said, these heretics were antichrists.<p>This truth was debated up until the nineteenth century when orthodox theologians all rejected the heresy of Docetism. It is very strange, however, that today many Christians still believe a form of this teaching. At most, they confess that the Lord Jesus was a man when He was on the earth, but they say that after His resurrection from the dead, He is no longer a man; therefore, the Christ on the throne today is not man but only God. In the past, a so-called co-worker among us actually said that he did not approve of the last line of stanza 5 in Hymns, #113, which says, &#8220;He wears our nature on the throne.&#8221; He considered that Christ on the throne today does not have humanity. The Bible clearly reveals that Christ on the throne still has humanity. Matthew 26:63-64 says that when the Lord Jesus was being judged, the high priest asked Him, &#8220;Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God.&#8221; The Lord Jesus answered, &#8220;You have said rightly. Nevertheless I say to you, From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.&#8221; This indicates that Christ is still the Son of Man after His ascension and will still be the Son of Man at His coming back. Acts 7:55-56 says that when Stephen was being persecuted, he looked intently into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God, and he said, &#8220;Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.&#8221; This indicates that Christ in the heavens today is still the Son of Man. In Revelation 1:13 the apostle John saw Christ walking as the Son of Man in the midst of the lampstands. Then 14:14 says that when Christ comes again to reap the harvest, He will be the Son of Man sitting on the cloud. Matthew 25:31 also says that when Christ returns to sit on His throne of glory in Jerusalem to judge the nations, He will still be the Son of Man. Furthermore, John 1:51 reveals that He will also be the Son of Man in eternity; at that time the angels of God will ascend and descend on the Son of Man. This shows us that in His ascension, in His heavenly ministry, in His second coming, in His rapturing the believers, in His judging the nations, and in eternity, He is always the Son of Man with humanity. This is the clear revelation of the Bible.<p>This is why we must see that, on the one hand, the Lord Jesus is God over all, blessed forever (Rom. 9:5), and on the other hand, He is also a perfect Man. The Lord in whom we believe is the One with both divinity and humanity. He did not have a body only when He was on the earth. Even after His death, He still has a body. When He came to the disciples on the evening of the day of His resurrection, the disciples were terrified and became frightened, and thought they beheld a spirit because all the doors and windows were closed tightly (Luke 24:36-49; John 20:19-20). Perhaps they thought, &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t the Lord Jesus buried? Perhaps this is His ghost.&#8221; But the Lord Jesus said to them, &#8220;Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your heart? See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself. Touch Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you behold Me having&#8221; (Luke 24:38-39). He showed them the nail marks on His hands and the spear wound in His side, and He even ate a piece of broiled fish before them (vv. 40-43). This indicates that after His resurrection, the Lord still has a resurrected body, which is a glorious, spiritual body. When a grain of wheat dies and then sprouts, we cannot say that it does not have a body; the sprout that grows up still has a physical form. This is the truth that the Bible reveals to us.<h2 class=head1>THE EXPERIENCE OF HAVING ETERNAL LIFE</h2><p>Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is life. Therefore, we have not only Christ and the Spirit within us, but today this life is also in us. Thus, since this life is in us, all the spiritual realities are in us. When we believed in the Lord, we may not have been clear about what we believed, but one thing is clear: When we prayed, Christ, the Spirit, and life all came into us. This can be proven by our experience. There are many among us who were very corrupt. However, when they believed in the Lord, prayed, and were saved, they immediately sensed something within them that gave them an indescribable feeling of joy, exaltation, and brightness. I myself had such an experience. After I was saved, as I was walking home, I prayed, &#8220;O Lord, even if You were to give me the whole world and make me an emperor with great authority, I would not want it. I only want You.&#8221; This is Christ, this is the Spirit, and this is also life entering into us as our life and our everything. This is what gives us such a sense.<h2 class=head1>PURSUING THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE</h2><p>Man&#8217;s real need is not morality, etiquette, or ethics. It is Christ, the Spirit, and life. If we do not have Christ, then we need the teachings of morality, etiquette, and ethics, but when Christ comes, we do not need them. Christ is the Spirit who is within us as life, and this life spontaneously teaches us. However, it is one thing to have this life, and it is another thing to remain continually in this life. The matters of life are all continuous. The necessities of life, such as breathing, eating, and drinking, must be carried out continuously. If we are willing to exercise constantly, then the life within us will be strong and well-supplied.<p>Reading the Bible is our &#8220;eating.&#8221; Reading the Bible is not for gaining doctrines; it is for receiving the supply of life. Thank the Lord that today we have not only the Bible but also the Life-studies and the Recovery Version of the New Testament. Every time we open the Recovery Version, exercise our spirit to pray-read the verses with the footnotes, and then consult the Life-studies, we receive the supply of life. After reading for a few minutes, we can open our mouth to praise with rejoicing and exultation. This is the difference between the Lord&#8217;s recovery and Christianity. It is true that many Christians read and expound the Bible. Our reading of the Word and our preaching, however, are for people to receive the supply of life. We are not like Christianity, which teaches people how to be good children, good husbands and wives, and good parents. There is rarely a message in Christianity that enables people to touch life and receive the supply of life. The situation among most Christians today may be considered as total darkness, where there is no light, life, or truth. Light, life, and truth are almost entirely in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. This is why we must receive the burden to do our best to go out and preach the gospel, teach the truth, and minister life. If someone is unsaved, we must preach the gospel to him; if someone is saved, we must present the truth to him; and if someone is pursuing the Lord, we must minister life to him.<h2 class=head1>THE ENTIRE PERSON- SPIRIT, SOUL, AND BODY-BEING LIFE</h2><p>Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is life. Man has three parts: spirit, soul, and body. When we were saved, this life entered into our spirit, making our spirit life. This is why Romans 8:10 says, &#8220;If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness.&#8221; However, we still have the psuche life, the soul-life, within us. Our mind, emotion, and will still remain in the realm of the psuche. Therefore, we must continue pursuing to give the Lord the room within us by setting our mind, emotion, and will upon Him. The more we love the Lord and pursue Him, the more room He will have within us. His life will not only fill our spirit but also overflow into our soul to saturate our mind. This is to set our mind on the spirit, and the result is that our mind is life, which issues in peace. This is why Romans 8:6 says, &#8220;The mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&#8221; When the mind becomes life, the soul becomes life.<p>If we pursue and exercise further, life will grow a little more. The result will be that the Spirit of the One who raised Christ from the dead, who dwells in us, will be able to give life to our mortal bodies, as spoken of in Romans 8:11. In this way our entire person of three parts will be life; our spirit is life, our mind, the leading part of the soul, will be life, and our mortal body will also have life. This means that our entire being will be life.<p>The law of the Spirit of life in Roman 8:2, which frees us, is the aggregate of verses 6, 10, and 11. This aggregate life-giving Spirit has already been sown into the soil of our heart as the seed of life. Therefore, we do not need to pray and beseech; we only need to diligently pursue and exercise, and life will grow out from this seed. It is just as 1 John 3:9 says, &#8220;Everyone who has been begotten of God does not practice sin, because His seed abides in him.&#8221; We have been regenerated by God in our spirit. Since our spirit has been born of God, we do not practice sin because His seed, that is, the divine life, has been sown into us. According to the revelation of the Gospels, this seed is Christ Himself, and according to the revelation of the Epistles, Christ is the Spirit and life. Thus, all the riches of the divine life will grow out of this seed within us. Every life grows from within; the growth of life is not something added outwardly. Likewise, the life within us will continue to grow to maturity.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT AND LIFE</h2><p>Romans 8:2 joins life to the Spirit. Revelation 2:7 also joins life to the Spirit, saying, &#8220;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.&#8221; This means that whoever listens to the Spirit will be given to eat of the tree of life. Most Bible expositors say that strictly speaking this refers to the millennial kingdom when the overcomers will eat of the tree of life in the Paradise of God as their reward. But today, we in the churches must enjoy Christ as the tree of life in order to obtain this reward in the future. If we do not exercise to eat today, then we will not know how to eat in the future.<p>In the millennial kingdom, the New Jerusalem will be the Paradise of God (Rev. 3:12; 21:2, 10; 22:1-2, 14, 19), and the church today, as the precursor and foretaste of the New Jerusalem, is the Paradise of God today. Therefore, in the churches today we must exercise to eat of the tree of life. In Greek the word for tree in Revelation 2:7, as in 1 Peter 2:24, means wood. This is not the word usually used for tree. This implies the crucified and resurrected Christ. In the Bible, the tree of life always refers to Christ as the embodiment of all God&#8217;s riches (Col. 2:9) to be our food. Thus, when we hear what the Spirit says to the churches, we overcome, and the result is that we enjoy Christ as our life supply.<p>If we want to enjoy the Lord Jesus, we must constantly contact the Lord to be filled with Him. The way to be filled with the Lord is to exercise our spirit and read His word. In John 6:63, the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&#8221; Today the Lord is the Spirit who is not only our life within but also the word. Therefore, the inward Spirit is life, and the outward word is Spirit and life. If we want to enjoy the Lord, we need to exercise our spirit and read the Lord&#8217;s word. Reading the Bible requires our eyes to see, our mind to understand, and our heart to receive, but it also requires our spirit to digest the word. This means that when we read the Bible, we must turn what our mind has understood and our heart has received into prayer. When we pray, we exercise our spirit, and the word becomes spirit and life in us for our supply.<p>This is why we need to come to the Lord again and again every day, not to use our mind to study, but to use our spirit to make a prayer out of what our eyes have seen, our minds have understood, and our hearts have received. If we exercise in this way for only ten minutes, we will immediately be filled inwardly with the Spirit, and the Lord&#8217;s life will function within us, causing us to live in a transcendent situation. This is because we are eating not the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil but the fruit of the tree of life. We are eating not Christianity but the living Christ, who is the Spirit and life. The result is that we do not live in the kingdom of morality, nor do we live in the kingdom of sin, but we live in the kingdom of life, which is the kingdom of reality.<p>Our need today is not merely to hear this doctrine, but to practice this matter. When you turn on a light switch, an electric light shines, but when you turn off the switch, it does not shine. This illustrates the secret of life. Christ has already saved us in His life, but if we do not constantly contact Him, we are cut off from His life, and spontaneously we are still in darkness inwardly and without function. Today the power source has been installed into us, but the important matter is whether or not we turn on the switch in order to obtain the heavenly electricity.<h2 class=head1>LIFE ISSUING IN THE CHURCH</h2><p>To maintain our human life properly and to be healthy, we must breathe every moment, eat three meals, and drink eight glasses of water every day. In addition, we need to stay in a good mood and be pleasant; we should not be angry, depressed, or downhearted. Likewise, we need to exercise our spirit every moment and read the Lord&#8217;s word every day, or else we will catch a spiritual sickness and become weak in our spirit. Then we will only be able to rely on conferences to give us a good &#8220;dose of vitamins&#8221; or to strongly charge us up to keep us going for a period of time. After a period of time, however, our spiritual sicknesses will again come back to bother us. Therefore, we should not rely on conferences and listening to good messages. We must understand that today the Lord is the Spirit who is in us as life. We need to contact Him every moment and read His word frequently, not only with our mind to understand, but even the more with our heart to receive and with our spirit to digest it. This is the way that our inward life receives &#8220;fresh air, nutrients, and water&#8221; to become lively and healthy so that we may live a normal Christian life.<p>We must have a normal Christian life before we can have a proper church life. Just as there cannot be a good country without good citizens, there is no way to produce a good church without good Christians. Christ is the Spirit, the Spirit is life, and life issues in the church. We thank and praise the Lord that He has given us the secret of the Holy Spirit within and the Holy Bible without. We have His Spirit and His word to enjoy. The way to enjoy is to pray, read the word, and call on the Lord&#8217;s name. Through these practices, we have deep breathing, and we eat to the full and drink until we are satisfied that we may live a normal Christian life and bring in the proper church life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 84:1-12; Matt. 16:16-18; 18:15-17; Acts 8:1; Eph. 1:22-23; 2:22; 4:24; 5:25-32; 6:11-13; Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6; 21:10-14; 22:1-2, 16-17</h1><h2 class=head1>HYMNS BEING EXPRESSIONS OF A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE TRUTH</h2><p>Our hymns were written not according to our own ideas but according to the truths in the Bible. To explain the biblical truths is not an easy matter. To express the truths in poems and lyrics requires even the more that we have a thorough understanding of the truths. If we desire to study and pursue the profound truths in the Bible, we must do it by using our hymnal along with the Bible and by being assisted by the life-studies and spiritual books. Sometimes even one line of a hymn is full of the riches of the truth.<p>I compiled our present hymnal in 1966. You cannot find a hymnal in Christianity that is like our hymnal, which is so full of truths in its contents. The table of contents alone occupies five pages, pointing out the sequence of the truths, so that by reading it, one can easily receive light. The study of this hymnal alone is the study of the highest theology in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. To study the table of contents of our hymnal until we thoroughly understand it and find the basis of the biblical truth of each hymn would require at least four years. Our spiritual books and life-studies are the expressions of the truths in written words, and hymns are the conversion of the words into poems and lyrics. To compose hymns is to reach the peak, to arrive at the ultimate point, of the study of the truth.<p>In the table of contents of our hymnal there is a category called &#8220;The Church.&#8221; It covers the church as the mystery of Christ, the increase of Christ, the fullness of Christ, the vessel of Christ, and the lampstand of Christ. It also covers the church&#8217;s general definition, course, faith, unity, foundation, building, attraction, coordination, and fellowship. Hymns, #824 is on the general definition of the church, whereas #852 is on the attraction of the church. Perhaps many of us have been in the church life for a number of years, yet we are still not clear about the definition of the church, nor do we know what kind of price we need to pay when we are attracted by the church. These two hymns reveal to us these two aspects of the truth. I hope that we all can earnestly study the truths contained in our hymns.<h2 class=head1>THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2><p>In the Bible, the Old Testament never mentions the church in plain words, but it contains the types of the church. According to the types in the Old Testament, on the one hand, the church is a woman to be a counterpart, and on the other hand, the church is a dwelling place for God to dwell in. Other than the lamb and the offerings, which are types of the Lord&#8217;s redemption, most of the types in the Old Testament are concerned with these two aspects of the church. On the one hand, the church is typified by a woman as the counterpart of God for His satisfaction; on the other hand, the church is typified by the tabernacle and the temple as the dwelling place of God for Him to dwell in.<p>In the Old Testament, the first type of the church as God&#8217;s counterpart is Eve. Eve, the wife of Adam, was formed of Adam&#8217;s rib and thus had the same nature as Adam. Then she was given back to Adam as his counterpart. Romans 5:14 says that Adam is a type of Him who was to come-Christ. Therefore, the marriage of Adam and Eve is a type of Christ taking the church as His wife. The church comes out of Christ, having the same nature as Christ, and is given back to Christ as Christ&#8217;s counterpart, as revealed in Ephesians 5:25-32. Although the Old Testament does not mention the church in plain words, it portrays the church in typology in a perfectly clear and suitable manner.<p>In the Old Testament, the tabernacle and the temple are types of the church as God&#8217;s dwelling place. In Psalm 84 the psalmist tells us that he longs, even faints, for the courts of Jehovah, which are the dwelling place of God. The function of God&#8217;s dwelling place is not only for God&#8217;s rest but also for His people&#8217;s rest. It is based upon this psalm that Hymns, #851 was written. In the Old Testament time, the children of Israel sang of the dwelling place of God in psalms. This indicates that they had the subjective experience of the holy temple as God&#8217;s dwelling place.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><h2 class=head2>The Church in the Gospel of Matthew</h2><p>In the Gospels in the New Testament, the church is mentioned only twice, in Matthew 16 and 18. In Matthew 16, the Lord had been with His disciples for three years. One day He brought them into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, in the northern part of the land of Judea, far from the atmosphere of Jerusalem. It was there that He asked them, &#8220;Who do you say that I am?&#8221; Peter answered, &#8220;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&#8221; Immediately, the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Upon this rock I will build My church&#8221; (vv. 15-18). This is the first time the term church is plainly mentioned in the entire Bible. Then in chapter eighteen, the Lord said that if a brother sins against us and refuses to hear our admonition, then we should tell it to the church (vv. 15-17). This is the second time the church is mentioned.<p>These two portions of the Word reveal two aspects of the church. The church revealed in 16:18 is the universal church, which is the unique Body of Christ, whereas the church revealed in 18:17 is the local church, the expression of the unique Body of Christ in a locality. Chapter eighteen says that if a brother sins and refuses to hear our admonition, then we should go and tell it to the church. To be sure, this refers to the church in the locality where we are. Therefore, Matthew 18 concerns the local church. The church is unique in the universe, yet it is expressed in each locality. This is the church revealed in the Gospels.<h2 class=head2>The Church in Acts</h2><p>The church is expressed in each locality. So where was it first expressed? This requires us to come to Acts. Verse 1 of chapter eight says, &#8220;The church which was in Jerusalem.&#8221; The church is mentioned here not in a doctrinal way but in a way of actual practice. On the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the disciples so that they, being filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly, preached the gospel with great power and brought in three thousand and five thousand persons on two occasions respectively (2:41; 4:4). Thus, there were close to ten thousand believers in Jerusalem. Christians were everywhere. When they met together in the city, that was the expression of the Lord&#8217;s church in that place, Jerusalem. Hence, the first church that was expressed in a locality was the church in Jerusalem.<p>The church in Jerusalem was the first church established in a locality within the jurisdiction of a city, the city of Jerusalem (5:11). Therefore, it was a local church in its locality, as indicated by the Lord in Matthew 18:17, and was a part of the universal church, which is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23), revealed by the Lord in Matthew 16:18. The record concerning the establishing of the church in its locality is consistent throughout the New Testament (Acts 13:1; 14:23; Rom. 16:1; 1 Cor. 1:2; 2 Cor. 8:1; Gal. 1:2; Rev. 1:4, 11).<p>In Acts 13 there was the church in Antioch. From Antioch, the gospel of the Lord spread outward and reached different cities in Asia Minor. Therefore, 14:23 says that the apostles appointed elders in every church. Every church here means every local church because there is only one church in one city (cf. Titus 1:5). The Greek word for church, referring to the church in Jerusalem in Acts 8 and in the church in Antioch in chapter thirteen, is singular. This indicates that in the eyes of God, regardless of the number of believers, in one city there is only one church. The church in Antioch was one. In Asia Minor, each of the several cities, such as Ephesus and Smyrna, had its respective church, so there were the &#8220;churches.&#8221;<p>In Matthew the Lord Jesus only briefly mentioned the church in its unique, universal aspect and in its local aspect for expression. He only said this much when He was on the earth. Then after His resurrection, ascension, and descending, immediately the church was manifested in place after place, first in Jerusalem, then in Antioch, after that in city after city in Asia, and then in different cities in Macedonia (Acts 16:8-12).<h2 class=head2>The Church in the Epistles</h2><p>In the Epistles, especially in Ephesians, the apostle Paul gives a detailed explanation of the church. He tells us that the church is what God planned in eternity, what God is after in His heart&#8217;s desire; it was God&#8217;s plan in His economy. Before the creation of the heavens and the earth, in eternity past, God had a heart&#8217;s desire, a good pleasure, to gain a group of people as a corporate Body to be His vessel that He may be its life and may dwell in it so that this corporate Body may become His expression. This corporate Body is one entity with Him; He is the life of this corporate Body, and this corporate Body is His outward living. Such a corporate Body is the church.<p>The church is the Body of Christ, and Christ, the Savior, is the Head of the Body. The Head with the Body, that is, Christ with the church, is the one great complete person in the universe. Christ as the Head is the embodiment of the Triune God. In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. Therefore, the Head of this great, universal, complete person is the Triune God, and the Body is the church. If someone would stand before us without a head, we would consider him to be a monster. If we see a headless body making gestures, we would definitely be terrified. It is unfortunate that of the Jews, the Gentiles, the Catholic Church, and many in Christianity, very few know that the Triune God is the Head. In the New Testament dispensation, the Triune God has become the Head of the Body, and His redeemed people are the Body. The Triune God as the Head and His redeemed people as the Body are not like parts of a puppet. A puppet&#8217;s head is something fastened to its body; it may be removed at any time and replaced by another. However, the Triune God as the Head of the church is not something fastened to the Body. Rather, this Head, as the head of a real person, is of life.<p>In Ephesians Paul covers the church in a very thorough way. Chapter one says that the church is the Body of Christ; chapter two, that the church is the dwelling place of God; chapter three, that the church is the fullness of God; chapter four, that the church as the Body of Christ is a new man; chapter five, that the church, the new man, is a bride, a counterpart, a wife; and chapter six, that the church is a warrior. In Ephesians Paul covers the church in its aspects as the Body, the dwelling place, the fullness, the new man, the bride, and the warrior.<p>Paul speaks not only concerning the inner being of the church but also of the outward expression of the church. Titus 1:5 says, &#8220;For this cause I left you in Crete, that you might...appoint elders in every city, as I directed you.&#8221; If we compare this verse with Acts 14:23, we can see that the jurisdiction of a local church is the city in which it is located and that in one city there should be only one church. The eldership of a local church should pertain to the entire city in which that church is located. Such a unique presbytery in a city preserves the unique oneness of the Body of Christ from damage. This practice is an absolute prerequisite for the maintaining of the proper order in a local church.<h2 class=head2>The Church in Revelation</h2><p>Paul was martyred soon after he wrote the book of Ephesians. After approximately twenty-five years, among the apostles of the first generation, only the aged John was still alive. He was the last one to pass away among the twelve apostles. In writing the book of Revelation, he points out at the beginning that the church in each locality is a golden lampstand, that each lampstand bears not one lamp but seven lamps, and that within the lamps there is the shining light. In figure, the golden lampstand signifies the embodiment of the Triune God. First, the nature of the golden lampstand is pure gold, and in typology gold signifies the Father&#8217;s glorious nature and life. Next, the golden lampstand is not simply a piece of solid gold. Rather, the gold is beaten into the shape of the lampstand. This signifies that Christ as the embodiment of God the Father became a man and passed through sufferings and trials for the expression of God. Moreover, each lampstand bears seven lamps. Revelation tells us clearly that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God (4:5). Therefore, in Revelation the golden lampstand signifies the church as the embodiment of the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. That the church is the embodiment of the Triune God corresponds with Ephesians 4. Ephesians 4:4-6 speaks of one Body and one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. This indicates that the church is the mingling of the Triune God with the Body. This corresponds with the golden lampstands in Revelation. The church is the Triune God completely mingled with His redeemed people as one to become a golden lampstand shining locally to express God Himself. When this expression is manifested, it is the testimony of Jesus (Rev. 1:2, 9).<p>At the end of Revelation, when the new heaven and the new earth come, their center is a golden mountain, the New Jerusalem. Upon this mountain is the throne of God, on which are God and the Lamb, Christ. God is the light and Christ is the lamp (21:23). Hence, the New Jerusalem is a lampstand. Ultimately, the New Jerusalem is an aggregate lampstand with Christ as the lamp and God as the light shining out from the golden mountain. This is the ultimate consummation of the church. At the beginning of Revelation, the church is expressed as many lampstands in different localities, with one lampstand for each locality. At the consummation of the church in its manifestation in eternity, all the lampstands are gathered together as the unique, universal lampstand, the New Jerusalem.<p>In Genesis 2 we see Eve as a type of the church being the counterpart of Adam as a type of Christ, and in Revelation 21 we see the bride of the Lamb as the New Jerusalem (v. 2). In the Old Testament we see the tabernacle and the temple as types of the church, and in Revelation we see the New Jerusalem, the consummation of the church, as the tabernacle and the temple (21:3, 22). This is the church revealed in the entire Bible.<h2 class=head1>KNOWING THE CHURCH</h2><p>As saved ones and members of the church, we must know the church. Unfortunately, today&#8217;s Christianity preaches the gospel and teaches the truth, yet it neglects the church. As a result, people today generally consider that the church is a chapel. When I was a small boy, I thought that the church is a building with a steeple and a big bell that is tolled on every Lord&#8217;s Day to summon people to worship. At that time, people used to say, &#8220;We are going to the church to worship.&#8221; What they meant by &#8220;the church&#8221; is the building with a steeple. Even until now, many still say this. I am concerned that many saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery may also consider the meeting hall as the church. Actually, the church is not a physical building; it is an assembling together of all the saints.<p>For more than a thousand years Christianity neglected and abandoned the church, making the church a material thing. In the previous century, when the Brethren in England were raised up, they saw the light and told people that it is a heresy to say that the church is a material building. They pointed out in a clear and definite way that the Greek word for church is ekklesia, composed of ek, meaning &#8220;out,&#8221; and a derivative of kaleo, meaning &#8220;call.&#8221; Hence, the church is the called-out ones, the congregation, the assembly. During the time of the city-states in ancient Greece, when the ruler of a city assembled the citizens, calling them out of their homes to the city square, this big meeting was called the ekklesia. Therefore, it is best to translate this word into the called-out congregation or the called-out assembly. The Brethren properly understood this meaning and therefore did not approve of using the word church, but used assembly instead. In his New Translation of the Bible, Darby renders ekklesia as assembly. The second Christian group that used assembly to denote the church is the Assembly of God. When they came to China, they translated the Greek word directly as assembly instead of church.<p>Concerning the church, the Brethren dealt only with its position. They also said something, but not much, about the church being the Body of Christ. Furthermore, they said, but also not much, that the church is the counterpart, the wife, of Christ. After the Brethren assemblies, it was not until the Lord came to us that He clearly revealed that the church is the Body of Christ, the dwelling place of God, the new man, the fullness of God, the counterpart, the warrior, and the lampstand, which is the complete mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed people. Nearly all the publications among us are on the Triune God, Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church. We tell people that the church is the Body of Christ, the dwelling place of God in our spirit, and the new man who has been fully regenerated and transformed to be filled with God unto all the fullness of God. We also say that the church came out of Christ to be His counterpart, just as Eve came out of Adam and was given back to Adam to be his counterpart, and that the church is a golden lampstand. Especially in the recent few years, we have released many messages concerning the golden lampstand, saying that the church as the golden lampstand is the embodiment of the Triune God and the mingling of the believers with the Triune God, which will eventually consummate in the New Jerusalem, the unique golden lampstand in the universe. Thus, we may say that we have thoroughly covered the matter of the church.<h2 class=head1>THE GROUND AND COURSE OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>We have already seen what the church is in its proper and normal sense. Now we must see that the believers should be in the church after they are saved. Today&#8217;s Protestantism and Catholicism have altogether become deformed. After two thousand years, the church has become degraded and deformed; it has lost its proper and normal condition and is in a state of great confusion. The condition of the church today is different from that at the time when it first appeared. In today&#8217;s Christianity, there is not one locality with one church but one locality with one hundred &#8220;churches&#8221; like a &#8220;church market.&#8221; This situation is typified by the history of the children of Israel in the Old Testament. In the beginning the Israelites were one nation, but they were divided because of degradation. Eventually, they were carried away to Assyria, Egypt, and Babylon. Likewise, the church today has also been divided because of degradation. Who is the proper church? The proper church in God&#8217;s eyes is a group of people who stand on the proper ground and are according to God&#8217;s heart.<p>After the captivity of Israel, there were only the children of Israel but not the nation of Israel. When the seventy years had been fulfilled, God commanded the children of Israel to return from the land of captivity to form a nation again. However, not all of them obeyed God&#8217;s command to return. The books of Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther tell us that only a small number of the children of Israel returned to rebuild the holy temple and the holy city. At that time there were still many Israelites in Assyria, Egypt, and Babylon. Therefore, at that time there were several groups of the children of Israel. Then, in God&#8217;s eyes, which group was the nation of Israel? It was the group that returned to Israel. Because the returned people had the holy temple and the holy city and were in the holy land, they were the nation of Israel. Those who did not return were not. Those who did not return may have been angry, questioning how they could not be the nation of Israel, since they also were descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In the same manner, those in the Christian denominations today may also question why they are not the church, since they are Christians.<p>It is true that the ones who did not return were all Israelites and were descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and that they gathered together in different places. However, they stubbornly remained in Assyria, Egypt, and Babylon, in the lands of captivity, and would not obey God&#8217;s calling to pay the price to return to the holy land for the worship of God. Hence, they were in desolation and became deformed. Before their deformation, they were the proper Israelites, but after their deformation, they became scattered and divided. Although they were still Israelites, they had left the ground of oneness and were no longer the nation of Israel. After the expiration of the captivity, God commanded all the children of Israel to return to the proper ground, the ground of oneness, that is, Jerusalem. Thus, they should not have still remained in Assyria or Egypt, much less in Babylon, a place which was condemned by God. Even if they returned to Bethany, it was still not good enough; they had to go on to Jerusalem. In God&#8217;s eyes, the Israelites who did not return to Jerusalem were not the nation of Israel. Likewise, in God&#8217;s eyes, Christians who do not return to the proper ground to worship God are not the church in practicality.<p>The Jews today are an illustration of this situation. At present there are about fourteen million Jews on the whole earth. The nation of Israel, however, is in the land of Palestine. There are only three and a half million Jews in Palestine, yet in New York alone there are over three million Jews, and in addition, there are over seven million Jews elsewhere. Which of them, then, is the nation of Israel? The Jews in New York may be very willing to contribute and donate to help build up Israel&#8217;s national defense and economic development, but they are still not the nation of Israel. To be the nation of Israel or be a part of the nation of Israel, one must return to the land of Israel and fulfill his obligations as a citizen of Israel by paying taxes and serving in the military. Herein is the difference; many Israelites gathering together are not necessarily the nation of Israel. Only the Israelites who are on the proper ground are the nation of Israel. Likewise, many Christians meeting together may not be the church; only those who stand on the unique ground ordained by God are the church. This is a very clear illustration.<p>At first the church was composed of all Christians. However, the church became desolated and was divided in captivity. Revelation 17 and 18 refer to Babylon the Great. Bible teachers acknowledge that Babylon the Great in chapter seventeen refers to the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Church is the great religious Babylon that carried God&#8217;s people into captivity. In Revelation, Babylon is a great harlot who brought forth many daughters (17:5). The Protestant churches broke away from the Catholic Church in name to become many sects, yet in principle, most of them did not break away from the teaching, practices, and traditions of the Catholic Church. Thus, they became her many daughters. Christianity today has carried Christians away from the normal and proper condition of the church and eventually has caused them to be scattered. This is the fulfillment of the type of the nation of Israel in the Old Testament.<p>In their captivity some Christians saw God&#8217;s revelation and knew that they ought to return from the land of their captivity. However, some only saw the need to return, yet did not see the proper ground to which they should return. As a result, they stopped halfway and became what Brother Nee called the &#8220;halfway cabins.&#8221; Thank the Lord that we have come back to the proper ground. Today we are those who have returned from the land of captivity. We are not in the Catholic Church, nor in the denominations, nor in a &#8220;halfway cabin,&#8221; but on the proper ground.<p>In the ancient time, all the children of Israel knew that they had to return, but only a small number of them returned. Today it is the same. Only we, a few people, have returned. Hence, the proper, normal church today is not the Catholic Church, nor the different Christian denominations and groups, but the few of us who have returned. The saved believers in the Catholic Church and in the different Christian denominations and groups are also components of the church, but they are not the church in practicality. This is similar to the situation of the Israelites in different places. As Israelites, they ought to be the components of the nation of Israel. Nevertheless, because they have not returned to the nation of Israel, they have no share in the formation of the nation of Israel. Today, the majority of Christians are scattered in the Catholic Church and in different Christian denominations and groups. As genuine Christians, they are components of the church, yet they are separated from the church and have no share in the church. Therefore, in the eyes of God, they are not the church, just as the children of Israel who are scattered everywhere are not the nation of Israel.<p>Only the returned Israelites were the nation of Israel. This is because they returned to Jerusalem to recover the proper worship to God and rebuild the temple and the city. As a result, God could also return to Zion (Zech. 8:3), and the glory of God could again be expressed through them. In figure, today, only we who have come out of the Catholic Church and the different Christian denominations and groups are the church. This is because we have separated ourselves from human opinions and organization and have returned to the original ground of the church, the ground of one locality with one church, to meet and worship in spirit as a testimony of the Lord (John 4:24). Therefore, every saved believer should come to the normal church instead of remaining in deformed Christianity.<h2 class=head1>THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>Both Matthew and Acts show us that the practice of the church is that the unique church in the universe is expressed in every locality by taking the principle of one church in one locality. At the beginning, when the Lord first brought His recovery to the United States in order that His recovery may spread to the Caucasian Americans, we did not pay much attention to the Chinese-speaking work. Rather, we worked actively on the Caucasians. Thus, some brothers and sisters who immigrated from Taiwan were lost. Many of these brothers and sisters who immigrated to the United States, which is an English-speaking country, cannot speak English. They can neither understand the messages nor pray in the meetings. Now since more and more Chinese have immigrated to the United States due to changes in immigration laws, we have also begun to pay attention to the Chinese-speaking work. The Lord has confirmed what we are doing by giving us very good results.<p>However, we must be clear that doing the Chinese-speaking work is not doing a work in addition to the work of the church. We do this only for the sake of language. To change language is not an easy matter. Chinese students who have obtained a doctorate degree in the United States may be able to speak about what they have learned in their field, but they are incapable of speaking biblical truths. Therefore, we need to have a Chinese-speaking work all the time. Nevertheless, the Chinese-speaking work is not done outside the church. Rather, it is a part of the work of the local church. It exists only because there are Chinese speakers in the church who do not understand English and therefore need to have Chinese as an alternative. This means that the church can have only the boundary of locality but not the boundary of language. We should not form a church because of language, since in the church there are no differences in nationalities, races, and languages (Col. 3:10-11).<p>Hence, the Chinese-speaking work in every place in the United States must be done in the fellowship of the local church. Never make the Chinese-speaking work a Chinese-speaking unit apart from the local church. To do so is to create division and fall into Babylon. The first church, the church in Jerusalem, also experienced the language problem, but they were able to have the spread and the building up in one accord by keeping the fellowship of the apostles (Acts 6:1-7). Similarly, the brothers and sisters who are involved in the Chinese-speaking work in every place also need to submit to the elders in their respective local churches and be built up together regardless of language. If they do this, the church will be enriched and will increase. On the other hand, the elders should not allow the Chinese-speaking work to have such unlimited freedom that it becomes a separate unit. The elders must always render fellowship, guidance, and supervision for the testimony of the oneness among God&#8217;s people.<p>We thank the Lord that under His sovereignty He has brought so many Chinese to the United States, and He has also brought His recovery here. In 1938 I was working in Peiping, which is now Beijing; at that time I never dreamed of coming to America. A certain saint who had studied in America sent me two checks and told me, &#8220;Brother Lee, I feel that you should go to America. America needs to hear the truths which you preach. Enclosed are two checks: one in the amount of sixteen hundred American dollars is for your traveling expenses, and the other in the amount of twelve hundred Chinese yuan is for your family&#8217;s living expenses for one year. I hope that you can go to America to work for one year.&#8221; In reply I told that saint that I had no burden at all to go to America. She said, &#8220;You don&#8217;t have the burden now, but I believe that later the Lord will send you there. Therefore, keep the two checks with you. When the Lord sends you, you go.&#8221; Afterwards, her prophecy was fulfilled. Twenty years later I passed through America, and after another three years, I came to America to officially start the work.<p>We did not come to America to seek refuge; rather, we brought the Lord&#8217;s recovery to America. It is truly the Lord&#8217;s mercy that so many Chinese are in America. Hence, we have to be faithful to live out the testimony and present it to the Americans that there can be the real spread and multiplication in every church. Instead of producing a Chinese-speaking unit, we should do the Chinese-speaking work only because of the language problem and use such a work as a bridge for the brothers and sisters to be built up so that our Lord may not suffer a great loss. Therefore, the Chinese-speaking work in every place must listen to the church and be one entity with the church. Do not do anything without fellowshipping with the church; neither do anything of which the church disapproves or in which the church refuses to participate. This is a principle. Only in this way can we keep the ground of oneness of the church.<p>The local churches are the expressions of the church in localities. The church is the Body of Christ; hence, a local church is the expression of the Body of Christ locally. The Body of Christ is only one and has no differences in nationalities, races, languages, and social statuses. Rather, Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:10-11). Language is related to practice, but in order to be considered proper practices, all church practices must take the locality as the boundary and keep the ground of oneness.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:16-18; 1 Cor. 12:12-13; Eph. 1:22-23; 5:25-32; 1 Tim. 3:15-16; Rev. 1:4, 11-12, 20; 2:7; 22:17</h1><p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You for Your Spirit and Your word. We worship You even more that Your word is spirit and life. As the Spirit You come into our spirit to be our life, our sanctification, and our salvation in everything. Because of Your precious blood, we believe that You are with us. We also look to You for the rich outpouring of the anointing and that You would grant us Your rich blessings. Lord, we do not trust in our doing, our ability, or our knowledge. We trust only in You, Your blessing, and Your anointing.<p>Lord, we worship You for the past, and we look to You again for the future. We pray that You would visit us again with Your thought, Your feeling, Your word, and Your utterance. We pray further that You would open us to You from within so that our spirit is open, our heart is pure, and our mind is sober. Our whole being is submitted to You, and we want to receive Your implanted word in our submissive mind.<p>Lord, shine Your light among us and reveal in each of us again Your great mystery that we may know Christ, the Spirit, and life and even the more that we may enter into the knowledge concerning the church. Deliver us from our tradition, from the influence of the past, from all the distractions around us, and from all the coverings. We ask You to lift the veils and remove all our coverings so that the heaven above us may be visible, that our eyes may be open and our spirit within be clear. Lord, make our whole being clear as crystal so that Your word may be open to us.<p>Lord, we worship You. May You be abundantly glorified, may Your enemy be greatly put to shame, may Your churches be built up, and may Your saints be edified, supplied, and nourished. Lord, may You answer our prayers and bless us once again. In Your precious name, amen.<h2 class=head1>A SUPPLEMENT OF THE TYPES OF CHRIST IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2><p>The extract of the whole Bible begins with Christ. As we have seen, the Old Testament refers to Christ mostly with pictures and figures, that is, with types that are mainly of six categories: human beings, animals, plants, minerals, offerings, and foods. Under the category of human beings, besides the priest, the king, and the prophet, there are the shepherd and the counselor. Under the category of plants, there are the henna-flower, myrrh, the rose, the lily of the valley, and others.<p>In addition to these six major categories, there are several items in the Old Testament which also typify Christ. One of them is the three universal lights: Christ is the Sun, the moon, and the Star. Numbers 24:17 says that a Star shall come forth out of Jacob, which Star is Christ. Psalm 89:37 says that Christ as the seed of David shall be established forever like the moon, and Malachi 4:2 says that Christ shall arise as the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings.<p>Furthermore, the various dwelling places also typify Christ. First, there is the ark. When the flood came, Noah&#8217;s household of eight entered into the ark and were delivered from God&#8217;s judgment upon the ungodly generation. This typifies Christ as our ark; if we believe into Him, we will not perish but will have eternal life. Numbers 35 also speaks of the cities of refuge where manslayers who kill without intent may flee from death. This typifies Christ as our cities of refuge. We are those who sin without intent, but since we are all sinful in Adam, according to the law we should all perish. However, since we have believed into Christ and have fled into the cities of refuge, we are safeguarded from death, and God will not claim the debt of sins from us. Christ is our refuge. Not only so, He is the excellent tabernacle and temple with all their furniture: the ark, the golden incense altar, the golden lampstand, the showbread table, and the other items. All these are extremely precious matters.<h2 class=head1>THE EXTRACTS OF THE BIBLE BEING CHRIST, THE SPIRIT, LIFE, AND THE CHURCH</h2><p>Christ is complete and perfect, and He has passed through all His processes to become the life-giving Spirit-the Spirit, who is life. Christ, the Spirit, and life produce the church. Our publication entitled The Basic Revelation in the Holy Scriptures covers seven main points concerning God&#8217;s plan, the Son&#8217;s redemption, the Spirit&#8217;s application, the producing of the believers, the believers becoming the church, the church being the reality of the kingdom and bringing in the kingdom, and the ultimate consummation being the New Jerusalem. The extracts revealed in the holy Scriptures are Christ, the Spirit, and life. However, the scriptural revelation does not end with these three items; it ends with the church, that is, with the New Jerusalem as the consummation of the church.<p>Therefore, we have a very clear picture. Our vision has been not only enlarged and advanced but also strengthened and brightened. The two ends of the Bible are Christ and the church, and the process in between is the Spirit and life. During the period from the Lord Jesus&#8217; death, resurrection, ascension, and enthronement to His second coming, the whole universe is altogether a matter of the Spirit and life to us. Our salvation, our growth, our transformation, and our maturity in Christ are all matters of the Spirit and life. Therefore, the Bible is not a book merely about human history, the creation of the heavens and the earth, or much less morality and ethics. The Bible is a book concerning Christ, the Spirit with the human spirit, life, and the church. Christ is the initiation, the church is the consummation, and the process is the Spirit and life.<h2 class=head1>THE OUTLINE OF REVELATION</h2><p>There are two books in the Bible which speak specifically concerning the church. One is Ephesians and the other is Revelation. Ephesians shows us the origin and the existence of the church. It tells us how the church is produced, how the church should have its living, and how it passes through a process. Nevertheless, the book of Ephesians does not show us the conclusion of the church. The conclusion of the church is in Revelation.<p>Throughout the generations, most Bible scholars and teachers have given people the impression that Revelation speaks only about the seven seals, the seven trumpets, the seven bowls, a dragon, and several beasts, the most dreadful one having seven heads and ten horns. Furthermore, they say that Revelation speaks about Hades, the lake of fire, and the last judgment. However, if we study Revelation carefully, the impression we receive of chapter one is that of the seven golden lampstands, signifying the seven churches. Then in chapters two and three we see the seven epistles written to the seven churches-one epistle to each church respectively. This proves that the first three chapters of Revelation speak emphatically concerning the churches. They show us that the churches as the golden lampstands before God are the objects of the Lord&#8217;s speaking in this age, the objects of the Lord&#8217;s work. We can never separate the Lord&#8217;s speaking from the Lord&#8217;s work. Whatever the Lord speaks shall be done. The Lord&#8217;s speaking equals the Lord&#8217;s work. Therefore, the Spirit&#8217;s speaking to the churches equals the Lord&#8217;s working on the churches, and the Spirit&#8217;s speaking concerns the Lord&#8217;s work.<p>In Revelation, the section from chapters four through twenty is an insertion. The first three chapters are a simple explanation concerning the church. Revelation does not speak of the producing of the church. This was spoken of in Ephesians. From the very beginning of Revelation, we can see that the churches are already existing as the golden lampstands illuminating and shining in this dark age. However, during this period of shining, instead of always remaining normal, the church has become somewhat abnormal. Therefore, there is the need of the High Priest-the Son of Man, Jesus Christ-to walk in the midst of the golden lampstands, tending and trimming the golden lampstands. This corresponds with the type in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament, the priests had to enter the Holy Place every morning and evening to tend and trim the golden lampstands, that is, to clear out the wax, trim the charred wick, and add fresh oil. In the first three chapters of Revelation, Jesus Christ as the High Priest is there to tend the golden lampstands by trimming the charred wick and supplying fresh oil. All the seven epistles are there to clear up the wax and trim the charred wick so that the seven lampstands can all shine forth and illuminate in a normal way.<p>However, there are many other stories in the universe. The Bible shows us that the universe is divided into three levels: heaven, earth, and under the earth (Phil. 2:10). In heaven, there is Satan resisting God&#8217;s work; on earth, there are fallen men rebelling in an uproar. Furthermore, Revelation shows us that under the earth, in the abyss, there is no serenity. The spirit of Antichrist is awaiting the opportunity to overthrow God&#8217;s governmental administration. Therefore, all the three levels in the universe are chaotic and in upheaval and unrest. Thus, there is the need of the insertion from chapters four through twenty to deal with and clear up these things.<p>Revelation 4 shows us that God is sitting on the throne. Regardless of the uproar in heaven, on earth, and under the earth, nothing can overthrow the throne in heaven. God is still sitting high up on the throne, having everything under control. He will deal with all the rebellions: the rebellion in heaven, the rebellion on earth, and the rebellion under the earth. Finally, He will deal with the leader of the rebellions, that is Satan, the devil, the ancient serpent, the great dragon. In chapter twenty God first binds Satan, the great dragon, and casts him into the abyss for a thousand years. At the end of the thousand years, Satan will be temporarily released, and he will rebel even more. Eventually, God will capture him and cast him into the lake of fire to utterly terminate him. In this way, all the negative things in the universe, whether in heaven, on earth, or under the earth, will be swept into the lake of fire. Then the new heaven and the new earth will be brought forth.<p>In Revelation 21 to 22, concerning the new heaven and the new earth, the revelation is once again on the church. However, what we see now is the aggregate of the church. In the new heaven and the new earth, the church is an aggregate-the New Jerusalem. The church in the old heaven and old earth is only a miniature of the New Jerusalem, but in the new heaven and the new earth we see the ultimate consummation of the New Jerusalem. This is the vision of the church in Revelation.<p>Therefore, we should not be influenced by traditional Christianity. We should be clear that Revelation speaks of the church. The first three chapters tell us how the church shines forth as a golden lampstand in the old heaven and old earth. The last two chapters tell us how the church is consummated in the new heaven and new earth. The old heaven and old earth may be compared to the night, whereas the new heaven and new earth are the real day. The old heaven and old earth are a long, dark night, and in this long stretch of night the church is a golden lampstand. The first three chapters of Revelation show us how the church as the golden lampstand passes through the long, drawn-out night of the old heaven and old earth. Then the insertion of seventeen chapters follows, telling us how in this long stretch of night God on the throne is taking care of everything in order that all things can be cleared up properly. God uses the seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls as judgments to clear up the whole universe, and eventually everything negative is cleared up and swept into the lake of fire. In this way, the whole universe is cleared up and purged. Then, in the last two chapters, the old heaven and old earth are renewed into the new heaven and new earth. At that time, the church will be not only a golden lampstand but also a holy city, the New Jerusalem. This is the outline of the entire book of Revelation.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH IN THE GOSPELS</h2><p>The verses in the New Testament concerning the church are very mysterious. The Bible is not an ordinary book, and the verses in it concerning the church are even more extraordinary. In Matthew 16:16-18, Peter first had the realization that the Lord Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. Then, immediately afterwards the Lord told him, &#8220;Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens. And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church.&#8221; This rock refers not only to Christ but also to the revelation concerning Christ which Peter received from the Father. That is why this portion of the Scripture is so mysterious that almost no one can expound it thoroughly.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH IN 1 CORINTHIANS</h2><p>First Corinthians 12:12 says, &#8220;For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.&#8221; The Christ, which is a literal translation, refers to the corporate Christ. This means that the Body has become Christ. Verse 13 goes on to say, &#8220;For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&#8221; Very few Christians realize that when they were baptized in the Holy Spirit, they were baptized into one Body. The believers are baptized through water and in the Spirit not only into Christ, the death of Christ, and the name of the Triune God, but also into the Body of Christ. We were individual and scattered, but when the Lord Jesus baptized us in the Holy Spirit, He baptized us into one body. We are no longer individuals but members of the Body.<p>According to the revelation in 1 Corinthians 12:12, we are all members of the Body of Christ. Yet, as the members we often like to be alone; we do not like to be in the Body. How pitiful and distorted this is! It would be awful if, when someone prophesies, only his mouth rose to prophesy and the rest of his body remained seated. Nevertheless, this is comparable to the situation among most Christians, even among us. We all acknowledge that we are members of Christ. Sometimes we even say that we should share everything with one another, we are all members, and we have to love one another. However, no matter how much we love, if we do not live in the Body, our love is merely in word and in tongue. Our eyes truly need to be opened to see that we cannot be individualistic. Rather, we must be in the Body to have the reality of loving one another. Only when each member is properly placed in the Body can there truly be a lovely and attractive situation.<p>Therefore, in speaking of the church, we must pay attention to the oneness of the church. Without oneness, there is no church, for the church is one Body. The Body is one, and without oneness, there is no Body. Today many Christians say that we should not have a narrow view or be sectarian but should simply love one another. However, unless we are joined together in oneness, there is no way for us to love one another. We cannot love one another except in the Body, in oneness. In the Body, we spontaneously love one another.<p>When I was saved, a pastor told me that Christians should be divided. At that time the population in Chefoo was about 250,000. That pastor said, &#8220;If there is only one church in Chefoo, this is like having only one electric lamp in a big house at night. No matter how much the lamp shines, the house will still be poorly illuminated. Therefore, there is the need for more lamps. At present there are eight denominations in Chefoo. This means that there are eight lamps. Wouldn&#8217;t it be better to have more lamps? That is why we should be divided into more groups.&#8221; This is Christianity&#8217;s schismatic philosophy, a philosophy of division. Today many Christians justify division and in doing so consider themselves to be broad-minded. A certain group of people left us because they said they desire to be broad to include all Christians. Eventually, however, they could not even tolerate their own people and have been divided over and over again. It is truly not a glorious matter for Christians to be divided and schismatic. Rather, it is a shameful thing.<p>Someone once commented that among the Chinese who come to the United States, two lines of business have been the most prosperous. One is to open a restaurant, and the other is to set up a church. Both of these enterprises can be carried out by the whole family laboring together. Because of amendments to the immigration laws, more and more Chinese have immigrated to the United States. Chinese-speaking churches have mushroomed in every place so that there seems to be a &#8220;church market.&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s recovery, on the other hand, has the clear light. The more we go on in this way, the more we are clear within, the more our eyes are opened, and the more we believe we are walking in the Lord&#8217;s intention. The church is the Body of Christ. As there is only one Christ, so there should be only one church. One head with many bodies is a monster. The Body of Christ is not a monster but the new man. Therefore, there is only one Body. First Corinthians 12:12-13 clearly reveals that although we are many, we are still one Body. Moreover, we have been baptized in one Spirit into one Body. Since the Body is one, there should be no division. Rather, we should have the same care for one another in the Body (v. 25).<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH IN EPHESIANS</h2><p>Ephesians 1:22-23 says that not only has Christ been exalted to be Head over all things, He is also Head over all things to the church. This indicates that His being Head over all things is related to the church and is for the church. The church is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.<p>In 5:25-27 the apostle tells us that Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her. Furthermore, not only did He shed His precious blood to cleanse us from our sins, but He also cleanses us by the washing of the water in His word that we may become a glorious church. As we have seen, the Spirit and the word are one, and the word is the Spirit. Therefore, the water in the word is the Spirit in the word. The Lord washes the church with the Spirit in the word. This washing is different from the washing of the precious blood. The precious blood washes away our sins and filthiness objectively, whereas the water washes away our spots and wrinkles subjectively. Spots, which are of the natural life, are scars left by the wounded natural life, whereas wrinkles are related to oldness. Hence, spots and wrinkles cannot be cleansed by the precious blood. Only the water in the Lord&#8217;s word, the Spirit of life operating within us, can wash away our spots and wrinkles and replace them with something new. The Lord does not perform an operation, like a plastic surgeon does, to remove our spots and wrinkles. Instead, He nourishes us as a nutritionist and removes our spots and wrinkles by the way of metabolism. The Lord uses the water in His word to cleanse the church of the spots from former wounds and the wrinkles due to oldness, thus making the church a glorious church, holy and without blemish.<p>Verses 28-32 say that we are all members of Christ. Everyone cares for his body and cherishes, rather than hates, his own body. In the same manner, Christ nourishes and cherishes the church, which is His Body. Husbands and wives are a type of Christ and the church. Therefore, husbands must love their wives as their own bodies. For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh. In like manner, Christ and the church not only are one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17) but also have become one Body (Eph. 1:22-23), as typified by a husband and a wife becoming one flesh. That is why Paul said that he spoke this with regard to the great mystery-Christ and the church (5:31-32).<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH IN 1 TIMOTHY</h2><p>First Timothy 3:15 says that the church is the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth. This means that God lives subjectively in the church, and He acts, moves, and works in the church. The church, which is the pillar and base of the truth, holds, bears, and testifies all the real things concerning Christ and the church. Therefore, verse 16 says that the mystery of godliness is great, that is, that God was manifested in the flesh.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH IN REVELATION</h2><p>The first three chapters of Revelation reveal that while the church is on earth, there is only one church in each locality. The seven churches are golden lampstands in seven localities. Within, the church needs the Spirit, and without, it needs a practical expression in localities. In 1:11, the Lord Jesus charged the apostle John to write what he saw and send it to the seven churches: &#8220;To Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.&#8221; Had there been only one federated church, one epistle would have been sufficient. However, the Greek word for to is used before every place named. Moreover, chapters two and three prove that there were definitely seven epistles written to seven churches respectively, not one general epistle to seven places. This indicates that the seven churches did not form a federation; they were churches in seven different places. Therefore, in 1:12 and 20 the Lord Jesus told John that the seven golden lampstands are the seven churches. This shows us that there is one church in one locality and that each local church is a golden lampstand.<p>Eventually, in the last two chapters of Revelation there is the ultimate manifestation of the church-the New Jerusalem. This city, the New Jerusalem, is built as a golden mountain, on the top of which is the throne of God and of the Lamb. There, God is the light, and the Lamb, Christ, is the lamp. Therefore, this golden mountain is the ultimate consummation of the golden lampstand shining forth God. In this age, the church appears in every place as a golden lampstand in each locality. In eternity, the church is only one, as the New Jerusalem, the unique golden lampstand. This is indeed very mysterious.<p>This New Jerusalem, with the golden mountain as its base, is built with precious stones. There are twelve gates all around, and each gate is a pearl. The wall as well as the foundation are built with jasper and precious stones. Within the city, there is a throne, out of which comes a street which passes by the twelve gates in a spiraling manner. In the middle of the street flows a river of water of life which proceeds out of the throne, and on the two sides of the river grows the tree of life. If we study this picture in detail and pray-read and digest it thoroughly, our eyes will be opened to clearly see what the church is.<h2 class=head1>THE CONCLUSION CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class=head2>The Relationship between Christ and the Church</h2><p>The church comes out of Christ, through the Spirit, and by life. Therefore, the church is a product of Christ, the Spirit, and life. First of all, we need to know the relationship between Christ and the church. The church is in Christ and comes out of Christ, as Eve came out of Adam. God created only Adam, but after Adam was created, God said that it was not good for the man to dwell alone. This indicates that God Himself felt a lack. Therefore, God caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep and took a rib from his side to build it into a woman. This signifies that the church came out of the side of Christ. When the Lord Jesus was crucified, His side was pierced and out came blood and water (John 19:34). Blood is for redemption, to deal with sins for the purchasing of the church (John 1:29; Heb. 9:22; Acts 20:28). Water is for imparting life, to deal with death for the producing of the church (John 12:24; 3:14-15; Eph. 5:26-30). This proves that the church comes out of Christ.<p>Second, the church is of Christ. Since the church is out of Christ, it is also of Christ. Out of denotes the source, whereas of denotes the essence. The essence of Eve was the same as that of Adam; there was no difference in essence because Eve was of Adam, being built with a rib of Adam. Therefore, Eve was not only out of Adam but also of Adam. In like manner, the church is not only out of Christ but also of Christ. The essence of the church is nothing other than Christ Himself (Col. 3:11).<p>Third, the church is joined to Christ. The union of the church with Christ is not only like the joining of a wife to a husband, but even more like the union of a body with a head. Even though a couple may be joined, they are still somewhat separate, but a head and a body cannot be divided because once they are divided, they are finished. This means that the union of the church with Christ is an organic union, not an organizational association. A table is made up of pieces of wood joined together; this is organizational. However, a head and a body are joined together not organizationally, but organically.<p>Fourth, the church is based upon Christ. The Lord Jesus said that He would build His church upon &#8220;this rock&#8221; (Matt. 16:18). This rock refers to Christ and also to the revelation concerning Christ. This means that Christ is the foundation of the church and that the church takes Christ as its starting point. Christ is the unique foundation of the church (1 Cor. 3:10-11). The church is out of Christ, of Christ, joined to Christ, and based upon Christ.<h2 class=head2>The Relationship between the Church and the Spirit</h2><p>We also need to see the relationship between the church and the Spirit. According to the Bible, the church is first baptized in the Spirit into one Body (1 Cor. 12:13); second, the church is given to drink the Spirit; third, the church lives in the Spirit; and fourth, the church is for the manifestation of the Spirit. On the one hand, the church is out of Christ, of Christ, joined to Christ, and based upon Christ. On the other hand, the church is baptized in the Spirit into one Body and is given to drink this one Spirit. To be baptized is to be immersed in the Spirit; to drink is to have the Spirit saturating us within. In the area around Nanking and Yangchow in China, there is a saying: &#8220;In the morning, the skin wraps the water; at night, the water wraps the skin.&#8221; When a person sits in the tea house in the morning drinking tea, that is the skin wrapping the water; when he goes to soak himself in a bath at night, that is the water wrapping the skin. This is the local people&#8217;s secret to health. For a Christian to be healthy, there is also the need to have &#8220;the skin wrapping the water&#8221; and &#8220;the water wrapping the skin.&#8221; First, it is the &#8220;water wrapping the skin,&#8221; that is, to be baptized in the Holy Spirit. Then, it is the &#8220;skin wrapping the water,&#8221; that is, to drink the Holy Spirit moment by moment. In this way, our living is in spirit. Once we live in spirit, the issue is that Christ is expressed. This is similar to what Revelation says concerning each golden lampstand having seven lamps. The seven lamps are the expression of the golden lampstand; this is the manifestation of the Spirit because the seven lamps are the seven Spirits (Rev. 4:5). Therefore, the church is baptized in the Spirit, is given to drink the Spirit, lives in the Spirit, and is for the manifestation of the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>The Relationship between the Church and Life</h2><p>We also need to see the relationship between the church and life. First, the church has been regenerated by God and possesses the regenerated life. The church is of life because every member of the church has been regenerated by God. When I was young, at least two books told me that regeneration is simply a renewal, that &#8220;everything in the past died yesterday, and everything henceforth is born today.&#8221; I could not accept this saying. In 1954, I came across a book by Brother T. Austin-Sparks, in which he said that regeneration is to have God&#8217;s life in addition to our human life. That was the day I became truly clear about what regeneration is. Regeneration is to receive another life, God&#8217;s zoe life, in addition to man&#8217;s psuche life.<p>If we do not have Christ as God&#8217;s life, we do not have life. Therefore, 1 John 5:12 says, &#8220;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&#8221; Since the Son of God is this zoe life (John 11:25; 14:6; Col. 3:4), once we have the zoe life, we are regenerated. Being born from our mother&#8217;s womb was our first birth for us to receive the psuche life, which is the human life. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were born of God. That was our regeneration for us to receive the zoe life, which is the life of God. Hence, the church is out of the zoe life.<p>Second, the church grows in life. The matter of growth is mentioned many times in the New Testament, such as arriving at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13), the growth of the Body (v. 16), and growing with the growth of God (Col. 2:19). All these refer to the growth of the zoe life in us. When the life of God grows in us, we grow in this life unto maturity and arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.<p>Third, the church is transformed in life. When life grows, there is transformation. When a flower blossoms, that is its transformation. Initially, flower seeds are not pretty, but the more they grow, the better they look and the more they are transformed to be beautiful. Children grow and change daily so that they become bigger and more mature. To become grown-up is to be changed. In the zoe life, we do not grow worse or change for the worse. Rather, we grow stronger and become newer, even rejuvenated. Therefore, we are born of life, grow in life, and are transformed in life.<p>Fourth, the church is built in life. Without the zoe life, there is no building of the church. The natural human life, being divisive and individualistic, does not care for building. However, the zoe life likes the building. Only the zoe life can cause us to be built together.<p>Furthermore, the church is unique in the universe, though it also appears in localities. Although there is one church in each locality, there is still only one church. Therefore, the contents of the church are Christ, the Spirit, and life, and the appearance of the church is one church in one locality. If we truly love the Lord, we must grow in life, live by the Spirit, and live in Christ. Eventually, we are manifested as the church in every locality to be the expression of the Triune God as the shining golden lampstands, the ultimate consummation of which is the New Jerusalem. All the above items comprise the church.</body></html>
