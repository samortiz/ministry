<p>Prayer: Father, we do worship You. We worship You for Your economy; we worship You for Your Son; and we worship You for the Spirit. We worship You for choosing all of us. Thank You that we could have another training to look into Your Word, to get into Yourself, and to enjoy all the riches You have in Your Son for our portion. Lord, do cleanse us. How much we need Your cleansing! How we need, even the more, Your anointing. Anoint each one of us. Anoint the entire congregation. Lord, fill this hall with Yourself that we may be gathered into Your name, into Your Person, into Your presence. Lord, thank You for Your constant presence. We live in this presence. Now we gather in this presence. We speak in this presence, and we listen to Your word in this presence. Thank You that You are so available, so rich, and so much to us. Even now, while we are gathering, we enjoy You. Lord, do speak Yourself into each one of us. While we are speaking, Lord, speak in our speaking. Do something for Your move, for Your up-to-date move. Show us Your way. Show us what is within You, Your heart&rsquo;s desire. Lord, cover us from the attacks of the enemy. Destroy him. Put him into the corner. Put him to shame. As the church, we bind him in Your mighty name. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">To Have a People to Be the Body of Christ for<br />
a Corporate Expression of the Processed Triune God</h2>
<p>In this chapter we want to see the God-ordained way to meet and to serve as revealed in the holy Word. First, we need to be impressed that the meetings of the believers should always be linked to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to have a people to be the Body of Christ for a corporate expression of the processed Triune God (Eph. 1:23; 3:19). The processed Triune God refers to God who has gone through so many processes. The Triune God came down from the heavens and passed through incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension.</p>
<p>The first process He went through was incarnation (John 1:14). Following this He passed through human living. Our God became a man in His incarnation, and as a man He lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years. In His first thirty years He lived as a poor Nazarene in a poor carpenter&rsquo;s home in the despised village of Nazareth. For us as men to live on this earth is commonplace, but for the infinite God, the eternal God, the unlimited God without beginning or ending, the Creator of all things, to live among human beings and work as a carpenter is wonderful. We may think that He lived in Nazareth all that time for nothing. But His living there was very meaningful. If the President of the United States were to move to a small locality to live, many people would be investigating to see what he was doing there. Nobody would believe that he was doing nothing in this place. Everyone would think that he was doing something so crucial, secret, important, and strategic. Do you think that the Lord Jesus lived in a poor home in Nazareth for thirty years without doing anything? His living in a carpenter&rsquo;s home for thirty years day after day, week after week, month after month, and year after year is a wonderful mystery. Our God, the Triune God, the infinite God, the eternal God who created the heavens and the earth, became a man and lived purposefully on this earth for thirty-three and a half years. His human living was the second step of the process He went through.</p>
<p>The third step of this process was the all-inclusive crucifixion, the all-inclusive death that Christ passed through. By His death every negative thing in the universe was dealt with (Rom. 8:3; 6:6; Heb. 2:14; John 12:31; Eph. 2:15), His life was released (John 12:24), and the church was redeemed (Eph. 5:25b; Acts 20:28b). Following this step was the step of resurrection. By His resurrection, He was glorified (Luke 24:26), He became the firstborn Son of God (Acts 13:33; John 20:17), making all of us His brothers (Rom. 8:29), and He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) breathed into us to be with us forever (John 20:22; 14:16-20).</p>
<p>The fifth step was His ascension, in which He was made Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36) and given to be the Head over all things to the church, which is His Body (Eph. 1:22-23). Through His ascension, He went back to the heavens. He came down from the heavens as God, but He went back to the heavens as both God and man. He came only with divinity but He went back with both divinity and humanity. Before His incarnation, He was in the heavens merely as God. Now that He has gone back to the heavens, He is sitting on the throne not merely as God but as God and as man (Matt. 26:64; Heb. 1:3, 13; Ezek. 1:26). The wonderful Person on the throne is the God-man. Our God today is not merely God; our God today is the very God-man.</p>
<p>This God-man desires an expression on this earth. The church should be the corporate expression of the processed Triune God. We must keep this in mind whenever we come together to have a Christian meeting. Our meeting must be linked to this expression, the expression of the processed Triune God. In our meetings, all the items of the Triune God&rsquo;s process should be fully covered and fully realized. We are meeting here with His incarnation, with His human living, with His all-inclusive death, with His resurrection, and with His ascension. We need this kind of message, this kind of teaching, this kind of revelation, and this kind of vision.</p>
<p>We need to come into the meeting with a vision of God becoming a man and in human living passing through all kinds of trials and suffering all kinds of hardships. We should come to the meeting with a vision that He has accomplished an all-inclusive death to terminate all the negative things. We should come to the meeting with a vision that we have been terminated. Our self, our flesh, our natural man, and all that we are as descendants of Adam have been crucified on the cross. We also need to come to the meeting with a vision that He is now in resurrection, and in Him and with Him we are also in resurrection (Eph. 2:6). Furthermore, we should come to meet with the saints in ascension (Eph. 2:6). We are not only in the heavens but also in ascension. We need to keep in mind that whenever we come together, we are linked to all these things.</p>
<p>Moreover, we should have the realization that we are coming to the meeting not only as men. We are coming to the meeting in incarnation as God-men, as those who have been mingled with God (John 1:12-13; 2 Tim. 4:22; 1 Cor. 6:17) and who have God living in them (1 John 4:15; 2 Cor. 13:5; Rom. 8:9; Eph. 4:6). While we are meeting, we are not Germans, Africans, Chinese, or Americans. We are meeting as God-men. If we have this vision, we will see that each one of the saints in the meeting is a God-man. There is no Chinese, no American, no German, and no French, but all are God-men! Can we meet this way? We have to say a strong &ldquo;yes!&rdquo; We meet as God-men! If we have this vision when we come to meet, we will be full of praises. When we assemble with the saints, we will say, &ldquo;Hallelujah! I am a God-man coming here to meet with other God-men!&rdquo; Our meeting is not a meeting merely of Christian believers but of God-men. The vision of this one item will send us to the heavens. Our meeting is altogether linked with the processed Triune God, and we are in the meeting as a corporate expression of the processed Triune God according to His divine economy.</p>
