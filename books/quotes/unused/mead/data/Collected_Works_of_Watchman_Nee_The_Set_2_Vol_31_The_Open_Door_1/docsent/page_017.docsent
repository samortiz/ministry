   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear Brother X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I received your letter a long time ago.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because of a boil on my hand, it has been difficult for me to write, and I was delayed in replying to your letter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have to ask the Lord to show me what position I should stand on and what gift I have been given in the Body of Christ so that I may be faithful to the end and so that I may not overstep or restrict the gift of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>X is still sympathetic to us and still has us in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is hope for him to turn.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>May the Lord accomplish the work of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Your prayer before the Father will certainly be remembered.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Dear Mr. X, my brother in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since I preached the gospel at the temples, my inward being has been more in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have no confidence about anything pertaining to the present situation, and I feel that a multitude of believers is being tested generally in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The gold has changed its color, but perhaps God will grant us faith that is more precious than gold.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He has promised "the proving of your faith, much more precious than of gold which perishes though it is proved by fire."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In another place He says, "God is mindful of sending woes to men."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In another place He says that in the last days, "because lawlessness will be multiplied the love of many will grow cold."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God is testing the believers to see whether they meet the standard of "cast down but not destroyed."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In other words, He is finding out whether believers will pass the test when they are put through a certain environment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Formerly a life of faith was required only of the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now every believer has to live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It seems that my prayer has done nothing except bounce off a blank wall, but I still insist that I will find my way out through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Concerning the condition of the meeting, Brother X has been most zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He goes with some other brothers to the Army Casualty Hospital and the Refugee Camp often to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is also faithful in his material offerings.</S>
