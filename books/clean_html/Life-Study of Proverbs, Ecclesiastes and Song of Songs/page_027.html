<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. Concerning Fools</H2><P>Like snow in summer and like rain in harvest, so honor is not fitting for a fool. Like the sparrow in its fluttering, like the swallow in its flying, so a curse without cause does not alight. A whip for the horse! A bridle for the donkey! And a rod for the back of fools! Do not answer a fool according to his folly, lest you also be like him. Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes. He who sends a message by the hand of a fool cuts off his own feet and drinks violence. Like the legs of the lame which hang down, so is a proverb in the mouth of fools. Like one who binds a stone in a sling, so is he who gives honor to a fool. Like a thorn that goes up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a proverb in the mouth of fools. Like an archer who wounds everyone, so is he who hires a fool or who hires those who pass by. Like a dog that returns to its vomit is a fool who repeats his folly. Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him (26:1-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. Concerning Contentious Women</H2><P>A continual dripping on a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike. He who would restrain her restrains the wind, and grasps oil with his right hand (27:15-16). It is better to dwell in a corner of a housetop than in a house shared with a contentious woman. It is better to dwell in a desert land than with a contentious and vexing woman (21:9, 19; 25:24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>12. Concerning Strange Women and Harlots</H2><P>The mouth of strange women is a deep pit; he with whom Jehovah is indignant will fall in there (22:14). For a harlot is a deep pit, and an adulteress is a narrow well. Indeed, she lies in wait as a robber, and increases the number of the treacherous among men (23:27-28). He who keeps company with harlots wastes his substance (29:3b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>13. Concerning Riches</H2><P>An inheritance gained hurriedly at the beginning will not be blessed in the end (20:21). A faithful man will abound with blessings, but he who makes haste to be rich will not go unpunished. A man who is envious hastens after wealth, and does not know that want will come upon him (28:20, 22). Proverbs 23:4-5 says, "Do not weary yourself to become rich; /Cease from your consideration of it./When you set your eyes upon it, it is gone;/For wealth certainly makes itself wings, /Like an eagle that flies toward heaven." The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor, a snare of death. All day long one covets greedily, but the righteous man gives and does not hold back (21:6, 26). The ruler who lacks understanding is also a great oppressor, but he who hates unjust gain will prolong his days (28:16). A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches, and favor is better than silver and gold (22:1). Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than he who is perverse in his ways though he is rich (28:6).</P>
