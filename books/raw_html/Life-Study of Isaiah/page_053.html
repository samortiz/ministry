THE RESTORATION BROUGHT IN THROUGH CHRIST</H2><P>Most students of Isaiah pay close attention to chapter eleven, which portrays a very pleasant picture of restoration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Coming Christ in Restoration</H2><P>Verses 1 through 5 and 10 reveal the coming Christ in restoration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. A Twig Coming Forth from the Stem of Jesse,<br>and a Branch from His Roots Bearing Fruit</H2><P>In the restoration, the coming Christ will be a twig that comes forth from the stem of Jesse and a branch from his roots (v. 1). Israel, especially the house of David, was like a tall tree. However, because of Israel's degradation, that tree was cut down to the very root. This was the situation with the descendants of David. Both Mary and her engaged husband, Joseph, were descendants of David's sons. They were part of the royal family, but they had become poor and were people of a low class, living in Nazareth, a despised city, in Galilee, a despised region. This shows that the house of David had been cut down to the root.</P><P>One day, a twig came forth from the remaining part. Christ as a twig came forth from the stem, the stump, above the earth, signifying that restoration is by life and of life. Also, Christ as a branch came forth from the root underneath the earth, signifying the depths of the restoring life, to branch out God and bear much fruit.</P><P>The branch and the twig are one. In His birth Christ was a twig. As He grew up, He was a branch. Because of His branching out, the whole world is filled with the fruit of this branch.</P>
