   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT IMPRESSION AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CONDITION OF THE SPIRIT BREAKING AND IMPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whether or not we can be a worker of the Lord depends not on what we say or do but on what comes out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we say and do one thing, yet what comes out of us is another thing, others will not receive help.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What comes out of us is a very crucial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes we say that we have a good impression of a certain person, or that we have a bad impression of another person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Where does this impression come from?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The impression does not come from a person's words.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If it does, then we would say that a person is good if his words are good and that he is bad if his words are bad; there would not be the need to talk about impression at all.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet in reality there is something inexplicable which gives us certain impressions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The impressions that we receive of a person are something apart from his words and deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As he is speaking or acting, something else comes out of his being which impresses us with an impression.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What generates an impression in others is the strongest spots we have in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If our thoughts have never been broken and are lawless and wild, when we meet the brothers and sisters, they spontaneously will touch our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This will be all that impresses them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may possess an abnormal emotion; it may be exceptionally warm or cold.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If our emotion has never been broken by the Lord, it will spontaneously come out of us when we contact others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The impression others will receive will be of our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our strong spot will be what comes out of us, and it will be the impression that others receive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can control our words and our actions, but we cannot control what flows out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whatever we have will flow out of us spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second Kings 4 gives us the account of the Shunammite woman's reception of Elisha.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible says that "one day Elisha was passing through Shunem; and there was a wealthy woman there, who compelled him to have a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>So whenever he passed through, he would turn aside and have a meal there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And she said to her husband, Now I know that this man who continually passes through unto us is a holy man of God" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Elisha passed through Shunem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He did not give one message or perform one miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every time he passed through, he turned aside and had a meal there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The woman identified him as a man of God by the way he took his meal.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was the impression that Elisha gave to others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today we have to ask ourselves, "What is the impression that we give to others?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is the thing that comes out of us?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have spoken repeatedly that the outer man must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the outer man is not broken, the impression that others receive from us will be nothing but the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every time we contact others, we may give them an unpleasant feeling that we are self-loving, stubborn, and proud.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Or we may give them an impression that we are clever and extremely eloquent.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps we give others a so-called good impression.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But does this impression satisfy God?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Does it meet the church's need?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God is not satisfied, and the church has no need of our so-called good impressions.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brothers, God requires that our spirit be released, and the church also requires that our spirit be released.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have a very great and crucial need: Our outer man must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the outer man is not broken, our spirit will not be released, and the impression we give to others will not be an impression of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A brother once was speaking on the subject of the Holy Spirit, but all his words, attitude, and stories exposed him as a man full of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>While others were listening, they were uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Holy Spirit was in his mouth, but the self was in his being.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His words were on the Holy Spirit, but the impression he gave to others was of his self.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What purpose does this serve?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must not pay attention to doctrines alone.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The important thing is what comes out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If what comes out of us is the self, others will only touch the self.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even though our subject may be wonderful and our message excellent, what good will it serve?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God has no intention for us to make progress in doctrine alone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He has to deal with the person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If our person is not dealt with, we will be of little use to God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We will only be able to give others spiritual teachings; we will not be able to give others spiritual impressions.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is a great pity if our teachings are spiritual but the impressions we give to others are of the self!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the reason we repeatedly have spoken of the need for God to break our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Time after time, God has been arranging our circumstances to break our strong spot.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It may be so strong that one blow is not enough to take it away.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, a second blow comes.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If our strong spot is still unyielding, a third blow will come.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God will not let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He has to break our strong spot.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He will never stop His work.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What the Holy Spirit accomplishes in us through His disciplining work is different from what we receive through ordinary preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In receiving a message, we generally understand the doctrine in our mind and then wait for months and even years before God leads us into the truth subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We receive the message, and then we enter into the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But the discipline of the Holy Spirit works differently.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is characterized by the fact that the instant we see the truth, we receive the content of that truth itself.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>These two things occur at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We do not see the doctrine and then receive the content later.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We are foolish men; we understand doctrines quickly, but we learn from the discipline slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We can remember many teachings after hearing them once.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Yet the discipline of the Holy Spirit may come to us ten times, and we still may be bewildered and astonished as to what we are being disciplined for.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If the Lord cannot break us with one blow, He will do it again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As we experience the discipline of the Holy Spirit once, twice, ten times, or even a hundred times, the Lord will wrought something into us, and in that same moment we will see the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The moment we see the truth is the moment we acquire the thing itself.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Hence, the discipline of the Holy Spirit equals both the breaking down and the building up of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After a man passes through the Spirit's discipline, he will be edified as well as see the truth; he will be built up as well as torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When he has experienced so much discipline from the Holy Spirit, he will see and touch something real before the Lord, and he will say, "Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Now I know that the Lord has used the past five or ten years to deal with me just for the purpose of getting rid of this one thing."</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Thank the Lord that He removes our obstacles through repeated dealings.</S>
