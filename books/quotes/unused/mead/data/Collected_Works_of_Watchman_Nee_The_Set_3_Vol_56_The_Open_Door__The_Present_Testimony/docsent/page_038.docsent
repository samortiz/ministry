   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The "Body" Referring to the Children of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in a Certain Time and at a Certain Place</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have just seen the negative view of division; now let us see the positive view of unity as is demanded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"We who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread" 1 Cor 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here Paul said, "We who are many..."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This includes the children of God at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This "one bread" is the bread on the table at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During the breaking of bread at Corinth, a loaf was displayed before the children of God, indicating that though they were many, they were still one bread.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In other words, the Body of Christ that the brothers at Corinth should express must at least be expressed at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here we must recall the situation at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let us take our mind back to the time at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the brothers and sisters gathered together, a loaf was displayed before them, with all the saints gathered around it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps fifty were breaking bread together; Paul was saying that the fifty, being many, are one bread.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other words, the Body of Christ has a universal expression: the church; this church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the brothers in each locality also express the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It does not mean that the brothers at Corinth are the Body of Christ, while the brothers at Ephesus are not the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It means that the children of God at Corinth are the Body of Christ; so, both according to the spiritual principle and the spiritual fact, they should express themselves as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Body of Christ is the universal church, the church which is in all places and throughout all generations both in space and in time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, the brothers in a locality must at least stand in the same position, applying the same principle to express the same fact.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, the minimum boundary of unity is the boundary of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the locality of Corinth, the unity of the Body, the unity of life, must be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is very wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Body spoken of in Ephesians refers to all the children of God, but the Body spoken of in Corinthians refers to the children of God in a certain time and at a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The children of God there and then are also the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we continue reading 1 Corinthians 12, we see the matter of the Body again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The one Body with the one Holy Spirit is discussed: "For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ" v. 12 . "If the foot should say, Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body, it is not that because of this it is not of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And if the ear should say, Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body, it is not that because of this it is not of the body....And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>15-16, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First Corinthians 12 speaks of the Body of Christ in much detail.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Body of Christ spoken of in 1 Corinthians is different from that which is spoken of in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As I have said, the Body of Christ in Ephesians refers to the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not a problem to most Bible students.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the Body of Christ in 1 Corinthians 12 refers to the church at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is because it is different from that which is spoken of in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Head in Ephesians refers to whom?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ephesians 5:23 says, "Christ is Head of the church."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First Corinthians 12 also speaks of the head, but to whom does this refer?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First Corinthians 12:21 says, "And the eye cannot say to the hand..."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here the eye is a member, and the hand is also a member.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 21 continues, "..nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The head spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12, therefore, is a member.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This statement cannot be used and applied as an illustration in Ephesians that would be terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A parallel cannot be drawn here.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If it were, the Head would be in a very low position.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The head in 1 Corinthians 12 is but a member, the position of which is different from that of the Head in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Head in Ephesians is absolutely Christ, while the head in 1 Corinthians 12 is one among the brothers who acts as a head.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is but one of the members, not the unique Head.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is low, not high.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, for the expression of the unity of the Body, the Bible shows us that locality is the minimum boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I hope the brothers and sisters will see that the minimum requirement of unity in the Bible is the unity of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God's children must have spiritual unity in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the basic demand of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What then is the purpose of God?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is "that there would be no division in the body" v. 25 . Paul said this because of the divisions spoken of in chapters one and three.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Paul showed them that having divisions in the locality of Corinth was the same as having divisions in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Unity must have locality as its boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If I live at Corinth, at a minimum I must be one with the children of God in the locality of Corinth; at a minimum I must live out a life that is in oneness at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I cannot have divisions.</S>
