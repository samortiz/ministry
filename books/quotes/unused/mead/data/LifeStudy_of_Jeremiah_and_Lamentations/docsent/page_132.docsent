   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Jehovah Being Their God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to verse 38, Israel would be Jehovah's people, and He would be their God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After making this promise, Jehovah said, "I will give them one heart and one way, to fear Me all the days, for their own good and for the good of their children after them" v. 39 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We, the chosen people of God, should all have one heart and one way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should have one heart to love God, to seek God, to live God, and to be constituted with God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that we love to be the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The one way is just the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus said, "I am the way" John 14:6a .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christians today are divided because they take many different ways other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Catholic Church has the Catholic way, and the Orthodox Church has the Orthodox way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Each denomination and independent group has its own way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Presbyterians have one way, and the Pentecostals have another way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What should be our way in the Body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the Body of Christ, we should take the way of the inner law, which is the Triune God with His divine capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should all have one heart to love Him, and we should all take Him as our life and our way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This one heart and one way is the one accord Acts 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we do not have one heart and one way, we cannot be in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For eternity in the New Jerusalem there will be only one way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John tells us, "He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month" Rev 22:1-2a .</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that the way, the life, and the life supply are all one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It also indicates what our way should be today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our way in the Lord's recovery is life; it is the inner law of life; it is the very Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am sorry to say that in recent years there was a turmoil among us, and this turmoil brought in division.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The reason for this turmoil was that certain ones wanted to take a way other than life, a way other than Christ, the Triune God, and the inner law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Divisions are always the result of taking a way other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we keep ourselves to the one way, there will be no division.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We praise the Lord that in His restoration He will give His people one heart to love Him and express Him and one way to enjoy Him.</S>
