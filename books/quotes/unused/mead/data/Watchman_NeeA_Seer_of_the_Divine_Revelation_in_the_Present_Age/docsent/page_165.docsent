   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE WITNESS LEE'S RELATIONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH WATCHMAN NEE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FROM 1937 TO 1950 RELATIONSHIP IN NEW REVELATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the end of December 1936, I received a cable from Watchman Nee asking me to come to Shanghai immediately for an urgent conference of all the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Peace Wang, Chang Yu-tzu, a third co-worker, and myself arrived at Shanghai early on the morning of January 1, 1937.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Watchman met us at the station, and the conference started the same day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In that conference, messages were released which now form the substance of the book entitled The Normal Christian Church Life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During the conference he became ill with a cold.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He called me to his bedside and charged me to deliver the message which he intended to release on Acts 13.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After receiving all the points from him, I did as he desired and delivered the message, but I must confess that it was very inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, after he recovered, he gave that message again himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One day during this conference time, he took me to see the construction work of the training center he had planned to build at Chenru, a suburb of Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He related to me how he was burdened to pass on to the Lord's young seeking ones some practical training on life, on the church, and on the work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The construction work of the training center was damaged by the invading Japanese in August 1937 before it was completed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At that time the decision was made that I should travel throughout all the provinces of northern China to preach and teach in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We felt at that time that we should pass on all the light the Lord had given us to the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the summer and in the fall of that year, I did much traveling in the northwestern provinces of Suiyuan, Shansi, and Shensi with Sister Peace Wang and others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In that summer Japan invaded China, and many of the co-workers fled from the coast to the interior.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At Sian, the last station of our journey in the northwest, we received a cable from Watchman Nee that we should go to Hankow in the central part of China to meet with him and the co-workers for a co-workers' conference.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Peace Wang and I proceeded there by train.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>While waiting in Hankow for Brother Nee to arrive, I received a cable from the elders in Chefoo urging me to return to care for my family because of the Japanese invasion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After I left Hankow, Watchman arrived and delivered the messages of The Normal Christian Church Life the second time in the co-workers' conference.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After returning to Chefoo, I could not leave again because of the war, so for a period of time I was retained in northern China while most of the other co-workers were in the interior.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In August 1939, after Watchman Nee came back to Shanghai from London to hold a conference concerning the Body of Christ, he cabled me to attend this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that time I was traveling and working in the central part of my province with four young co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All five of us proceeded to Shanghai for the conference.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In all the meetings of the conference, I was invited by Brother Nee to read the Scripture verses before he spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was during that conference in 1939 that my eyes were opened to see the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As his guest at this conference, I was again brought into close contact with Watchman.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He related portions of his European trip to me, making me clear concerning the real situation of the Lord's interest in England and in northern Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Following the conference I returned to Chefoo, intending to come to Brother Nee's training in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The following April, I and a few others attended the training and stayed there for approximately two months.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One day while walking with him down the stairway of the meeting hall, he said to me, "We have the blueprint of God's plan in our hand."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That puzzled me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"What is 'the blueprint'?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I said to myself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As time went on I discovered what he was practicing in Shanghai concerning the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I took "the blueprint" back to the north and put it into practice in Chefoo for about two years.</S>
