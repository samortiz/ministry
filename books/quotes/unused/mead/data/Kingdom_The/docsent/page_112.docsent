   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HIDDEN CHARACTER OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following this, Matthew quoted a portion from Isaiah telling us who the Lord Jesus was at that time Matt 12:18-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord Jesus was a person with the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He did not strive or cry or shout or make Himself known to people on the streets.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He had no fame, and He made no name for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In a sense He was very hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is one of the most important aspects of the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we try to become great, if we try to make a name for ourselves, we will become the great tree instead of the little mustard herb Matt 13:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the Lord Jesus was living on earth, He never made Himself great.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather He always kept Himself small.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He did not strive; neither did anyone hear his voice on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are even told that He would not break a bruised reed or quench the smoking flax.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Reeds were used by Jewish children to make pipes as musical instruments.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When a pipe was bruised and did not produce the proper sound, they would break it and throw it away.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many times we are like bruised reeds and cannot produce proper music.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As a rule, we should be broken and cast away.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the Lord Jesus will never do this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Also, in ancient times the Jewish people used flax with oil as a torch, especially for walking at night.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the flax torches ran out of oil, they quit shining and became only smoking flax, which people would quench and throw away.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nearly all of us are like bruised reeds and smoking flax.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus, however, would never cast us away because He Himself is such a little one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was His character when He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All these verses reveal an important principle of the kingdom: the kingdom today is not something great in appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In form, the kingdom life is small and lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No local church should display a grand appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even if we have a large number, we should never flaunt it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not have any outward form.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The smaller our appearance, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must be little; even we must be nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should be hidden and concealed all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we put all these passages together, we will discover that the way to have rest in the kingdom life is not to be great or manifest or public.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The way to enjoy Christ as our rest in the kingdom life is to remain small, concealed, and hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should never become a great tree; we must be the little mustard herb.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE SIGN OF JONAH</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Another principle is also revealed in Matthew 12.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The religious people came to the Lord Jesus asking for a sign, a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They wanted Him to perform a miracle to prove that He was of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He answered them in this way: "An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, and no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet" 12:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Jonah was a prophet who spent three days and three nights buried within a great fish in the waters of death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After three days he came out.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was a type of the crucifixion and resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord Jesus indicated to the religious people that their generation would see no sign except the unique sign of the crucified and resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The atmosphere among some religious people in our own time is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They always want to see signs, miracles, and healings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, in the kingdom life we should not display ourselves with signs and wonders.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, we should reveal ourselves as being crucified and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The sign that is needed today is not a wonder or a miracle; it is the sign of a crucified and resurrected person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to put all these principles together.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the end of chapter eleven, the Lord Jesus began to show us the way to enjoy Him as rest in the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In chapter twelve He revealed that we need to break the religious regulations, but refuse to make ourselves great, public, and popular.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should not seek for popularity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to be hidden, small, and low.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, we should not make an ostentatious show by doing miracles and signs.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the contrary, the more people require signs of us, the more we should go to the cross, the more we should be buried in the death water.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The more people expect us to do something extraordinary, the more we must go to the cross to be crucified and to the death water to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Following crucifixion and burial, we will experience resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The kingdom people have to be the crucified, buried, and resurrected people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we are today's Jonah, experiencing death and resurrection, we will certainly be today's Solomon, building the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once again we see that Matthew does not follow the historical sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>According to the sequence of history, Solomon came first and Jonah came later.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Why then is Jonah mentioned first in Matthew?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is because Jonah typifies Christ as the crucified and resurrected One, and Solomon typifies Christ as the reigning One.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After being resurrected, Christ is the King who reigns over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, in history Solomon precedes Jonah, but in typology Jonah precedes Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Matthew did not write according to history; he wrote according to revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He selected facts and incidents and put them together to show us a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord Jesus is the unique sign.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He is first the crucified, buried, and resurrected One.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then He is the reigning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the sign for today.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The crucified, buried, and resurrected Christ is now reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Because He is reigning, the kingdom is here.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He is the greater Jonah, and He is also the greater Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>For the kingdom life, this generation needs no other sign.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We do not need miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We only need the unique sign the crucified life, the buried life, and the resurrected life that has become the reigning life.</S>
