<h2 class="head3">4. Man's Second Fall Due to Nakedness</h2><p>When Adam and Eve sinned, their nakedness exposed their sin. Noah came out of the ark 1,656 years later. He planted a vineyard and became drunk. As a result, he took off his clothes and exposed himself. The first man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and found himself naked. The next man found himself naked after eating the fruit of the vine. The second fall of man came when he did not put on the clothing he was supposed to put on. Adam fell from a state where he needed no clothing to a state where he needed clothing. Noah fell when he had clothing but did not put it on. In the Bible nakedness is a shame. It is something forbidden by the Scripture. This is the result of the second fall of man.</p><h2 class="head3">5. The Altar Having No Steps</h2><p>When God instituted the law at Mount Sinai in Exodus, He commanded the Israelites to build an altar with no steps because He did not want their bodies to be exposed when they went up the steps to offer sacrifices. God abhors the principle of exposure. He does not want man to expose his body. Other than the hands, feet, and head, every part of the body must be covered, and the hands, feet, and head must be covered with the blood. The modern trend of exposing one's body is a violation of God's original principle. God's original purpose is for man to cover himself with clothing. Even when he goes up to the altar to offer sacrifices, he should not expose his body. It is not right for man to be without covering.</p><h2 class="head3">6. The Priest Wearing a Long Robe and Breeches</h2><p>The priests' garments were very fine. They were sewn with fine needlework, which allowed for no opening in the seams. God did not permit them to expose themselves. The priests were not allowed to expose themselves in any way before God. Their ephod was especially long. In addition, they had to wear breeches, lest their body be exposed (Exo. 28:42). The Bible is consistent in its emphasis; clothing is for covering, not for exposure. This is one main characteristic of clothing.</p><h2 class="head3">7. The Garment Symbolizing Redemption<br />and the Lord Jesus Himself</h2><p>God uses the garment as a symbol of our redemption. It is also a symbol of the Lord Jesus Himself. We are clothed with God's salvation, and we are those who have put on Christ Jesus. We are those who have put on the new man. God does not want to see any openings or breaches among us. We are completely clothed with salvation, with Christ, and with the new man. Our whole being is covered by God. We are saved and clothed with salvation.</p><p>Each time we put on our clothing, our inner eyes need to be opened to Christ and salvation. Before we put on our garment, we were naked. We were not covered at all before God, and we could not hide from God's light or His judgment. Thank God! Today we are clothed. Before God we have put on His salvation and His righteousness. We have put on the garment which God has given to us. We have put on Christ and the new man. The completeness of the covering of our garment symbolizes the completeness of the covering we have received from the Lord. This significance must not be overlooked. How marvelous it is that God is merciful enough to cover us! We are completely covered before God.</p><p>The principle of clothing is for covering. Christians should not wear any clothing which does not cover them. Any garment which exposes one's body should be discarded. The purpose of clothing is for covering, not for exposing. No one should make or wear any clothing which is in the principle of exposure rather than covering. The principle of exposure is incompatible with the principle of a Christian.</p>
