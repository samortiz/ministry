<p>By paying attention to the matters that were in the original church, we are not seeking to be different from others. Rather, we want to stress the authority of the Spirit. Furthermore, we are not fighting for different forms or rituals. Rather, we are for the authority of the Spirit. Every deformed situation in Christianity has annulled the authority of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Although the practice of believers electing elders does not correspond with the practice in the initial church, it is unacceptable primarily because it annuls the authority of the Spirit. The practice of electing elders only gives ground to opinions in the church; it does not allow the Spirit to have the authority in the church. The Bible says that &ldquo;the Holy Spirit has placed&rdquo; the elders in the church as overseers (Acts 20:17, 28). The Spirit manifests certain brothers who are more mature and experienced among God&rsquo;s children in the church, and then He leads the apostles to appoint these ones as elders. Some brothers in the church allow the Spirit to lead them to grow in the divine life; hence, they are spiritual and know the Lord. The Spirit manifests brothers who love the Lord, pay the price, care for God&rsquo;s children, and labor in the church as being mature and experienced. Then the Spirit exercises His authority and appoints them to the eldership through the apostles who submit to the Spirit&rsquo;s authority. As a result, the manifestation and appointment of the elders are under the authority of the Spirit.</p>
<p>The practice of electing elders results in a completely different situation. Voting allows people and their opinions to have the lordship, and it also annuls the authority of the Spirit. Some may say that it is possible for Christians to vote for elders by following the leading of the Spirit or by giving the Spirit the ground, but elections involve human insight and are affected by a person&rsquo;s worldly position, wealth, and influence. Such a practice prevents the Spirit from manifesting those who should be elders, and it annuls the authority of the Spirit. With such a practice, only the human will is enthroned. Elections involve the human will, and they involve man&rsquo;s assumption of authority. The Bible does not have such a method, and we cannot adopt it.</p>
<p>Although the practice of pastors administering holy communion is inconsistent with the Scriptures, it also is unacceptable primarily because it annuls the authority of the Spirit. Such a practice does not allow the Spirit to operate as He wills. The saints who gather at the Lord&rsquo;s table to break bread are on the same level. No person should act as a chairman; instead, we should allow the Spirit to take the lead and operate in the meeting. All the brothers and sisters, whether they have been saved for many years or are new believers, should allow the Spirit to operate in the meeting. Everyone should pray according to the leading of the Spirit and praise according to the inspiration of the Spirit. When the Spirit operates and has complete freedom in the meeting, any brother may be led by the Spirit to select a hymn or to bless the bread and the cup. However, a person acting as the chairman to administer the holy communion annuls the lordship of the Spirit among the believers and quenches the operation of the Spirit. Therefore, the Bible does not record such a practice, and we do not want it.</p>
<p>The priestly system, the pastoral system, and the clerical system are human ways that usurp the authority of the Spirit. The Spirit should have authority over all the believers in their service to God. But the priestly system, the pastoral system, and the clerical system have annulled the authority of the Spirit over the believers, causing the believers to neglect the duties of their service to God.</p>
<p>The existence of sects and denominations is the result of human opinion prevailing over the Lord&rsquo;s Word, human methods prevailing over the Lord&rsquo;s ordination, and human authority prevailing over the authority of the Spirit. If people would let the Lord be the Lord, let the Spirit lead, let the Lord&rsquo;s Word prevail over human opinion, and let the Lord&rsquo;s decision prevail over human methods, there would be no ground for sects and denominations to be established. Therefore, we should ask whether sects and denominations are scriptural, whether human opinion should take precedence over the Lord&rsquo;s Word, and whether the Lord truly is the Lord.</p>
<p>Without exception, Christmas, Good Friday, Easter, and numerous other practices and rituals in the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant churches are the issue of human opinions prevailing over the Lord&rsquo;s Word, human methods prevailing over the Lord&rsquo;s ordination, and man prevailing over the Lord. If believers would let the Lord exercise His lordship, let His Word annul their opinions, and let His ordination swallow up their methods, Christianity would be pure, strong, holy, and rich. Christianity is mixed, weak, full of compromise, and poor because it has given room to human opinions, human methods, and human lordship. We must rid ourselves of all mixture and compromise in order to serve the Lord in purity and holiness. Whatever did not exist in the initial church and whatever is inconsistent with the teachings, principles, and examples in the Bible are a mixture of human will and the world. We must reject such things.</p>
<p>I have cited these practical examples so that the saints can understand why we differ from other believers and why we disagree with many Christian practices today. Some may say that there is no need for differences or disagreements, but we have received mercy from God to realize that these differences are crucial. Does man have the lordship in the church, or does the Lord have the lordship? We are not fighting for right or wrong but for who has the lordship and the ground in the church.</p>
<p>Should man and his opinions have the ground in the church, or should the Spirit have the authority in the church? This is the important question. It is pitiful if we can argue only about right and wrong and pay attention only to outward appearance and practices. Our focus is not on outward appearance but on the lordship of the Lord. We are not arguing about whether holy communion is right or wrong but whether the Lord has the lordship when we break bread. We are not arguing about whether electing elders is right or wrong but about whether the Spirit has the authority in the manifestation and appointment of elders. This is the central issue. If we are clear concerning the central issue, that is, concerning the authority of the Spirit in the church, it will not be possible to remain in deformed Christianity, and we will be grieved when we see a situation in which the Spirit does not have the authority.</p>
<p>We desire to put aside every matter that is inconsistent with the condition of the initial church, regardless of its source or of how good or valuable it may seem to be. Such a desire is not the result of following others, and neither does it come out of a deliberate intention to be different from others. We desire to let the Spirit recover His authority and position in the church. We do not want to be dissenting for the sake of dissension; we want to take care of the Spirit&rsquo;s authority and the Lord&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>We have put aside the deformed practices of Christianity because they have annulled the authority of the Spirit. Our desire is to let the Lord recover His position and authority in the church and thus return to the original appearance of the initial church.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Serving According to Revelation &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
