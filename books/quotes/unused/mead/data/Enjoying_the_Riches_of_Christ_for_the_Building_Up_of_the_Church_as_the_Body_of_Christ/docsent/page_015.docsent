   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE DISPENSING OF THE RICHES OF CHRIST THROUGH HIS WORD Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; 4:24; 5:39-40; 6:35a, 57b, 63; 14:23; 15:7-8; 17:17; 1 John 5:6b; Col 3:16; Eph 5:18-19; 6:17-18; Jer 15:16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous chapters we saw that the eternal purpose of God is to have the church, that the church comes out of the dispensing of the riches of Christ, and that in His economy God eventually became the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is by this Spirit that all the riches of Christ are being dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE WORD OF GOD BEING GOD HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this chapter we come to the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all know that the Bible is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, we probably know this in a very common, natural, or religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We see that the word in the Scriptures is the Word of God, but we need to see something more.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Word is not only the word of God; the Word is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the beginning was the Word, this Word was God, and one day this Word became flesh, tabernacling among us, full of grace and reality v. 14 . Grace means enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Word, who was God becoming flesh and tabernacling among us, was full not of doctrines and teachings but of enjoyment and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To be sure, this Word is more than the word of God in letters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This Word is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE WORD OF GOD BEING THE EMBODIMENT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word in the Bible is not only the word of God; it is also the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we touch the word, we must touch God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is short and even wrong to touch the word in the Bible and not touch God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord Jesus told the Jewish leaders, "You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me. Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life" 5:39-40 . The word search in Greek means to research, to search and search again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus seemed to say, "I am one with the Scriptures, and the Scriptures are one with Me. If you come to the Scriptures, you have to come to Me. If you research the Scriptures, you have to come to Me. You have to make the Scriptures one with Me; instead, you have made the Scriptures something separate from Me. Therefore, you are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You may gain knowledge in letters from the Scriptures, but you cannot have life because I am life."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These two verses are a warning to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is possible to come to the Bible yet not come to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is possible to separate the Bible from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to realize that to divorce the Bible from Christ is seriously wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the time we have to take the Bible as one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever we come to the Bible, we have to come to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whenever we read the Bible, we have to touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible is not merely a book of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible is the embodiment of the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE BIBLE BEING THE MEANS OF GOD'S DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's intention in His economy is to dispense Christ into us, and for this dispensing there must be some means.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible is the means that God uses to dispense Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be sure, if we come to touch the means without touching Christ, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to serve a meal we must have some utensils, such as bowls, dishes, and cups, but if we come to the bowls, dishes, and cups and do not touch any food, we are very foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not come to dinner for the bowls, dishes, or cups; we come to dinner for the food.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Still, in order to serve the food we must have the means.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Bible is the means through which God dispenses Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, when we come to touch the Bible, our intention is not merely to touch the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Bible is only the means; Christ Himself is the food.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we come to the Bible without coming to Jesus, we are wrong.</S>
