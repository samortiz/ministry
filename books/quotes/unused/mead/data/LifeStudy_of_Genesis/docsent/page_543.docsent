   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. FROM ESAU TO JACOB</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 25:22-26, 29-34 we see the shifting of the birthright from Esau to Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although Esau was the firstborn v. 25 , Jacob was predestinated to have the birthright v. 23 . The shifting of the birthright from Esau to Jacob reveals that receiving the birthright is a matter of predestination.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It does not depend on our natural birth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although you may be an Esau by birth, this does not mean that you are predestinated to have the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is absolutely a matter of God's sovereignty; it does not depend on us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we consider the five cases of the shifting of the birthright, we must worship God for His sovereignty and say, "O Lord, we thank You for Your sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everything depends on Your sovereign predestination."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jacob, the one predestinated to have the birthright, was very covetous and did everything possible to get the birthright himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When Jacob and Esau were still in their mother's womb, they were fighting over the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I believe that this fight was initiated by Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But, according to God's arrangement, Esau was stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you read the Bible carefully, you will see that Esau, as a hunter, was strong and rather large in physical stature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jacob, on the contrary, as one who stayed home with his mother, must have been rather small.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I do not believe that a husky young man would always stay home with his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because Jacob was smaller and weaker than Esau, he could not obtain the birthright by fighting for it with his physical strength.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although Jacob fought for the birthright in the womb, Esau defeated him, was born first, and gained the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Jacob's struggle had been in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jacob, however, refused to give up the fight.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I believe he stayed with his mother mainly for the purpose of conspiring with her to gain the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Perhaps Jacob's mother eventually agreed to help him gain the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to supplant his brother and gain the birthright, Jacob did two things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first was to maneuver Esau into a situation where he was willing to sell the birthright to him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>29-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jacob was exceedingly subtle and clever.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was very skillful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through his cleverness he gained his mother's cooperation, and Rebekah, who was more clever than Isaac, stood with Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This clever Jacob tempted Esau to sell his birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jacob probably observed Esau's activities over a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He might have noticed that after hunting Esau was always hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because hunting arouses one's appetite, a hunter enjoys a good meal after a hunt.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Anyone who engages in exhausting activity, such as hard work or play, afterwards desires some hearty and nourishing food.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jacob analyzed the entire situation the environment, Esau's psychology, and Esau's appetite after hunting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Jacob might have said to himself, "Aha!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have a way to get the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While Esau is hunting, I shall prepare soup for him."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Genesis 25:29 says, "And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Esau was hungry, and the soup had been prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Esau said to Jacob, "Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint" v. 30 . To this, Jacob replied, "Sell me this day thy birthright" v. 31 . When a person is hungry, he will eat anything and pay any price for it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, Esau said, "Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?" v. 32 . Esau seemed to be saying, "The birthright is something for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What good does it do me now?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But here is a bowl of soup in front of me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is actual, present, and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Who knows when I shall have the birthright?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I don't know when it will come.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For now, I need something real and practical."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, Esau agreed to Jacob's proposal and sold his birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the one hand, the birthright depends on God's sovereign predestination.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But on the other hand, whether or not we shall have the birthright depends on our attitude and our deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Esau's attitude was poor, and his act was foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He was absolutely wrong to accept Jacob's offer.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Nevertheless, using today's terms, he signed the contract and gave up his birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although Esau had sold the birthright, he did not have the standing to give the blessing of the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This blessing was not in his hand; it was in the hand of Isaac, his father, the representative of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, the second thing Jacob did to gain the birthright was to deceive his father into giving him the blessing of the birthright 27:18-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Probably Jacob's maneuvering of Esau was initiated by Rebekah who, in all likelihood, had been maneuvering the whole situation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Jacob was the learner, and his mother was the tutor.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After Esau had been maneuvered into selling the birthright to Jacob, Rebekah waited for the opportune time to help Jacob receive the blessing of the birthright from Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although this had to take place before Isaac died, it could not be too early.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If it had been too early, Isaac's eyesight would still have been keen.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, Rebekah waited until Isaac's eyes were dim.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When she heard that Isaac was about to bless Esau, Rebekah said to Jacob, "Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee" 27:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Rebekah seemed to be saying, "Now is the time to deceive your father."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Jacob obeyed his mother and deceived Isaac into blessing him blindly.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As a result, Jacob obtained not only the birthright, but also the blessing of the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Jacob's maneuvering, however, was unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If he had done no maneuvering or deceiving, God would have had a way to give him the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Apparently, Jacob's maneuvering and deceiving helped him to acquire the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Actually, it caused him to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>From the time Jacob deceived his father, he never saw his mother again.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Although Rebekah loved Jacob, due to her cleverness she lost him and never saw him again.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Jacob had to flee to Laban's home and suffer there under his hand for twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Do not learn of Rebekah.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you do, you will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Through the case of the shifting of the birthright from Esau to Jacob, we see that the birthright depends on God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We also see that we should never maneuver or deceive in order to gain the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In other words, there is no need for us to struggle for the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Moreover, we should not be so loose as to sell our birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Although we may not be able to gain the birthright by our own effort, we can sell it if we have it.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It was not because of his doing that Jacob gained the birthright, but Esau lost it because of his wrongdoing.</S>
