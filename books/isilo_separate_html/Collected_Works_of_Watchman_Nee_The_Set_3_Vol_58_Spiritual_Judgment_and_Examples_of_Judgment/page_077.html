B.</h2><p>I was born into a non-Christian family. In my youth I always pondered the meaning of the human life. I searched through Chinese traditions and ethical teachings, but I did not find any answer or profit. Later I turned to the pursuit of temporal recognition and wealth for myself. I decided to join the army. Twice I had close encounters with bombs. I began to realize the vanity of this world. One day in 1937 a friend of mine invited me to a gospel meeting. I had been a mocker up to that point, and I had criticized pastors for not practicing what they preached. I went along with my friend and attended the meeting, but I did not try to listen to the message. Instead, I was checking out the stories and snooping around. The second day I went, I was moved by the sincerity of the preacher. The third night I went again, and the Lord worked on me. I saw my own evil, and I saw that the Lord Jesus had died on the cross for me, a sinner. I believed in Him and accepted Him as my personal Savior. I recalled the two incidents in the army when I was bombed. If I had died then, I would not have been able to sit here today. Thank the Lord that I am still alive and that I can still believe in Him. After I accepted the Lord, I began to testify for Him. Eventually, my father also accepted the Lord. The most painful thing was seeing my mother pass away without having a chance to accept the Lord.</p><p>I was a traditional Chinese doctor. After I became a Christian, I still desired to build up a career. I became successful, but this success turned me away from spiritual things. At one point in my life, I became very bothered. The Lord began to deal with my business. I obeyed the Lord and prostrated myself before Him in confession. Outwardly, it was a bitter experience, but inwardly, it was a time of joy. I recovered my intimate fellowship with the Lord. From that time on, everything else became a secondary profession; my primary profession was to serve the Lord. I began to serve Him earnestly in the church. At first my messages were mostly borrowed from reference books. I sought for the Lord's light but did not receive anything. This bothered me very much. Later I decided it was simpler to invite evangelists to come and conduct meetings. Yet inwardly I felt that something was wrong. This was like giving people a stimulant; it only revived them for a little while.</p><p>In January 1948 I received an invitation from a brother to attend a meeting by Brother Witness Lee. I first thought it was just another revival meeting. However, after listening to the message, I realized that I had heard something that I had never heard before. I became very hungry within. Later I learned that Brother Nee was giving conferences and talking about the truth of handing oneself over. At the beginning I had reservations, but later I realized that it was only right for me to break my alabaster flask. I am willing to commit my ways to the Lord from now on. I am a quick person, both at heart and in my speaking. I like to criticize and judge others. Now I truly realize that this is wrong.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Concerning our brother I would like to point out one thing in particular. There are two ways to live the Christian life. We can say that there are two types of Christians. First, there are those who try to control their outward conduct. Some are very successful in doing this. They learn to bridle their outward conduct by their will. Through their own cultivation, they are able to act calmly, humbly, and politely. Second, there are those who have learned inward control through the discipline of the Holy Spirit. This control also restricts a person, but not by means of the will like the first kind. In the first case, a person observes others speaking with a certain tone of voice or acting quickly, slowly, or calmly, and he tries to imitate this in an outward way. This outward imitation is not the outflow of inward activity. A person may think that he is holy. Actually, he is only acting in an outward way. He may say that he has a certain degree of humility, but even he himself does not know his real self. He cannot put his finger on the things he has acquired through imitation. At the most he has borrowed others' conduct to change his own acts. Other than this, he knows nothing. This is a very dangerous course for one to take in the spiritual pathway. These ones are like crows with many white feathers glued to them; even they themselves do not know what kind of bird they are. God's children should live their Christian life before God; they should not simply borrow a set of behaviors from others. Instead, they should learn the proper, inward lessons themselves. Only these ones will have the proper growth. Those who will not give up their outward restrictions and outward godliness will not advance; they will not grow in the Lord.</p><p>When I was in London, I asked Brother Austin-Sparks concerning a certain missionary. He told me that God only needs to destroy the part that is natural in a natural man. But if a natural man has acquired things in addition to his natural self, God first has to destroy the imitations which he has picked up. Many people have acquired many things that belong to others. They are actually adding materials to themselves that need to be broken down. In order to break down the natural man of these ones, God must first break down the foreign elements that have been added to them. This adds to the breaking process, and it is foolishness.</p><p>During the past two thousand years, everyone whom God used was unpretentious and spontaneous within and without. We have the treasure, but it is in the earthen vessel. The outward vessel always remains impure. There is no need to embellish or paint it. We do not treasure the outward earthen vessel; we treasure the inward reality. Many people only imitate the outward things; they have picked up nothing at all inwardly. Our treasure is within us. We can be unpretentious because we have the treasure within us. In order for us to be unpretentious Christians, we have to start from the inside. We should not draw others' attention to the outward elements. Instead, we should draw their attention to the inward reality.</p><p>Our brother is quick in thoughts and words, but this is not the kind of Christian God wants. Our brother should not just learn outward lessons. He should allow the Lord to do a breaking work in him. You have to experience inward afflictions. The outward innocence should not be given up, while the inward dealings should be deepened. Then you will be able to express His life. I am not saying that our brother's attitude and words have to change. I am saying that he needs the inward working of the Holy Spirit to change him from a "raw" state to a "cooked" state. Being "raw" means to be innocent but with no maturity. Our brother has to seek to turn from "rawness" to maturity. He has to touch God in an inward way, and then his rawness will go away. On the one hand, you have to preserve your innocence. On the other hand, you have to experience the work of the Holy Spirit so that you will not lose your balance. Once you are balanced in both aspects, your rawness will go away. God does not destroy our innocence; rather, He dispenses the discipline of the Holy Spirit to us, which results in a deeper destruction of our living. The inward operation of the Holy Spirit always produces wounds. We should have ample experience of the Holy Spirit and allow His discipline to be added to our innocence. Some people are still in the old creation; they need to be broken in many aspects. In Shanghai I once told a sister that if God had mercy on her, many of the things artificially "installed" in her would be dismantled. Brother, you must experience the building-up process of the Holy Spirit within you. In order for the self to be destroyed, all the foreign elements that have been added into you must be removed first. Much time is needed for the inner being to be strengthened. When your inward spiritual condition is strong enough, your outward innocence will be a complement to you and will render the Lord a way to go on. If your inward spiritual measure is too small, it will not match your outward innocence. If one has the discipline of the Holy Spirit, the release of the inward man will bear the outward innocence upon its wings. Unless you have such an experience, you will only give others the impression of your rawness. God only needs to deal with the natural elements in an innocent man; He only needs to constitute His life into such a man. When the spirit of such a man is released, he will not lose his innocence. This is a beautiful picture.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_076.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_078.html">Next</a> </body></html>
