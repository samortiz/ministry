<h2 class=head3>The Lord Being the Spirit</h2><p>The second crucial verse concerning Christ being the Spirit is 2 Corinthians 3:17, which says, “The Lord is the Spirit.” “The Lord” here, of course, is Jesus, and “the Spirit” is the Spirit who gives life, mentioned in verse 6, and who is the life-giving Spirit. Many Christian writers, including Dean Alford and Andrew Murray, all acknowledged this point. Praise the Lord, the Christ in whom we believe is the Spirit today.<h2 class=head3>The Lack in Christianity’s Theology</h2><p>In our English hymnal there are twenty to thirty hymns concerning Christ as the Spirit. In the compilation of the hymnal, we did our best to collect all the truths expressed in hymns from different Christian backgrounds. Therefore, our hymnal may be considered a collection of the hymns of theology. If you want to study real theology, you need to first study our hymnal.<p>A great lack in Christian theology is that it does not say anything about Christ being the Spirit. Due to the fact that this truth is lacking, it is impossible to link all other truths together. Without this truth, the Father is the Father, the Son is the Son, the Spirit is the Spirit and the three are totally separated. In other words, without Christ being the Spirit, the three of the Divine Trinity would be completely separated. From this standpoint, we must consider it our responsibility to explain and preach the divine truth concerning Christ being the Spirit according to the revelation of the Bible.<p>In particular, the young people who desire to serve the Lord must know this truth thoroughly. You should not be the Philips who speak nonsense. rather, you should spend time to study in order that you would see this mystery in the Gospel of John, so that whatever you preach will involve this truth.<h2 class=head1>HE WHO HAS SEEN THE SON HAVING SEEN THE FATHER</h2><p>In John 14 Philip asked the Lord to show them the Father, and the Lord answered, “Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip?” (v. 9a). After hearing this, Philip was even more puzzled. Perhaps he thought, “Of course, I know You. How could I not know You? You grew up in Nazareth, and You were a carpenter before You came out to preach the word. Your mother is Mary, whose husband is Joseph. You also have a few siblings, all of whom I know.” In fact, if this was Philip’s thought concerning what it meant to know Jesus, then this shows that he did not know Jesus at all. So the Lord went on to say, “He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father?” (v. 9b). Some Bible expositors think that this means that the Lord is the Father’s representative. They would liken this to the President of the United States sending a representative to the Philippines: when the people there contact this representative, it is equivalent to contacting the President of the United States. Actually, this verse does not mean that the Lord Jesus represents God or that the Son of God represents the heavenly Father. What it means is that the Lord Jesus, the Son, is the Father. He does not merely represent, but He is.<p>When the Lord said, “How is it that you say, Show us the Father?”, He meant that He is the Father; thus, when men see Him, they see the Father. The disciples’ asking the Lord to show them the Father is like having the President of the United States come to see you and saying to him, “Please show us the President of the United States.” He would surely be very surprised and say, “You who have seen me have seen the President of the United States; how is it that you say, ‘show us the President of the United States?’” The Lord had been with the disciples for three and a half years, and they had been seeing Him all that time, yet incredibly they still did not know that He was the Father and still asked Him to show them the Father. They were really making matters difficult for the Lord.
