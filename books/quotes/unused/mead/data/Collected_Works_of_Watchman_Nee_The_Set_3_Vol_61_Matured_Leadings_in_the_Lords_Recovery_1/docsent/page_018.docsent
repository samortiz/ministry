   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR A TALK WITH CO-WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM HONG KONG AND CANTON 4 Date:Wednesday evening, August 31, 1949</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Hong Kong CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One can study the Bible alone privately, but he also can study it corporately with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The co-workers in particular should spend time together to study the Word corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every time they do this, they should spend at least three hours together.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Keys Compiling and Translating</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One of the ways to study the Bible is to take a portion of the Word and compile and translate it from scratch.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In translating each word, one has to compare the existing Chinese versions word for word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can consult the writings of a few Bible teachers: Dean Henry Alford's word study, Stephen's New Testament in Greek, Young's Concordance, Newberry's Bible published by the Brethren, and F. G. Grant's and J. N. Darby's expositions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are not careful and serious in our study of the Word, we can easily build a message upon a wrong translation of a word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Romans 1:1 Paul said that he was called by God to preach the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Philippians 1:16 he spoke of the defense of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Galatians 1:6-9 he pointed out that those who preached a different gospel should be accursed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, we should never consider God's Word in a light way; neither should we consider that anyone can expound it at will or preach the gospel from it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul told Timothy that the church is the pillar and base of the truth 1 Tim 3:15 and that this truth is concerning God's divine economy 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The cross, life, faith, truth, and teachings are all included in the gospel of God, which is revealed in the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The gospel of God encompasses all of God's communications with man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul was separated for this gospel, yet he was only a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God keeps His enterprise under His own hand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the reason Romans 11:34 says, "Who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has become His counselor?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's gospel is God's entire divine enterprise.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul was a slave in this enterprise.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are called by God to be slaves as well.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we should not be so presumptuous as to expound the truth by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do, we will become God's counselor.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Word Study</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The second way to study the Bible is by word study.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to study every word and phrase in every passage carefully and thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Consider Romans 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Expressions such as Christ Jesus, slave, called, apostle, separated, and the gospel of God require special attention.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to find out how many times these expressions are used and under what circumstances they are used.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to find the Scripture references and teachings behind these expressions and organize them a little.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This will give us a basic and clear understanding of the use of these expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With the word separated, for example, we can note the process through which God separated Paul:</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>1 Separated at birth from his mother's womb Gal 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>2 Separated to be a vessel at the time of salvation on his way to Damascus Acts 9:3-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>3 Separated for the work in Antioch Acts 13:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In some cases, the expressions Jesus Christ and Christ Jesus are used interchangeably.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, we should not think that they are the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This work is time consuming.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not take any expression for granted.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we can dig into a few dozen of these expressions, we will have some foundation in the knowledge of the Bible.</S>
