   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>K. Reasonings</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Philippians 2:14 also charges us to do all things without reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Reasonings come from the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are of our mind and come mainly from the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do not care for finding out the reason for things; we simply desire to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The four Gospels tell us a number of times that the disciples of the Lord Jesus were trying to find out the reason for certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the Lord Jesus would not let them know the reason.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The disciples would ask "why," but the Lord Jesus would not tell them why.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If He had answered them, He would have been taking care of their reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To take care of people's reasonings is to take care of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus always took care of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He did not care for people's reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Murmuring and reasoning both frustrate us from carrying out our salvation to the fullest extent and from experiencing and enjoying Christ to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the church service, we must learn to reject murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>L. Gossip</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Gossip is another item of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It can be considered as an unnecessary exchange of information.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Gossip is idle talk with idle words.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Matthew 12:36 the Lord said, "I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Greek word for idle means "not working."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>An idle word is a non-working word, an inoperative word, a word that has no positive function and is useless, unprofitable, unfruitful, and barren.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>M. Rivalry</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul told us in Philippians 2:3 to do nothing by way of selfish ambition, or rivalry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rivalry is different from competition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In a school, the students compete.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In athletics, the athletes compete.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Competition is not bad, but rivalry is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rivalry is negative competition.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Someone may give a good testimony, and another saint may want to give a better one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Someone may bring three persons into the recovery, and another may see this and want to bring in six.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you always want to be higher and better than others and have something more than others, this is rivalry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rivalry is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the saints in the church service, by the Lord's grace, exercise to avoid all the thirteen items of the flesh listed above, we will have a wonderful church service.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It would even be good if some of these items could be on our wall as frameable quotes such as "No vainglory," "No outward show," "No ambition for leadership," etc.</S>
