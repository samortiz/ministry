   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Self-pity, self-love, the fear of suffering, and shrinking back from the cross are expressions of the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The greatest goal of the soul-life is to preserve its own existence.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is very reluctant to suffer anything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is why the Lord calls us to deny ourselves and to take up our cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this way we will lose our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every time a cross is put before us, it calls us to give up ourselves, to have no more love for ourselves, and to lay down our lives for others through the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here the Lord says that the cross is ours; we receive it individually from God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we set ourselves to do God's will, God calls us to take up the cross and bear it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This cross is ours; it is specially prepared for us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But it is also joined to the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we are willing through the spirit of Christ's cross to take up our own cross, the power of Christ's cross will enter into us and enable us to lose our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every time we bear the cross, we crucify the soul-life once more.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every time we dodge around the cross, we nourish our soul-life and keep it going.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should notice that what the Lord speaks of here is not something that is done once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Luke the word daily is added to the expression concerning the bearing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, this kind of death is a continual one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We know that our death to sin is an accomplished fact, it has been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All we have to do is acknowledge and receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the death of our soul-life is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not an accomplished fact.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, it is an experience which we have to achieve and gain day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This does not mean that we will never die nor that we must die slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It means that the death of the soul-life is not like the death to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our death to sin was accomplished by Christ on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When He died, we died with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the death of the soul-life is not an accomplished fact.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to bear our own cross daily through the power of the Lord's cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must be resolved to deny ourselves and to put the self to death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This kind of work must be done daily by walking according to the Lord's will, by taking up our own cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By this, the soul-life will lose its power.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our Lord spoke similar words in Luke 17:32-33.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But there it refers to the things of the world: "Remember Lot's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whoever seeks to preserve his soul-life will lose it, and whoever will lose it will preserve it alive."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here the Lord tells us again how the soul-life is to be forsaken.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But what the Lord is emphasizing here is the attachment of the saints' heart to earthly wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord tells us that we should remember Lot's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In her danger she still remembered her wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She did not return back to Sodom; she did not even walk back an inch.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All she did was just turn back her head a little.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But how much this one turning reveals.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This turning of her head speaks a long story concerning her heart.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A saint may forsake the world and outwardly part with everything, yet within him he may still crave the things that he has given up for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the work of the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A saint who is consecrated to the Lord may not go back to the way of the world and may not try to gain back what he has given up for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yet if his heart still lingers on these things, it shows that he has not seen clearly the place the world occupies on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The work of the soul-life may not necessarily turn men back to the way of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All it has to do is cause the saints to privately hold dear in their hearts those things they need to forsake or have already forsaken.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the soul-life has indeed been lost, nothing in the world will move that saint's heart anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The soul-life belongs to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is why it cannot give up the world.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only when a saint is willing to put the soul-life to death will he be able to steadfastly obey the Lord's sermon on the mount.''</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although there is no explicit mention of the cross in the sermon on the mount, we know that unless the saints have genuine experience of dying with the Lord not only to sin, but also with respect to the soul-life being put to death there will be no seriousness in obeying the sermon on the mount.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The reason for this is that unless the cross has worked deeply in the soul-life of the saints, any outward conformation to the sermon on the mount will not have an inward echo in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A saint who has lost his soul-life can spontaneously and sincerely take off his outer garment and give it to him who would take away his inner garment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A saint who has committed his soul to death is one who has been cut off from the things of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The condition for receiving spiritual life is for us to forsake certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only by this will we truly gain.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the spiritual realm, we are not reckoned rich by how much we have gained; the richer we are, the more we have to lose.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not measure our life by our "gains"; we should measure our life by our "losses."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our true measure is the measure of wine that we pour out, rather than the measure that we have kept.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those who lose the most have the most to offer.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The power of love is seen in the sacrifice of love.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If our hearts are not yet separated from the craving of worldly wealth, our soul-life is not yet on the cross and has not yet passed through the work of the cross.</S>
