<p>In verse 4 the Lord said, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you.&rdquo; In order for us to abide in the Lord, we should be like branches that remain in the vine. Such branches are supplied with sap, which includes the riches of the vine&rsquo;s life and nature, in order to grow. The growth of the branches has an outflow, an expression, which is the bringing forth of clusters of grapes. Strictly speaking, the word <em>cluster</em> is used to describe how the grapes are borne by the branches of the vine. The branches of peach trees and apple trees do not bear clusters of fruit; only vines have branches that bear fruit in clusters. A vine tree would not look nice if each branch bore only one grape. Every branch of a vine has at least a few clusters of fruit, and every vine tree has many branches. Therefore, when we look at vine trees that are growing on trellises, we notice clusters of grapes. This shows that bearing fruit is the purpose of the branches of the vine.</p>
<p>Our relationship with the Lord is not like the relationship between two friends, nor is it like the relationship between students and their teacher. Our relationship with the Lord is like the relationship between the branches and the vine tree. He is the vine, and we are the branches. Since we are branches, what is our purpose? The branches of the vine are not suitable to be used as wood. They cannot be used even for fuel because they are hard to burn. When the branches of the vine become useless, they are thrown away. Hence, it is not a wonder that every branch that does not bear fruit will be taken away (v. 2). We are branches, and our responsibility is to bear fruit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Bearing Fruit Meaning<br />
to Lead People to the Lord</h2>
<p>Among Christians there are two main understandings of bearing fruit. One group of Christians says that <em>fruit</em> in John 15 denotes moral virtues, such as patience, humility, and honoring one&rsquo;s parents. Thus, to bear fruit is to live out these virtues. I agreed with this understanding when I was a young believer. Another group says that believers are branches of the Lord, who is the vine. Therefore, to bear fruit is to lead people to salvation.</p>
<p>Most people lean toward the first understanding, because of the tendency to explain the Bible according to one&rsquo;s situation. The kind of person that we are determines the way that we understand the Bible. Even if two people were to read the same version of the Bible, they would understand it in different ways. Sisters tend to have one explanation, and brothers tend to have a different explanation. Believers tend to say that fruit-bearing denotes the virtues of our character. Such an explanation is for our convenience. This understanding means that we do not need to struggle to go forth, nor do we need to labor; instead, we can stay at home and be lazy. Such a believer may claim that he is humble and full of endurance. He may not revile when he is reviled, and he may not get angry. Therefore, he has clusters of fruit all over him. It is easy and convenient to bear this kind of fruit. If fruit-bearing is to lead people to salvation, we would all be exposed.</p>
<p>We need to examine our conscience before the Lord. We need to ask ourselves, &ldquo;How many people have I led to salvation?&rdquo; Many people have been saved for more than ten years, but they have not yet led two people to salvation. Most of us would have to confess that we have not led even one person to salvation.</p>
<p>An elder recently testified that he has served as an elder in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for twenty years, but he has not led one person to salvation. It is hard to believe that an elder who is among us has not brought one person to the Lord in twenty years. Another brother has been saved for many years and preaches the gospel zealously, but he has not been able to lead others to be baptized. I believe that this has been our situation.</p>
<p>Such a situation indicates that although the Lord has planted a vineyard here with numerous branches, there are few grapes. Some branches have only one grape, and some branches are bare; they do not have even one grape. This is our condition. We moved to Anaheim in 1974. At that time about one thousand saints from different places formed seven local churches in this area. However, there were not many new believers among us. After ten years I began to notice our barrenness and felt that this situation could not be tolerated. The churches have remained, but the number of saints had decreased to under a thousand. This was also the situation in the Far East. Then I woke up and realized that something is wrong; instead of bearing fruit, we are caring only for the meetings. As a result, we have become experts and professionals concerning going to meetings. Every year we meet zealously at least four times per week, but we do not bear fruit. In October of 1984 I realized that we can no longer take this way. Hence, I went back to the Bible to find out what the Bible says about fruit-bearing and to understand why we were not bearing fruit.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Proper Way for Believers to Meet and to Serve &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
