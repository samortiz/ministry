   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT THE REWARD OF THE KINGDOM Scripture Reading: Matt 19:13-15, 16-30; 20:1-16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we will cover Matthew 19:13 through 20:16.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although this is a long portion of the Word, it is nevertheless quite simple.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The parable found in Matthew 20:1-16 is a definition of the Lord's words at the close of chapter nineteen.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This passage begins with little children being brought to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the disciples tried to prevent the children from receiving the Lord's blessing, the Lord rebuked them, and laying His hands on the children, He blessed them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This reminds us once again that the kingdom people must be like little children.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether we are old or young, we all need to be like little children.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Children are very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are poor in spirit, and in a sense, pure in heart, fulfilling the requirements of Matthew chapter five.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For the sake of the kingdom we need to be poor in spirit and pure in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because children are not rich, it is quite easy for them to be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Grown-ups, on the contrary, are rich.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some are rich physically, others are rich psychologically, and still others are rich in their dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They dream of being rich.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Little children are poor in every sense of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must rid ourselves of such dreams and become like little children.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we fail to become like little children, we will be like a rich man coming to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A RICH MAN</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Following the incident with the children, we are told of a rich man who came to the Lord Jesus seeking eternal life 19:16-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was seeking the zoe life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He already had the bios, the physical life, and the psuche, the soulish life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now he was seeking after the zoe life, the divine and eternal life, which he thought he could inherit by doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Addressing the Lord as "Teacher," he asked, "What good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>19:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus was very wise, and His answer revealed something very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord responded, "Why are you asking Me concerning that which is good?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One is good" 19:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What does this reveal?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It tells us that if we call the Lord good, we must recognize that He is God, for no one is good except God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord was saying that if you call Me good, you must recognize that I am God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not think of ourselves as good, because we are not God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only God is good.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This indicates that we are unable to do anything good because we ourselves are not good.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How can a man who is not good do something good?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Can an evil tree bring forth good fruit?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Matt 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are not good.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must be convinced that we cannot do anything good.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we consider ourselves to be good, this is blasphemy against God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all must realize that we are not good because we are not God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only God is good.</S>
