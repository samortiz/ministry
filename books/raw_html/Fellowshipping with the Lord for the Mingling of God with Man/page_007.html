        <h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP BEING THE FOUNDATION<br />
FOR OUR GROWTH AND SERVICE</h2>
<p>A genuinely spiritual person remains in his spirit, enjoys God&rsquo;s presence, and has life, peace, and freedom. He is also satisfied and strengthened. Since he lives in fellowship with God, the divine life can flow into him and become his constitution. As a result, he can always express the life of God and impart this life into others. By means of the divine life flowing into him and becoming his constitution, he gradually grows in this life unto maturity. The flow of life and the imparting of life are the genuine work of every person who serves the Lord. Our growth in life and our function in the work depend on the fellowship of life, which is also fellowship in God&rsquo;s presence. It is possible that some of us do not have the fellowship of life, yet we still give messages, pray, visit, or administrate the church. This kind of work, which is not in fellowship with God, is merely a job, and it cannot impart life into others. The inexperienced ones may regard such outward things as being the work of God, but those who are experienced, who live in fellowship with God, know that such work can be carried out without fellowship and without the supply of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE INNER SENSE FOR FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>A believer who desires to be used by God must pay the price. This is the prerequisite to being used by God. In addition to paying the price, there are still many lessons that can be learned only in fellowship with God. Some brothers paid a price when they began to serve, but now they cannot be properly used by the Lord, because they gradually lost the fellowship. Not every person who pays the price is able to maintain the fellowship. However, those who maintain the fellowship will surely be able to pay the price. When we are not willing to obey the inner sense and pay the price, the fellowship will cease spontaneously. There are times when we pay the price, yet we do not have the fellowship. Learning to fellowship with the Lord is the most important lesson for the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones. Fellowship is the key to all our spiritual experiences, whether they are related to our life, our living, or our work. Hence, if we desire to be used by God, we must pay full attention to this fellowship.</p>
<p>Concerning learning to fellowship, we must begin with knowing the inner sense. Suppose a brother senses that he does not have life, peace, or freedom within. He must stop and immediately check with God concerning the reason. Perhaps he did something that God forbade, or he kept something that God wanted him to give up. Perhaps he has remained in a certain sin and is not willing to forsake it, even though he has a feeling about the situation. As long as he is willing to enter the presence of God, it will be easy for him to find the cause. Once he knows the cause, he must deal with it immediately. If he is not willing to deal with it, his sense of death and bondage will become more acute. These negative feelings are warnings from God, telling the brother that there is a problem and that he should check with God.</p>
<p>It may be that a brother did not make a mistake, commit a sin, or disobey God, but he senses hunger and thirst within. The sense of hunger and thirst differs from the sense of death, unrest, bondage, and emptiness. The sense of emptiness and death is not normal, but the sense of hunger and thirst is normal. God uses the sense of hunger and thirst to urge us to seek Him in prayer and to pay the price to gain Him. If we are willing to take care of this sense within, we will enter deeper into the presence of God. The sense of dullness is different from the sense of darkness. The sense of darkness is abnormal, and it indicates that there is a problem between us and God; that is, we have offended Him. The sense of dullness is often an urging from God for us to rise up and pursue Him in prayer and wait for His calling. When we have the sense of dullness, we should rise up to wait on God and seek Him in a deeper way.</p>
<p>There is also the sense of indifference, in which we neither feel peaceful nor restless. This is also a calling from God for us to enter into His presence. In order to take adequate care of the inner sense, we need to spend time to absorb God in prayer. Prayer is the way to absorb God. If we do not take adequate care of the inner sense, we will lose the sense of life, peace, and freedom. God gives us the inner sense because He desires that we would draw near to Him and respond to His call. If we do not ignore the inner sense, we will enter into deeper fellowship, which will result in our experiencing abundant life and enjoying deeper peace and more freedom. If we ignore the inner sense, we will lose the fellowship of life, which will cause us to lose the sense of life, peace, and freedom.</p>
<p>If we are willing to learn the fine details of the lesson of being in the presence of God and fellowshipping with Him, we will grow in life daily, and we will also be constituted with the spiritual element daily. As a result, we will have the overflow of life and be able to impart the divine life into others. This is the result of living in the divine fellowship and of allowing God to constitute His divine element into us. God can flow out of those who are willing to become such people, and such people can be used by God.</p>
<p>Fellowship is the flow of life. It is the Spirit flowing within us. To learn the lesson of fellowship is to take care of the feeling in our spirit by dealing with ourselves before God. Hence, we must set aside a substantial amount of time in order to look to Him, to absorb Him, and to wait on Him. We must enter into His presence so that He has the opportunity to strengthen the flow of His life within us. The more time we spend entering into His presence to wait on Him, draw near to Him, and absorb Him, the more opportunities He will have to flow in us. The dealings produced through this kind of fellowship will strengthen our fellowship with God, produce the overflow of life, and manifest our function.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING USEFUL DEPENDING ON TOUCHING LIFE</h2>
<p>As those who desire to be used by the Lord, we should pay attention to the fellowship of the divine life and not to good and evil or to right and wrong. The fellowship of life is the principle of the tree of life. Any church or any saint who desires to be used by the Lord cannot live in the realm of right and wrong. Whatever we touch in the realm of right and wrong is not of life and does not give peace or freedom. We must touch God&rsquo;s presence, that is, His life. When we touch death, our service comes to a halt. The key to being used by the Lord is to touch Him. This applies to an individual saint and to a church. Those who are in communion with God will be used by Him. Rather than arguing over the fine details of the truth, we should pay more attention to entering into a deeper fellowship with the Lord. Regrettably, many saints who have a heart to serve the Lord have fallen into the trap of the devil; that is, they are in the realm of right and wrong or good and evil. As a result, they have lost the flow of life and have fallen into death. When believers debate concerning an item of the truth, they may get clear concerning the truth, but they almost always touch death. We must not forget that only those who touch the flow of life can be used by God. Hence, we must touch the fellowship of life.</p>
<p>Andrew Murray was greatly used by God because he was a person who touched the divine fellowship. He brought people into God, and his work was very effective. The secret of being used by the Lord lies in the fellowship of life. We must be willing to forsake other things in order to keep this fellowship. The apostle John was a mender of nets, and his ministry was a mending ministry with the divine life. God used him to write the last book of the Bible, Revelation, in which every spiritual matter concludes with the divine life. The foundation of serving the Lord is the experience of life, and the experience of life depends on our fellowship with the Lord.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
