   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTY-THREE RECKONING Date: August 6, 1937</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Singapore</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Rom 6:11 RECKONING OURSELVES TO BE DEAD IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Last night we saw the fact concerning God crucifying our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What should we do now that the old man has been crucified?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 6:11 says, "So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should reckon ourselves to be dead in Christ, and also reckon ourselves to be resurrected in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should reckon ourselves to be dead to sin and living to God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What does reckoning mean?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We know that men often are not that accurate in the way they speak or write.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No one can guarantee that what is recorded as history or in documentaries is one hundred percent accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The most that one can say is that the records are very close to the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The most accurate human knowledge is mathematics.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Mathematics is the only exact knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Two plus two equals four.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is very precise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You cannot discount a little by saying that two plus two equals three, or inflate a little by saying that two plus two equals five.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the kindergartners and university students on the earth alike will say that two plus two equals four.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You cannot say that two plus two equals five just because you have a doctorate degree.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On this earth nothing is more precise than mathematics.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God wants us to reckon ourselves to be dead because we are truly dead.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Four means four.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If it is not four, we cannot say it is four.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whatever we have, we can only say what we have.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can reckon ourselves to be dead because we are actually dead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose you are the bookkeeper of a business.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If your accounting shows a loss of twenty thousand dollars, you have to report it as such.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You cannot change the twenty-thousand-dollar loss into a twenty-thousand-dollar profit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The accounting book must match the income and loss of the business precisely.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If God tells us to reckon ourselves to be dead, it means that we are truly dead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only genuine death can be considered as death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you have not died, you cannot reckon yourself to be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The reckoning in the Bible is an act of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How do we reckon?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We reckon by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We know that when the Lord was crucified, He took our old man along.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The one who was without hope, the one who was full of sins and filth, was crucified on the cross of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps you still consider yourself to be alive and not dead.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that you do not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>FAITH IN GOD'S WORD, NOT IN ONE'S FEELINGS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I have always felt that the thing which is most lacking among believers today is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is the knowledge of the truth, but the real experience often does not match the knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because of the lack of living faith Heb 4:2 , there is always a gap between what one knows and what he experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If one has a living faith, everything will be reality to him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if he does not have faith, the truth will remain the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He will remain separate from the truth, and the two will never be joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we have genuine faith, all the truth will become reality to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God says that we are dead in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we believe, we will find that we are truly dead.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Two years ago a Western missionary who had several children came to me, saying, "Mr. Nee, I do not know how I can make it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If one of my children cries, I can bear it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if another one cries, I lose my patience.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>My patience can only endure one child, not two.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If two of them cry at the same time, I lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Mr. Nee, what can I do? I see that I am still alive; I am not dead at all.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the reason for my failure.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If I were truly dead, everything would be just fine."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I smiled at her and said, "When has God ever said that you are dead in yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God has never said this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God has said that you are dead in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If your eyes are upon yourself, you will always be very much alive.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you look at Christ, you will find that you are truly dead.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many people know the truth of crucifixion with Christ, but when they look at themselves, they find that they are not yet dead.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God has never told us that we can look at ourselves and find ourselves dead simply by listening to a message.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is to live according to feeling, not according to faith.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Faith is looking at Christ, not at ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Faith sees ourselves in Christ, not in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As believers we should never look at ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should only consider ourselves in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We can only believe in the facts in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We cannot believe in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Satan will continue to tempt us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He will tell us that we are alive.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We find that we are still alive when we are in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Satan will cause us to look at ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He will deceive us, saying, "God may say that you are dead, but you are not dead!"</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we look at ourselves, we will see that we are not dead indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, should we believe God's word or our feeling?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God says that we are dead in Christ, but Satan says that we are not dead.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When we look at ourselves, it may seem as if we are not dead.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Should we believe God's word, or should we believe our own feelings?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is the difference between having and not having a living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We know that God says that we are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Should we believe God or should we believe our own feeling?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Is God's word true or is our own experience true?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We should believe God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we have a living faith, even if it seems that we are alive, we can say, "Even though I feel this way, I do not believe that I am alive.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I do not believe my own feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I believe God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>God says that I am dead, and I am dead."</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>What is a living faith?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It is laying hold of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Only God's word is real.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Our feeling and experience will always change.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But I believe that all the works of God have been accomplished in Christ already.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Our problem today is that we only see that we are alive.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>When we only see that we are alive, we have let go of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When our senses are filled with our own feelings, we have put aside God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We may feel that we are alive, but these feelings are contrary to God's word; therefore, we should not believe our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Rather, we should only believe God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If we do this, we will find deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Tens and thousands of people have heard this truth, but most of them just know the truth; they do not have a living faith, and everything is vain for them.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Our mind cannot render us any help.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>When temptation comes, our mind wonders what we should do to act dead.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>But such endeavors only prove that we do not have any faith at all.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>It is not a matter of whether or not we can believe that we are dead in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We do not have to die; we are dead al- ready.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We do not have to do anything; everything is done already.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We do not have to inwardly resist temptation; we only need to believe God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If a business has gained some profit, the account will surely reflect a profit.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>God says that I am dead.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>I should reckon myself to be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Many people think that once they die, everything will be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Actually they died long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Everything has been accomplished in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>There is no need for me to die, because I am already dead.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>If I am not genuinely dead, how can God reckon me to be dead?</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>If the business is losing money, how can the owner ask me to record a profit?</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Only when I am truly dead can God reckon me to be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>God would not ask me to cheat in the accounting.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>In Christ I am truly dead.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Whether or not I experience it, my old man is dead already.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Temptation will not add anything to the work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>The work of Christ is fully accomplished, whether or not we have the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>We only need to reckon ourselves to be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Where there is faith, there is the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Without faith there cannot be the real experience.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Suppose temptation comes and you are stirred up within.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>At such times do you believe in the stirring within or do you believe in God's word?</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>You will be tested immediately as to whether you believe in God or in your own feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Believing God does not mean believing in evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Faith does not require evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Anything real does not need the proof of evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Those who are trustworthy have no need of evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>If I lent money to the president, there would be no need for him to give me a guarantee.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>If I lent money to a taxi driver, I would require someone to guarantee the loan because the loan might not be repaid.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>God's word has no need of a guarantee.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>What He speaks stands because He is the great and most high God.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>He is real.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>What He speaks stands forever Heb 6:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>Our feelings will tell us that we are not dead and that we are still sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>When this happens, what will we believe?</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Will we believe that we are dead in Christ or that we are still alive in our feelings?</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>All those who believe that they are dead in Christ are blessed; all the problems will be resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>A living faith believes in God's word rather than in the doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>If you only know the doctrine, it will stay in your mind and not have any effect on you.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>You must believe God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>You must reject everything that belongs to the self and believe that God has accomplished everything.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>When temptation comes, you may be stirred up because you realize that you are proud, unclean, anxious, unhappy, and jealous.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>What should you do?</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>Those who have faith will praise God and say, "Although I cannot rejoice, I am still dead.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>Although I lose my temper, I am still dead.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>Although my feelings are contrary to God's word, I will still praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>God has accomplished everything in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>If you believe that you are in Christ and that you are truly joined to Him, you will jump up and shout, "Praise God, I am dead!"</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>The difficulty today is that we only see "truths"; we do not see God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>We only see the truth without seeing the real thing behind the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>This is like studying geography without ever visiting the places.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>You must have revelation, and God's light must enlighten you before you will see your position in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>You do not see it now, and that is why you cannot believe.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>Suppose I go and hide in a room.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>You will believe that I am in the room because you saw me go in. Today you cannot see yourself as dead.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>On the contrary, you see that you have not died at all.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>Regardless of how you look at yourself, the old man is still alive.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>But thank God, although you cannot see it, you can believe it because you know that you are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>When He died, you died with Him also.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>You cannot say that He is dead but you are still alive.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>Suppose I throw a soft-drink bottle into the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>Wherever the bottle is, there is the drink within the bottle.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>You cannot say that the bottle is in the sea yet the drink in the bottle is at the YMCA or at Brother Wong's house.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>Where the bottle is, there also is the drink.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>God has put you into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>Since Christ has died, you have died also.</S>
