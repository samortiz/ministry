   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE WRITER</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The writer of the book of Ezra was Ezra, whose name means help or helper.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE CONTENTS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is very important for us to know the contents of the book of Ezra This book gives us a record of the two returns of the children of Israel from their captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first return was under Zerubbabel, a descendant of the royal family of David chs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Zerubbabel should have been the one to succeed the throne of David, but he was appointed to be the governor of Judah by Cyrus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second return was under Ezra, a priest as the descendant of Aaron chs.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>7 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is significant that Zerubbabel was of the royal tribe Judah and that Ezra was a descendant of a priestly family.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The priests took care of God s speaking, and the kings took care of God s ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All that God has been doing is mainly in these two matters of speaking and ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>V. THE CRUCIAL POINTS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The book of Ezra stresses the return of the children of Israel from their captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This return is crucial in four points.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A. The Return of the Children of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>from Their Captivity Recovering the Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>of God s Calling of Them</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The children of Israel were called by God and separated by God unto Himself as His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Their captivity had annulled this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The return of the children of Israel from their captivity recovered the purpose of God s calling of them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As a people, the children of Israel were supposed to be a testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In what way was Israel to be a testimony to God?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we would answer this question, we need to see that the law given through Moses was called the testimony Exo 25:16, 21 because it is a portrait of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the Giver of the law, God is portrayed in the law according to what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In particular, the Ten Commandments are God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The ark was called the ark of the testimony 25:22; 26:33 , and the tabernacle was called the tabernacle of testimony Num 1:50, 53 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Ten Commandments, inscribed on two tablets of stone, are divided into two groups of five commandments, like the ten fingers on our two hands.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Each group of five commandments is divided into four plus one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the first group, the first three commandments are concerned with God and charge us not to have any god other than God, not to worship idols, and not to take the name of God in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God must be the unique God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The fourth commandment concerns the keeping of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The real significance of keeping the Sabbath is that we must stop ourselves in order to be one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Those who do not keep the Sabbath may gain a day for themselves, but they lose God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The commandment regarding the Sabbath is also related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, the first four commandments are all concerned with God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The fifth commandment, concerning honoring our parents, ranks our parents with God and points to God as our origin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our origin is our parents, and the origin of our parents is God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we honor our parents, we honor God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>From this we see that honoring our parents is a very significant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The second group of five commandments is concerned with our relationships one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These are the commandments not to kill, not to commit adultery, not to steal, not to lie, and not to covet.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How wonderful our society would be if there were no killing, no adultery, no stealing, no lying, and no coveting.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our community would be a marvelous place if everyone was loving, pure, truthful, and helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A people who keep these last five commandments would surely be a real testimony of God, testifying that their God is the God of love, purity, sympathy, and truthfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Such a people would surely be God s particular people, God s elect, separated unto Him and sanctified to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After the man created by God became fallen, mankind fell lower and lower until, at Babel, they became rotten to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God gave up the created race after Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then He called Abraham and gave his descendants the law as the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He expected that Abraham s descendants would be a people who had only Jehovah as their God, who rested with God in oneness, who honored their origin, and who loved one another in purity and honesty.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Such a people would be the same as God in expression.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They would be the many reproductions of God on earth testifying of the one God in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This was God s purpose in calling the children of Israel and separating them to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But the children of Israel failed God, breaking every one of the Ten Commandments and becoming the same as mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The testimony of God is that we have one God and no other gods, that we stop ourselves in order to be one with God and to enjoy Him and have Him as everything, and that we honor Him as our origin, which is signified by our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Israel was carried away into captivity, and God lost such a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They were called by God for the purpose of being His testimony, and their captivity annulled this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But the return of the children of Israel from their captivity recovered the purpose of God s calling of them.</S>
