   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LOOKING TO GOD FOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SUSTENANCE WHILE WORKING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To the best of my knowledge, Sister Dora Yu was the only preacher at that time who did not receive a salary and who depended wholly upon God for her living.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>She was my spiritual elder sister, and we knew each other very well.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>She had many friends, Chinese and foreign, and the field of her work was very wide since she preached everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But my condition was just the opposite; few cared for me, so I found it rather difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yet when I looked to the Lord, He said to me, "If you cannot live by faith, you cannot work for Me."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I knew that I needed living work and living faith to serve a living God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When once I found that there was only about ten dollars in my wallet, which before long would be fully spent, I suddenly recalled the widow of Zarephath, who had only a handful of meal in the barrel and a little oil in the cruse 1 Kings 17:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There were not two handfuls of meal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I did not know by what means God sustained her, but I knew He had the means.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1921 two co-workers and I went to a place in Fukien province to preach, intending to go from there to another place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In my pocket were only four dollars, an insufficient amount for three bus tickets.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But, thank the Lord, a brother gave us three tickets.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Again, at Kulangsu, in the south of Fukien province, my money was stolen from my pocket, so that I had no traveling expenses to return home.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We were then staying in someone's house and preached once a day in a small chapel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We finished and were ready to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>My two co-workers had money to return home, but mine had been stolen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At that time each of us was spending his own money.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They made the decision to leave on the following day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I heard this I was embarrassed, but I was not willing to borrow money from them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That evening I prayed to God, beseeching Him to provide the needed money for traveling expenses.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nobody knew this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That afternoon some people had come to speak with me about the Word, but I was in no mood to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that time the devil came to tempt me and shake my faith, but I was firm in believing that God would not let me down.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I was then merely a youth, just embarking on serving the Lord by faith; I had not yet learned the lesson of living by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I continued praying to God that evening, thinking that perhaps I had done something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The devil said, "You could ask the co-workers to buy your ticket, then repay them when you reach the provincial capital."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I did not accept this suggestion and continued looking to God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the time came for us to leave, there was still no money in hand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I packed my luggage as usual and hired a rickshaw.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At that moment, I recalled the story of a brother who had no train ticket when the train was about to leave, but at that very instant, God ordered someone to give him a ticket.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We were all ready and boarded the rickshaws, of which there were three.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I took the last one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the rickshaw had been pulled about forty yards, an old man in a long gown came from behind shouting, "Mr. Nee, please stop!" I ordered the rickshaw boy to halt.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After handing me a parcel of food as well as an envelope, the old man departed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I was then so grateful for God's arrangement that my eyes were filled with tears.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When I opened the envelope, I found four dollars inside, just sufficient for a bus ticket.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The devil kept speaking to me, "Don't you see how dangerous it is?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I replied, "I was indeed a little anxious about it, but it is by no means dangerous, for God has supplied my need in time."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After arriving in Amoy, another brother gave me a return ticket.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In 1923 Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi invited me to preach in Kien-ou in the north of Fukien province.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I had only about fifteen dollars in my pocket, one-third of the traveling expenses.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I decided to leave on Friday evening and continued my prayer on Wednesday and Thursday.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The money, however, did not come in. I prayed again Friday morning.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not only was no money forthcoming, but also I had a feeling within that I should give five dollars to a certain co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I recalled the Lord's words: "Give, and it will be given to you."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I had not been a money lover, but on that day I really loved money and found it extremely difficult to give.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I prayed to the Lord again, "O Lord, if You really want me to give away five dollars, I will," but I was still rather unwilling inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I was deceived by Satan into thinking that after praying I would not have to give away the five dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That was the only time in my life that I shed tears over money.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Eventually, I obeyed the Lord and gave the five dollars to that co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After the money was given, I was filled with heavenly joy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When the co-worker asked why I gave him the money, I said, "You need not ask; you will know later."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Friday evening I prepared to begin my journey.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I said to God, "Fifteen dollars was already insufficient, and You wanted me to give away five dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Won't the sum be even more inadequate?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now I don't know how to pray."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I made up my mind to go first to Shui-kow by steamer and then to Kien-ou by a small wooden boat.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I spent only a little for the journey to Shui-kow.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As the steamer was about to arrive, I felt that if I would not pray according to my own concept, the result would be much better.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>So I said to the Lord, "I do not know how to pray; please do it for me."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I added, "If You will not give me the money, please provide a boat for me with a little fare."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When I arrived in Shui-kow, many boatmen came to solicit business.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One asked only seven dollars for my passage.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This price was beyond expectation; the usual fare was several times more.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I asked the boatman why his price was so low, and he replied, "This boat is hired by the magistrate, but I am allowed to take one passenger only for the space at the stern, so I do not care how much the fare is.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But you have to provide your own food."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Originally, I had fifteen dollars in my pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After giving five dollars to a co-worker and spending a few dimes for the journey by steamer, seven dollars for the small wooden boat, and a dollar or so for food, there was still a dollar thirty left when I reached Kien-ou.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Praise Him that His ordering is always good.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After I completed my work at Kien-ou and was ready to return to Foochow, the problem arose again: I did not have sufficient funds for traveling expenses to return.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I had decided to leave on the following Monday, so I continued praying until Saturday.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This time I had a feeling of certainty in my heart, recalling that before I left Foochow, God had asked me to give five dollars to a co-worker, which I then begrudged giving.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>At that time I read Luke 6:38: "Give, and it will be given to you," and I laid hold of this sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I said to God, "Since You have said this, I beseech You to provide me with the necessary money for traveling expenses according to Your promise."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>On Sunday evening a British pastor, Mr. Philips, a true brother, assuredly saved and loving the Lord, asked Brother Weigh and me to dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>At dinner Mr. Philips told me that he and his church had received great help through my messages, and they offered to be responsible for my traveling expenses both ways.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I replied that there was already someone who had accepted this responsibility, meaning God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then he said, "When you get back to Foochow, I will give you The Dynamics of Service written by Mr. Padgett Wilkes, a gospel messenger greatly used by the Lord in Japan." I soon felt that I had missed a great opportunity; what I needed then was money for traveling expenses, not a book.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I somewhat regretted that I had not accepted his offer.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>After dinner Brother Weigh and I returned home together.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I had refused Mr. Philips's offer for my traveling expenses so that I might look solely to God for help; nevertheless, there was joy and peace in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Brother Weigh was unaware of my financial situation.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I had a slight thought of borrowing money from him for my expenses and then reimbursing him when I returned to Foochow, but God would not allow me to divulge this matter to him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I was under full conviction that God in heaven is forever dependable, and I wished to see how He was going to provide for me.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When I left the following day, I had only a few dollars in my pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Many brothers and sisters came to see me off, and some carried my luggage.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>While walking I prayed, "Lord, surely You wouldn't bring me here without taking me back."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Halfway to the wharf, Mr. Philips sent someone with a letter.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The letter read, "Though someone else has assumed the responsibility for your traveling expenses, I feel that I should have a share in your work here.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Would it be possible for me, an aged brother, to have such a share?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Please be good enough to accept this small sum for this purpose."</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>After reading the letter, I felt I should accept the money, and I did.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It was not only sufficient for my return expenses to Foochow, but also for printing one issue of The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Upon my return to Foochow, the wife of the co-worker who received the five dollars said to me, "I have the feeling that when you left you did not have enough money yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Why did you suddenly give five dollars to my husband?"</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I then asked her what had occurred in connection with the five dollars, and she replied, "We had only one dollar left in the house on Wednesday, and that had been spent by Friday.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>On Friday we prayed all day.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Afterwards my husband felt that he should go for a walk, and then he met you, and you gave him five dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The five dollars lasted us through five days; then God provided for us from another source."</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>At this point she continued with tears, "If you had not given us the five dollars on that day, we would have suffered hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>It does not matter that we suffer hunger, but what about God's promise?"</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Her testimony filled me with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The Lord had worked through me to supply their need with the five dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The Word of the Lord is indeed faithful: "Give, and it will be given to you."</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is the lesson I have learned in my life.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>I have now experienced that the less money I have in my hand, the more God will give.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This is a difficult path to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Many people may feel that they are able to live the life of faith; but when the trial comes, they are in fear.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Unless you can believe in the real and living God, I do not advise you to take this path.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>I can bear testimony today that God is the One who gives.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>To be sustained by means of ravens as Elijah was at his time is still possible today.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>I am going to mention something to you which you may find difficult to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>It has been my experience that God's supply arrives when I have spent my last dollar.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>I have had fourteen years of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>In each experience God wanted to get the glory for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>God has supplied all my needs and has not failed me once.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Those who used to give do not do so now.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>There is a constant change of offerers; one lot of people replaces another.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>All this does not matter, for God in the highest is a living God.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>He never changes!</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>I say this today for your benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>I must say this that you may go straight forward in the path of living a life of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>There are ten to twenty more cases like these that I have already related to you.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Concerning the matter of offering the Lord money, one ought to set aside a definite amount a tithe of your income or half of your income and put it in the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>From her natural being, the widow who gave two half-farthings might have grudged doing so, but she was praised by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>We have to be an example for others; we need not fear, for God will not fail.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>We should learn to love God, to believe Him, and to serve Him as is His due.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>We ought to thank Him and praise Him because of His unspeakable grace!</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Amen.</S>
