   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FORTY-TWO THE MINISTERS OF THE NEW COVENANT 11 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 6:1-13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many teachers of the Bible treat 2 Corinthians 6 as if it were separate from chapter five.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They do not point out how chapters five and six are connected.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, chapter six is an explanation of chapter five.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>BECOMING THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have seen that in chapter five the apostles have received the ministry of reconciliation to bring God s people, not only sinners, back into God Himself so that they may become the righteousness of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The apostles had been commissioned with this ministry to bring God s people into Him and to make them one with Him organically.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we are brought back into God in this way, we become the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since righteousness is an attribute of God, to become God s righteousness in Christ is to become this divine attribute.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this sense, we become what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is righteousness, and in Christ we become this righteousness of God, an attribute of what God Himself is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the purpose of God s salvation and the goal of His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God s economy in saving us is to make us the expression of God, even one of His attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is revealed in chapter five of 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE NEED FOR FURTHER RECONCILIATION</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul realized that his description of reconciliation in chapter five involved something very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, in chapter six he explains further that the reconciliation in chapter five is equal to full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For this reason, in 6:2 he refers to reconciliation as salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The salvation here is not the salvation of sinners; it is the salvation of God s half-reconciled people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who have been only partly reconciled to God need further reconciliation, further salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all can confidently declare that we have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, we may not yet be saved in full.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, we need to humble ourselves before the Lord and pray, O Lord, I thank You that by Your mercy and grace You have saved me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But, Lord, I still have not been fully saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I need more of Your salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some believers have been saved to a large degree.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Others, however, have been saved only to a very small extent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In these messages I am burdened that we all would have a greater degree of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am concerned about the percentage of your salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To what degree, to what extent, have you been saved?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some who have been under this ministry for years still only have a very limited salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, the percentage of their salvation is increasing slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>My point here is that reconciliation and salvation are matters of degree.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is especially true of reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am hoping that the degree of our reconciliation into God will increase rapidly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What we have in chapter six is progress related to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the context, to be saved 6:2 is simply to be reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As long as certain parts of us are not saved, in those parts of our being there is a discrepancy between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A more accurate word to describe this condition is enmity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Romans 8 Paul says the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the mind set on the spirit is life and peace Rom 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we are in spirit, we have life and also peace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Peace is an indication of being reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As long as there is something within us that is lacking in peace, some part of us is at enmity with God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This indicates that, at least in certain matters, we have not been reconciled to God, for in these matters there is no peace between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To be sure, whenever there is no peace, there is enmity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But when peace comes, enmity disappears.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may also say that when enmity goes, peace comes.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whether or not we are at peace depends on our being reconciled to God.</S>
