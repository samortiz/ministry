<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE ENJOYMENT OF THE HOUSE AND THE CITY OF GOD THROUGH CHRIST</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 49 to 67</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 50:2; 51:18-19; 52:8; 53:6a; 55:14; 61:4; 63:1-2; 65:1, 4; 66:13</h1><p>In Book I of the Psalms Christ is emphasized and the house of God is then sweetly presented. Many dear Christians who love the Psalms have failed to see this. A few have seen Christ, but hardly one has really seen the house of God. Book I of the Psalms has both Christ Himself and the house of God. Book II presents Christ and the house again, but it brings us on in a marvelous way to see the strengthened, enlarged, and built-up house, the city. In Psalms 46, 47 and 48, we are brought to the climax of the city. These Psalms describe the city to the uttermost. Following these three Psalms, we still have many wonderful and precious verses concerning the house and the city. Such verses as these are not found in the first book and especially not before Psalm 22.<h2 class=head1>MORE CONCERNING CHRIST</h2><p>Psalms 49 through 67 tell us how the saints enjoy the house and the city of God through Christ. Firstly we must indicate the various verses in this section which speak further concerning Christ. (1) He suffered the plot of men (Psa. 56:6, cf. Luke 11:54; John 11:57). (2) He was betrayed by His friend (Psa. 55:13, cf. Matt. 26:50). (3) He was falsely accused by the people (Psa. 55:3, cf. Matt. 26:59-68; John 18:30; 19:7). (4) He was assailed by the assembly of the adversaries (Psa. 62:3-4, cf. Matt. 26:3-4, 57, 59).<h2 class=head1>THE SAINTS’ ENJOYMENT OF THE HOUSE AND THE CITY OF GOD</h2><p>Secondly, we come to the saints’ enjoyment of the house and the city of God. We have to spend some time to consider these verses. Firstly we see that the church, the dwelling place of God, is the perfection of beauty out of which God shines. “Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined” (Psa. 50:2). Zion in typology is the church. It does not say that the church is the perfect beauty, but the perfection of beauty. It is very meaningful. In the eyes of God the most beautiful object in the entire universe is the church. On the first day of God’s recovery of creation, as recorded in Genesis 1, God only said, “It is good.” On the second day God made the firmament, which divided the waters above from the waters beneath. However, on that day God did not say, “It is good,” because in the waters beneath there were the demons, and in the air above there was the subtle one, Satan. Even though the firmament was good, God would not say that the work of that day was good. But on the third, fourth, and fifth days, God continually said, “It is good.” Then on the sixth day, when man was created, God said, “It is exceedingly good.” In God’s eyes, nothing in all His creation is so beautiful as man. But today, in all God’s creation plus His redemption, nothing is so beautiful as the church. The church is the perfection of beauty.<p>Have you ever looked at the New Jerusalem? Oh, the New Jerusalem! Look at it! Is that not the perfection of beauty? Is there anything in the universe more beautiful than the New Jerusalem? The entire city is of gold, transparent gold, with nothing opaque. There are twelve gates, and each gate is one tremendous pearl. The foundation is made of precious stones, layer upon layer, and the wall is also built up of gems. God is within the city as the shining light, and the entire city radiates the glory of God. Could anything be more beautiful than this? It is the perfection of beauty. One day, when we are all there in the New Jerusalem, we will exclaim, “O Lord, now we are really in the perfection of beauty!” It is not only beautiful; it is the perfection of beauty. Nothing could be more perfect; nothing could be more beautiful. This is the church!<p>While we are still in this old age, while we are still on this old earth, in my realization, the church is even now the perfection of beauty. You may say that it is not so perfect. In a sense, it is not, but in another sense, I would ask if you can find anything better. Never! I have passed through all kinds of human societies: I have been with the poor; I have been with the rich; I have been with the low-class as well as the high-class; I have been with the educated and with the uneducated. According to my experience, I must testify that in my entire life on this earth I have never found anything better than the local churches. To me this is the perfection of beauty, out from which God shines. “Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.” Praise the Lord!
