   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE SABBATH AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE REVELATION OF THE TABERNACLE Scripture Reading: Exo 31:12-17</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Exodus 25:1 31:11 contains the revelation of God to Moses concerning all the matters of the tabernacle and His service.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Immediately following this is God s further word on the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since God s word on the Sabbath was written as the conclusion of all the revelations in the preceding chapters, it must surely be significant.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Genesis 1, after all things had been created in six days, there was the Sabbath on the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the same way, after all things were revealed to Moses concerning the Lord s work and the services of the tabernacle, the Lord reminded the people of Israel to keep the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After all the divine work is the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE PRINCIPLE OF THE SABBATH</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must consider the principle and the meaning of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For six days God worked in creation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After God had done everything and all things were completed, accomplished, and finished, He kept the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, the Sabbath is the result of God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this result, that is, on the Sabbath day, God rested.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Exodus 31:17 says, It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God not only needs to rest but also to be refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The result of the divine work, which is the Sabbath, was that God could rest and refresh Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This result was an enjoyment for God, and God rejoiced in this result.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After we have finished a certain work, we then enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is especially true with the sisters who cook.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After they have done everything in their kitchen, they sit down at the table and enjoy what they have done.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The table is the Sabbath to them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They sit there, enjoy it, and are refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, after a mother has finished her cooking, she does not go to the table by herself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She goes to the table with her children.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The table is not an enjoyment to her alone; it is an enjoyment to her with her children.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Without her children she could not rest.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even though the cooking is completed and the whole table is prepared, could a proper mother sit down, eat well, and enjoy rest and refreshment if her children were missing?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The table is not for the mother alone but is for her and her children.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the first Sabbath day, after the conclusion of the creation, God did not rest alone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All creation rested with Him, and God especially rested with the man He created.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To God the Sabbath was the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To man, however, the Sabbath was the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man was the final item of God s creation and was created on the sixth day, probably toward the end of the sixth day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, immediately after man had been created, he entered into the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the divine work was done by God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nothing was done by man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, the Sabbath is the result of the divine work and is the rest to God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man s obligation to God is not to work but to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The obligation of the work has been borne by God already.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God s portion is to work and enjoy, but man s portion is simply to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, after the enjoyment there is a further work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After Adam had been created by God, he entered into the Sabbath, the first day to him, to rest and to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But after that day, he began to work, to till the ground Gen 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>With God, work is first and enjoyment is second.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>With man, enjoyment is first and work is second.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the vision of the principle of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God did the work and then enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We enjoy what God has done; then we work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This principle applies not only to creation but also to redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord has accomplished everything for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After the completion of His redemption, the Lord enjoyed the result.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord worked first and enjoyed later.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We, however, enjoy first and work later.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Concerning redemption and grace, we have nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Everything is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We simply enter into the Lord s accomplishment and have our rest.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To receive the gospel is to enter into the work which the Lord has finished.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Take it as the Sabbath, as your rest, and enjoy it with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But after you enjoy it, you have to bear some obligation to work.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After our enjoyment, we should offer ourselves to the Lord to do His work.</S>
