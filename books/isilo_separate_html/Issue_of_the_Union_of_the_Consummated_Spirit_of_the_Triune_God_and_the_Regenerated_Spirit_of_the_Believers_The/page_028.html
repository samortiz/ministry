Christ has divinity and humanity; He is God yet man, God plus man. A Christian has humanity and divinity; he is man yet God, man plus God. Hence, from the beginning Brother Nee did not agree to translate the word Christian into Chinese as "Christ-disciple." He said that we should translate it as "Christ-man." A Christ-man is one who has both the divine nature and the human nature, one who is a man yet has two natures. We are a dual-natured entity&#151;man yet God; hence, we are God-men. Since we are God-men, our living is not merely the living of God but also the living of human beings; it is not merely the living of human beings but also the living of God.</P><P>The redeemed people in the Body of Christ are those who are regenerated to be man yet God. We who are regenerated by God will become God. Some people do not agree with this kind of speaking. However, I must say that once a person believes in the Lord Jesus, He is regenerated, born of God. God is his Father. Since the Father is God, the children also should be God. Sheep beget sheep; horses beget horses. Of course, God begets God. John 1:12-13 says, "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten...of God." This word strongly indicates that the believers of the Lord are God's children, who are born of God. What is born of God is God. Perhaps there are some who say that although we are born of God, we are still men. To this I must say that although the Lord Jesus is God who became a man, He is still God. Although we are men who become God, we are still men. The Lord Jesus is God who became a man, but He did not lose His divinity; He is still God, and hence, He is God yet man. Today we, the saved ones, are men who become God, but we have not discarded our human nature; we are still men, and hence, we are man yet God. This is the fact and the truth, and it is logical.</P><P>We, the saved ones, are not merely forgiven of our sins; we are regenerated. To be regenerated is to be born a second time. Our first birth was of our parents, who are humans; hence, we also are humans. Today we are regenerated, born of God the Father; hence, we also are God. Our second birth was of God. Since we are born of God, surely we are the children of God. The children of God surely are God. By our first birth we became man; by our second birth we become God. If a person in his second birth is still only a man, he has not been regenerated. In our second birth we are born of God, and what is born of God surely is God. Hence, today we are not merely men but men yet God. We are children of men, and also children of God. A man has begotten me; thus, I am a man. God has begotten me; thus, I am God. By our two births we have become men yet God. This is irrefutable.</P><P>I have been stressing the fact that we are men yet God because this has too much to do with our living. For example, the children of a president are prudent in their speech and careful in their actions because they recognize their status. A person who is born of God should not forget his status as a son of God. If we have really seen this matter, there will always be a reminder within us: "Would a son of God speak in this way? Would he dress in this way?" No one who really recognizes that he is a son of God could ever live and act by his own desires. I can testify that when I went to a department store, each time I picked up a necktie, there was a reminder within me saying, "I am a child of God who speaks for the Lord. Can I use this tie?" Often I just put down the necktie because I knew that I could not use it. Brothers and sisters, do not forget your status. If the prince of a royal family forgot his status, that would be very unfortunate. Since we are men yet God, our living should match our status. We must live the life of one who is man yet God.</P><P>Only when we live the life of one who is man yet God can the Body of Christ be built up. We should never think that the Body of Christ is worked out by man's labor; neither should we think that the Body of Christ can be built up by good behavior. The building up of the Body of Christ depends on the living that is the mingling of two natures&#151;the divine nature and the human nature&#151;that is, the co-living of two parties&#151;the One who is God yet man and those who are man yet God&#151;blended together as one. This kind of joined and mingled living will cause the Body of Christ to be built up.</P><P>In other words, the building up of the Body of Christ is the issue of the co-living and co-walking of God and man through the union and mingling of the Spirit of God with the spirit of man. In actuality, this kind of co-living and co-walking is the building up of the Body of Christ. On the one hand, this kind of building requires the participating God, in His resurrected and uplifted humanity, to co-live and co-walk with the participating men. On the other hand, this kind of building also requires the participating men, in their redeemed and resurrected humanity, to experience the co-death with Christ so that the attributes of the participating God can be manifested from within the participating men in resurrection to be their virtues.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> </body></html>
