 <p>Prayer: O dear Lord, hear the singing of this hymn [<i>Hymns,</i> #840]. Lord, You know that we sing it from our heart. We sing it with a deep longing, according to Your desire, to be built up into one building. Lord, we thank You for Your speaking in the past and we look unto You for further speaking. Lord, cover us, defeat Your enemy, glorify Yourself, and bless all the dear saints. Amen.</p><p>In this message we come to the sixth section of God&rsquo;s organic salvation&mdash;the secret of building.</p><h2 class="head1">I. SOMETHING CRITICAL</h2><p>The building is something which is critical to the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Highest Requirement</h2><p>To be built up with the fellow believers is the Lord&rsquo;s supreme and highest requirement to His faithful seekers according to one of the divine attributes of the Divine Trinity (John 17). Our oneness, to which we testify in the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, is according to the divine oneness, which is an attribute of the Divine Trinity.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Highest Virtue</h2><p>Being built up with the fellow partakers of the divine life is the highest virtue of the one who pursues after Christ in God&rsquo;s eternal economy. Building is the highest requirement, and being built up is the highest virtue.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Fallen Adamic Race<br />Not Able to Meet the Requirements</h2><p>Not one of the descendants of the fallen Adamic race has the capacity and ability to meet the high requirements of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Believers Being Qualified</h2><p>Only the regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed believers are qualified to fulfill the supreme requirements of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p></P><h2 class="head2">E. The God-men Having the Divine Capacity</h2><p>The God-men, who have the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine mind, and who participate in the divinity of God, have the divine capacity to carry out the divine requirements of the divine kingdom. God has qualified us by imparting His life into us, by sharing His nature with us, by making His mind our mind, and by transforming us with the element of His being. We praise Him for qualifying us and for giving us the divine capacity.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE SECRET OF BUILDING</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Prerequisites</h2><p>There are many prerequisites of the believers&rsquo; building up in the church, the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Realizing That the Lord Wants a Built Church</h2><p>The first prerequisite is to realize that the Lord loves and wants to have, according to the desire of His heart, His good pleasure, a built church, not scattered individual believers. If we are scattered individuals, we can have no part in the building up of the church. It is crucial for us to see this.</p>
