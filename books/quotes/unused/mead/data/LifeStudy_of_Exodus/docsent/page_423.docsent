   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S WAY OF SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s way of speaking through the breastplate with the Urim and the Thummim is the opposite of what we would expect.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God speaks not through the stones that are shining, but through stones that become dark.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that God speaks through negative situations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Normally the twelve stones in the breastplate were under the shining of the Urim.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suddenly a piece inscribed with a certain name would become dark.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This darkening of a particular stone was God s instant speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our natural concept would be that God s speaking through the breastplate came from the stones that were shining.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, He spoke through the stones that suddenly became dark.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul s Epistles and also the seven epistles of the Lord Jesus to the seven churches in Asia were all written according to this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They were written according to the negative situation of the churches, not according to the positive things found in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Take, for example, Paul s First Epistle to the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If there were no negative things found in the church in Corinth, I doubt that 1 Corinthians would have been written.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul wrote this Epistle according to his reading of the negative situation at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By considering that situation, he knew what to write.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But although his writing was based on the negative things, in this Epistle he ministered positive things the riches of Christ to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The problem among Christians today is that because there is so much darkness, there is no way for God to expose darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When everything is in darkness, it is difficult to point out a particular matter that is in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suppose in a room there are many rows of lights on the ceiling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If all the lights are shining, it will be easy to find one that becomes dark.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This illustrates how God spoke through the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The darkening of a particular stone was God s instant speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The situation of Christians today is abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead of light, there is darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a result, God has hardly any way to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order for the darkness to be made known, there must first be the shining of light.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If there is no light in a room, there is no way for darkness to be shown.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But when all the lights are shining, it immediately becomes apparent when a certain light becomes dark.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That darkness is an indicator that something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If in a certain church things that are wrong are easily found out, that church is normal.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if in a particular church it is not possible to find out what is wrong, this is an indication that the church there is in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When darkness prevails, it is not possible for negative matters to be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For this, light is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is exposed under the shining of the light is God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God speaks through things becoming negative.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This kind of negative situation is an indicator of the shortage of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By reading the negative situations in this way, we come to know God s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then in our locality we shall know what God wants us to do, and we should then follow His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>JUDGMENT AND SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The leading obtained through the breastplate always involves a judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that the Lord s speaking through the breastplate is through negative situations.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If this speaking were only through positive situations, there would be no need of judgment, for everything would be positive and justified.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But because the Lord s speaking is through negative situations, that speaking is a judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Apostle Paul was one who was truly shining.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Under the shining of Paul, the darkness was exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul wrote certain of his Epistles according to the darkness, according to the negative condition, of the saints in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because Paul saw certain dark areas in the church in Corinth, areas that were letters of God s judgment, Paul could write Corinthians as a book of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But along with all the judgment contained in this Epistle, there are many positive things: the riches of Christ ministered to the believers at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is God s way of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Both in the Old Testament and the New Testament, God s speaking is according to the negative situation, yet with the riches of Christ as the supply for His people.</S>
