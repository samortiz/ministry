Brother Nee once said that the highest level of spirituality for the New Testament believers is revealed in 1 Corinthians 7. He considered that Paul’s spirituality, as seen in this chapter, was on the highest peak, making Paul the most spiritual person. In 1 Corinthians 7, there are four crucial and very unique verses. In verse 10 Paul says, “But to the married I charge, not I but the Lord, A wife should not be separated from her husband.” The phrase “not I but the Lord” is similar to Galatians 2:20 where Paul says, “It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.” The charge in this verse is a serious one since it concerns God’s ordination of marriage, so Paul has the confidence to say, “not I but the Lord.” But in verse 12 Paul says, “But to the rest I say, not the Lord, If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she consents to dwell with him, let him not leave her.” In this verse Paul is bold to speak his own word to the Corinthians, yet what he spoke became a part of the divine revelation.<p>In verse 25 Paul says, “Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion as having received mercy of the Lord to be faithful.” Paul gives his opinion concerning the important matter of virgins based upon his having received mercy of the Lord to be faithful. Paul seemed to say, “Up to this point, I have not received a commandment of the Lord, but I give you my opinion, my feeling, concerning the matter of virgins. I admit that what I have to say is my opinion, but my opinion has been constituted with the Lord’s mercy, making me a faithful one.”<p>In verse 40 Paul says, “But she is more blessed if she so remains, according to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God.” The word “opinion” in this verse may not seem to be so pleasant or sweet. When the Lord spoke, He did not have to qualify His word by saying that His word was His opinion. He simply spoke because as the Lord and Master, He is the “Boss.” But Paul, as a servant of the Lord, must first qualify his word when he speaks his opinion. Many so-called spiritual men today do not speak in such a way. Rather, they usually speak by saying, “I assure you that this is the right way. What I say is of the Lord.” Paul, however, did not speak in this way. He simply said what he thought according to his opinion. Yet in giving his opinion, he was not alone; he had the Spirit of God with him.<h2 class=head1>PAUL’S EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST IN 1 CORINTHIANS 7</h2><p>Before he was saved, Saul of Tarsus persecuted the saints and devastated the church. After he was saved, he became a different person and began to speak for the Lord in the way revealed in the preceding verses. The Old Testament principle of speaking for God (prophesying) is, “Thus saith the Lord” (Isa. 10:24; 50:1; Jer. 2:2; Ezek. 2:4). But the New Testament principle of incarnation is, “I (the speaker) charge.” The speaker and the Lord are one. When Paul spoke, you can say not only that he spoke but also that the Lord spoke. Paul and the Lord were one in the principle of incarnation.
