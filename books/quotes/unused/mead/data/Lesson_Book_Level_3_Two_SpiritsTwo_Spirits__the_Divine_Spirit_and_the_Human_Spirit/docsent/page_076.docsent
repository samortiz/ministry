   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TRIPARTITE MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not only is God triune; man is tripartite.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We human beings are spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We were created in this way, so that we could be organically grafted to God, and so that the two spirits, His and ours, could be joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. Body and Soul and Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Man, as we have often pointed out, can be represented by three concentric circles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The outer ring corresponds to our physical body, the part of us that has substance and can be seen and touched.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Besides this part, we have a soul, represented by the middle ring.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the psychological part of us, enabling us to think, to love or hate, and to make decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The soul, then, consists of the mind, the emotion, and the will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The innermost ring, the deepest part of man, is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You may not be clear about the human spirit, but one part of it, the conscience, you are familiar with.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The conscience is deeper than the mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. The Spirit Making Man Unique</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such is the way man is made.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Animals may have a part that corresponds to the soul, but they lack this inner part, man's worshipping organ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There has never been a case in the whole history where a donkey, or a monkey, or a goat built a little sanctuary and set up an image to worship!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The record of mankind, in contrast, is replete with religions, idols, temples, and forms of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Cultured or barbarian, ancient or modern all peoples have a desire to worship a higher Being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What accounts for this difference between man and the animals?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What constrains man to worship?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is because man was made by God with a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>C. Regenerated with the Divine Seed</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is the distinction between an unregenerated human being and a believer?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Both have these three parts of body, soul, and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The believer, however, has a divine seed in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The seed of God abides in him!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This seed of the divine life and nature needs to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As it grows, it develops and spreads from the spirit into the soul, especially into the mind, the leading part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we allow this seed to grow without hindrance, it will spread even to our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE IMPARTING OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>TO EVERY PART OF OUR BEING</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 8:1-11 we see that, after having passed through the various processes, the Triune God became a life-giving Spirit, the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In verse 11 Paul clearly says that the One who raised Christ from among the dead gives life to our mortal bodies "through His Spirit Who indwells you."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This Spirit now dwells in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A. Our Spirit Being Life</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As the life-giving Spirit, the processed Triune God dwells in us to give us life in a threefold way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first aspect of this giving of life is found in verse 10: "And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This verse says that if Christ is in us, our spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ here is the very Triune God who has become the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because this Christ is in us, our spirit is life, for as the life-giving Spirit, Christ dwells in our spirit, and His indwelling makes our spirit life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the first aspect of the giving of life revealed in Romans 8.</S>
