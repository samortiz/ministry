   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When Mr.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Chapman first began his work for the Lord, those who gathered to hear him grew in number day by day, and a great building was erected at the place where he preached.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Mr. Moody heard of his fame, and took a train to where his church was, in order to listen to his preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Moody arrived, he sat quietly and listened.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After the meeting, Mr. Chapman recognized Moody and stepped down from the platform to greet him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He asked Moody for a frank comment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Mr. Moody said, "Brother, your work is a failure; it will not be successful, because there is something wrong with your life." When Mr. Chapman heard this, he was not happy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He thought, "Mr. Moody should not have criticized me this way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He does not have the authority to say this to me."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, he realized that Moody had pointed out something to him, and he knew that in at least one area he was not perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He realized that he was too attached to his wife and children; for two or three weeks, he felt very bad about it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the end, he told the Lord, "I cannot give up my love for my wife and children.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But I pray that You will make me able."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From that day on, he found the proper way to love his wife and children.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later he became very prevailing in his work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When someone asked him to give a testimony, he said, "If I can preach the gospel or deliver any message, and if there is any goodness in me at all, it comes from that one time of obedience that I had."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God will operate in us to the point that we become able.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Abraham ordered the old servant to find Rebekah for Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The old servant had to do his best to bring her to Canaan, but Abraham prepared the camels and needed items for the journey Gen 24:10, 61 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The one who was wounded by the robbers on the way to Jericho was carried by the Samaritan on his own beast and brought to the inn Luke 10:30, 33-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not have the strength to walk, because we have suffered the sin-wound; we will never be able to walk by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But God operates in us until we can will, work, and do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He operates in us both the willing and the working for whatever is according to His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we can remember this, everything will be well.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Mr. D.M. Panton in England once said that when God is in us, we can do everything God can do.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When one woman died, her epitaph said, "She has done what she could not otherwise have done!"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Daily we live a life which is seemingly impossible to live.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If it is ever possible for us to experience full salvation, and if our life can ever be clean and perfect, it is because of God's operation in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many people want to imitate Christ, but they never succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God must first work before we can work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to lay hold of this fact daily: it is God who operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not our working, but God who first works, and then we work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we see the lofty standard of the Bible, think we should meet it, and try to meet it, we will surely fail.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We ought to ask God to operate in us until we become willing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Mr. Panton once told a story.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A doctor charged a nurse to ask a patient to do one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The nurse told the patient accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the patient said that he could not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The nurse went back and told the doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The doctor went to find out why the patient could not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After he examined the patient, he said, "The problem with this person is not that he cannot do it or that he will not do it, but that he cannot make himself willing to do it."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The problem with us is that within we are not willing, while without we are not able.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Within, we are not willing to give up the world, and without, we are not able to give up the world.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But God can operate in us until we become willing and able to fulfill God's good pleasure, and until we actually carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God has worked in; therefore, we can work out.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because God has operated within us, we can work out whatever He has worked in. Our burden today is the way to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not a matter of waiting or praying, but a matter of working it out.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Everyone who has believed in the Lord has Christ living within him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"Do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>2 Cor 13:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There are two common mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One is to think that we should do good; we hope to do good and to have a spiritual living.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The other mistake is to think that since we are saved already, we do not have to move a finger anymore; there is no need to pray, read the Bible, or consecrate, because Christ will automatically make us zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The mistake of the first group is to try to do good by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The mistake of the second group is to think that there is no need to strive and pursue after a person is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Actually, if a saved person is not diligent, he will not have a spiritual living.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yet, if we do not believe in God, nothing will avail either.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must believe that God operates in us to will and to work, and that therefore we can pray, read the Bible, and testify.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The believing comes first, and the working out comes afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The kingdom is taken by violence; the violent ones seize it Matt 11:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Day by day we have to work out our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should not say that there is no way, because God has done everything.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Since we have received what we have received, we can surely make it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Let me give a few illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord taught the disciples, saying, "Take heed to yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>And if he sins against you seven times in a day and turns again to you seven times, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him" Luke 17:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Immediately after this word, the disciples prayed, saying, "Increase our faith" v. 5 . The disciples knew that they could not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is terrible enough for someone to sin once, twice, or three times.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If he sins seven times and repents seven times, this is too trying and difficult to endure.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, the disciples asked the Lord to increase their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>How did the Lord answer them?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>"If you have faith like a mustard seed, you would have said to this sycamine tree, Be uprooted and be planted in the sea; and it would have obeyed you" v. 6 . What does this have to do with forgiveness? When we have faith within, we can say to the hatred within our heart, "Hatred, go away." When we have such a faith, we can forgive others when they come to ask for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When we believe that God has done it, we can make it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Not only do we need faith before we can forgive others, we need faith before we can read the Bible, pray, or give up the world.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When we believe that God can make us do it, we can do it.</S>
