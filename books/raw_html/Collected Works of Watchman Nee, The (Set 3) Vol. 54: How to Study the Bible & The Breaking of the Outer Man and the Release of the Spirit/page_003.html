<h1 class="series">HOW TO STUDY THE BIBLE</h1><h1 class="msg">PREFACE TO THE CHINESE EDITION</h1><p>The Bible is the inspired word of God, and every child of God should spend time to study it.</p><p>The Bible shows us what God has done for us in the past and what He has said. It also shows us the ways that God has guided men in the past. In order to acquaint ourselves with the riches and vastness of God's provisions, we have to study the Bible.</p><p>God's present speaking is based on His past speaking. When God speaks to others through us, He does so through His established word. We must let the word of God dwell richly in our hearts before we can hear His speaking today and before He can make us ministers of His word.</p><p>The purpose in publishing these messages is to provide the readers with the prerequisites to the study of the Bible and to furnish them with some important tools in the study of the Word. It is our hope to render some help to those who have a desire to know the Scripture. May God bless this book and its readers. Taiwan Gospel Book Room</p>
