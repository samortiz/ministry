   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1 To Be the Beginning of God s New Creation</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ was the first One raised from the dead, becoming the firstfruits of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was typified by the firstfruits a sheaf of the firstfruits, including Christ with some of the dead Old Testament saints, was raised at the Lord s resurrection Matt 27:52-53 in Leviticus 23:10-11, which were offered to God on the day after the Sabbath, the day of resurrection Matt 28:1 .</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is the firstfruits of the new creation in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is confirmed by Colossians 1:18b: He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, Colossians 1:18a tells us that Christ is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since He, the Head of the Body, has been resurrected, we, the Body, also will be resurrected.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the entire universe there are only two men: the first man, Adam, including all his descendants, and the second man, Christ, comprising all His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We believers were included in the first man by birth and became a part of the second man by regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our believing has transferred us out of the first man into the second.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In regard to our being part of the first man, our origin is the earth and our nature is earthy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In regard to our being part of the second man, our origin is God and our nature is heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Out of heaven denotes both the divine origin and the heavenly nature of the second man, Christ.</S>
