[1]  CHAPTER NINE CONDEMNATION AND JUSTIFICATION IN ROMANS Scripture Reading: Rom 1:28; 2:15, 17; 3:21-25; 4:25; 5:10-11 THE CONTENT AND SECTIONS OF ROMANS
[2]  The Knowledge of God, the Conscience of Man, and the Law of God
[3]  God began to set forth Christ as the propitiation place at the time that darkness came over the whole land during His crucifixion, when He offered Himself as the unique sacrifice for sin, the reality of the sin offering Luke 23:44; Heb 9:26 .
[4]  Then, on the third day God resurrected Him; this resurrection was also a part of the process of God's setting forth of Christ.
[5]  This section of Romans says that on the one hand, we are justified through the redemption in Christ Jesus, that is, through faith in His blood 3:24-25 , and on the other hand, we are justified because of the resurrection of Christ 4:25 .
[6]  God placed Christ, set forth Christ, from the time that He shed His blood to the time that He ascended to sit at the right hand of God.
[7]  CHAPTER TEN SANCTIFICATION IN ROMANS Scripture Reading: Rom 5:12-21; 6:4-6, 11, 19; 7:1-6, 18, 20-25; 8:2, 4, 6
[8]  The third main section of Romans, the middle part, is the heart of this book.
[9]  We inherit sin and death from the first man, but we receive righteousness and life in Christ, the second man v. 17 . All the things in Adam were inherited by us, whereas all the benefits in Christ are received by us.
[10]  BONDAGE IN THE FLESH BY THE INDWELLING SIN The Law of God
[11]  Although it is somewhat easy for us to understand chapter six, it is not easy to understand chapter seven.
[12]  There is yet another law, the third law, which is the law of the mind.
[13]  Released from the Bondage of Sin and from the Obligation of the Law
[14]  THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE Freedom in the Spirit by the Highest and Strongest Law
[15]  In Romans 8 there is a wonderful term: the law of the Spirit of life v. 2 . In this phrase three things are composed together: law, Spirit, and life.
[16]  CHAPTER ELEVEN SANCTIFICATION, GLORIFICATION, SELECTION, AND THE BODY LIFE IN ROMANS Scripture Reading: Rom 8:6, 4, 14, 28-30, 32, 35, 38-39; 9:16; 11:5; 12:1-2, 11, 4-5 SANCTIFICATION Three Parties with Three Wills, Three Lives, and Three Laws
[17]  As we saw in the previous chapter, Romans 7 and 8 speak of three lives and four laws.
[18]  The Secret of Setting Our Mind on the Spirit
[19]  Walking according to the Spirit by the Inner Anointing
[20]  Romans 8:4 tells us to walk according to the spirit.
[21]  The last key word in Romans 8 is glorified v. 30 . We are currently in the process of conformation, but our aim is that one day when He returns He will glorify us; He will bring us into glory.
[22]  Being Burning in Spirit for Our Function in the Church Life
[23]  In addition, our spirit must be burning v. 11 . Here we have the body, the soul, and the spirit.
[24]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE MAIN PRINCIPLES IN 1 CORINTHIANS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:2, 9, 18, 22-24, 30; 2:2, 14-15; 3:1, 3
[25]  As we saw in the previous chapters, the first five books of the New Testament are a history of the universal man, Christ with the church.
[26]  Following this sketch, 1 Corinthians presents cases and illustrations to show us that in this universal man there are two matters which are basically and vitally important: Christ and Christ crucified, or we may say, Christ and the cross.
[27]  Christ crucified refers not only to Christ Himself but Christ with His cross.
[28]  Following Romans, therefore, 1 Corinthians gives us a lengthy illustration to show us how much we need to realize Christ as everything and to experience the cross of Christ in our daily walk, in our church service, and in everything.
[29]  Verse 24 says of Christ crucified, "But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God."
[30]  The verses that we have mentioned are the key verses of the entire book of 1 Corinthians.
[31]  On the positive side, they show us how we must realize Christ as everything in our daily walk and Christian service, and on the negative side, they show us that the cross is the only way to deal with all things other than Christ Himself.
[32]  Second, they reveal that we may have the so-called gifts yet still be infants in Christ, not only childish but even fleshly in our Christian life.
[33]  However, they may not know that Christ is the power, Christ is the wisdom, Christ is the energy, Christ is the strength, and Christ is the knowledge.
[34]  In order to realize the real meaning of sanctification, we must know Christ, and we must know how to serve Christ, how to enjoy Christ, how to apply Christ, and how to experience Christ.
[35]  The enjoyment of Christ is something on the positive side, while the cross is on the negative side to deal with all the things that are not Christ Himself.
[36]  The third main principle in 1 Corinthians is that a believer can be spiritual, soulish, or fleshly, even fleshy.
[37]  Simply speaking, a spiritual person is one who lives and walks by his spirit, whose soul is always subdued by the spirit, and whose body, the flesh, is always under the control of the strong will of his renewed soul.
[38]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE PRINCIPLES AND CASES IN 1 CORINTHIANS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:2, 9, 23-24, 30, 7; 3:1-3; 2:14-15; 1:12-13; 5:1; 6:7; 7:32; 9:1, 4-5; 10:17, 23; 11:3, 29; 12:12-13; 15:3-4, 54; 16:1-2; 5:7; 10:3-4; 9:24; 3:12, 15, 9
[39]  If we do not have a vision from God that Christ is everything, it is very difficult to understand what the real meaning of the Christian walk and church life are.
[40]  All things, such as forms, knowledge, gifts, and functions, are to help us realize Christ, know Christ, partake of Christ, apply Christ, and experience Christ.
[41]  Christ is both theirs and ours 1:2 , and we have been called into the fellowship, that is, the participation, of Christ v. 9 . Moreover, God has made Christ wisdom to us, including righteousness for our past, sanctification for the present, and redemption for the future v. 30 . In God's salvation, purpose, and plan Christ is everything to us as power and wisdom v. 24 . Now we must learn to know Him in such a way.
[42]  HAVING KNOWLEDGE AND GIFTS BUT BEING INFANTS IN CHRIST
[43]  The second principle in this book is that no matter how many gifts and how much knowledge we may have received, we are still infants and fleshly if we do not know how to experience Christ with His cross v. 7; 3:1-3 . This is a serious matter, which is made very clear in this book.
[44]  However, in this book the apostle Paul tells us clearly that regardless of how much knowledge and how many gifts we have, even if we do not lack in any gift and have all knowledge, we are fleshly and infants in Christ if we do not realize how to experience Christ and His cross.
[45]  THE CASES IN 1 CORINTHIANS The Problem of Divisions
[46]  With these three main principles in view, we can now consider each of the cases.
[47]  If we know Christ, apply Christ, and experience Christ, we will realize that He is one.
[48]  The fourth case dealt with by this Epistle is the abuse of freedom of foods and in the body vv.
[49]  In dealing with this problem, Paul tells the Corinthians that our bodies are members of Christ v. 15 , we are one spirit with the Lord v. 17 , and our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit v. 19 . The Problem of Marriage Life
[50]  Verse 3 says, "But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ."
[51]  Even the spiritual gifts can be a problem to the Body of Christ.
[52]  SOME SECONDARY PRINCIPLES A Picture of the Real Condition of the Believers
[53]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE MINISTRY AND THE MINISTERS IN 2 CORINTHIANS Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:3, 6, 17-18; 4:7, 10-11, 16; 6:4-10; 11:23-29; 12:7-10; 13:14 A LIVING MINISTRY TO WRITE LIVING LETTERS OF CHRIST
[54]  Second Corinthians 3:3 says, "Since you are being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone but in tablets of hearts of flesh."
[55]  This word indicates that something of Christ has been wrought into people to make them living letters of Christ.
[56]  Rather, it must be by something of Christ that has been wrought into us to make us not only the ministers of Christ but also the ministry of Christ.
[57]  When we minister, we not only pass on the knowledge about Christ to others, but we minister Christ Himself through the word into them.
[58]  A Personal Testimony of Turning from the Letter to Life
[59]  In my own Christian life I have had this experience.
[60]  BEHOLDING AND REFLECTING TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO THE IMAGE OF CHRIST
[61]  Verses 17 and 18 of chapter three say, "And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
[62]  But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."
[63]  THE DECAYING OF THE OUTER MAN AND THE RENEWING OF THE INNER MAN
[64]  Verse 7 of chapter four says, "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels."
[65]  No doubt, we are the earthen vessels, and the treasure within us is Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God.
[66]  The Work of the Ministry Being to Turn Our Soul from the Body to the Spirit
[67]  The soul of an unbeliever is one hundred percent on the side of his body.
[68]  Becoming the Ministers of Christ through Sufferings and the Experience of Grace
[69]  The ministers of the new covenant are described in verses 4 through 10, which say, "But in everything we commend ourselves as ministers of God, in much endurance, in afflicTions, in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings; in pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in a holy spirit, in unfeigned love, in the word of truth, in the power of God; through the weapons of righteousness on the right and on the left, through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers and yet true; as unknown and yet well known; as dying and yet behold we live; as being disciplined and yet not being put to death; as made sorrowful yet always rejoicing; as poor yet enriching many; as having nothing and yet possessing all things."
[70]  When we have the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, we enjoy the grace of Christ, and when we enjoy the grace of Christ, we have the love of God.
[71]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN WALKING BY THE SPIRIT IN GALATIANS Scripture Reading: Gal 3:16, 29; 5:16-17, 22, 25
[72]  In the order and the arrangement of the books of the New Testament, there is the sovereignty of the Lord.
[73]  The two Epistles to the Corinthians show us that the Christian walk and the church life are a matter not of gifts or knowledge but of Christ being wrought into us by the working of the cross.
[74]  Galatians 3:24 says that the law is our child-conductor unto Christ.
[75]  In the same way, before we came to Christ, there was the need of the law to conduct us, to protect us, to keep us from going astray, and to bring us to Christ.
[76]  God's intention is that we enjoy Christ, have Christ, experience Christ, and live out Christ by and in the Spirit.
[77]  When we are in the Spirit, we have Christ as our life, we enjoy Christ as everything, we experience Christ, and we live out Christ.
[78]  The central thought of the first chapter of Galatians is the contrast between religion and Christ.
[79]  However, one day God came in and revealed not a religion, a system, a set of forms, teachings, or practices but a person in him v. 16 . Although Paul was zealous for his forefathers' religion and was one hundred percent for it, God revealed Christ in him.
[80]  Galatians 5 tells us that since Christ has set us free from the law and has made us one with Him, we should not go back to the law v. 1 . If we return to the law, then Christ will profit us nothing, and we will be brought to nought, separated from Christ vv.
[81]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH IN EPHESIANS Scripture Reading: Eph 1:17; 3:11; 1:9-10; 3:2, 9; 4:4-6; 3:14-19; 1:22b-23; 2:15-16; 4:22-24; 5:25, 32; 2:20-22
[82]  Ephesians is the most complete book revealing the church, the Body of the universal man.
[83]  The best way to realize the sketch of Ephesians is to identify its main points.
[84]  Verse 3 of chapter one says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ."
[85]  In chapter three Paul says, "For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father, of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God" vv.
[86]  The Church as the Body of Christ in the Triune God
[87]  It is in this Triune God that we are all regenerated, transformed, composed, and built up as a Body for Christ with humanity mingled with divinity.
[88]  The New Man with Christ as Life and the Body as His Fullness
[89]  Now we may see some of the details of the different aspects of the church.
[90]  The church is also the dwelling place of God.
[91]  Just as our body is the place in which we exist, our habitation, so the church is the Body of Christ to contain Christ and to express Him.
[92]  As we have seen, the church as the new man is a matter of life, the church as the Body of Christ is a matter of expression, and the church as the bride of Christ is a counterpart.
[93]  Paul's first prayer is for us to have a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Christ, while his second prayer is that our inner man would be strengthened with power that we may experience Christ in a full way, that Christ may make His home in us, that we may be filled unto all the fullness of the Triune God.
[94]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN CRUCIAL POINTS CONCERNING THE CHURCH IN EPHESIANS Scripture Reading: Eph 2:1-6; 4:24; 5:22 6:9; 6:10-20; 1:3, 17; 2:22; 3:16; 4:23; 5:18 THE MATERIALS FOR THE CHURCH
[95]  In the previous chapter we saw the first three main points in Ephesians.
[96]  Second, God raised us up not only from the grave but from the earth to the heavens.
[97]  This wonderful Spirit transmits all that Christ is, all that Christ has done, and all that God has accomplished in Christ into us.
[98]  Our walk must be a walk that expresses Christ, exalts Christ, testifies Christ, ministers Christ, releases Christ, and shares Christ with others.
[99]  THE CHURCH AS THE WARRIOR FOR DEFEATING GOD'S ENEMY
[100]  The seventh main point revealed in Ephesians is the enemy of God, Satan, the devil, who frustrates and damages God's purpose 2:2; 6:11-12 .
[101]  The more we experience Christ, the more we have the armor to cover and protect us to fight the spiritual warfare in Christ as the power and by Christ as the armor.
[102]  CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST IN PHILIPPIANS Scripture Reading: Phil 1:19-21; 2:5-8, 15, 17; 3:7-11, 14; 4:12-13
[103]  The subject of the book of Philippians is the experience of Christ in every kind of circumstance.
[104]  No other book deals as specifically with the experience of Christ as this one, telling us that Christ must be our experience regardless of our circumstances and difficulties.
[105]  This means that we are living here to express Christ, exalt Christ, and honor Christ, and our life, living, and being are to follow Christ as our purpose.
[106]  Our purpose is to magnify Christ, express Christ, glorify Christ, exalt Christ, and honor Christ.
[107]  The Bountiful Supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
[108]  Verse 19 of chapter one is another verse which is very precious yet very much neglected by Christians today.
[109]  This verse speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[110]  By the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ we can live Christ to magnify Him, and we can say, "For to me, to live is Christ."
[111]  TAKING CHRIST AS THE PATTERN By Lowering Our Position and Standard
[112]  Philippians 2 is the second section, showing us Christ as our pattern, our living example.
[113]  It is not wrong to grasp our position and say that it is something that God has given us to enjoy, but if we do this, we are not taking Christ as our person and pattern.
[114]  Verse 15 says, "That you may be blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as luminaries in the world."
[115]  The first time it refers to the resurrection power by which we are conformed to the death of Christ v. 10 . Then verse 11 says, "If perhaps I may attain to the out-resurrection from the dead." Many translations of this verse are not adequate; the translators neglected the first part of the Greek word for resurrection because they did not have the proper light.
[116]  If Christ were not the Spirit, He could not be our power within.
[117]  CHAPTER NINETEEN CHRIST AS EVERYTHING IN COLOSSIANS 1 Scripture Reading: Col 1:9; 4:12; 2:2; 1:15-18; 2:9, 16-17; 1:12; 3:4
[118]  Although this is a short book of only four chapters, there are many main points that we need to see.
[119]  The King James Version renders the last part of 2:2 as "the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ."
[120]  CHRIST AS EVERYTHING As the Creator, the Firstborn of Creation, the Firstborn from the Dead, and the Head of the Body
[121]  The fourth main point in Colossians is that Christ has the first place, the preeminence, in all things 1:18 .
[122]  The last main point concerns Christ being everything to us.
[123]  Christ is not only everything, but everything to us.
[124]  CHAPTER TWENTY CHRIST AS EVERYTHING IN COLOSSIANS 2 Scripture Reading: Col 2:6-8; 1:9-11; 2:11-12; 3:1, 3, 9-11; 1:27; 2:16-17, 19 RECEIVING CHRIST
[125]  The next main point is that we receive Christ.
[126]  We must realize that when we were regenerated, we received Christ as our life and our everything, so Christ has become the sphere, the realm, and the means for us to live on the earth and walk in the presence of God.
[127]  Our Need for a Detailed Experience of Christ in Our Daily Life
[128]  According to Colossians, the will of God is to make Christ everything to us, to give us Christ as our portion, our life, and our everything.
[129]  By the mercy and grace of God we have received Christ as the all-inclusive One.
[130]  Colossians 1:10 says, "To walk worthily of the Lord to please Him in all things, bearing fruit in every good work and growing by the full knowledge of God."
[131]  To walk worthily of the Lord and grow by the full knowledge of God is to live and walk according to spiritual wisdom and understanding.
[132]  After we receive the revelation and vision concerning Christ, we have to walk according to it.
[133]  The way for Christ to increase in us is by our receiving spiritual wisdom, understanding, and revelation concerning Christ and by walking according to the spiritual revelation of Christ that we have received.
[134]  Although we have been rooted in Christ, the measure of Christ within us may be small; we may not have an adequate measure of Christ.
[135]  The next main point in Colossians is our identification with Christ.
[136]  We are identified with Christ in four things in His death, in His burial, in His resurrection, and in His ascension 2:11-12; 3:1, 3 .
[137]  We died with Christ, we were buried with Him, we were raised with Him, and we ascended with Him.
[138]  CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE FAITH, LOVE, AND HOPE IN 1 AND 2 THESSALONIANS Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 1:10; 2:19-20; 3:13; 4:17-18; 5:23; 2 Thes 2:1-8; 1 Thes 1:3; 2 Thes 1:3; 1 Tim 1:5; 2 Pet 1:1, 3-7
[139]  No other book of the sixty-six books of the Bible is composed in the way that 1 Thessalonians is.
[140]  The last verse in chapter three says, "So that He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints" v. 13 . Chapter four ends clearly with the subject of the Lord's coming: "Then we who are living, who are left remaining, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we will be always with the Lord.
[141]  THE WORK OF FAITH, LABOR OF LOVE, AND ENDURANCE OF HOPE
[142]  In the first Epistle to the Thessalonians there are three words which are very important faith, love, and hope.
[143]  Verse 3 of chapter one says, "Remembering unceasingly your work of faith and labor of love and endurance of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father."
[144]  ENCOURAGED BY THE COMING OF CHRIST WHILE WORKING IN A FAITHFUL WAY
[145]  WALKING, WORKING, AND LIVING IN THE LIGHT OF THE LORD'S COMING
[146]  The main emphasis of the two books to the Thessalonians is that the Christian walk and living is one of three dimensions faith, love, and hope.
[147]  CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE IN 1 AND 2 TIMOTHY Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 3:15-16; 4:7-8; 2 Tim 2:2; 1 Tim 1:5, 19; 4:2; 1:12; 6:12; 2 Tim 4:1, 18, 7-8; 1 Tim 1:14; 2 Tim 4:22
[148]  They tell us how we were sinners condemned before God, how we were justified and saved, how originally we were dead but were regenerated and made alive, how we received Christ into us as our life, and how this life has a consummation.
[149]  The full and complete instructions for practicing the church life are in these four books.
[150]  They tell us how to set up the government of the church, how to appoint and establish the elders, how to arrange the church service as the responsibility of the deacons, and how to learn many things by exercise and teach them to others 1 Tim 3:1-13, 4:6-16; 2 Tim 2:2 .
[151]  TEACHING THOSE WHO WILL BE COMPETENT TO TEACH OTHERS
[152]  Second Timothy 2:2 says, "And the things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also."
[153]  First Timothy 1:12 says, "I give thanks to Him who empowers me, Christ Jesus our Lord."
[154]  CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE IN TITUS AND PHILEMON Scripture Reading: Titus 2:14; Philem.
[155]  1-25 THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE IN TITUS A Confirmation of 1 and 2 Timothy
[156]  By the Lord's sovereignty, the short book of Philemon comes at the end of the section on the practice of the church life.
[157]  A SUMMARY OF THE REMAINING BOOKS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT The Eight Supplementary Books
[158]  As we have seen, the thirteen books from Romans to Philemon are the definition of the Body of Christ.
[159]  The three Epistles of John are a supplement concerning the fellowship in the divine family, a point which was not thoroughly covered in the definition of the Body of Christ given in the first thirteen Epistles.
[160]  What we have seen thus far of a general sketch of the New Testament should be considered as a training.
[161]  Lastly, you may stress certain matters, but do not force them on others.
