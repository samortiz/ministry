<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWELVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A FELLOWSHIP</H1><P>Date:December 30, 1947<br>Place:Chanticleer Restaurant, Hong Kong<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GRACE BEING THE UNIQUE REALITY</H2><P>The Lord Jesus is the grace. John 1:17 says, "Grace and reality came through Jesus Christ." This chapter shows us that reality is something that can be seen, and grace is something that can be received. Grace is the unique reality in the universe. Other than grace, nothing is real. Even the heaven and the earth will pass away one day. This is why we say that the earth and everything that can be seen will not last forever, and they are therefore not real.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED FOR THE LIFE WITHIN TO GROW</H2><P>The identifying death mentioned in Romans 6 can only be experienced and lived out in the Holy Spirit in chapter eight. Hence, it is useless to "reckon" alone. In the same way, the sin in Romans 5 is lived out in chapter seven. When a baby is born, sin is there already. But it is only when he grows up that sin is manifested. The same principle applies to God's life within us. When we are regenerated, we have life already. But this life needs to grow before its fullness is expressed.</P><P>Between 1938 and 1942, I saw this truth. In 1943, I was put into prison. One month after I came out of the prison, I became sick, and I was in bed for a whole year. During this period of time, this truth appeared clearer and clearer to me.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD'S DEATH AND HIS LIFE</H2><P>Ephesians 1 and 2 cannot be separated from each other. In fact, the end of chapter one is joined to the beginning of chapter two. Chapter two should not begin with a capital letter.</P><P>The death of the Lord Jesus contains two elements: death and life. The two combined together also give life. The Lord gives life to us out of His death. This can be likened to some medicine that kills germs, on one hand, and imparts life, on the other hand. Everything mentioned after chapter two confirms these two facts, that is, the fact of the Lord's death and the fact of His life. To sin, the world, human relationships, and the flesh, we are dead; whereas to God, we are living.</P>
