   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not to Work on the First Day</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and the Seventh Day but to Eat</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Exodus 12:16 says, And in the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This verse says that on the first and last days of the feast of unleavened bread no manner of work was to be done.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This signifies that in the enjoyment of God s salvation, there is no place for our work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must learn to stop our doing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must cease from every kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do not resolve to be a loving husband, a submissive wife, or a child who honors his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All this is human work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The only thing we are permitted to do is eat.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that as we partake of God s salvation, there is room only for enjoyment, not for working.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not try to do anything just eat and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The situation of today s Christianity is just the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead of eating, there is working.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sermon upon sermon is given charging people to engage in certain kinds of work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This contradicts the principle of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God s salvation does not allow us to do any work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Due to our serpentine nature, immediately after we were saved or revived, we made up our mind to do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some resolved not to lose their temper; others decided to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the Lord makes no allowance for this kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In God s salvation we are only allowed to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In contrast to the writings of the religions of man, the Bible charges God s people concerning the first and last days of the feast to do nothing except eat.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the children of Israel worked on these days, they would have broken the principle of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Salvation is for our enjoyment; it does not require our work or our doing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, even many zealous Christians are cut off from spiritual fellowship simply because they are engaged in so much work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To add human labor to God s salvation is to insult God and to cut ourselves off from fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We find it difficult to stop working and to keep eating.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead of eating without working, our habit is to work without eating.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some may complain of too much spiritual eating.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They may even say that they are bored with such eating.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Talk like this circulated among us some time ago.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This kind of word comes from the Devil, the enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As soon as a word is spoken against eating the Lord, it is followed by a suggestion that we work or engage in a certain activity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What a devilish contradiction of the principle of God s salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I repeat, God s salvation requires that we stop our working and do nothing except eat.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is even possible for prayer to become a work that God forbids.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some of the saints may decide to spend more time in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In such a case, their prayer may become a work that breaks the principle of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To one who resolves to pray in this way, I would say, Do not allow prayer to become a work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead of praying in a natural way, you must eat the unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I was young, I engaged in much work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I read books about how to be holy, how to pray, and how to overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These books encouraged me to work and to do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then one day I saw the light that God does not want us to work He wants us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we would feast unto Him, we must stop our doing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Suppose a brother invites you to his home for a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After you arrive, however, you spend a great deal of time working for him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You mow the lawn, trim the trees, and wash the windows.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But all your work is offensive to this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What he desires is that you sit down at the table and feast with him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The more you feast, the happier he will be.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all must learn to drop our natural doing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, this is not easy for us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As we drop our doing, we need to maintain our eating.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But if we do not eat, we should not stop working.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Most Christians work without eating, but we must learn to eat without doing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Let us drop our doing, but continue with our eating.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>F. Not to Be Eaten by Strangers</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>or Hired Servants</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Exodus 12:43 says, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Verse 45 goes on to say, A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>These verses indicate that strangers and hired servants were not permitted to eat the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the Old Testament strangers represent two categories of people: the unbelievers and the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may readily agree that the unbelievers are strangers, but we may not agree that our natural man is also a stranger who is not allowed to partake of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Actually, our natural man is no different from an unbeliever, for our natural life is always quick to go along with the way of an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hence, the natural man and the unbelievers are of the same family.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Notice that in Exodus 12 the natural man is the stranger linked to the hired servants.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A hired servant is one who serves for wages, for compensation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The natural man always works for God in order to receive compensation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is commonplace in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>For the most part, Christianity has become a religion in which strangers are hired to work for wages.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Although a hired servant may receive wages, with him there is no grace, faith, or enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we try to enjoy the Passover according to the principle of a hired servant, we shall find that we have no position to partake of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Those who work as hired servants have the attitude that they labor and God pays them their wages.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But in Romans Paul indicates that we are not to work for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Romans 4:4 and 5 say, Now to the one who works, the reward is not reckoned according to grace, but according to debt.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But to the one who works not, but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Speaking of the selection of grace, Paul declares in Romans 11:6, But if by grace, it is no longer out of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the words of Galatians 4:7, we who believe in Christ are no longer servants; we are sons.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Children simply enjoy the family life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They do not labor as hired servants in order to share in this enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Our enjoyment of God s salvation is according to the principle of free grace, not according to the principle of a hired servant who works for recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>As far as salvation is concerned, our labor means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God allows us to enjoy the Passover not as wages, but only as a free gift of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is clear that the natural man cannot enjoy Christ as the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If a person is still in the natural man, he has not come to the month Abib, which means sprouting or budding.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This means that he has not experienced a new beginning in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>With such a one there is no sprouting of the divine life through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>To have a new beginning is to no longer be a stranger, to no longer be a natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>On the contrary, it is to be regenerated and to become a new creation in Christ 2 Cor 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Do not partake of the Passover as a natural man or as a hired servant, and do not have the attitude that you work for God and that He pays you.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We do not receive God s salvation because of our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If we remain in the natural man or regard ourselves as hired servants who work for recompense, we have no right to partake of the Passover.</S>
