<h2 class="head2">Being Broad in Receiving Others</h2>
<p>A person who has been dealt with and broken is also wise. Solomon was a wise man: &ldquo;God gave Solomon wisdom and very much understanding and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the seashore. And Solomon&rsquo;s wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the children of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt. For he became wiser than all men&rdquo; (1 Kings 4:29-31). This means that his wisdom could not be matched by the wisdom of any person on earth; his wisdom was God-given. This wisdom was not for Solomon to be crafty and sly but for him to have largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the seashore. The sand is the limit, the boundary, of the sea; hence, the sand is greater than the sea. The sand on the seashore is a picture of the largeness of Solomon&rsquo;s heart. This is to have wisdom. A person who has been broken and dealt with by God has a large and broad heart. He can accept any suggestion and any kind of person.</p>
<p>Some people may worry that it is dangerous to have such a broad heart. We must remember that regarding God&rsquo;s building, a broken person will never depart from the pattern shown in the mountain but rather will insist on taking the pattern as his standard (cf. Exo. 25:40; Heb. 8:5). He would never abandon the principles in the Bible but would insist on keeping them. He can accept any suggestion that does not oppose the principles in the Bible or affect God&rsquo;s testimony.</p>
<p>The Bible does not tell us when we should preach the gospel or study the Bible or whether we should use a dry or wet cloth to clean the benches, because such things do not affect the pattern shown in the mountain. Anything that is related to God&rsquo;s testimony has a standard, the pattern shown in the mountain. If the suggestion of a brother or sister is contrary to the clear teaching in the Bible, the manifested revelation of God, or the pattern shown in the mountain, we should not accept it. For example, a brother may suggest that we rent the meeting hall to a social club on the days that we do not have meetings in order to collect some rent every month. We should stand against such a proposal for the sake of guarding the testimony of God.</p>
<p>Regrettably, the atmosphere of disharmony among us has mainly been due to saints insisting on differing views and ideas. This proves that we are not broken and have not been dealt with enough and that we are narrow and our heart is small. As a result, we are not willing to accept the views of others. A person who has been broken does not have opinions, is wise, and has a large and broad heart. Hence, he can accept any suggestion and any kind of person as long as it does not involve God&rsquo;s glory or affect His testimony. Only such a person can be proper material for the building. When such material is being built up, the sound of hammers, axes, or iron tools will not be heard. But this is not our situation. Sometimes when the brothers are serving together, the sound of different tools is heard in their coordination, because each has a different opinion; that is, there is the sound that comes from the lack of breaking and dealing, because the materials being used for the building have not been dealt with.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DEALT WITH IN OUR DAILY LIVING</h2>
<p>Some people say that the situation described in 1 Kings 6 is a picture of the situation at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s return. They say that it is not time for the building because the Lord has not returned. They also say that we are stones that are still in the process of being dealt with by God. In their view, when all the believers have been fully dealt with, the Lord Jesus will return to build us together, and then the sound of a hammer or an ax will not be heard, because we will no longer need to be dealt with. Such speaking is not according to the teaching in the New Testament. The New Testament says that we need to be built up, that is, to be joined and knit together (Eph. 4:16). The preparation of the stones at the quarry in 1 Kings 6:7 refers to our being dealt with by God in our daily living. If we are dealt with by God in our daily living, there will not be any sound when we come together as the church. Conversely, if we do not accept God&rsquo;s dealing in our daily living, we will be loose and full of opinions. As a result, it will be inevitable for there to be sounds when we are together.</p>
<p>God desires that we experience dealings in our daily living. For many their family life is a &ldquo;quarry.&rdquo; If we can accept the breaking in our family and not be stubborn, we will not need further dealings, and there will be no sound when we are being built up in the church. A sister whose head is properly covered and has a quiet demeanor in the meetings may be above her husband at home. She may have the last word in every situation, and she may be like a tigress toward her maids. This condition indicates that she has not passed through God&rsquo;s breaking in her &ldquo;quarry.&rdquo; Hence, when she coordinates with others in the church, there are still many sounds. She may utter wonderful prayers in the prayer meeting and give excellent praise in the table meeting, but her stubborn attitude will come forth as soon as she discusses matters with the brothers in the service meetings. The saints who have not been chiseled and cut in their daily living will maintain the sound of their &ldquo;tools,&rdquo; their opinions, when it is time for the building.</p>
