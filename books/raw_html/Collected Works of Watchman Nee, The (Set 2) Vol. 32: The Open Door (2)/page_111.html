<h1 class="title">ISSUE NO. 19</h1><h2 class="head4">The Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 323, Shanghai, September 1939</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">Work in Shu-Fu, Szechuan Province</h2><p>On May 31 we were led of the Lord to leave Chungking by boat, and we arrived safely in Shu-Fu on June 3. After arriving, we spent a few evenings praying in one accord with the brothers and sisters. Then we conducted three edification meetings in the evenings. On the eleventh of this month (a Lord's Day) in the afternoon, we had the first Lord's table meeting in Shu-Fu. There were four brothers and four sisters. On the twelfth to the seventeenth of this month, we preached the gospel every evening at a building in the park, and we had a large audience. After the gospel meetings, we had three nights of special meetings for the new believers. The Lord willing, we will conduct a baptism in the near future. After the work concludes here, we intend to make a visit to Ch'eng-tu. The Lord has put brothers and sisters in a few places in Szechuan already (such as O-Mei-Shan, Rong-Chang, Yung-Chuan, Shin-Jin, and Nan-Bu). The Lord willing, we desire very much to go and visit them and to testify for the Lord.</p><p>Passing through the provinces of Kweichow and Szechuan this time, we were impressed by the vastness of the harvest and the scarcity of workers who are of the same mind. The testimonies of the lampstand are as rare as morning stars, and the situation in Kweichow is particularly desolate. While we passed through Jun-Yi (Kweichow), we met a Western missionary who was very sympathetic toward the book Rethinking Our Work. He had ordered a few copies and had given them to others. We spent some time to talk and pray with him. He prayed, "Lord, many of Your servants have passed through Kweichow from Yunnan to Szechuan or from Szechuan to Yunnan but have neglected Kweichow. May You send workers to Kweichow." These words show the need of Kweichow. Through the recent scattering of the saints, many doors to the work have opened to the workers. We pray that the Lord would send many workers to come and meet this need. As for me (Stephen Kaung), through the Lord's sovereign arrangement, I intend to move my family to Shu-Fu temporarily. It is an obvious fact that there is a great need in Szechuan and that the present time is critical and urgent. I am weak and do not feel adequate to meet this urgent need. I can only hope to stand in Szechuan while waiting expectantly for more workers to come. Greetings to all the workers in Shanghai.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />K.H.Weigh and Stephen Kaung<br />June 22</p><p>(According to correspondence from Shu-Fu on August 5, Brothers Weigh and Kaung left Shu-Fu for Ch'eng-tu on July 14. According to correspondence from Ch'eng-tu on August 14, they remained in Ch'eng-tu for about a month. According to correspondence from K'un-ming on August 21, Brother Weigh arrived in K'un-ming with Brother Chang Hwei-zhi on August 13.)</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Hsu Dah-wei</h2><p>I have been with Brother Chang ever since I met him in Hu-Shan on February 24. However, at a certain point, he felt ill-disposed to continue with the work during May in Jiang-Nan, so he went alone to Fan-Shan for a rest. I then went with Brother Chen Chin-fa to Yien-Ting and Sha-Di, and then with Brother Hwang Li-chuen to Lu-Pu, Ya-Yao-Tou, and Luh-Bien. After working there I went to Fan-Shan at the beginning of July to join Brother Chang again.</p><p>The Lord willing, I intend to take a little rest and wait on the Lord with Brother Chang. After summer, if the sea route from Wenchow to Shanghai is clear, I hope to return to Shanghai. There is much work waiting for us in many places, but the question is whether or not the workers themselves have food to distribute, and whether they can distribute it in season. We have accepted the doctrine of the cross for a long time. But the knowledge of Christ in the Spirit and the knowledge of the power of His resurrection and of our conformity to His death and our suffering with Him are life-long lessons. I feel that we truly need the Lord's mercy.</p><p>Hsu Dah-wei<br />August 8</p>
