 <h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Twenty-three</h2>
<h1 class="title">THE ONE WHO REDEEMS US FROM SIN&mdash;<br />
CHRIST</h2>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Isa. 53:6; 1 Pet. 2:24; Heb. 9:12</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Man needs redemption
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man is sinful.</li>
	<li>Man, being sinful, has neither the right nor the power to redeem himself from sin.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ is man&rsquo;s Redeemer
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is God, coming to redeem us. Only He could and would redeem man from sin.</li>
	<li>Christ redeemed man from sin through His death on the cross. The penalty He paid on the cross accomplished redemption on man&rsquo;s behalf.</li>
	<li>Christ died on the cross, bearing our sins in His own body.</li>
	<li>The redemptive work of Christ on the cross is complete and eternal.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Twenty-four</h2>
<h1 class="title">THE ONE WHO FORGIVES SIN&mdash;GOD</h2>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: 1 John 1:9</h2>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The One who forgives sin
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The One who condemns sin is the One who forgives sin. Only He who is qualified to condemn is qualified to forgive.</li>
	<li>Thus, only God can forgive our sins.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The basis of God&rsquo;s forgiveness
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The forgiveness of God is based upon Christ&rsquo;s redemption and is executed through His righteousness.</li>
	<li>The forgiveness of God is also based upon His faithfulness and is according to His word. Not only has God sent Christ to accomplish the work of redemption for us, He also gives us His word to proclaim the fact of redemption. If we believe in His proclamation, He has to forgive us because of His faithfulness and because of His word.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The completeness of God&rsquo;s forgiveness<br />
<span class="normal">Because Christ&rsquo;s redemption is complete and eternal, God&rsquo;s forgiveness is also complete and eternal.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Twenty-five</h2>
<h1 class="title">THE ONE WHO IS FREED FROM SIN&mdash;<br />
THE BELIEVER</h2>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Acts 10:43; 26:18; Rom. 6:7; 8:1-2</h2>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>How can man be freed from sin?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ has accomplished redemption and God has promised forgiveness.</li>
	<li>So now, if a man believes, he can be freed from sin.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To be freed from sin has two meanings
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To be freed from sin means to be freed from sinful acts. This also means that the history of sins is erased and the judgment on sins is removed.</li>
	<li>To be freed from sin means to be freed from the nature of sin. This is because the power of sin is broken and the pains of sin are over.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Once a man believes and is freed from sin, he is immediately justified</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Twenty-six</h2>
<h1 class="title">THE ONE WHO BEARS SIN&mdash;SATAN</h2>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Matt. 25:41; Lev. 16:7-10; Rev. 20:10</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Who should bear sin?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Since sin originated with Satan, it should ultimately be borne by him. Although Satan transmitted sin to man, God sought to remove it from him and to give it back to Satan. To do this the Lord Jesus bore sin for a short while on the cross, but that was only the bearing of man&rsquo;s sentence for sin; sin itself is ultimately and eternally to be borne by Satan alone.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How sin will be borne
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Although man was deceived into receiving the burden of sin from Satan&rsquo;s hand, thus becoming a sinner, God has no intention for man to bear sin. As soon as a man believes in the redemptive work accomplished by Christ, he is freed from sin.</li>
	<li>If he does not believe, he will have to help Satan to bear sin for eternity. Thus Matthew 25:41 says that the unbelieving ones shall enter into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil. The lake of fire is not for man, but for Satan. If you follow Satan, you will have to share his judgment.</li>
	</ol></li>
