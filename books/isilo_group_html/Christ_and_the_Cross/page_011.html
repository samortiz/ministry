<p>Christ is not only being formed in us; He is also being magnified in us (Phil. 1:20). To be conformed is to have a maturity in life such that everything of Christ becomes our inward element. To magnify Christ is to have a manifestation in our living such that everything of Christ becomes our outward expression. We need to let Christ be formed in us and be magnified in us at all times. Christ must be our inward life and our outward living; He must be our inner element and our outward expression. Our outward expression should always be a magnification of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOR US TO LIVE BEING CHRIST</h2>
<p>God wants Christ to be formed in us and to be magnified in us so that we can say, &ldquo;For us, to live is Christ&rdquo; (cf. v. 21). When we take Christ as our life, live by Him, let Him grow and be formed in us, and let Him be magnified in us and lived out of us, we will be able to say that for us to live is Christ. Then our nature will be constituted with Him, and we will have His likeness and be completely one with Him. Thus, our living and our moving will be His living and moving; that is, our living will be His living again on the earth. Then we will be so one with Him that people will see Him when they see us. When He was living on the earth, He was one with the Father, and when people saw Him, they saw the Father. This is the meaning of Christ being in us. This is God&rsquo;s purpose in having Christ live in us. God wants all that Christ is and has to be fully expressed through us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING OUR HOPE OF GLORY</h2>
<p>Christ may be our life and our everything, we may have His nature and likeness, and we may be able to say that for us to live is Christ; however, we still have not entered into His glory, and our body has not been redeemed and delivered from the old creation. Entering into His glory is still a hope to us. When our hope is realized in the future, we will enter into the glory of Christ; that is, we will gain Christ and enjoy Him in a deeper way. Hence, our hope is a hope of glory, which is Christ Himself. Now He is in us as our life and our everything, but in the future He will swallow up all the death in our being by the power of His resurrection life so that our body will become immortal and glorious. We will be brought fully into His glory, and He will be fully glorified in us. Today He is the hope of glory in us (Col. 1:27), but in the future He will be the reality of this glory expressed from us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR HAVING THE GLORY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>We have the life of Christ in us so that we may be the same as He is in life and nature, but we do not yet fully express His glory; that is, we are not exactly the same as He is in our body and appearance. When we obtain the hope of glory, He &ldquo;will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself&rdquo; (Phil. 3:21). Then our bodies will be fully delivered from everything of the old creation, and we will enter into the fullness and glory of the new creation. We will be like Him in glory from within to without (1 John 3:2), that is, in life and nature and in body and form. Inwardly we will have His life and nature, and outwardly we will have His image and glory. He and we will be completely the same in life, nature, image, and glory. He will be one with us, and we will be one with Him. He will be our ultimate enjoyment, and we will be the expression of His fullness. This is the ultimate consummation of Christ in us. This is the highest goal that He desires to attain in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REQUIREMENTS FOR EXPERIENCING CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Loving Him</h2>
<p>John 14:21 speaks of the Lord manifesting Himself to those who love Him, and verse 23 speaks of the Son and the Father making an abode with those who love the Son. If we want the Lord to manifest Himself to us and make an abode with us so that we may experience Him, we must love Him. Loving the Lord is the prerequisite to experiencing Him. Loving the Lord is also the ultimate basis for enjoying Him. To believe in Him is to receive Him into us, but to love Him is to have Him manifest Himself to us and make an abode with us in our experience. The Gospel of John reveals both our believing in the Lord and our loving Him. After we believe in the Lord, we need to love Him. It is regrettable that many people have believed in the Lord, but they do not love Him. He can manifest Himself to us only because we love Him, just as He appeared to Mary the Magdalene because she loved Him (Mark 16:9; John 20:1-18). Furthermore, if we love the Lord, He will make an abode with us so that we may know and experience Him. We can pursue Him because we love Him, we can experience Him through loving Him, and we can enjoy Him by loving Him. Our heart must love Him and be open to Him. May the Lord draw us!</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ and the Cross &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
