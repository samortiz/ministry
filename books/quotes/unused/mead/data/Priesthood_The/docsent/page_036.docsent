   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE THE THREE CATEGORIES OF DEALINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE PRIESTHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat: When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD: So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations Exo 30:17-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help Heb 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus, By a new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh Heb 10:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the foregoing chapters we have seen that all the Lord s work depends upon the priestly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And we must keep in mind that when we use the word priesthood, it does not only mean the office of the priests, but also the body of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the ministries throughout all generations depend on the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The army of God in the Old Testament was a priestly army, and even the Apostle Paul preached the gospel as a priestly evangelist Rom 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He served the Lord as a priest in the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These cases show us that all the ministries and works of God depend upon the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now we must see the practical way to be a living priest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I believe that Hebrews 4:16 and 10:19-20 are very familiar to all Christians who read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all know that we must come unto the throne of grace to obtain mercy and find grace to meet our timely need.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And we know that we must have boldness to enter into the Holy of Holies to contact the Lord by the blood through a new and living way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We know these verses, but have we ever considered that they describe a priest?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the Old Testament, only the priests could enter the Holy of Holies and touch the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The throne of grace is the mercy seat, which is composed of three things: the testimony the law , the two cherubim of glory, and the blood sprinkled on the cover of the ark under the two watching cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The composition of these three things is the mercy seat.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the mercy seat is the law, the glory, and the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The law is the testimony and definition of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The glory of God convicts us, but the blood of Jesus speaks for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is through the blood that the judgment seat of the Lord becomes the mercy seat.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And this mercy seat is the very throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only the priests could enter the Holy of Holies and touch the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we are familiar with Hebrews 4:16 and 10:19, we realize that these two verses speak of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, any priest who would enter the Holy of Holies must pass through many things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the outer court there is first of all the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then, between the tabernacle and the altar there is the laver.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When a priest is going to enter into the Holy of Holies, he not only has to pass through the altar and the laver, but also through the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He must pass through these three main things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do we adequately realize what all these things mean to us?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE ALTAR</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the altar, it is mainly sin and sins that are dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many kinds of offerings, such as the trespass offering and the sin offering, must be offered to the Lord there.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These offerings are for the purpose of dealing with sin and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Have you fully dealt with the matter of sin?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christians, more or less, are careless with the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the Lord Jesus were to stand before us, we would sense that we are sinful in many respects.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In certain things we are wrong with others, and in other things we are wrong with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are so careless about our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But when we go into the Holy of Holies as a priest, we cannot be careless about sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Anything sinful must be dealt with at the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must go to the Lord again and again to deal with this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First John chapter one tells us that when we stay in the fellowship, we are in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then we see our sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our shortcomings and weaknesses are exposed by the light, and we need the cleansing of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We do need the altar to deal with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Most Christians today do not have a deep and full sense of sin and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When they pray to the Lord, they do not have the conviction that they are so sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, they do not apply the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But one who is really with the Lord is so conscious of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He will stay at the altar to deal with his sins by applying the blood of the Lord.</S>
