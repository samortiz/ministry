<h1 class="title">DEALING WITH THE NATURAL CONSTITUTION<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP</h1>
<p>The purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation is to build up the church as the Body of Christ. Hence, we must have the concept that we need to be built up. In terms of calling, we need to grow unto maturity. In terms of building, we need to be built up into the dwelling place of God. Growing unto maturity is related to life. Birds can fly because they have a flying life. It is possible and easy to fly with the bird life, but it is extremely difficult to fly without the bird life. The growing processes spoken of in the Bible, such as sanctification and renewing, are a matter of life; they are part of the process of growth in life. It is possible to grow with the life of God, but it is not possible to grow without the life of God. After we receive the life of God, we need to grow in this life unto maturity. We also need to be built up in this life into the dwelling place of God in order to accomplish the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE MIXTURE OF<br />
THE NATURAL CONSTITUTION</h2>
<p>For building we need to allow the Lord to touch our natural constitution. Some Christians do not love the Lord and are not zealous, but some love the Lord zealously. Among the Christians who love the Lord zealously, some love the Lord and seek Him in a pure way. Mary the Magdalene was such a person. She truly loved the Lord, and her love was not mixed with the natural or selfish element. She had a pure desire to find the Lord. Therefore, people regarded her as foolish. There are also Christians who love the Lord zealously according to their natural taste and preference. Such people love the Lord, but their love is mixed with a natural element; it is not pure. As a result, their love for the Lord is void of revelation and cannot build up the church; rather, it can create problems.</p>
<p>Some people are constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love and respond zealously with the desire to serve the Lord and labor for Him. However, because their heart is not pure, they want to be at the top and love to be a leader. This is the mixture of their naturalness. The service of the church is a test to the purity of our love for the Lord. Some people are naturally independent. They can love the Lord individually but cannot love the Lord together with others. Some people naturally like to take the lead. Such ones love the Lord zealously when they take the lead, but they stop loving the Lord and lose their zeal when they come into the church and are not given the opportunity to take the lead. If the church does not give them the position of a leader, they will cause trouble in the church. This is very serious.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROBLEMS CAUSED BY OUR NATURAL TASTE</h2>
<p>It may be harder for those who love the Lord with their naturalness to see light and receive revelation than for those who do not love the Lord. This is seen in the examples of Paul and Martha. Before his salvation Paul did not love the Lord; he even opposed and attacked the Lord Jesus. However, God had mercy on him. While he was on his way to Damascus, he saw light and received revelation (Acts 9:1-6). Martha loved the Lord and diligently labored and served Him. She was unable to receive the Lord&rsquo;s revelation, not because she was too busy but because she held on to her own opinions and taste. She was strong in her naturalness. She rebuked the Lord for not understanding that she was toiling in service (Luke 10:40), and she complained that the Lord did not come on time to heal her brother Lazarus (John 11:21). Martha loved the Lord according to her natural taste, and she wanted the Lord to do things according to her will. As a result, she was unable to hear the Lord&rsquo;s words or receive His revelation when He said that He is the resurrection and the life and that Lazarus would rise again (vv. 23-27).</p>
<p>We should not think that those who are quiet are Marys but that those who are busy running around are Marthas. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things&rdquo; (Luke 10:41). Martha&rsquo;s problem, however, was not that she was busy but that she was busy according to her natural taste. When some people do not love the Lord, they leave everyone else alone, but when they love the Lord, the whole church has to follow their taste and be subject to their control. They will complain if the church is not under their control. This was Martha&rsquo;s problem. It is not wrong to be busy, nor is it right to be quiet. We need to ask whether our being quiet or being busy is according to our natural taste or according to the Lord&rsquo;s command. If the Lord commands us to be busy, it is right to be busy. If the Lord commands us to be quiet, it is right to be quiet. Whether we are busy or quiet, we will cause trouble in the church if we love the Lord with our naturalness. This is the most common problem among Christians today.</p>
<p>When some Christians are zealous, a new sect is formed. For example, a brother who has a natural taste for foot-washing may demand that others practice foot-washing according to his taste. This brother may love the Lord zealously and sacrifice his time, spend his energy, and offer material riches to the church but insist on foot-washing and ask the elders to lead the whole congregation to wash each other&rsquo;s feet. If the elders cannot agree to his demand, he may form a sect that practices foot-washing. Never think that we do not have such a natural preference. Every person has his own taste. We are willing to love the Lord, but we often require the saints to do things according to our will and to serve according to our taste. Some people boldly say that they will accomplish great things if they become elders in the church. This is an expression of their natural taste. If such persons become elders, they will not serve according to the Lord&rsquo;s will but according to their own taste. As a result, they will create problems in the church.</p>
<p>When someone loves the Lord zealously according to his own taste, it is hard for him to see light and to receive revelation. Such a person holds on to his own taste and condemns others. There was a brother from Shanhsi who loved the Lord zealously, but his taste was to preach the gospel. No matter what the occasion was, he would speak about preaching the gospel. At the table meeting he did not care whether the saints were remembering the Lord or worshipping the Father; he would give a long prayer and preach the gospel in his prayer. Later the saints became frustrated, and a few elders fellowshipped with him to focus on remembering the Lord at the table meeting and to pray according to the atmosphere in the meeting. This brother refused to receive the fellowship and continued to preach the gospel in the table meeting. Eventually, the elders had no choice but to say, &ldquo;Even if you feel that you are justified, we would still like to ask you to not pray in such a way in the next table meeting.&rdquo; But at the next table meeting he prayed, &ldquo;Lord, the responsible brothers do not want me to pray, but no one else will pray, so I have no choice but to pray. You died for sinners. You visit men. You love sinners.&rdquo; Later, this brother left the church and started broadcasting the gospel on a radio station. Even though this was not very effective, his zeal was satisfied. This is what it means to love the Lord according to one&rsquo;s natural taste, caring only for the self and no one else. Such zealous love for the Lord is unlikely to last long, but if it is long lasting, it will cause other problems or bring trouble to the church.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> </body></html>
