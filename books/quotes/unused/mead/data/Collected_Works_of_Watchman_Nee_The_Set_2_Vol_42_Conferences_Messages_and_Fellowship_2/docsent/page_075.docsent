   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Making Resolutions and Bridling Oneself</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fourth way to deal with sin is by making resolutions and bridling oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One makes up his mind and vows to do such and such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many Christians constantly resort to this method.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They say to the Lord, "I will not do this anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I promise that I will not do it again."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yet their temper, pride, and anxieties do not respect their resolutions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man cannot overcome his sins by his own determination.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every time a person determines not to do a certain thing, he ends up doing it instead.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who make many resolutions find themselves constantly failing in spite of their year-round resolutions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul showed us clearly in Romans 7 that to will is present with us, but to work out the good is not v. 18 . God allows us to make resolutions again and again and to fail again and again in order to show us that we cannot overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God has said that we cannot overcome; we can never overcome our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His way of salvation is to remove us, to remove the person who sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our identification with the Lord's death on the cross removes the sinning person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are identified with the Lord in His crucifixion; therefore, we do not have to be a slave to sin any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is absolutely futile for a person to try to overcome by his own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>GOD'S SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Romans 7 is between chapters six and eight.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Chapter six shows us the doctrine of crucifixion and our living with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Chapter eight tells us of the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, if we do not have the experience of chapter seven, that is, if we do not see our own failures, we cannot overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have been Christians for many years already.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why does the Lord allow us to fail again and again?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to realize that the Lord has a wonderful intention behind allowing us to fail.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His intention is to show us that we cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We could not make it before we were saved, and we cannot make it now that we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord wants us to confess, "I cannot make it."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we can say this, we are almost there.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Romans 7, we see Paul's experience of victory only when he comes to the last two verses.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His shout of victory, "Thanks be to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord!" v. 25 , follows his declaration, "Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?" v. 24 . If we sin to the extent that we can do nothing but groan about it, we are close to deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once we stop making resolutions and cease struggling, our victory is in sight.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can listen all we want to teachings on victory, but if we do not cease our own struggling, we will not experience victory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I can make a prediction: Anyone listening to this message tonight who still thinks that there is some good in him will surely not overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thirteen years ago when I was in Foochow, a brother invited over twenty brothers to Yang-Shu-Pu to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We had to cook, shop, and do our laundry by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all took our bath in the Pu-Tsai River because there was no place to take showers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One day while Brother Lee Teh-yuen was taking a bath, he suddenly had a leg cramp.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even though he could swim, I noticed that he was struggling and was about to sink.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brother Wei-san was very good at swimming.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I shouted for him to rescue our brother, but he remained in the same place and did nothing except watch Brother Lee closely.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everyone was nervous and wanted him to rescue Brother Lee immediately, but he would not move.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I was mad.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When Brother Lee was about to give up and was close to sinking, Brother Wei-san swam quickly to his side.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With one arm around him and the other arm paddling, he quickly brought him to shore.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I immediately did artificial respiration on him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When his condition stabilized, I turned and rebuked Brother Wei-san, saying, "Had you gone earlier, he would not have suffered so much."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He then said to me, "There is a secret to rescuing people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not rescue the living and do not rescue the dead; only rescue the half-dead.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If a person has died, you cannot save him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If he is still living, he will grasp hold of whatever he can grasp hold of in his desperation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When he sees you, he will cling to you and you both will sink together.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One can only rescue a drowning person when he is about to sink.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then you can seize him without him seizing you and bring him to shore."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the way God saves men.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to go through many failures in the course of our struggle over sin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the end we have to give up struggling and admit that we cannot make it before God will come to our rescue.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God's way of salvation is different from man's concept.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Romans 6:14 says that sin will not lord it over us, for we are not under the law but under grace.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What does it mean to be under the law?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What does it mean to be under grace?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Being under the law means that man is doing something for God, and being under grace means that God is doing something for man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If it is left to man to keep God's commandment, he will surely fail and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our victory over sin does not depend on how much we do, but on how much God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should not make the mistake of thinking that salvation is of God's grace, while victory is of man's effort.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>No. Victory is of God's grace, just as salvation is of His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Everything is accomplished by the Lord alone.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God wants to secure all the glory; therefore, He accomplished everything by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>None of our ways work; they can accomplish nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must give up our concepts and our ways.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Everything that I said tonight is on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The purpose of this word is to show you man's errors.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All of these erroneous concepts and ways frustrate man from experiencing victory.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Tomorrow night we will see the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The positive side is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must pray more and ask God to open our eyes to see what the life of God's Son is and to see that He is not here to be our Savior in an outward way, but our Savior in an inward way.</S>
