[5]  IN GALILEE Scripture Reading: Gal 1:4, 13-16a; 2:3, 19-20; 3:1-3, 5, 14, 27; 4:6, 19, 29; 5:3-6, 16, 25; 6:1, 8, 13-15, 18 THE PRESENT EVIL AGE BELONGING TO
[6]  The first is in 1:4, which says, Who gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age according to the will of our God and Father.
[7]  Originally, it was the first kind of world, the secular world, that kept man away from God s purpose, but after God brought man back to Himself, Satan formed the second kind of world, the religious world, to once again keep man away from God.
[8]  Apparently, all these religions teach people to worship God, please God, serve God, and do many things for God, but in actuality they keep people away from the fulfillment of God s purpose.
[9]  Between his mentioning of the present evil age Gal 1:4 and the world 6:14 Paul speaks of the Jewish religion and tradition 1:13-14 .
[10]  This shows that anything related to worshipping, pleasing, or serving God apart from Christ and the Spirit is religion, which is evil in the eyes of God.
[11]  We have received the Spirit, God bountifully supplies to us the Spirit, and God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts v. 5; 4:6 . Since we have the Spirit, we must walk by the Spirit, live by the Spirit, sow unto the Spirit, and reap eternal life of the Spirit 5:16, 25; 6:8 . We need to do everything in the Spirit, who is Christ experienced by us.
[12]  Galatians 6:1 says, Brothers, even if a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, and the final verse of Galatians says, The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit v. 18 . We need to exercise our spirit to touch Christ and experience Him as grace in our spirit.
[13]  FOR THE SPREAD OF THE LORD S RECOVERY Scripture Reading: Gal 2:11-14; Acts 21:18-24, 26-33 CHRIST AND THE CHURCH BEING
[14]  At the end of thirty years Jesus came out to minister.
[15]  Nevertheless, the Lord trained His disciples so that one day He could live in them in a practical way in order to produce the church for the fulfillment of God s purpose and plan.
[16]  Some time later, when Paul went to Jerusalem, he came to James and the elders there Acts 21:18-19 .
[17]  All these ones worked together to convince Paul, saying, You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed; and all are zealous for the law.
[18]  The Lord has His economy, and even though Paul tolerated the influence of religion, the Lord would not allow him to continue.
[19]  Beginning from the second century the fathers of the church began to argue concerning the Person of Christ.
[20]  TO TAKE CHRIST AS LIFE FOR THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Phil 3:2-8; Col 2:8-9, 16-17; 3:10-11
[21]  We are all clear that the secular world is evil and that it frustrates people from going along with God 1 John 2:15-16 .
[22]  Again, it was not mainly the heathen, secular world that sentenced the Lord Jesus to death.
[23]  The Sanhedrin was composed of the chief priests, the elders, the lawyers, and the scribes, all of whom were God-fearing people, but they sentenced Jesus to death according to the law given to them by God.
[24]  The Lord Jesus came to preach the gospel to him directly, saying, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? v. 4 . Although he did not know the Lord, Saul cried, Who are You, Lord? v. 5 . If anyone calls Jesus the Lord, he will be saved Rom 10:13 . When Saul called Him Lord, the Lord said, I am Jesus Acts 9:5 . It was there that Paul had a radical change.
[25]  Whether or not a person is religious depends on how much he knows Christ, lives by Christ, knows the church, and lives with Christ in the church and for the church.
[26]  Not many among the four Christian groups that we spoke of earlier had seen an adequate vision concerning Christ, nor did they know the church.
[27]  They were seeking ones, but they were not seeking Christ, and they were not living for the church.
[28]  Again I say, most of the believers in those groups had not seen Christ and the church, and they were not for Christ and the church.
[29]  It is not that when we sit quietly in a pew, we are dead and in religion, but when we shout and are excited, we are living and not in religion.
[30]  The two attempts to practice the church life under Zinzendorf and the Moravian Brethren and under John Darby and the British Brethren were good, but eventually they were nullified by religious concepts.
[31]  Since they had been forced by Further Talks on the Church Life to admit that Brother Nee did not change in the matter of the church, they utilized Brother Nee s ministry on the side of life to build up their religion, at the same time refusing to promote anything that Brother Nee wrote concerning the church.
[32]  Nevertheless, he was the forerunner of Christ, testifying of Christ and recommending Christ to the people.
[33]  Although the genuine, typical religion of that day taught people to worship God, serve Him, seek His interests, and hold to His holy Word, it defamed the Lord Jesus to such a great extent.
[34]  However, at the end of this age the Lord will sovereignly use Antichrist, the evil incarnation of Satan, to terminate all religions.
[35]  He will cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease, and he will set up his image in the temple, sitting in the temple of God to say that he is God Dan 9:27; 8:9-11; 12:11; Matt 24:15; Rev 13:14-15; 2 Thes 2:3-4 .
[36]  In religion people can be saved, love the Lord, and seek Him, but the Lord cannot truly build His church there.
[37]  FOR THE LORD S INTERESTS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Tim 4:22; Gal 5:16, 25; 6:18
[38]  The revelation of the Bible is that Christ came in the flesh to be the Lamb of God John 1:29 that He might die on the cross in order to accomplish redemption, deal with all negative things including sin, Satan, the flesh, and the world solve all problems, and release the divine life from within Him.
[39]  Because God has forgiven us of our sins and Christ has imparted Himself into us as life, we have all become living members of Christ s Body, His living organism for His expression.
[40]  Today we are no longer like the children of Israel in the Old Testament, who had God only among them, not mingled with them.
[41]  Because the God who was among them could not enter into them, He gave them five long books written by Moses full of regulations, rituals, forms, and instructions.
[42]  God came in the flesh to accomplish redemption, the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit, and this Spirit, who is the realization of the Triune God, has come into us to regenerate us and mingle Himself with our spirit to make us one with Him.
[43]  As we have been speaking about the young people being useful in the hands of the Lord, the older brothers and sisters may have been bothered concerning their own usefulness.
[44]  We believe that the vision we have received concerning the young people going to the college campuses is truly from the Lord, and that the Lord has already begun a good work among many of the young people.
[45]  However, we must fellowship concerning a number of crucial points related to the Lord s present move in His recovery.
[46]  We must all learn to pray and not make decisions too quickly concerning our going out for the Lord s present move.
[47]  If we make a quick decision without prayer, our decision may be without God, the Lord, and the Spirit.
[48]  Politicians make decisions by themselves without praying to seek the Lord s leading, but we have the Lord.
[49]  Some will say to the Lord, Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power?
