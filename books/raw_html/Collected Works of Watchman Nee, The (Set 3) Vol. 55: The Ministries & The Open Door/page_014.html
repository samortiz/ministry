<h2 class="head1">LESSONS LEARNED IN LAN-CHOU</h2><p>The church in Lan-chou has been especially blessed by the Lord recently. The brothers and sisters are pursuing and growing in life. They have also been preserved by the Lord. Some have been brought inward by their environments. Others are going through trials, discipline, and even chastisements. Overall, the brothers and sisters among us have touched the real and living God and are in the process of coming out of Christianity and into Christ. Satan, however, has been attacking us very strongly; please pray for us much.</p><p>After the brothers left, we had two days of special gospel meetings on the first and fifteenth days of the first month of the lunar calendar. Although we were under fierce attack by the enemy, we saw the Lord's victory in the end. The brothers and sisters all learned something. Praise the Lord!</p><p>We are in the process of leasing land and building a new meeting hall, and we have also seen the beginning of some monetary offerings from the brothers and sisters. Please pray for us much.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Si Lu-Chen, John Lee<br />April 12, 1948</p><p>Mailing Address: 5 Park Road, Lan-chou, Kansu province</p><h2 class="head1">HOPE IN THE MIDST OF DISAPPOINTMENTS</h2><p>..With regard to going to Shanghai, I have desperately sought the Lord for these past few days, and I hope that the Lord would give me an open door to get there in a timely manner, but my environment has not released me. (The dean of my department has taken three weeks off, and he will not return to Tsingtao until around April 21.)</p><p>I have just come back from taking Brother Zi-jie to the dock, and my heart is filled with boundless disappointment! I deeply hope that by the Lord's mercy I will not be rejected, and I ask the brothers to remember me in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Qu Xun-min<br />March 31, 1948</p><p>Mailing Address: Nei 4, 1 Zi-Chuan Road, Tsingtao</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO NOURISH OTHERS</h2><p>Dear Brothers:</p><p>The Lord led us to begin preaching the gospel in November of last year. Thank the Lord for being with us. Many people confessed His name. We were not able to baptize them into the Lord's name because we are weak and immature and because of other hindrances. On the eighteenth of this month, the Lord gave us special strength, and we were finally able to baptize them into the Lord's name. Thirteen brothers and one sister were baptized. Many other people are also seeking this way. The Lord willing, we may have another baptism meeting. We are still praying concerning the time. May the Lord decide it for us.</p><p>O brothers! We feel there is a great problem here. God has borne so much fruit for us that we have no way to nourish them all even though our hearts are full of joy. We are still milk-drinkers; how can milk-drinking infants help newborn babes grow? May the brothers often remember us young, weak brothers before God, and may we not hinder God's will and grace. Please send us letters to help us so that we could go on in the heavenly way of true light and so that we would have the strength to bring the brothers and sisters on. May the Lord's grace be with you. Greet all the saints in Shanghai.</p><p>Representing the brothers who meet in the Lord's name</p><p>in Xu-Zhou,<br />Abel Wang, Liu Zhi-cheng<br />April 22, 1948</p><p>Mailing Address: Dawning Light Pharmacy, 211 Peng Cheng Road, Xu-Zhou</p>
