   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD DESIRING TO BE JOINED TO MAN AND TO BE MAN'S LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this New Year's conference, we will have four meetings on God's way in life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's life is our way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible shows us clearly that God is life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God is the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we have God, we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This life is our way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the other hand, without God, there is death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With death, we have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today, we are taking a way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This way is simply God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With God there is life, and with life there is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without God, there is no life, and without life, there is no way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Apart from God, everything is death, and death affords no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible reveals further that this God of life desires to join Himself to man and to be man's life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For this reason, the Bible tells us that God loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The love God has for the world is like the love a man has for a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not a general kind of love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, it is a romantic love.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is in love with man in a romantic way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Perhaps some find it hard to compare God's love to the love between a man and a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But according to the Bible, the love between a man and a woman is holy; it is ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible compares God to a man and compares mankind to a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is loving us not only in a merciful way, but in a romantic way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God loves us in this way because He desires to join Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A man and a woman love each other with the purpose of being joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When two love each other very much, they are joined as one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Marriage is such a union.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the way God loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He desires to be one with us and to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For this reason, God created man according to His image.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is wonderful that God did not create a pair of human beings; He created only one man, Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After Adam was created, though all the living creatures were brought before him, he did not find his match.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was a lonely man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, the Bible says that "it is not good that the man should be alone'' Gen 2:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This signifies that it is not good for God to be alone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He does not want to dwell alone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead, He wants to join Himself to the man He created in His image.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When God created man, He created only one man, Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before God prepared a counterpart for Adam, He brought all the created beasts of the field and fowls of the air before him, and Adam gave names to each one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But he did not find his counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was still a lonely bachelor.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God then caused Adam to go into a deep sleep, and He opened his side and took out a rib.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From that rib God built a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, man was created by God, whereas woman was built by God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God brought the woman He had built unto Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When Adam saw her, he said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh.''</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As a result, the two were joined as one flesh Gen 2:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From that day on, Adam became Eve's life, and Eve became Adam's living.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In human society, whether in the East or in the West, the female takes her name from the male; never does the male take his name from the female.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that once a man and a woman are married, the man becomes the woman's life, and the woman has the man as her living.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After a girl is married, she can no longer live her maiden life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Instead, she must live her husband's living.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The wife has to take the husband as her life and her living.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>GOD AS LIFE TO MAN THAT MAN MAY TAKE GOD AS HIS LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First, God created Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then He completed Adam's marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Eve came out of Adam and had Adam for her life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Eve was also for Adam and had Adam as her living.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is a type.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It signifies that God desires to be joined to the created man, to be man's life, so that man can be His living.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Brothers and sisters, from this we can see what kind of a living we Christians should have.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should have God's living.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are human beings; yet we can have God's living.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For this reason, God came to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This life is our way in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do you want to submit to your husband?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The way is to take God as your life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Do you want to love your wife?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The way also is to take God as your life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Today, many are not living in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we want to live as a proper man, there is no way other than through God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Only when God is life in us can we be a proper man.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God's life is the way for us to live a proper human life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hence, God desires not only that we would have His image, but that we would take Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>For this reason, after God created man in His image, He put him before the tree of life, which is a symbol of Himself, and said, "Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die'' Gen 2:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is the beginning of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>By the end of the New Testament, in Revelation the Lord Jesus said, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God'' Rev 2:7b .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Finally, in the holy city, the New Jerusalem, we have the tree of life spreading as a vine along the river of water of life for God's people to receive and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This describes the God who loves us, who is joined to us, who has become our life and is giving us life, becoming our eternal and infinite supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We have to receive Him again and again as our life, so that we can live Him as our living.</S>
