<P>Chapter one tells us, on the one hand, that Jesus is Emmanuel, and on the other hand, that He will save His people from their sins.</P><P>In chapter two the word concerning Jesus being born as the King of the Jews was spoken from the mouths of the Gentiles.</P><P>In chapter three first it says to the Jews that they should produce fruit worthy of their repentance. This relates to the Jews. Then it speaks of how God is able to raise up children to Abraham out of the stones. This relates to the Gentiles. Finally, it speaks of the Lord's death, that is, the Lord's baptism in the Jordan River.</P><P>In chapter four the Lord began His work.</P><P>Chapters five through seven cover the requirements of the spiritual kingdom.</P><P>The end of chapter seven mentions God's will, and the end of chapter twelve also mentions God's will.</P><P>In chapter eight the Lord healed first the Jews and then the Gentiles. Then He went back to the Jews to heal Peter's mother-in-law and finally to heal all the people.</P><P>Chapter nine tells us that the Lord healed diseases and cast out demons, yet He was accused of casting out demons by the ruler of the demons. The rejection of the Lord by the people had begun.</P><P>In chapter ten the Lord still sent His disciples to the house of Israel. This was the final call for them to go out to gain a remnant.</P><P>In chapter eleven we see a remnant which is the result of the work in chapter ten.</P><P>At the end of chapter twelve the Lord declared that from then on He cut off His relationship with the Jews. However, that was only a doctrinal declaration. The formal declaration would be made at the end of chapter twenty-three.</P><P>The teachings after chapter thirteen are not related very much to the Jews; rather, they are directed toward the church.</P><P>Verse 25: "At that time Jesus answered and said, I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants." Here in this verse, all those people mentioned earlier in the chapter were put aside. A remnant is here. The Lord showed us that all those who desire to have the truth concerning the kingdom of the heavens are infants. The wise and intelligent here are not truly wise and intelligent. Rather, they are in contrast to the infants. Here we have a principle: if we read the Bible yet do not understand what we read, it is not because our mind is not good but because our mind is too good. If our mind is not good, it is because our heart is not good. Every time we fail to understand the Bible when we read, it is because we do not have the attitude of an infant. If our judgment is of God, we will not be afraid to read it once more.</P><P>Verse 26:"Yes, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in Your sight." Who were these infants? They were the remnant gained by the Lord. Although almost all rejected Him and only a small number, a remnant, followed Him, that was sufficient for Him, for that was well-pleasing in God's sight. M. E. Barber once said something to this effect: "If the Lord desires to imprison me for twenty years, I am willing, though I came to China to save people." The Lord's being a perfect Servant does not depend on the result of His work but on His doing the will of God.</P><P>Verse 27:"All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father; neither does anyone fully know the Father except the Son and he to whom the Son wills to reveal Him." "All things" refers to people. From John 6:65 we can see that every saved one is given by God to the Son. Everyone who comes to the Lord is moved by God (John 6:37). From this verse we know that no one knows the Son. Although the Lord was misunderstood by men, He was satisfied as long as He was known by the Father.</P><P>The life of the Lord can be divided into three sections: (1) from the manger to the Jordan River, (2) from the Jordan River to the Mount of Transfiguration, and (3) from the Mount of Transfiguration to Jerusalem.</P><P>By reading Hebrews 10:7 we can see that the purpose of the Lord's entire life was to die, that is, to do the will of God. Herein lies the particular point concerning Christ and the Father. That is, Christ had only One who knew Him, and that was the Father. Love is single and also hidden; otherwise, it cannot be considered love. No one can come to the Father; only He who knows the Father can reveal the Father.</P><P>Verse 28:"Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest." The Lord did not say "all who sin." What does it mean to toil and be burdened? This refers in particular to the lost sheep in the house of Israel, who could not obtain their satisfaction from the world. "Give you rest." This is the other aspect of salvation, that is, the aspect of rest. Toiling is brought forth by sin, as with those who burn incense and bow down every few steps. The Jews fast twice a week; the Hindus sleep on beds of nails. These are toilings brought forth by sin. To "come" is our duty; the rest is done by Him. We do not have to bear our sins.</P><P>Verse 29:"Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls." This means that we, the rebellious ones, will find rest by turning to the Lord. The "rest" in the preceding verse is the rest from sin; the "rest" here is the rest that we need to find because of our heart's disobedience to God, that is, the rest that we have by coming out from ourselves.</P><P>Verse 30:"For My yoke is easy and My burden is light." When we obey, we will feel that His yoke is not difficult. The yoke is difficult only because we do not surrender inwardly.</P>
