   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Old Testament, after man s creation, God made the first covenant with man; after man s fall He made the second covenant with man Gen 3:8-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I. THE ONE WHO MADE THE COVENANT JEHOVAH A. Coming to the Place of Fallen Man</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After Adam and Eve disobeyed God s word and ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, immediately they knew that they had violated God s prohibition and that the result of their transgression would be death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, they hid themselves from the presence of God, awaiting the sentence of death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, instead of forsaking them, God came to the garden, to the place of the fallen people Gen 3:8 ; and instead of sentencing them to death, He preached the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, Jehovah God came to the place of fallen man to make a covenant with man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>B. Seeking and Calling Fallen Man</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God not only came to the place of fallen man, but He came to seek and to call fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He spoke to them in the way of seeking and calling, saying, Where art thou?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Gen 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, Jehovah, the One who made the covenant, was such a God who came to the place of fallen man to seek and to call fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man s fall did not cause God to give up His purpose in man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since His will is established, it will never change.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many years later, God Himself became a man, the Lord Jesus, and came to the place of the fallen people to seek and to save us, the fallen and lost ones Luke 19:10 .</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE ONE WITH WHOM THE COVENANT WAS MADE</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>FALLEN MAN A. Transgressing God s Prohibition</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>While man was in the Garden of Eden, God admonished him, saying, But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die Gen 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God s intention was that man should exercise his free will to choose the tree of life and reject the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, man transgressed God s prohibition and ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, man had an offense before God Rom 5:18a , and he also had Satan s evil life and nature in him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus he became a fallen person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>B. Having Sin and Death</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When man ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Satan s evil essence entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, within man there was an essence that was not created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This essence is the nature of Satan, which is also the sin that dwells in man, as mentioned in the Scriptures Rom 7:17 , becoming the essence and constituent of fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, the fallen man had sin and was constituted a sinner Rom 5:12, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The fallen man not only had sin and was constituted a sinner, but he also had death and became a dead person 1 Cor 15:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>First, the fallen man s spirit was deadened, becoming insulated from God and losing its function toward God; eventually even man s body died.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, through the offense of one man, Adam, sin entered into the world, and sin brought in death, so death ruled over all men Rom 5:12, 17 , causing all men to die.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although man fell into such a tragic and hopeless condition, God came to visit him and to make a covenant with him.</S>
