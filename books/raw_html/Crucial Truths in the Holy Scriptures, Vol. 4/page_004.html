	 <h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br />
ACCORDING TO THE PURE WORD IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God Being Unique</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You alone are God&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 86:10).</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;I am Jehovah...; besides Me there is no God&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 45:5; see also Eph. 4:6; 1 Tim. 2:5).</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;There is no God but one&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 8:4).</p>
<p>Both the Old and New Testaments clearly and definitely speak of God as one.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Being Triune</h2>
<h2 class="head3">I and Us, Me and We</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us?&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 6:8; see also Gen. 1:26; 3:22; 11:7).</p>
<p>In this verse God refers to Himself as both &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;Us.&rdquo; Although we cannot say how He is both &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;Us,&rdquo; we know that He is both. In the New Testament there are verses in which God refers to Himself with both singular and plural pronouns.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:23).</p>
<p>When the Lord, who is God, referred to Himself in this verse, He used the pronouns <em>Me</em> and <em>My,</em> but when He referred to God the Father, He used the pronoun <em>We.</em> Both <em>Me</em> and <em>We</em> refer to only one God.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Holy Father, keep them in Your name, which You have given to Me, that they may be one even as We are&rdquo;</strong> (John 17:11).</p>
<p>In this verse the Lord referred to Himself and to the Father using the word <em>We.</em> This is a mystery that is beyond human language and understanding.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Father, Son, and Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Baptizing them into the name [singular] of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 28:19).</p>
<p>This verse clearly says that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit have one name. There are three, but there is only one name. This is God being triune.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Three All Being God</h2>
<h2 class="head4">The Father Being God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:2).</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:17).</p>
<p>Many places in the New Testament speak of God the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Son Being God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;But of the Son, &lsquo;Your throne, O God&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 1:8).</p>
<p>The Son is called God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:1).</p>
<p>The Word is Christ, the Son. Since the Word is God, the Son is God.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 9:5).</p>
<p>Christ is not only God but the God who is over all.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Spirit Being God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to deceive the Holy Spirit...You have not lied to men but to God&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 5:3-4).</p>
<p>In verse 3, Peter told Ananias that he had deceived the Holy Spirit, and in the following verse he equated this with lying to God. Thus, these two verses indicate that the Holy Spirit is God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Three Being Eternal</h2>
<h2 class="head4">The Father Being Eternal</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Eternal Father&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 9:6).</p>
<p>This verse speaks of the Mighty God as being the Eternal Father. Thus, the Father is eternal.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Son Being Eternal</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You are the same, and Your years will not fail&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 1:12).</p>
<p>According to this verse, the years of the Lord will not fail, that is, will not end. This is confirmed in Hebrews 7:3, which says that He is without beginning of days or end of life. Thus, He is eternal.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Spirit Being Eternal</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The eternal Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 9:14).</p>
<p>According to this verse Christ offered Himself without blemish to God through the eternal Spirit. Thus, according to the Bible, we must proclaim that the Father, Son, and Spirit are all eternal.</p>
