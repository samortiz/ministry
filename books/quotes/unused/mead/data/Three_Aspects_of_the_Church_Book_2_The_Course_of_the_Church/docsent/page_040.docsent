   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the church had been transmuted and became the Roman Catholic Church, in a sense it could not be transmuted or fall any further.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whatever could be transmuted had been transmuted, whatever could fall had fallen, and whatever could be corrupted had been corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Roman Catholic Church is the best illustration of the church after it fell to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When people or situations are corrupted to the uttermost, everything is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, a sick person dies when his sickness reaches the extreme; everything is finished he cannot get any sicker.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With the formation of the Roman Catholic Church, the transmutation and degradation of the church were complete.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, the church could not be further transmuted or fall any lower.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE RECOVERY OF JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In A.D. 590, when Gregory the Great established the papal throne, the Roman Catholic Church was fully established in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was more than nine hundred years from that time until Martin Luther was raised up at the beginning of the sixteenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During those nine hundred years, the Roman Catholic Church did its best to corrupt, degrade, and defile the church in order to transmute it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Under the influence of the Roman Catholic Church, this was the darkest period in human history.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am afraid that speaking about the corruption, abominations, power struggles, hypocrisy, and idolatry of that time would defile our mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This dark situation fulfilled the word in Revelation 17:1-6.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Chinese have a famous proverb that says, As soon as a thing reaches its extremity, it reverses its course.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, when the darkest hour comes, daybreak is at hand.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The corrupted, dark situation stirred up a number of people who had a pure heart for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, Martin Luther was provoked by the Roman Catholic Church before he began to seek the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Martin Luther was a central figure in the Reformation, but he was not alone; the Reformation began long before Martin Luther was raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John Huss tried to reform the Roman Catholic Church before Luther came on the scene.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Huss received light from the Lord s Word and spoke the basic truths.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because his preaching contradicted the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, he was martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the seeds that he sowed in central Europe bore fruit a hundred years later.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The recovery of the church that began with John Huss was not strong enough.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was not until Martin Luther was raised up that the recovery of the church was sufficiently strong and full.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Martin Luther and those who stood with him recovered the truth concerning justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first thing they testified was that Catholicism had lost God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Roman Catholic Church was full of sins and had many basic heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Heresies are deeper and more serious than sins.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sins are merely weaknesses, but heresies bring in human teachings and other awful things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Early on, Luther sought to reform the Roman Catholic Church, but he was not able to carry out his plans.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The abuses related to the sale of papal indulgences, however, was more than he could tolerate.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Roman Catholic Church sold expensive indulgences for great sins and cheaper indulgences for small sins; it cost more to obtain pardon for big sins, and it cost less for little sins to be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The poor paid less, and the rich paid more.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The pope s representatives sold indulgences in every city, and people were told that as long as they bought indulgences, their sins would be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This matter provoked Luther more than anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At this time Catholicism had forsaken the truth and did whatever it pleased; it even made its sinful practices into doctrines, which were taught to people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In principle, at the time of the Reformation, every truth had been transmuted.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Roman Catholic Church had the Bible, which was not open; it had God s name but still worshipped idols.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Catholicism even taught the worship of the bones and relics of its so-called saints; moreover, these bones and relics were frequently fakes sold for profit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Almost every household had some kind of relic; people worshipped the relics and asked the relics for peace and healing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The situation was so low that it is difficult to describe.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God s recovery began with the foundational truth of justification by faith; Martin Luther expressed this matter with much light and great clarity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, those who followed Luther to come out of Catholicism were not sufficiently pure and thus were still somewhat confused.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, Protestantism is still complicated and impure because it was built on a confused and complicated foundation and was not inwardly pure.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although the doctrine of justification by faith was clear, many other aspects of the truth were still in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At Luther s time the Roman Catholic Church was united with the governments of many European countries.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, when Luther challenged the Roman Catholic Church, he was also challenging the governments involved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, some governments were not in one accord with the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The leaders of some countries were not satisfied with the Roman popes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For example, the states in the region around Germany united themselves with Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the one hand, their support caused Luther to suffer persecution from the Roman Catholic Church and to be harassed by governments that supported Catholicism, but on the other hand, it afforded Luther some support and protection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This put Luther in a very difficult position.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Luther was a man, and despite what he accomplished positively, he was still very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At one point, he helped the landowners suppress a peasant revolt; this put him under the powerful hands of the governments that supported him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Wherever the government opposed the popes, the Reformation was active.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, all the churches that came out of Catholicism were, like Catholicism, in union with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Luther s writings clearly indicate that he knew that the church should be separate from the state, but he was unable to accomplish this separation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He hoped that others would be able to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Protestantism is weak because it did not make a clean break at the outset.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When the Reformation began, the church was not clearly separated from the state, so the church was placed in the hands of Egyptians and returned to Egypt while it was leaving Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It was as if they left the realm of Nebuchadnezzar and went back to Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is not too much to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Reformation causes people to praise God on one hand and to feel heartbroken on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The recovery of justification by faith was a good beginning, but even before Luther s death, the Protestant churches were in confusion because of their union with politics.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many of those who accepted justification by faith accepted only the doctrine and were not regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many of the leaders of the Reformation used the Reformation for political purposes.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They took part in the Reformation for the purpose of obtaining political power.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Some political leaders sought to solidify their power base through Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They participated in the Reformation because they wanted to oppose the political authority of the Roman Catholic Church; as a result, they brought many worldly things into Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The proper church life was not recovered at the time of Luther; he began the recovery with the truth of justification by faith, but he did not recover anything else worth mentioning.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Actually, everything else was in confusion, and the spiritual standard was very low.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Thus, in Revelation 3 the Lord says to the church in Sardis, You have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead...establish the things which remain, which were about to die; for I have found none of your works completed before My God...You have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments vv.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>1-2, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This word from the Lord to the church in Sardis is a prophecy concerning the condition of Protestantism.</S>
