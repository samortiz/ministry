   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The third time was in Acts 10.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Peter did not have the intention at first to go to the house of Cornelius in Caesarea.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He went because he saw the vision; he saw a big sheet coming down from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a result of the vision, he went to Caesarea.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After he arrived at Caesarea, he began to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible says that Peter gave a long message.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He talked about God being no respecter of persons and about God sending His Son Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you read that message, you will see that it was very incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The beginning was great but the last part was brief.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was like someone with a big head, a small trunk, and a lower part that has disappeared altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Just when he was coming to the practical application of the message, he stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Just as he was about to speak about Jesus, about God appointing Him, about man rejecting Him, about God resurrecting Him, and about how He accomplished redemption, God interrupted the speech.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Acts 10:44 is very interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It says, "While Peter was still speaking these words..."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Please note the word "while."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that Peter did not intend to stop there; he was about to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was prepared to speak more; there were more things in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His mind had prepared more things to say, and he was about to continue, but the Holy Spirit interrupted his words.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Holy Spirit was poured out, and everyone spoke in tongues and magnified God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This interrupted Peter's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is strange that during the three times Peter spoke, he was interrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first time God the Father interrupted his words from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The second time God the Son interrupted his word on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The third time God the Spirit interrupted his word in Caesarea.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God the Father interrupted his words from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God the Son interrupted his words from the house.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And God the Spirit interrupted his words in the midst of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God did not allow him to go on; He interrupted Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In one case, He interrupted after Peter spoke a few words.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In another case, He interrupted before anything was said.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The third time, He interrupted Peter after he had spoken a long discourse.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There was an interruption after a few words, an interruption after no word, and an interruption after a long discourse.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Of the three times that Peter spoke, God interrupted each time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you compare these three cases with the story of Job in the Old Testament, you will find one very interesting thing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Old Testament, God would listen to man's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man was always speaking, and God did not object.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God allowed man to speak; He was willing to let man speak so much.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If this was the case, why did God interrupt Peter's speaking when he spoke these three times in the New Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you read the book of Job, you can see that God is capable of listening to man's speaking; He can patiently listen.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why then did He not allow Peter to speak?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why did He not allow him to continue?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why did He not allow Peter to finish what he wanted to say?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You must realize that God is a God who can listen.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He can listen patiently to man's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His interruptions of Peter's speaking show that his word needed to be interrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If God did not allow him to continue with his words, it means that the words should not have continued.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His words should not be heard anymore; they were not worthy words and had to be interrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the listening God interrupts man's word, it must mean that his words should be interrupted and should not be allowed to continue.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we spend some time to consider these three passages, we will find out that Peter's words in each case had to be interrupted, because they were too crucial to Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If those three speakings had continued, there would be no Christianity left.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If the three speakings had continued, Christianity would have been overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God interrupted all three speakings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This shows us that Christianity is something very special.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have to have God's viewpoint, and cannot have man's viewpoint.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we take the human view, God will come in to interrupt our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Let us consider these three instances, and why God interrupted Peter's speakings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The first instance was on the Mount of Transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We know that on the Mount of Transfiguration the Lord manifested His own honor and glory, and He showed men the kind of Christ He was.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He put on the flesh and came among men.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We can say that the Jesus who began from Bethlehem was a disguised Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Because He put on the human body, men did not recognize the kind of Christ He was.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the Mount of Transfiguration, He removed His disguise for a short time and showed the three disciples the kind of Christ He was.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He showed them what He was like originally.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many people claimed to be His disciples, but few knew about Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many people knew that He was Jesus of Nazareth, but few saw Him as the Son of God and the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They did not know who He was, and their eyes were not yet open.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Peter might have said, "You have talked much about Christ, and my ears have heard of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>My hands have touched Him, and I have heard His words.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I have seen a little of the kind of person He is.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But there is something that I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I have seen Him, and I have heard Him, but there is still something that I have not seen or heard."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Mount of Transfiguration was a removing of His disguise.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>A new revelation was opened to the disciples, and they saw who Christ was.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>While this was going on, Moses and Elijah also appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We all know that Moses represents the law, while Elijah represents the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Both the law and the prophets were on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The main features of the Old Testament are the law and the prophets, while the main feature of the New Testament is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>According to God's ordination, the law and the prophets, as shadows, will pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When the substance is here, the shadows will pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Peter saw Moses and Elijah; he saw the main features of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He also saw Christ, the main feature of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Therefore he exclaimed, "It is good for us to be here."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>While he was speaking, God came in to interrupt his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God's interruption of his speaking means that the law and the prophets cannot be mixed with Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God said, a few chapters previous, that "all the prophets and the law prophesied until John" Matt 11:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>"Until John"!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>From that time the kingdom of God began.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We can see that the law, the prophets, and the kingdom of God are consecutive and not parallel to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Peter was saying that the law, the prophets, and Christ were coexisting, rather than in sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He was saying that Moses, Elijah, and Christ were equal, instead of being consecutive.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>God interrupted his speaking in order to show him that the law, the prophets, and Christ are not equal, with the latter superseding the former.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Once the former two are finished, the latter begins.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The latter starts when the first two end. The two parties cannot coexist.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>No one in the Old Testament occupied a higher position than Moses and Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Yet they cannot stand side by side with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Peter said that he would build three tents, one for Christ, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He meant that even though the Lord Jesus should occupy the first place, a second and third place should be reserved for the law and the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>God in heaven pronounced that the law and the prophets should not step back to a second and third place, but should not occupy any place at all in Christianity and in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In Christianity, in the New Testament, and in the church, the Lord Jesus occupies everything; the law and the prophets must step aside completely.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Listen to the voice from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>While Peter was saying that one tent was for Christ, one was for Moses, and one for Elijah, the voice from heaven said, "This is My Son, the Chosen One.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Hear Him!"</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Luke 9:35 .</S>
