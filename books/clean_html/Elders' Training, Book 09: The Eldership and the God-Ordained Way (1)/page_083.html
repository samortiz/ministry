<P>We do not want to compel people to take anything or impose what we have learned on others, but we need to have some discernment to know the more excellent things. The four major steps in the advance of the Lord's recovery today are workable, but they require our constant and regular labor. In Colossians 1:28, Paul said that he announced Christ, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom to present every man full-grown in Christ. Then in verse 29 he said, "For which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power." We need this kind of labor. This new way will make everyone busy because it will afford everyone the opportunity to function, to serve.</P><P>The governing principle of the Lord's ordained way is that it affords equal opportunity to all the members of the Body of Christ. In preaching the gospel, in home meetings, in the group meetings, in prophesying in the church meetings, the opportunity is afforded to each of the saints. This is God's way. The traditional way robs the saints of their opportunity to function and gives this opportunity to a small clerical class. Thus, the clergy has all the opportunities, and they do everything. The so-called laymen are left with little opportunity to do anything. In this clergy-laity system, the saints are annulled in their capacity of the divine life. In the divine life there is the capacity, the power, the ability to speak for the Lord. According to the old, traditional way, the believers seemingly have little ability because they are not allowed to participate in anything. They become pew members, coming to a Lord's Day service to listen to a professional speaker. The Lord's ordained way releases the saints from the bondage of this system.</P><P>Of course, to have any change is difficult at the beginning. To take the new way is not so easy because we are not used to it. I fully sympathize with the elders who are taking the lead and bearing the responsibility of the churches. It is easy to carry on in the old way because so much of the service is carried out in a routine way. There is not the need of much labor. But to carry out the new way, we have to practice diligently to learn something. Then we have to help others to enter into what we have learned to bring them into functioning with equal opportunity. I believe that in another five years, we will begin to see the consequence, the result, the coming out, of the new way. We want to be brought into a situation in which everyone can preach the gospel, everyone can take care of new ones, everyone can perfect others in the group meetings, and everyone can speak forth the Lord into others. Thus, whenever we come together we will have many ministers. We must exercise to discern the excellent things and the excellent way. The new way is the excellent way to organically build up the Body of Christ.</P>
