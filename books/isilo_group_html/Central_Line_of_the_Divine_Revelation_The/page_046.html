As the Consummation of the Triune God<br>for the Dispensing of Himself<br>into the Believers of Christ</H2><P>The Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God for the dispensing of Himself into the believers of Christ is the seed of Abraham (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17-18; Rom. 8:9). The last Adam mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15:45 is the seed of Abraham. This seed became not only our Redeemer and Savior but also the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is a transfigured descendant of Abraham. The top blessing, the consummate blessing, to us sinners is God Himself as the life-giving Spirit. On the one hand, the life-giving Spirit is a transfigured descendant of Abraham, and on the other hand, He is the very Triune God. This life-giving Spirit is the consummated Spirit who is the consummation of the processed Triune God. This is the real blessing.</P><P>If today we had only a Redeemer who died for us on the cross and only a Savior who stretches out His hand to pull us out of the "water" of our troubles, this would not be sufficient. The Savior we need today is the One who can enter into us. We need the life-giving Spirit who dwells in our spirit and who is one spirit with us (1 Cor. 6:17). When we fall into the "water," He falls in with us. He is buoyant. If we did not have the life-giving Spirit in our spirit, we would sink in the "water" because we are not buoyant. But, praise the Lord, we do have a buoyant One within us. The third stanza of Hymns, #505 expresses this thought: "There's a Man in the glory / Whose Life is for me. / ...He's strong and in vigor, / How buoyant is He!" Where is Christ buoyant? He is buoyant in our spirit. He has been buoyant within me for sixty-five years. Because of this buoyant One, I can boast that I have been kept from falling. The life-giving Spirit as the seed of Abraham and as the consummation of the processed Triune God is the top blessing. As such a One, He can be in us with both His divinity and His humanity. How wonderful this is! The totality of what He is, is called the Spirit. The good land given to Abraham was a type of this Spirit. The Spirit is the blessing God promised Abraham.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. For the Believers in Christ,<br>Who Are Abraham's Seed, to Inherit<br>the Consummated Spirit as<br>Their Divine Inheritance</H2><P>The seed of Abraham is for the believers in Christ, who are Abraham's seed, to inherit the consummated Spirit, the consummation of the processed Triune God, as their divine inheritance&#151;their spiritual blessing for eternity (Acts 26:18; Eph. 1:14a; Gal. 3:14). Christ is the seed of Abraham, and all His believers are also the seed of Abraham (v. 29). Now, as believers we are no longer merely descendants of Americans, Chinese, or Japanese. We are Abraham's seed. We are all one family, and our surname is Abraham, because Abraham is our father (Rom. 4:12).</P><P>Our spiritual blessing for eternity is to inherit the consummated Spirit, the consummation of the processed Triune God, as our inheritance. In the new heaven and new earth in the New Jerusalem, we will enjoy the processed Triune God, who is the all-inclusive, consummated, life-giving Spirit. This is our blessing. Even today, the most enjoyable thing to us is the indwelling Spirit.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Line of the Divine Revelation &nbsp; pg 46</div><br></body></html>
