   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I received your letter and learned everything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In my heart, I do not want to live in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But since the Lord has loved me so much, in these last days, I should love Him and take up my own cross to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I do not understand Cantonese or English, so I would not be able to testify for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I would be willing to go to Hunan or Szechuan for the following reasons.</S>
