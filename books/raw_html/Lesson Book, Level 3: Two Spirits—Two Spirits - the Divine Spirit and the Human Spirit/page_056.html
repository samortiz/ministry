To speak of the soul is also not difficult, because, though the soul is abstract, we can feel it and know it by its functions and actions, such as thinking, considering, determining, decision-making, and being pleased, angry, sorrowful, and joyful. Only when we speak of the spirit is it truly difficult. Even understanding the spirit is not easy, not to mention speaking about the spirit.]</P><P>Where is our spirit located? This we are not sure of. Daniel 7:15 tells us that our spirit is in the midst of our body but does not tell us the exact location. Nevertheless, from our experience, we know that we have a spirit in us. If we want to know the spirit directly, it is somewhat difficult, but it is comparatively easy to know the spirit itself by the senses of the spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE SENSE OF THE SPIRIT</H2><P>[To know the spirit is to know it by the sense of the spirit. Even up until this day, no one has ever seen electricity itself. The light of a lamp is not the electricity, but an expression, a sign of electricity. We can know electricity by its signs and expressions. Also, no one has ever seen the physical life of a person's being, but we can know the physical life by its expression and by certain senses. In the same principle, the spirit is very mysterious. You can't see it, but you can sense it. You can't see electricity, but when you touch it, you can sense it. In like manner, you can know the spirit by sensing the spirit. To sense the spirit is the way to know the spirit.]</P>
