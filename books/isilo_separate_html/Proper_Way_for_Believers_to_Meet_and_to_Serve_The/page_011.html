<p>The result of being filled with the Holy Spirit is to have joy within. Acts 13:52 says, &ldquo;The disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The Holy Spirit always comes with joy. Furthermore, we will have peace (9:31); we will be calm, without complaints or murmuring, and there will not be any resistance in us. The reason we murmur, complain, and are full of resistance is that we are not filled with the Spirit. If we would be filled with the Spirit, everything within us will be calm, and we will not be affected by any outward turmoil. Regardless of how our outward circumstances change, we would remain calm and enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
THE TRIUNE GOD AS LIFE<br />
AND OUR MEETINGS AND SERVICE</h2>
<p>The Triune God as life is related to the believers&rsquo; meetings and service. This is the proper way for us to meet and to serve. We are qualified to meet and to serve because the Triune God indwells us, His Spirit and our human spirit are joined as one spirit, we can walk according to the spirit in everything, and we can be filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>Such a qualification is not required in Christianity. Many years ago I was led by the Lord to begin meeting as the church in my home with the breaking of bread. At that time, one of my former schoolmates who lived nearby saw what I was doing and decided that since I could break bread at home, he also could break bread at home. Eventually, he used the same table to eat breakfast in the morning, break bread at noon, and play mah-jongg in the evening. Not only so, in Christianity couples who have quarreled severely at home will also go to the Sunday worship and offer money.</p>
<p>The meetings in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery need the qualification of life. In the meetings we must exercise to function by calling on the Lord, singing hymns, praying, and prophesying. If we quarrel with our spouse five minutes before the meeting, we will not be able to open our mouth to sing, pray, or prophesy. Therefore, this way requires that we overcome and are revived.</p>
<p>Likewise, the service in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery requires the qualification of life. It is easy to invite people to come and hear the gospel or to attend a love feast. However, to visit people in their homes or to preach the gospel by knocking on doors requires that we pay a price. If we do not pay a price, even if someone opens the door to us, we will be &ldquo;deflated&rdquo; persons, without the Spirit, and our effort will be wasted because we will not be able to speak with power. In order to speak with the Spirit and with power, we must be filled with the Holy Spirit, which requires us to pay a price.</p>
<p>Only when we take the Triune God as our life can we have proper meetings and service. If we do not have such a life and living, we will not be qualified to meet or to serve. If I were sick with tuberculosis, a stomach ulcer, or other ailments, it would be impossible for me to compete in the Olympics. The athletes who compete in the Olympics are restricted in many matters, including their diet and sleep. This is the only way that they can build up a healthy body and be qualified to compete in the games. Christianity is desolate and weak because the believers are sick. Even in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we have not been freed of this sickness. Hence, when we meet, most of the believers are silent, and we have no way to maintain the meetings without a speaker. This kind of situation necessitates big meetings with one person speaking and the rest listening. On the one hand, such meetings can supply and edify people, but on the other hand, after a prolonged period this way of meeting will annul the organic function of the saints.</p>
<p>A new believer is like a newborn babe whose organs are complete. Even though he is small, he has the senses of hearing, seeing, and smelling and the ability to move. However, he needs exercise in order to develop. A baby whose eyes are kept covered will not be able to see after ten years. If he is not allowed to walk, he will not be able to walk after ten years. The organic functions in a human being need to be developed through exercise. The worship service in Christianity annuls rather than develops the organic function of the believers. The way of one man speaking and the rest listening may provide a long-term supply, edification, and teaching, and it may be used to maintain the situation. However, after meeting in this way for five years, a believer&rsquo;s organic function will be annulled. Such meetings are not according to the Bible. The Bible says that when believers meet, they should testify for the Lord (1 Cor. 14:26). Whenever they meet, they should learn to speak. A mother teaches her child by helping the child to practice speaking. When a child learns to speak, he must learn to exercise his ears, because he cannot learn to speak without the ability to hear. This kind of instruction is for development. We have been enlightened to see that if we desire to take the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must practice accordingly. This requires us to be filled with the Spirit, that is, to be filled with God, in our spirit and to let Christ make home in our hearts. We will then be filled with the fullness of God, and our meetings and service will be full of the riches of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OUTWARD FILLING OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When we speak of being filled inwardly with the Spirit, we must also mention being filled outwardly with the Spirit. The Greek word for the inner filling of the Spirit is different from that for the outward filling of the Spirit. Pouring water into a cup is inward infilling, and putting the cup into the water is outward filling. In 1936 I wrote an article entitled &ldquo;The Work of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; In this article I referred to the work of the Holy Spirit in three steps: regeneration, inward filling, and outward filling. At that time I coined the term &ldquo;outward filling,&rdquo; that is, being filled outwardly. The Spirit is not only in us but also upon us. On the day of Pentecost the Spirit entered into the disciples and was poured upon the disciples. Acts 2:33 says, &ldquo;Having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He has poured out this which you both see and hear.&rdquo; This pouring out is like being baptized, which is outward. When we drink water, we are filled with water inwardly. When we are baptized, we are immersed into the water. Drinking water is to be filled with water, and being baptized is to be enveloped with water. This kind of outward filling is for power, not for life.</p>
<p>Verse 31 of chapter 4 says, &ldquo;When [the disciples] had so besought, the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness.&rdquo; Paul was filled with the Holy Spirit when he went forth to preach the gospel, that is, when it became necessary for him to preach the word (13:9). The outward filling of the Spirit is for the believers to be empowered. I believe that I have the infilling of the Spirit as well as the outward filling of the Spirit while I am speaking the word, because I have the boldness, utterance, and strength to release my burden. I also believe that when I am outwardly filled, others are filled as well. This is the outward filling. This is not a matter of life but of power. It is for our work and our service.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
