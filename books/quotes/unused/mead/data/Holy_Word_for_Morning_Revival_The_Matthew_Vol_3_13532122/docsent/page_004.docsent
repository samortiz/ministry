   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 11 DAY 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 14:14-21</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>14 And going forth, He saw a great crowd.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>15 Now when evening fell, the disciples came to Him, saying, This place is deserted and the hour is already late.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Send the crowds away that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>16 But Jesus said to them, They do not need to go away.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You 1 give them something to 2 eat.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>17 And they said to Him, We do not have anything here except five 1 loaves and two 1 fish.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>18 And He said, Bring them here to Me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>19 And after commanding the crowds to recline on the grass, He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>20 And they all ate and were satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And they took up what was left over of the broken pieces, 1 twelve handbaskets full.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>21 And those who ate were about five thousand men, apart from women and children.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>16 1 The disciples' concept was to ask people to do something; this is the principle of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the Lord's concept is to give people something to enjoy; this is the principle of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>16 2 In this record of the miracle, the Holy Spirit's intention in His inspiration is to show that what the followers of the heavenly King actually need is the proper food to satisfy their hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The disciples of Christ did not know this, nor did the crowds who followed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All that they needed was His resurrection life, which would satisfy their spiritual hunger, as signified in this miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What the heavenly King did indicates strongly and clearly that He provides for the necessities of His followers while they follow Him in this rejecting world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This corresponds with His word in the heavenly constitution saying that the kingdom people need not be anxious about what they will eat 6:31-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>17 1 John 6:9 tells us that these five loaves were barley loaves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Barley is a type of the resurrected Christ Lev 23:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, the barley loaves signify Christ in resurrection as food to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Loaves are of the vegetable life, signifying the generating aspect of Christ's life, whereas fish are of the animal life, signifying the redeeming aspect of Christ's life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For our spiritual hunger to be satisfied, we need Christ's generating life as well as His redeeming life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Both aspects are symbolized by small items loaves and fish.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This indicates that in this age the heavenly King came to His followers not as a great King to reign over them but as small pieces of food to feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>See note 92 in John 6.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>20 1 Twelve handbaskets full of broken pieces indicates not only that the resurrected Christ is unlimited and inexhaustible but also that the Lord's provision for us is abundant, more than sufficient to meet all our need.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although you may say that you do not have anything to offer to the Lord, you at least have yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us give whatever we are to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord needs our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If what we have is kept in our possession, it will be nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whatever you are and whatever you have must be offered to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you do this, in His hand nothing will remain whole.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, everything will be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are not broken, our consecration does not mean anything, and it is not effectual.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No doubt there has been great blessing in the Lord's recovery in this country.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nevertheless, we must realize that some dear ones have offered themselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the Lord's hand, they all have been broken, and those broken pieces have brought in the blessing.</S>
