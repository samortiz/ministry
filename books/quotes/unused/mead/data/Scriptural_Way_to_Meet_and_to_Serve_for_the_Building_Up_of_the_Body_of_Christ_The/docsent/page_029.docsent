   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We may also speak in the meetings according to the apostles teaching by presenting a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Teaching covers a broad field, but we should not go beyond the limit of the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We always should be limited and controlled by the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not try to invent new kinds of teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must always stick ourselves to the New Testament in our teaching concerning any matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even concerning a matter like our dress, we have to give a teaching based upon what is taught in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many of us may be deeply stirred up and very burdened to carry out the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But we should not claim too much freedom in what we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have no liberty to speak anything in the meeting that crosses over the limiting line of the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must be within this line and should always keep this in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Otherwise, we will be the creators of all kinds of confusions and divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why I am setting the limits in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are open to any speaking within the limit of the teaching of the apostles, but we want to bury anything that does not correspond with this unique teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may also present a revelation in the proper Christian meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Any revelation today must be within the limit of the apostles teaching because the divine revelation from Genesis to Revelation has been fully completed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that God s divine oracle has been fully completed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are not any other new points or new thoughts outside of this divine oracle.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a so-called Christian revelation is beyond the teaching of the apostles, that revelation is not from God but is heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whatever revelation we receive should be compared with the apostles teaching and should be limited by it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Mrs. White, the chief leader of the Seventh Day Adventists, fell into error by claiming that she received new revelations from God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormons, also claimed that he received new revelations, but the so-called revelations received by him were great heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our revelation must be limited and controlled by the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first amendment to the Bill of Rights concerning freedom of speech stands out in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those of us who live in the United States may feel that we have the right to say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we open our meeting in the new way to all the saints, this opens the door to all kinds of things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The New Jerusalem has a great and high wall Rev 21:12 , but it may seem that there is no wall in our meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am concerned that some free speechers will come in to speak whatever they think is a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They may say that they have received a revelation based upon what Paul teaches in 1 Corinthians 14:26.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why Paul says in the same chapter that when two or three prophets speak, the others should discern v. 29 . When a prophet speaks, we have to be sober and learn how to discern.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a brother opens the Bible, reads a verse, and speaks based upon this verse, there is no danger of any heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if a person stands up and claims he has received a new revelation, we have to be careful to discern his revelation according to the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way we can guard our meeting from being invaded by different revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>An Exhortation and an Admonition</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the apostles teaching, exhortation is also included Heb 10:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thank the Lord that in the apostles writings, that is, in the New Testament, there are many adequate exhortations.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do not need to invent new exhortations.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the exhortations we need are already in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may also speak an admonition in the meeting according to the teaching of the apostles Col 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not need to invent new admonitions, but we should always adhere to the New Testament teaching.</S>
