   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND SERVING GOD CO-WORKERS' MEETING 13</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Date:6:30 a.m., April 20, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Speaker:Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>MAKING MONEY BEING UNBECOMING</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>OF A CHRISTIAN'S STANDING</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today there are only two ways to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Either one serves God, or he serves mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Of all the Christians in the whole world, perhaps eighty percent serve mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of the remaining twenty percent, perhaps eighteen percent serve both mammon and God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is difficult to find a few persons who will serve God only.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the past, we never mentioned the matter of mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the one hand, it was because we were not faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the other hand, it was because mammon is a difficult subject to talk about.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Mammon itself is unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A Christian should not only consider it wrong to make money by unrighteous means, but should realize that making money itself is improper.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not a question of much money or little money.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's word says that we cannot serve God even by making money by righteous means.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a person has not settled this question, he has not settled the most basic issue.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God made from one all things, and money unifies all things into one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God created all things, and money can procure all things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Any thought of making money is a sign of serving mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rice costs three million dollars a basket.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you try to make three million dollars to buy the rice, you are serving mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Where are you going to make your money?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Will we not feel ashamed to make money from our brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Can we make money from the unbelievers?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, if the president of a country were to make money from a rickshaw coolie, would it not be very unbecoming for him to do such a thing?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are more noble than any president in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The worldly presidents are elected, but we are born kings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I wish that we could give away all our things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is more proper and becoming.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All proper occupations extract riches from nature itself; they do not extract riches from others' pockets.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, if there are two billion people on the earth and everyone has a dollar in his pocket, the total wealth of the world would be two billion dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If I try to make money, I will have to cause the money in my pocket to increase.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order for the money in my pocket to increase, the money in the pockets of others will have to decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How can a Christian extract others' money into his own pocket?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Is it becoming for a child of God to do this?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Any kind of money-making is a reduction of others' wealth and an increase in one's own wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What we have to do is to increase the natural wealth on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why do we have to increase our own wealth at the expense of others' wealth?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How can a Christian do such a shameful thing?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>REJECTING OCCUPATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>OF PURELY COMMERCIAL NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the occupations in the Bible derive their riches from nature.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The fishermen derive their wealth from the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The farmers derive their wealth from the land.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These occupations increase one's own wealth without decreasing others' wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is all right for us to increase our own wealth, but not at the expense of others' wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The increase of the herd of Abraham and Isaac was a blessing from God Gen 24:35; 26:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But the increase of the herd of Jacob came from Laban 30:37-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The increase in the herd of Abraham and Isaac was right, but the increase in the herd of Jacob was wrong, because in making the increase, he did injustice to Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today, there are many people like Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If this problem is not solved, we cannot serve God in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As a minimum requirement, we cannot engage ourselves in money-making jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to reject any work that is purely commercial in its nature.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Ezekiel 28 mentions the king of Tyre, who refers to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He fell because of the multitude of his merchandise.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Merchandising is a purely commercial activity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Ezekiel 28 is the record of the first commerce, whereas Revelation 18 is the record of the final commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Ezekiel 28 is the beginning of world commerce, whereas Revelation 18 is the consummation of world commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Revelation speaks of "the merchants of the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The word merchants here refers to great entrepreneurs.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Antichrist will use Babylon to carry out his commercial activities.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Pure commerce is not just a matter of money, nor is it a matter of gold or silver.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Rather, it is a question of where the money is coming from.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Today, we have to pay attention to how money comes in. It is all right for me to increase my wealth, but I cannot decrease society's wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For example, to turn iron into steel is to contribute something to society, and such kinds of work are proper.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today, our thoughts have to be controlled by God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Those who are for money see nothing but money.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They do not see how many fishes have been added; they only see how many dollars have come in. Pure commerce is too great a temptation for man.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is why we have to make a complete turnabout in many things in the days ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Jews were originally farmers, tillers, shepherds, and laborers.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But after they became degraded and were scattered into the nations, they became the most numerous and powerful merchants on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the Old Testament, God allotted the lands to the Israelites and charged every one of them to work on their own land.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Jews learned the lesson through this, and they would not want to work for others or to have others work for them.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They would rather manage their own business.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Here is a serious hurdle, and one that is difficult to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We have to ask God to turn our thoughts around.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is wrong to make money.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Somehow, we have to be delivered from money.</S>
