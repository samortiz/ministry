   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Refuting Job 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Saying That God Would Never Do Evil</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Elihu went on to refute Job, saying that God would never do evil and that the Almighty would never commit iniquity v. 10 . Rather, God will render a man's work to him and will cause a man to receive that which is according to his own way v. 11 . In verses 12 through 20 Elihu spoke further concerning God's not doing evil and not perverting justice.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verses 12 through 15 he declared, "Indeed in all certainty God will not do evil,/And the Almighty will not pervert justice./Who has ever put the earth in His charge?/Or who has ever set in order the whole world?/If He were to consider Himself only,/He would gather back to Himself His spirit and His breath;/All flesh would perish together,/And man would return to dust."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Saying That God Governs and Judges</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>the Nations and Men Not to Fit Job</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verses 21 through 33 Elihu continued to refute Job, saying that God governs and judges the nations and men not to fit Job, since Job had rejected it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Elihu said that God's eyes are upon the ways of a man and that He sees all their steps; that He, knowing the actions of the mighty men, breaks them in pieces without inquiry and puts others in their stead; and that He strikes them as He would evil men because they turned aside from following Him and would not regard any of His ways.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Toward the end of this speech, Elihu asked Job, "Should He recompense to fit you, since you have rejected it?" v. 33a .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By reading chapter thirty-four, we can realize that Elihu was a person who was full of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This young man should have considered that Job and his three friends already knew all the things that he was speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But he was so full of knowledge, he said that he would burst if he did not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have often wondered why this book does not say that Job and his three friends and Elihu came together to pray by exercising their spirits to touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I cannot understand how such a group of godly men could come together without any prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They just exercised their minds.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Their speaking was all composed of poetry.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even Elihu's word was spoken in poetic form.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That requires much exercise of the mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why would they not pray together to seek the Lord's mind, to seek the Lord's purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What a pity that they did not do this!</S>
