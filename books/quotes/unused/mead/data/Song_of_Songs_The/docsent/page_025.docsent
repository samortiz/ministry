   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>But the most that the watchmen can do is to show the way or the teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to meet the Lord, you have to go to the Lord yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No watchman can do this for you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Finding the watchman is not the same as finding the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every seeking heart must deal directly with the Lord and be dealt with directly by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although the watchmen are useful, they sometimes turn out to be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the Lord is dealing with you, you will not receive anything if you depend too much on others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You have to see that you have to leave the watchmen in order to find the way to the Beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may experience the same thing as this maiden, who meets her beloved as soon as she leaves him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Going about the city is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But we cannot find the Lord this way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The broad places are necessary, but they will not lead us to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord wants her to take only one way, which the watchmen cannot help her to find.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 4 says, "It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now she finds the beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It does not mean that going about the city is absolutely justified, and it does not mean that the streets and the broad places are the right places to go.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nor does it mean that she was perfected by confessing her failures before the watchmen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are still many lessons for her to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She is not only in the Lord's heart; she is also in the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The fact that she is able to find the Lord again is not a sign that she has been perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It merely means that the Lord realizes that she can only take so much testing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although she is still far from perfection, her desperation for the Lord causes Him to gladly reveal Himself to her.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He brings this period of testing to a conclusion and waits before taking her on further in the way ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The seeking of a person who is not in complete union with the Lord is mixed and imperfect.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the Lord does not have the time to deal with this mixture now.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the initial period of experience, the Lord is willing to allow those who seek to find, even though their seeking may not be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This experience is like that which is described in Ezekiel 47:3-5, where one is measured and brought through the water.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord has measured her, and He is now taking her through.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This portion of the journey has been under the Lord's measuring.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"I held him, and would not let him go."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She thinks that she has regained what she lost.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She may think that she lost Him because she did not hold tight enough.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, she holds Him tight now.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once she was not alert enough in her feelings, and she allowed Him to slip away.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now she has to be watchful to guard Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although she realizes that she needs to come out before she can be with the Lord, her heart's desire is still for His presence in her feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Part of the lesson of coming out has been learned, but the lesson of faith has not yet been learned.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She has indeed risen, but she has not yet gone away with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She has not been brought to the point where she allows the Lord to come and go as He pleases.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She does not realize that in a life of faith, it is impossible to retain the feeling of the Lord's presence forever.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>She still holds on to this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She has not realized that the feeling of His presence should be allowed to come and go.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When He is pleased to give us the feeling of His presence, we can have it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But when He is not pleased to give us this feeling, we should gladly relinquish it, holding on to Him and on to all that He is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the maiden does not know this yet.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She still thinks that the best experience is the feeling of His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She is still not aware of even though she may have heard of it a way and a life of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, she holds Him tight and will not let Him go.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Little does she realize that holding with the flesh will only result in more loss.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A spiritual pursuit allows the Lord to have the full freedom in everything, whereas a soulish pursuit plans everything for oneself, even though he is seeking the Lord's presence.</S>
