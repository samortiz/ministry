[1]  CONTENT Abiding in the Lord and Enjoying His Life Living by the Lord in Spirit Unceasingly Praying and in Everything Giving Thanks Not Quenching the Spirit or Neglecting the Lord's Word Not a Matter of Sin but a Matter of "I" In the Holiest Place, Live Within the Veil Experiencing the Cleansing of the Lord's Blood and Enjoying the Anointing of the Holy Ointment
[2]  CHAPTER ONE ABIDING IN THE LORD AND ENJOYING HIS LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:1-3; 2:27-28; John 15:4-5 FOUR MYSTERIOUS MATTERS
[3]  ABIDING IN THE LORD BEING THE SUBJECT OF JOHN'S WRITINGS
[4]  Although many saints throughout the ages have seen the matter of abiding in the Lord, according to what we have read and to our knowledge of the truth in the Bible, we can say that there has not yet been a book written which covers the matter of "abiding in the Lord and enjoying His life."
[5]  The purpose of our speaking about abiding in the Lord at this time is that we may enjoy the Lord's life.
[6]  For the accomplishment of His economy, God especially created a spirit in us that He might dispense Himself, the Triune God, into us to be our life, so that we could be one with Him and become a dual-natured entity, an entity with both humanity and divinity, for His expression.
[7]  But after believing in the Lord, even though we may not have said it aloud, within us we had the concept that we were believing in a religion, and in our living we practiced a religion, which means that we practiced "regulating our heart."
[8]  For example, before we believed in the Lord, even though we may not have committed great crimes, we still liked to take the easy way out or take advantage of others; then after believing in the Lord, we felt in our heart that we had believed in a religion, so we should not do anything bad.
[9]  The Lord's salvation is that He dispenses Himself into us as our life.
[10]  John says that the Lord Jesus, who is the Word of life and the inner life, was manifested, and John saw Him and even touched Him with his own hands.
[11]  It is not that we are humble because the Bible teaches us to be humble; instead, we are humble because when we abide in the Lord and enjoy His life, we live Him out and He Himself becomes our humility, ethics, and morality of a higher standard.
[12]  CHAPTER TWO LIVING BY THE LORD IN SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 14:19-20; 6:57; Gal 2:20; Phil 1:21a; Rom 8:4 ABIDING IN THE LORD BEING A CRUCIAL TRUTH IN THE NEW TESTAMENT
[13]  I remember that not long after I was saved, I was helped to know that the Lord was in me and I was in the Lord.
[14]  Although I studied the truth of this matter until I became clear, I still did not understand the factual and experiential aspects.
[15]  For example, in the past I did not know that to abide in the Lord is to enjoy the Lord's life, nor did I know that the real enjoyment of the Lord is to abide in Him.
[16]  A PROPER CHRISTIAN LIVING BEING A LIFE IN WHICH WE LIVE BY THE LIVING PERSON WITHIN US
[17]  For this reason, the Lord Jesus in John 14 told His disciples, "I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality; He abides with you and shall be in you" vv.
[18]  Therefore, the Lord Jesus continued by explaining, "Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live.
[19]  According to my experience, it is easy for us to be in the Lord when we encounter big or difficult things, but when we encounter small things or fine details in our living, we often neglect to abide in the Lord or live by Him.
[20]  TO LIVE BY THE LORD BEING TO LIVE AND WALK BY THE SPIRIT
[21]  If you reason even just a little with your spouse, then you know that you are not in the Lord because you have not lived by the Lord.
[22]  In the same way, if your inward lightbulb does not shine but is flickering, it means that you are not in the Spirit, nor are you abiding in the Spirit; you are a "flickering" Christian who is not firmly in the Lord.
[23]  CHAPTER THREE UNCEASINGLY PRAYING AND IN EVERYTHING GIVING THANKS Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 5:17-18; Col 3:16-17; Eph 5:18b-20 ABIDING IN THE LORD CONTINUOUSLY
[24]  In chapter two we saw that for us to abide in the Lord and enjoy His life, we need to live and walk by the Spirit.
[25]  As those who pursue the Lord, we should always pray and petition, longing to abide in the Lord continuously and enjoy His life that we may shine and function every day in a normal way.
[26]  THE CHRISTIAN LIFE ULTIMATELY BEING A MATTER OF GIVING THANKS IN EVERYTHING
[27]  Apparently, we cannot find the truth of giving thanks in everything throughout the whole Bible.
[28]  The first of these books, 1 Thessalonians, speaks of how we can be saved and how we should have a holy life so that our spirit, soul, and body may be wholly sanctified, making us ready to meet the Lord at His coming.
[29]  When I first became a Christian, I was amazed when I read in the Bible that we should unceasingly pray.
[30]  CHAPTER FOUR NOT QUENCHING THE SPIRIT OR NEGLECTING THE LORD'S WORD Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 5:17-21; Col 3:16-17; Eph 5:18b-20
[31]  Prayer: O Lord, we thank and praise You from the depths of our heart for gathering us once again.
[32]  For this reason, we really look to You to take care of the needs of everyone, especially the newly saved ones, that we may be full of light within and have Your word as a base to know assuredly that we have been saved, and that every one of us may become living to flow out Your life from within us.
[33]  In addition to abiding in the Lord, we need to give thanks in all things and to pray unceasingly.
[34]  A CHRISTIAN NEEDING NOT ONLY TO HAVE THE LORD AS LIFE BUT ALSO TO LIVE IN SPIRIT
[35]  Then the Lord showed me that it is not adequate to have life and yet be without the Spirit.
[36]  THE SPIRIT TODAY BEING IN US AND ALSO POURED UPON US
[37]  I like to tell you that on that day of Pentecost God's work to save us was completely accomplished.
[38]  God not only had become a man, lived the human life on earth, and died on the cross to bear our sins, but He also resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit, entered into His disciples, and poured out the Spirit.
[39]  Therefore, this Spirit is the Triune God the Holy Father, the Holy Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[40]  TO ABIDE IN THE LORD REQUIRING US NOT TO QUENCH THE SPIRIT
[41]  By thus digging away all the obstructions, the living water will flow, and spontaneously we will be abiding in the Lord.
[42]  Fifty years ago when I read this verse, I felt I did not know what was meant by the inspiration of the Spirit, so how could I quench it?
[43]  CHAPTER FIVE NOT A MATTER OF SIN BUT A MATTER OF "I" Scripture Reading: John 6:57; Gal 2:20; 1 Cor 15:10; Phil 1:20b-21a
[44]  However, according to my personal experience, if you want to abide in the Lord and enjoy His life, you must understand that this is not a matter of whether you sin but of whether it is you who live.
[45]  GOD CREATING MAN WITH THE PURPOSE THAT MAN MIGHT TAKE GOD AS HIS CONTENT AND THEREBY EXPRESS GOD
[46]  NO LONGER I WHO LIVE, BUT CHRIST WHO LIVES IN ME
[47]  Only the biblical concept is superior to the human concept; its highest goal is not for man to be a perfect man without any sin or transgression, but for man to live God's life that God may live in man.
[48]  HE WHO EATS THE LORD LIVING BECAUSE OF THE LORD
[49]  The Lord Jesus said, "As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me" v. 57 . The living Father sent the Lord Jesus.
[50]  However, the Gospel of John tells us that when the Father God sent the Lord Jesus, the Father God came with and in the Lord Jesus.
[51]  CHAPTER SIX IN THE HOLIEST PLACE, LIVE WITHIN THE VEIL Scripture Reading: Heb 10:19-20; 4:16; 1 Cor 3:16; 1 Thes 5:23
[52]  Prayer: O Lord, we worship You that You have gathered us before You, and we believe that You are with us.
[53]  How good it is that we can be here around Your word, and by this we can draw near to You and contact You as the Spirit!
[54]  O Lord, we really thank You that, as our Savior, You died on the cross for our sins, You bore all our offenses, You were judged by God for us, and You were raised from the dead.
[55]  THE TYPES OF THE TABERNACLE AND THE HOLY OF HOLIES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT
[56]  In the Old Testament, when the Israelites came out of Egypt and journeyed through the wilderness, God commanded Moses to build a tabernacle for Him so that He could be with the children of Israel.
[57]  DWELLING IN THE HOLIEST PLACE AND LIVING WITHIN THE VEIL
[58]  ABIDING IN THE LORD AND ENJOYING HIS LIFE BY ENTERING INTO THE HOLY OF HOLIES TO TOUCH THE THRONE OF GRACE
[59]  What does it mean to abide in the Lord and enjoy His life?
[60]  First, we must know where this Lord is whom we want to enjoy.
[61]  CHAPTER SEVEN EXPERIENCING THE CLEANSING OF THE LORD'S BLOOD AND ENJOYING THE ANOINTING OF THE HOLY OINTMENT Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:6-10; 2:20, 27; Lev 14:14-18
[62]  In this message we will go on to see another aspect of abiding in the Lord and enjoying His life, that is, experiencing the cleansing of the blood and enjoying the anointing of the ointment.
[63]  Our God, however, is our Redeemer today, and by the cleansing of His blood and by His becoming the Spirit He now abides in us.
[64]  Thus, we have a feeling within us and know that God wants to do a certain thing, so we follow Him to do it.
[65]  Despite the fact that this matter is clearly explained in 1 John, it is still not easy for us to understand because the human concept does not have this thought and because it is very deep, mysterious, and abstract.
[66]  Hence, in the New Testament, the apostle John first wrote his Gospel telling us that Jesus Christ was God who came in the flesh and died for us; then in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit to give us the eternal life.
[67]  When we believe and receive Him, He comes into us as the life-giving Spirit and gives us the eternal life.
[68]  Then John continued his writings with 1 John, telling us that whoever is regenerated with the life of God to be a child of God has this eternal life inside him and that this life brings a fellowship.
[69]  If we speak the truth, we must confess that we have a sinful nature within and sinful deeds without.
[70]  Therefore, this Spirit is the Triune God, our Lord Jesus, the Creator, the Redeemer, the Savior, the life-giving Spirit, and life, compounded with all the items of His human living, His death, His resurrection, and all that He is.
[71]  When you hear the gospel, when you hear people preaching the Bible, your spirit within you is moved because your spirit can touch this Spirit, who is God Himself, that is, the Lord Jesus Himself.
