   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Holy and the Faithful Things of David</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 13:34 Paul speaks a further word regarding the resurrection of Christ: As to His having raised Him up from the dead, no longer to return to corruption, He spoke in this way, I will give you the holy things of David, the faithful things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verses 33 and 34 are concerned with the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 33 indicates that Christ s resurrection was His second birth to bring Him forth as the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God promised to give Him to His people, and this resurrected One is the holy and faithful things of David.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The phrase the holy things of David, the faithful things indicates that Christ was of David, for it was out of David s seed that God raised up such a One.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To God, the resurrected Christ is the firstborn Son, but to us, He is the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, He is a great gift given by God to His chosen people, and this gift is entitled the holy things...the faithful things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Greek word for the holy things...the faithful things here is in the plural.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The same Greek word is used for Holy One in the next verse, but in the singular.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, it is not the regular word for holy; it is a Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word chesed, which is translated mercies in Isaiah 55:3, 2 Chronicles 6:42, and Psalm 89:1, both in the Septuagint and in the King James Version.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Psalm 89 the word mercies in plural in verse 1 KJV is the same word as for Holy One in singular in verse 19.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This Holy One is Christ, the Son of David, in whom God s mercies are centered and conveyed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the holy things of David, the faithful things refers to the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is fully proved by the context, especially by Your Holy One in the next verse, and by the verse following Isaiah 55:3.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul s thought in Acts 13:33 and 34 is very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The resurrected Christ, who is God s firstborn Son brought forth through His second birth, His resurrection, is the holy and faithful things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 34 the word faithful means trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The resurrected Christ is the holy and faithful things God gives to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here Paul indicates that the resurrected Christ is not only our Savior bringing us God s salvation and that He is not only the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This resurrected One is also the holy and faithful things as a gift given to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is easy for us to understand that Christ is our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is more difficult to understand that Christ is the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But it is very difficult to understand that the resurrected Christ is the holy and faithful things given to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The holy and faithful things cover a wide span, a span much wider than that covered by the titles Savior and firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The phrase the holy things...the faithful things is actually a divine title, a title of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In these verses Christ is called the holy and faithful things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Savior God raised up out of the seed of David has become the holy and faithful things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These holy and faithful things are all the aspects of what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the New Testament, Christ is life, light, grace, righteousness, holiness, sanctification, and justification.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is also the bread of life and the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, the holy and faithful things include all the aspects of Christ unveiled in 1 Corinthians: power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption, glory, the depths of God, the unique foundation of God s building, the Passover, the unleavened bread, the spiritual food, the spiritual drink, the spiritual rock, the Head, the Body, the firstfruits, the second man, and the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We see many more aspects of Christ in the Gospel of John, such as the Shepherd and the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Oh, how much Christ is to us as the holy and faithful things!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As the resurrected One, He is the firstborn Son, the Savior, and all the holy and faithful things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Old Testament the holy and faithful things are regarded as mercies.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Isaiah 55:3 speaks of the sure mercies shown to David.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Second Chronicles 6:42 mentions the mercies of David, the Lord s servant, and Psalm 89:1 says, I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Mercy implies both love and grace, but it reaches further than love.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Where love and grace cannot reach, mercy can reach.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the holy and faithful things are Christ Himself as mercies to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Life is a mercy, and light is also a mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Likewise, righteousness, holiness, justification, and sanctification are mercies.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In chapter ten of the Gospel of John we have the door, the pasture, and the Shepherd, all of which are mercies.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we took time to count all the aspects of these mercies, we would have a long list of mercies.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A husband s love for his wife and the wife s submission to her husband are Christ as mercies to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a husband, in Christ, loves his wife, this surely is a mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His love for her is Christ Himself as a mercy to him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In a similar way, if a sister, in Christ, submits to her husband, that also is a mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Her submission is Christ Himself as a mercy to her.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our speaking the word of God year after year inexhaustibly is certainly Christ as a mercy to us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is not a matter of our ability or gift.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is altogether a matter of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Not only is it a mercy for us to speak the word of God, but even the dear Savior is our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our speaking is Christ, and to us this speaking Christ is a mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Though our speaking may not be eloquent, our speaking may be full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is wholly due to Christ being a mercy to us in speaking the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all need to see that the resurrected Christ is all the holy and faithful things as mercies given to us by God as an all-inclusive gift.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This was the Christ preached by Paul in Acts 13.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Paul, in his gospel message, not only preached Christ from the Old Testament, but also preached the resurrected Christ as the holy and faithful things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Actually, what Paul proclaimed here in his preaching of the gospel requires all the Epistles written by him for its definition.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, if we want to see more concerning Christ as the holy and faithful things, we need to study the fourteen Epistles of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In his preaching Paul set up an excellent pattern for us to follow in our gospel preaching today.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Like Paul, we need to preach Christ in a rich and uplifted way.</S>
