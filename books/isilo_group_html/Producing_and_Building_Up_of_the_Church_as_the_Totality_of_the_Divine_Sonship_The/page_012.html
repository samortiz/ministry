<p>Since the divine life has come into our spirit, our spirit is no longer merely an organ. Before we were regenerated, our spirit was an organ for our soul, which was our person, but through regeneration our spirit has become our new person. The person of an unbeliever is his soul, but the person of a believer is his spirit. Since we have had two births, we no longer have only one person. Moreover, the two persons within us often fight against each other. It is very crucial, therefore, that we see that our person today should no longer be our soul but our spirit. The soul, our old man, the person produced by our first birth, has been crucified and buried with Christ in baptism (Rom. 6:4-6). The part of our being that is buried with Christ is not our body or our spirit but our soul with our old person. Now, in resurrection, our soul is simply an organ for our regenerated spirit. We must not let our soul be our person, but neither should we discard our soul. If we discard our soul, we will not be able to think, feel, or make decisions. We still need our soul as an organ. Formerly, our two organs were our body and our spirit, but now our two organs are our body and our soul.</p>
<p>Previously, our person was our soul, but now our person is our regenerated, reborn, spirit. Formerly, our spirit was merely an organ without life, but now our spirit has the divine life in it, which makes it our new person. Therefore, in a very real sense, we are no longer souls but spirits. As spirits, we are very different from angels. Angels are spirits (Heb. 1:13-14), but they do not have the divine life, and they do not have a soul and a body as organs. We, the believers, are spirits with the divine life, and we also have our soul and our body as our organs. Because we are regenerated, we are a new person, a new being. Formerly our person was our soul, but now our person is our spirit. That which is born of the Spirit is not a body, a good heart, a renewed will, or an adjusted emotion. John 3:6b says, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; Since we have been born of the Spirit, we are a spirit, a wonderful spirit with a soul and a body as organs.</p>
<p>The Bible tells us that when we receive a vision from God, it is sweet in our mouth but bitter in our stomach (Rev. 10:9-10; Ezek. 2:8&mdash;3:3). The vision is bitter in our stomach because it causes us to lament when we consider how the traditional teachings in Christianity have taken the things of the Bible and misused them according to the natural human concept. Not many Christians realize that their person has changed. Today we must look to the Lord that we may see that since we have been reborn, our person is no longer our soul but our spirit. If we see this, we do not need to look for a way to overcome sin. Both sin and the world are related to our old person, which has been crucified and buried. Therefore, the world and sin have nothing to do with us. We are a new person, and this person is a spirit. Whenever the world, sin, our temper, or any such thing comes to us, we should say, &ldquo;You have come to the wrong person. My old person was buried with you, and now I am a new person. My old person&rsquo;s name was Adam, but my new person&rsquo;s name is Christ. Little sin, why are you coming to visit Christ? Go away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need a vision to see what we are now. We do not merely have a created spirit; now we not only have but also are a regenerated spirit. This is not a small matter. To be regenerated means that we have another life and have become another person. The other life is Christ (John 11:25), the embodiment of the Triune God, and our regenerated spirit, indwelt by the embodiment of the Triune God, is our new person. If we were still souls, we could not be members of the Body of Christ. This needs to become a vision to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST BECOMING<br />
THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT TO INDWELL US</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Producing the Church<br />
through His Incarnation,<br />
Crucifixion, Resurrection, and Ascension</h2>
<p>According to the revelation of the Bible, Christ is unlimited (3:31, 34; Eph. 1:23; 4:10). Christ is all and in all, the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End (Col. 3:11; Rev. 22:13). There was nothing before Him, and there will be nothing after Him. He is everything. First, He is God. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; According to verse 14, this very Word who was God became flesh. Christ&rsquo;s incarnation brought God into humanity and made God one with man. After this incarnated One lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, He went to the cross to accomplish His wonderful, all-inclusive death, which took away all the negative things in order to produce the church. Then He was resurrected, and in resurrection He, as the one grain of wheat, was multiplied to become many grains (12:24). We, the believers in Christ, are Christ&rsquo;s multiplication, duplication, and reproduction. Following His resurrection, He ascended to the heavens and positioned us also in the heavens (Eph. 2:6). According to our position, we are not on the earth but in the heavens, because we are attached to the ascended, exalted Christ (2 Cor. 1:21). We must not look at ourselves. We must look at Him. He is in the heavens, and since we are attached to Him, we are in the heavens also. Not only so, but we were also released by Christ&rsquo;s ascension. While we were on the earth, we were entangled, bound, and involved in many earthly things, but now that we are attached to Christ, we are in the heavens, where there are no more entanglements, no more earthly involvements, and no more bondage.</p>
<p>Moreover, Christ&rsquo;s ascension has furnished, equipped, and constituted us as gifts for our function (Eph. 4:7-8, 11-12, 16). We should all proclaim, &ldquo;Hallelujah, I can function!&rdquo; We can all pray, praise, speak for the Lord, and preach the gospel. If we do not do this, it is because we have never seen our position of being attached to the exalted Christ. The factor that equips us is our position. Because we have been positioned and equipped, we can all function. If we see that we are in the third heaven, we will be able to speak boldly to anyone to tell him that he needs Christ as his life. We need to see that we are in the heavens and that we are fully equipped. Then when we come to the church meetings, we will have much to speak. Everyone will function, and everyone will appreciate others&rsquo; functions.</p>
<p>This is altogether different from the situation in today&rsquo;s Christianity, in which there are many religious, dead, natural, human teachings and rituals. People know mainly that Christ died for their sins as their Redeemer and Savior, but they suppose that while they are waiting to go to heaven, they need to behave properly in order to glorify God. Many even think that since God cares for them as their Father, they may ask Him for many things, such as a new car or a better house. This is the poor situation in religion, where there is little vision of Christ. Today the Lord is recovering our vision and experience of the riches of the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and indwelling Christ. We must all see that such a Christ has accomplished everything by His death, resurrection, and ascension. Now all the negative things are gone, and we have become the many grains, the many brothers, the multiplication, of the resurrected Christ. Moreover, we have also been positioned in the heavens and afforded, furnished, and equipped with everything we need for our function.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Producing and Building Up of the Church as the Totality of the Divine Sonship &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
