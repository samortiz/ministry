   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JUDGES MESSAGE SEVEN THE MISERABLE HISTORY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF ISRAEL S FORSAKING OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>CHAPTERS 2 16 5 THE SIXTH CYCLE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF ISRAEL S MISERABLE HISTORY Scripture Reading: Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>10:6 12:15</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have the burden to speak further concerning forsaking God and being joined to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This matter is fully revealed and recorded in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first man was poisoned by this, and the first family was devastated by this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ever since the time of Genesis 3, man has been forsaking God and joining to Satan, taking many things as replacements of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In his fourteen Epistles, Paul ministered the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ, but he also dealt with all kinds of replacements of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The book of Judges shows us how degraded and corrupt Israel had become.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is hard to imagine that the children of Israel, who had been chosen, taught, trained, and disciplined by God and who had God s law, could have become so rotten.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their degradation began with their forsaking of God and their worshipping of idols, and it issued in their indulgence in fleshly lust and in wanton self-destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Samson, the last judge mentioned in this book, was very powerful, yet the factor of his failure was his indulgence in sex.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the end of Judges, there is an account of wanton slaughter, describing how the entire tribe of Benjamin was nearly extinguished by Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The factor that led to this degradation was that they forsook God to the uttermost and turned to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here we see that idol worship is closely linked to fornication and murder.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If someone becomes an idol worshipper, he will become a person who is very indulgent in sex and full of hatred toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have been serving the Lord for nearly sixty-one years and have had much consideration concerning these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My realization is that all the sins, all the evils, all the iniquities, come out of one source forsaking God and joining to something which becomes a replacement of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is true even in small things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, a sister s combing of her hair can be an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a sister pays too much attention to her hair, honoring it excessively, that kind of honor is a worship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a sister may not have time in the morning to spend ten minutes with the Lord, but she has plenty of time to comb her hair.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The sisters may need to check with the Lord regarding this, saying, Lord, is the way I care for my hair a replacement of You?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a sister checks with the Lord in this way, the Lord will tell her, her conscience will tell her, and her intuition in her spirit will also tell her.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In recent years, certain ones left us and formed divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It seems that the leaders among them are doing nothing but traveling from place to place in order to create and strengthen such divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Division has become a thing that motivates and energizes them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The goal of their activity is to separate the saints from the enjoyment of the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Their intention is to poison the saints in order to deaden them, cool them down, and cause them to have doubts about the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The main factor with these ones is that they have left the church and joined themselves to the demon of division.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have published a book called The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion, presenting the whole story, fully documented.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That book concludes by saying that we need to reject any kind of division 1 Cor 1:10 , to stand against any wind of teaching and any spreading of spiritual death Eph 4:14; 2 Tim 2:16-17 , and to separate ourselves from the contagious ones exercising to quarantine Titus 3:10; Rom 16:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some, however, have not agreed to quarantine these ones and have embraced division.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They have been deceived to such an extent that they take the matter of division as an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In our spiritual life, even to take a small thing, such as combing our hair or buying something, may be to take another husband.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To some extent, this is to forsake Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even in holding a thought preferring this or that thing, our preference can become an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You may say that you are still with the Lord, but you may be with the Lord in a general way, but particularly, in a certain thing, you may not be with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God s Spirit is indwelling us and is speaking to us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sometimes I would like to speak something to my wife, even something spiritual, but someone within is saying, Don t talk.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To take my preference to speak that thing would be to make that thing an idol and would bring me into chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But to obey the inner speaking is to hold to our one Lord, one Master, one Head, one Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let us now turn to Judges 10:6 12:15 and consider the sixth cycle of Israel s miserable history.</S>
