<h2 class="head1">BRINGING UPON THEMSELVES SWIFT DESTRUCTION</h2><p>Peter says that the false teachers will bring upon themselves swift destruction. No doubt, this means that destruction will come upon them.</p><p>In this Epistle Peter uses three different Greek words concerning the consequence of the apostasy under God&rsquo;s judgment. <i>Apollumi</i> signifies to destroy utterly; in middle voice, to perish, as in 3:6, 9. The idea is not extinction, but ruin, loss, not of being, but of well-being. Its usage in Matthew 10:28; 22:7; Mark 12:9; Luke 17:27, 29; John 3:16; 10:28; 17:12; 1 Corinthians 10:9, 10; 2 Corinthians 2:15; 4:3; 2 Thessalonians 2:10; and Jude 5, 11 unveils more of God&rsquo;s governmental judgment.</p><p><i>Apoleia,</i> akin to <i>apollumi,</i> indicates loss of well-being, not of being, ruin, destruction, or perdition (physical, spiritual, or eternal). It is used for &ldquo;destruction&rdquo; in 2:1 (twice), 3; 3:7, 16. The same word denotes different results of God&rsquo;s varied judgments (see second paragraph of note 17<sup>2</sup> in 1 Pet. 1). In cases such as those described in 2 Peter 2:1, 3; 3:7; John 17:12; Rom. 9:22; Phil. 1:28; 3:19; 2 Thessalonians 2:3; and Revelation 17:8, 11, it denotes eternal perdition. In cases such as those described in 2 Peter 3:16 and Heb. 10:39, it denotes the punishment of God&rsquo;s governmental discipline, not eternal perdition. In Matthew 7:13 and 1 Timothy 6:9, it denotes a principle for any case.</p><p><i>Phthora</i> denotes corruption unto destruction, destruction that comes with corruption, destroying by means of corrupting, of morality, soul, and body. It is used for &ldquo;corruption&rdquo; in 1:4; 2:12, and 19, and for &ldquo;corrupting&rdquo; in 2:12. The verb form, <i>phtheiro,</i> is used in future passive voice for &ldquo;shall be corrupted&rdquo; in 2:12, and in present passive voice for &ldquo;are being corrupted&rdquo; in Jude 10. Its significance can be further seen in Romans 8:21; 1 Corinthians 3:17; 15:33; 2 Corinthians 7:2; 11:3; Galatians 6:8; Revelation 11:18; and 19:2.</p><h2 class="head1">CAUSING THE WAY OF TRUTH TO BE REVILED</h2><p>In verse 2 Peter continues, &ldquo;And many will follow their licentiousness, because of whom the way of the truth will be reviled.&rdquo; The way of the truth is the path of the Christian life according to the truth, which is the reality of the contents of the New Testament (1 Tim. 2:4; 3:15; 4:3; 2 Tim. 2:15, 18; Titus 1:1). It is designated by other titles according to its various virtues, like the straight way (2 Pet. 2:15; see Heb. 12:13), the way of righteousness (2 Pet. 2:21; Matt. 21:32), the way of peace (Luke 1:79; Rom. 3:17), the way of salvation (Acts 16:17), the way of God (Matt. 22:16; Acts 18:26), the way of the Lord (John 1:23; Acts 18:25), and the way (Acts 9:2; 19:9, 23; 22:4; 24:22). It was slandered as the way of heresy (Acts 24:14).</p><p>Because of the false teachers, the way of the truth will be reviled. Since the way of the truth is the way of reality, and the way of reality is the way of God&rsquo;s economy, this means that the false teachers will cause the entire revelation of the New Testament to be reviled.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S GOVERNMENTAL JUDGMENT</h2><p>In verse 3 Peter goes on to say, &ldquo;And by covetousness with fabricated words they will make merchandise of you, for whom the judgment of old is not idle, and their destruction does not slumber.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s first Epistle stressed God&rsquo;s governmental judgment (1 Pet. 4:17-18). This is continued in the second Epistle. Under God&rsquo;s government the fallen angels were caught and are being kept for judgment (2:4), and the age of the deluge and the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were all judged (vv. 5-9). But God will especially mete out serious judgment to the New Testament heretics (v. 10). And all the ungodly will be judged and destroyed at the day when the heavens and earth will be burned by fire (3:7). Because of this, the God of justice and holiness has begun His governmental judgment from His own household&mdash;the believers.</p><p>In verse 3 Peter indicates that as God exercised judgment upon the false teachers of old, that is, in ancient times, as illustrated in 2:4-9, so He will also exercise judgment upon today&rsquo;s false teachers. Peter says that for such ones the judgment is not idle, and their destruction does not slumber. God&rsquo;s judgment is not idle. This judgment will come upon the false teachers, and they will be destroyed.</p>
