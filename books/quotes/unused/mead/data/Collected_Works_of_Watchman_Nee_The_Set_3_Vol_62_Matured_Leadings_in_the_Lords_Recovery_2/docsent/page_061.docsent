   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VARIOUS ARRANGEMENTS IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN PREPARATION FOR THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the church has a gospel move, everyone has to coordinate and work together as one man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the gospel meeting is conducted in the meeting hall, all the brothers and sisters have to do their best to invite people to come.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ushering</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ushering is very important in a gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In particular, there is the need of proper arrangements in ushering visitors to their seats.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a preacher sees something wrong in the way his audience is sitting, the power of his speaking will be reduced by one half, even if he is a very good speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A gospel friend feels uncomfortable when there is too little or too much ushering.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not pass out tracts to the friends during the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This will distract their heart and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The ushering brothers and sisters must be sensitive but inconspicuous.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They should let their presence be felt only when they are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sitting beside Friends</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to appoint brothers and sisters to sit by every gospel friend.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They can help the friends to find the right hymn and the right verses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They can sing with them or read the verses with them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If necessary, they should say a few words softly to the friends or stand up with them to pray and to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, those who are sitting among the visitors should not speak too much.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They should not try to set up a little separate "platform" of their own.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do not do anything, we do not realize the technique involved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once we do something, we realize that nothing is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is like trying to keep our white shirt clean.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It does not become dirty if we do not wear it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once we wear it, however, it is hard to keep it clean.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are many things we need to pay attention to in sitting with new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we are not careful, they will not receive the necessary help.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Getting Their Names</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to pay attention to helping the new ones give us their names.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In helping them to leave their names, we must not only get the names but also take care of their reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In talking to them, our attitude and tone have to be proper and natural.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not interrogate them like a census taker.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>While our friends are listening to the gospel, we should pay attention to their response.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we observe that some are touched, we should help them receive the Lord in a proper way after the message.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In filling out forms for our friends after the gospel meeting, we should not only write down objective facts but also their reaction to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this way, others can render them the proper help.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When I was in Chefoo, we had a brother who worked in the customs department.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After he was revived and touched by the Lord's love, he brought many of his colleagues to salvation, but his wife was against his faith in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once, he invited a few brothers to his house for a meal and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His wife treated the brothers coldly and only served leftovers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In spite of this, he eventually brought his wife to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He did it by first inducing his wife to come to a gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>While I was speaking, he noticed that his wife was listening attentively.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>She was touched but dared not stand up.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No one was sitting beside her.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The next day she came again.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She was very touched by my word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Her face turned red and tense.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I was secretly keeping an eye on her.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At that critical time, no one dared speak to her.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eventually, the Lord worked in her in a mighty way, and she stood up and received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If someone had been there to help her, it would have been much easier for her to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Following Up</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not invite people to come to a gospel meeting and then let them go away easily.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After the meeting, we have to follow up with discussions with them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In a gospel meeting, the message is only fifty percent of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Another twenty-five percent of the work lies in sitting with the friends, making various arrangements, and helping them to write down their names.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The last twenty-five percent of the work consists of our follow-up discussions with our friends.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are not here to be pew members, inquirers, or nominal Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Every one of us has to speak the mystery of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The fire of the gospel should be as fierce as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The hotter the fire, the easier it is for people to get saved.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is like the fire we use for cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The heat should be as high as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Otherwise, the food will not be cooked.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The conclusion of a gospel meeting is the follow-up conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is a work that the whole church should participate in.</S>
