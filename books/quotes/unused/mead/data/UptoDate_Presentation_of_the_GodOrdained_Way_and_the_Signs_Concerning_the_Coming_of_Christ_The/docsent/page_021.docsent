   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ANTICHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 24:3 says, "And as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, Tell us,...what is the sign of Your coming and of the consummation of the age?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In His reply in the succeeding verses, the Lord first spoke concerning Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 15 the Lord said: "When therefore you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place let him who reads understand ."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This will definitely be fulfilled in the last three and a half years of the present age, the time of the great tribulation, the second half of the last week.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time Antichrist's image will be set up as an idol in the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4 Paul also said, "Let no one deceive you in any way; because it will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or an object of worship, so that he seats himself in the temple of God, proclaiming himself that he is God."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This shows us that before the consummation of the age, Antichrist must first appear; he will play a leading role in the last week.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Revelation 13:1 points out that a beast, which signifies Antichrist, will come up out of the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This beast has seven heads and ten horns.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Revelation 17:8-11 tells us the origin of this beast.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The seven heads of the beast are seven Caesars of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to historical records, the Roman Empire had a total of twelve Caesars, but only six of them were referred to in Revelation, because all these six were "fallen" Rev 17:10 and note ; that is, they all died unnaturally they either committed suicide or were murdered, their throne being usurped.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Antichrist, the seventh Caesar, will come from one of the Gentile nations around the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He will have the support of ten kings, and they will unite to form a great empire, which will be the revived Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He will make a covenant with Israel for seven years and permit them to freely worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After three and a half years, Antichrist will be slain temporarily; then the spirit of the fifth Caesar Nero of the Roman Empire will come up out of the abyss and enter into the dead body of Antichrist to resurrect him to be the eighth Caesar.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Antichrist will break the covenant and begin to persecute the Israelites and the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He will also set up his image in the temple Matt 24:15; 2 Thes 2:4 , until the complete destruction that is determined will be poured out upon the desolator, that is, upon Antichrist Dan 9:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Antichrist will be the Caesar of the revived Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once he makes a seven-year covenant with Israel, that will be the beginning of the last week.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today, this last week is not yet manifested because the Roman Empire is not yet revived; but as we observe the world situation, it seems that the restoration of the Roman Empire will take place soon.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the previous two years we all have seen the great change in the world situation, a change that is beyond our imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, the Soviet Union is proceeding with a reformation and has declared her renunciation of communism.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then a number of her satellite countries have risen up to copy her action.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now East Germany and West Germany are unified.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, the entire situation in Europe is pushing toward the direction prophesied in the Bible for the restoration of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When that time comes, Antichrist will appear.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Matthew 24 the Lord gave a clear revelation concerning the restoration of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verse 32 the Lord said, "But learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To the saints, the fig tree is a sign of the consummation of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Matthew 21:19, during His last visit to Jerusalem, the Lord Jesus cursed a fig tree because He could not find any fruit on it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The fig tree is a symbol of the nation of Israel Jer 24:2, 5, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because Israel was stubborn and rebellious and had no fruit that could satisfy God, she was rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In A.D. 70, Titus, the Roman prince, brought with him a great army to destroy Jerusalem and the temple, as prophesied by the Lord when He said, "A stone shall by no means be left upon a stone which shall not be thrown down" Matt 24:2 . From that time, the children of Israel were scattered among the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not only did their nation fall, but even their homeland was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Humanly speaking, there was truly no hope for the nation of Israel to be reformed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, the Bible contains a prophecy saying that one day the cursed and dried up fig tree would become tender and put forth leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I was newly saved, shortly after the end of World War I, many books concerning Bible prophecy were published.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After studying the prophecies, I had doubts in my heart, wondering how it could be possible for the nation of Israel to be reformed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Holy Land belonged altogether to the Arabs, and the site of the temple had been occupied for seven centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, since this prophecy is the word in the Bible, I dared not be unbelieving.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 1948 I was working in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day the newspaper carried a report on the front page: the nation of Israel had been restored!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When I heard the news, I almost jumped up in great excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The fig tree truly had "become tender."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then, after another nineteen years, in 1967, during the six-day war, Israel seized Jerusalem; that was the fig tree "putting forth leaves."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At that time I was even more excited.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I knew that the summer was near, right at the door; it would not be long before the full restoration of the nation of Israel would take place.</S>
