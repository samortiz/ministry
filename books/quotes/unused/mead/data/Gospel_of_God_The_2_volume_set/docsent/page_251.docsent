   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Following this, verse 9 says, "And if your eye stumbles you, pluck it out and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into the Gehenna of fire."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This shows us that if a saved person does not deal with his lust, he will not be able to enter into life, but will go into eternal fire.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The eternal fire here is the Gehenna of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible shows us that a Christian has the possibility of suffering the Gehenna of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although he can suffer the Gehenna of fire, he cannot suffer it forever.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He can only suffer it during the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Matthew 18 is not the only portion of Scripture that says this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Other portions of the Bible also contain the same teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5 7 contains clear words of the same kind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Matthew 5:21-22 says, "You have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'You shall not murder, and whoever murders shall be liable to the judgment.'</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And whoever says to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the judgment of the Sanhedrin; and whoever says, Moreh, shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the beginning of chapter five, we read that the Lord Jesus saw the multitude.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But He did not teach the multitude; rather, He taught the disciples v. 1 . The Sermon on the Mount is for the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the one who reviles others in verse 22 is a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He calls another brother Raca, that is, good-for-nothing, or Moreh, that is, a fool.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When he calls his brother this way, he shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This does not refer to an unsaved person, for an unsaved person will go to hell even if he does not call anyone Moreh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every time the Bible talks about works, it refers to one who belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If such a one does not belong to God, there is no need to mention such things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a saved person, a brother, but because he has reviled his brother, he is liable to the Gehenna of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 23 says, "Therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many times others hold things against us on purpose, and there is nothing that we can do about it; but if others complain because of our reviling, we have to be careful when we offer up our gift at the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you think poorly of a brother and have spoken something against him, you have to go to him and deal with the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift" v. 24 . The important thing is to be reconciled to your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 25 says, "Be well disposed quickly toward your opponent at law, while you are with him on the way."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Your brother is the plaintiff, and you are the defendant.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now he is bringing you to court: "Lest the opponent deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Such a thing will happen in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The kingdom is very strict.</S>
