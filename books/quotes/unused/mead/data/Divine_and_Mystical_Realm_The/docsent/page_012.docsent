   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE DIVINE AND MYSTICAL REALM OF THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT AND THE PNEUMATIC CHRIST Scripture Reading: John 14:10-11; Phil 1:19; Rom 8:9; 2 Cor 3:17-18; John 14:16-20; 1 Cor 15:45b; John 20:22; 16:12-15; 15:4-5, 8; 17:21, 23 OUTLINE The divine and mystical realm: The Son is in the Father, and the Father is in the Son John 14:10-11.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This indicates that the Father is embodied in the Son and the Son is the Father's embodiment, forming a divine and mystical realm.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The divine and mystical realm of the consummated Spirit and the pneumatic Christ Phil 1:19; Rom 8:9; 2 Cor 3:17-18: Another Comforter, the Spirit of reality, to be the reality of the Son realized as the Son's presence in the believers John 14:16-18.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the day of the Son's resurrection in which the Son became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b , He came to the disciples in the night of that day to breathe into them and asked them to receive the Holy Spirit John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By all this we can know that the Son is in the Father, the believers are in the Son, and the Son is in the believers John 14:19-20.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before and after that day of Christ's resurrection: Before that day of Christ's resurrection: Christ had yet many things to unveil to His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But His disciples could not bear them then John 16:12 because they had not received the Spirit of Christ's resurrection and had not entered into the divine and mystical realm.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After that day of Christ's resurrection: When the Spirit of reality would come, He would guide the disciples, who would then be in the Spirit of Christ's resurrection, into all the reality concerning God's economy for the Body of Christ, who is the pneumatic Christ and the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He would speak what He heard of Christ and would declare to the disciples in the twenty-two Epistles of the New Testament from Romans to Revelation John 16:13.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The divine transition for the eternal economy of the Divine Trinity: All that the Father has is the Son's possession, embodied in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All that the Son possesses is received by the Spirit, realized by the Spirit who became the life-giving Spirit in the resurrection of Christ for the realization of the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Spirit receives all that Christ has and declares to the disciples who were then in the reality of Christ's resurrection and in the divine and mystical realm of the pneumatic Christ for the producing of the assemblies which issue in the Body of Christ that consummates the New Jerusalem to express the all-inclusive Christ for His glorification in eternity John 16:14-15.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the believers should be in this divine and mystical realm of the consummated Spirit to be mingled with the Triune God for the keeping of oneness: All the believers should abide in the Son that the Son may abide in them that they may bear much fruit for the glorification expression of the Father John 15:4-5, 8.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the believers should be one; even as the Father is in the Son and the Son in the Father, that they also may be in both the Father and the Son the Son is in the believers and the Father is in the Son, that they may be perfected into one John 17:21, 23.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ's heavenly ministry is carried out in this mystical realm, and God's organic salvation is practically accomplished in this realm.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The believers must consider highly the entry into this realm, realizing that without Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit, without Christ being the pneumatic Christ, without Christ being the Lord Spirit, and without Christ being the Christ in resurrection and not only in the flesh, there is absolutely no way for the believers to participate in, experience, and enjoy the organic section of God's complete salvation in Christ.</S>
