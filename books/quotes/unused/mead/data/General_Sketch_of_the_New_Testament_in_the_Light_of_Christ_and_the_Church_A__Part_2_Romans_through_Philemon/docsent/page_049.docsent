   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Raising Us Up Together with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second, God raised us up not only from the grave but from the earth to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we were dead in sins, we were fallen to the lowest level, even to the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But God raised us up to the highest point, even to the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Seating Us in the Heavenlies with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Third, we were seated in the heavenlies with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A person sits down only when his work is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, to be seated means that everything has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In one sense, the church will be built, but in another sense, the church has been built up already.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the one hand, the Lord still must work on us, but on the other hand, He already has finished His work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He has made us alive, raised us to the heavenlies, and seated us together with Christ and in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When did God make us alive?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Christ was resurrected, His entire Body was made alive and raised up together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then in His ascension He brought us to the heavens and seated us with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, in God's divine point of view, the church has been built already; everything is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may worry about the building of the church, but God does not worry because it already has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot understand this, but it is a fact which has been revealed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>John 2 records that when the Jews were trying to kill the Lord Jesus, He told them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" v. 19 . When I was young I thought that this referred only to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, in these last years the Lord showed me that according to 1 Peter 1:3 all of us were regenerated through the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When Christ was crucified on the cross, we were crucified there also.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same way, when Christ resurrected, we resurrected with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we died in Him, were resurrected in Him, and were seated in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In God's sight everything has been accomplished and completed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through Christ's resurrection and ascension the church has been produced.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is what is revealed to us in Ephesians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ's History Becoming Our Experience By the Transmission of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What God accomplished through Christ and in Christ must become our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, Christ is Christ, and we are we.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He resurrected and ascended nearly two thousand years ago in a place far away.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How then can the resurrection and ascension of Christ be our experience?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How can we be in Christ, how can Christ be in us, and how can God's accomplishments in Christ be ours?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not sufficient to answer that it is by identification.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even more, it is by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may illustrate the Spirit by transmission through electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By means of electricity, something that happens in Los Angeles can immediately be brought into our presence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By the same transmission, people in America and the Far East can speak with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Without electricity, only my direct audience can hear me, but by the transmission of electricity, people in the uttermost part of the earth can hear me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because of electricity, the problem of space and time is eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the same way, there is no problem of space or time with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What Christ has accomplished and what God has wrought in Christ have all been compounded into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now the Spirit has come into us, and we have been put into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, what Christ has accomplished is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church is produced by the resurrection and ascension of Christ, which are applied to us by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we take these matters merely as doctrine, they can never be our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They will merely be a formula in our mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only when we realize these things in the spirit do they become our experience.</S>
