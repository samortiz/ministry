   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE KING'S ANTECEDENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND STATUS 4</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We come now to the last part of the genealogy of Christ according to Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous message I said that this part of the Word is not milk or meat, but bones.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the points in this message will help us penetrate the bone and see what is inside it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>R. David the King Begetting Solomon</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Matthew 1:6 says, "David begot Solomon."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Compare this statement with the record that says, "Nathan, which was the son of David" Luke 3:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nathan also was the son of David.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The genealogy in Matthew says that the son of David was Solomon, and the genealogy in Luke says that the son of David was Nathan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we read 1 Chronicles 3:1 and 5, we see that these are two different persons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Luke's record is the genealogy of David's son Nathan, who was Mary's forefather, whereas Matthew's record is the genealogy of David's son Solomon, who was Joseph's forefather.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One genealogy is the line of Mary, the wife's line; the other genealogy is the line of Joseph, the husband's line.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Both Mary and Joseph were descendants of David, but they were from two families descended from the same grandfather.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One family is the family of Solomon; the other is the family of Nathan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Under God's sovereignty Mary and Joseph, descendants of these two families, were betrothed and brought forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ may be counted as the descendant of David through both Solomon and Nathan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the reason He has two genealogies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Solomon's relationship with Christ was not direct.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Strictly speaking, Solomon was not a direct forefather of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His relationship with Christ was indirect through his descendant Joseph's marriage to Mary, of whom Christ was born Matt 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Old Testament did not say that Christ would be Solomon's descendant, but it prophesied repeatedly that Christ would be the descendant of David 2 Sam 7:13-14, 16; Jer 23:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although Christ was not a direct descendant of Solomon, the Old Testament prophecies concerning Christ were nevertheless fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>S. Rehoboam</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We proceed to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon Matt 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With Rehoboam, the kingdom of David was divided 1 Kings 11:9-12; 12:1-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Of the twelve tribes, one tribe was kept for David's sake 1 Kings 11:13 , that is, for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ needed the kingdom that belonged to the house of David because Christ had to be born as the heir of David's throne.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the whole kingdom had been dissolved, nothing would have remained to allow Christ to be born as David's royal heir.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, God preserved one of the tribes for David.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Apparently it was preserved for David; actually it was preserved for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After this division, the kingdom of David was in two parts: the northern part, called the kingdom of Israel, and the southern part, called the kingdom of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The northern part was called the kingdom of Israel, a universal name, because it was made up of the ten tribes of Israel; the southern part was called the kingdom of Judah, a local name, because it was composed of the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As far as you are concerned, which title has the better meaning the kingdom of Israel or the kingdom of Judah?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I would surely favor the kingdom of Israel, for that is something universal, something for the majority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I would never favor Judah, because Judah is too local, too narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, although the kingdom of Israel was more universal than that of Judah, in the genealogy of Christ, not one name of the kings of Israel is included.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They were universal, but they were excluded from the generation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They were excluded because they were not associated with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This picture, like all other items in the Old Testament, was written for our learning, and it is a type of the occurrences in the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We see the same thing today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In principle, at the beginning the church was one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But after a certain time, the church was divided, not into two parts, but perhaps into more than two thousand parts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some may say, "Were not those in the kingdom of Israel still the people of God?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Certainly they were.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They were the people of God, but they were outside of the line of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be outside of the line of Christ means that, although you are God's people, you are not for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You are for something other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Consider the situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are all real Christians, and we are all God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But are we solely, purely, fully, and ultimately for Christ or are we for something else?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you are for something other than Christ, then you are outside of the line of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For this reason, none of the kings of the northern kingdom, the larger and more universal kingdom, is included in the genealogy of Christ.</S>
