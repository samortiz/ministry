   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Shepherding</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The third responsibility of an elder is to shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Acts 20:28 Paul said to the elders in Ephesus, Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers to shepherd the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this verse shepherding does not refer to being the head sheep but to being a shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first thing a shepherd must do is to supply food to the flock by preparing all that the flock needs for food and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The elders need to prepare spiritual food for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Promoting</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The fourth responsibility is promoting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In addition to leading, teaching, and shepherding, the elders need to promote the work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The elders should be the ones who promote the work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church can be compared to a car and the elders, to a driver.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A car without a driver will not move.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is a saying in the Philippines that illustrates the function of a driver: The car is here, but the head of the car is not here.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that the driver is the head of a car.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church is likened to the car and the elders to the driver.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A church should never be in the situation where the car is present, but the head of the car is absent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The elders should always remember that even if they do well in leading, teaching, and shepherding but do not know how to promote, they are still not up to the standard of being an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without a driver, a car will not move even if there is gas.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The elders in each meeting hall must take the responsibility to drive the car.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A businessman who can produce superior ideas makes more money.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The most valuable managers in the business field are those who can come up with ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>During the Sino-Japanese War, there were several businessmen living in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When they saw that the war was going on in earnest and that every country was using sulfur to make ammunition and matches, they realized that sulfur would be in short supply.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>So they began to stock up on matches, and true to their prediction matches came to be in short supply.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They then sold the matches at more than ten times the regular rate and made a profit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In terms of promoting the work, all the elders should learn from these businessmen and come up with ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They should not be ones who do not know how to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The elders should always exercise to come up with ideas to promote the work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Suppose in one meeting hall there are over eleven hundred saints on the list, but six hundred do not meet regularly and only about two hundred fifty saints meet on Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The elders in that meeting hall need to come up with ideas, because there is too much work to be done.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They might not be able to recover all six hundred saints who have not been meeting, but they can at least try to recover half of them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They should make a plan to recover ten percent of the saints in three months.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then they should work on another plan to recover another ten percent in the next three months.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The elders need to have ideas concerning the principle of the work and concerning the details.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church in Taipei urgently needs practical ideas in order to recover one hundred saints in three months.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For many years no one has been recovered, but we must practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every meeting hall will be entrusted to two responsible brothers who need to be accountable to come up with ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In addition, we are opening up four areas for the co-workers: the gospel in the schools, the small groups, the community gospel, and the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The co-workers are happy with this arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now the elders can labor in these areas.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have a great possession, and our need is to promote it in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even our possession in Taipei is great.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the Lord s Day there are three thousand saints meeting in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a great possession.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Things will happen when the elders begin to promote.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our lack in the past was that we did not promote things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For this reason, as soon as the work on the Life-study of the New Testament was finished, I put down my pen and said, I am returning to Taiwan to promote things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to pray for this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church in Taipei is large, with at least eleven thousand saints.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, only six to seven thousand saints are in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It seems as though these six to seven thousand saints alternate in attendance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You come to the meeting when I do not come, and he comes to the meeting when you are absent.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As a result, only three thousand saints are in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we would gradually promote the gospel, truth, life, and the church among the saints, there will be results.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is an urgent need.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must promote these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are led by the Lord to begin promoting the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, all the elders need to promote the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once all the responsible brothers assume the responsibility of the meeting halls, the first matter for them is to study how to promote the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The small groups must be promoted among us.</S>
