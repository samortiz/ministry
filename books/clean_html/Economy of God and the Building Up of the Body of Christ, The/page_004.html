<p>On man’s side, we are also of three parts. Outwardly we have a body. Inside the body we have the soul. Within the soul is the spirit. Hence, Paul said in 1 Thessalonians that God wants to sanctify our whole spirit, soul, and body (5:23). Although we are small, we are not simple. Within this small man, there are a lot of levels. Outwardly we have a visible form. Within this form there is a soul, which is our personality, the seat of our self. In the depth of our being, there is still one more part, which is our spirit. The spirit is for us to worship God and to contact God. If we exercise our mind, we will not find God. But if we would forget our thoughts and would exercise our spirit to call “O Lord Jesus” a few times, we will touch God in the depth of our being and will feel that God has touched us. This proves that our spirit within us wants God. It also proves that God is real, true, and living. If you call any other name such as that of Confucius or Washington, you will not have any feeling, even if you were to call a hundred times. The reason for this is that they are all dead and buried. But if you call “O Lord Jesus” in whatever language, whether it be English, Korean, or Chinese, you will have a certain feeling within. Perhaps you will feel that you have wronged Him. Perhaps you will want to praise Him, or perhaps you will want to tell others how good Jesus is. This proves that Jesus is the living God, and He is living within you. I believe all of us who have believed in the Lord Jesus have this kind of experience.<p>Hence, we have to see that the God revealed in the Bible is the Triune God. He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. We also are of three parts. The Triune God desires to work Himself into the tripartite man. First, He enters into our spirit to regenerate us. Next, He wants to increase His territory within us. He desires to expand from our spirit to our mind, emotion, and will. This requires that we hand ourselves completely over to Him. We have to surrender to Him our mind, thoughts, emotion, love, and decisions. In this matter we always have our reservations, and we are always debating and bargaining with the Lord. The Lord is not satisfied with gaining our spirit only. He wants to go one step further to gain our soul.<p>What is sanctification? To be sanctified is to have the Lord Jesus gain our inward parts step by step. When the Lord gains your mind, your mind is sanctified. When He gains your emotion, your emotion is sanctified. This is the renewing and transforming mentioned in the New Testament. Our spirit is sanctified already, but our soul must be transformed. Now the Lord is transforming us every day until the day He comes when He will transfigure our body. By then even our body will be sanctified, and He will gain all of the tripartite man. Our spirit, soul, and body will all be occupied and saturated by Him, and He will be fully manifested from within us. This is the basic thought of God’s economy.<p>God’s economy is the Triune God working Himself bit by bit into us the tripartite men. The revelation of the New Testament shows us that the Lord Jesus who saved us is the embodiment of the Triune God. He desires to work the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—into us. Therefore, we the believers have the Father in us, the Son in us, and the Spirit in us. Paul said in 2 Corinthians 13:14, “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.” The Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—is enjoyed by us here. How mysterious! Our God is not one but three. But though He is three, yet He is still one. Our human mind can never understand this. We can only acknowledge it as such. The entire Triune God is here; the love of the Father is here, the grace of the Son is here, and the fellowship of the Spirit is also here.<p>This is not all. On our side, we are not of one part only. Rather, we are of three parts. There is the spirit, the soul, and the body. The Triune God is not just in our spirit; He is spreading out from our spirit. The question is whether or not we would allow Him to spread. Are we willing to be subject to Him and to give Him all the ground? When we give Him all the ground, He will gain us completely to be His living members, coordinating with all the members to become His Body. This is God’s economy. The whole Bible is a record of this. In the Old Testament it is revealed in types. In the New Testament it is unfolded in revelation
