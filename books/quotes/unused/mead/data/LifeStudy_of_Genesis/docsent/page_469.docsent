   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE EIGHTY-TWO BEING TRANSFORMED 5 f Jacob's Doing 1 Building a Pillar</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall still dwell on the experience at Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 35:14, at Bethel Jacob eventually set up a pillar of stone as he did after having the dream when he was at Bethel the first time 28:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There, this pillar of stone was called the house of God 28:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If Jacob had not called this pillar the house of God, we would never realize that the pillar of stone was for the building of God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We would think that it was simply a mass of rock.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But now we know that this stone can become a house.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This indicates that the pillar will become a building, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the book of Genesis, there are two kinds of pillars the pillar of stone 28:18; 35:14 and the pillar of salt 19:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Which kind of pillar do you want to be?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Certainly, we all want to be pillars of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The pillar of stone indicates building in strength.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Solomon set up two pillars in the porch of the temple 1 Kings 7:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first pillar was named Jachin, which means, "He shall establish," and the second was named Boaz, which means, "In it is strength."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The pillar of stone not only indicates building, but building in strength.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The pillar of salt indicates shame, for a pillar of salt is useless for God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lot's wife, who was one of God's called people, became a pillar of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She should have been building material, but due to her degradation she became shameful material.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During the course of this life-study, we have seen again and again that nearly everything in this book is a seed of the truth that is developed in the following books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The way to study Genesis is to trace all its points in the subsequent books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The way to study the book of Revelation is just the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you would understand Revelation, you must trace its points backward in the foregoing books.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this message we need to follow the development of the seed of the pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>a A General Sketch aa.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For the Temple</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After Solomon built the temple, he purposely added the two pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to our natural concept, we would think that Solomon should firstly have built the pillars and then the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But it was after he had built the temple that he proceeded to build two pillars and to place them in front of the temple 1 Kings 7:15-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we could have seen that temple, our eyes would have firstly attended, not to the temple itself, but to these two pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The size of these pillars is seemingly out of proportion to the size of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The disproportionate size of the pillars is significant.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It indicates that the two pillars in the temple are like a huge signboard.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today, when we approach a certain building, there is a sign designating what that building is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Likewise, in front of the temple were two pillars which said, "God shall establish," and, "In it is strength."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These two pillars declare to the whole universe, including mankind, Satan, and all the fallen angels, that the Lord establishes and that strength is in the building.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Bible emphatically says that the first pillar is called Jachin and the second Boaz.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have pointed out that the name Jachin means, "He shall establish" and that the name Boaz means, "In it is strength."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This reveals clearly that the building of God's house is altogether dependent on the pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the reason that Jacob did not build the house of God, but only set up a pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In chapter twenty-eight, Jacob was still a supplanter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nevertheless, this supplanter received both the vision and the interpretation of the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He interpreted his vision, his dream, by setting up a pillar and calling it God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This interpretation was much better than Daniel's interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Daniel merely interpreted; he did not set up anything or take any action.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Jacob, however, not only interpreted his dream verbally, saying, "This is the house of God"; he also set up a pillar and called it the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How could Jacob, an unrepentant, unregenerated, and untransformed supplanter, have done such a wonderful thing?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Nevertheless, he did it, and we all must say, "Thank you, Jacob, for opening the heavens that we might see the house of God."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For the building of God's house, the heavens were opened by a supplanter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I believe this because the Bible tells us so.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I do not trust in my concept, for according to my concept, it would be impossible for a supplanter to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I could easily believe that a godly and pious person like Daniel, a man who prayed daily, could have interpreted a spiritual dream.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But it seems neither fair nor logical for a supplanter to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But he did it spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is absolutely a matter of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As Romans 9:11 indicates, it is "not of works, but of Him who calls."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Romans 9:13 says, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Grace is not a matter of fairness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not question God, saying, "God, why do You hate Esau?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To me Esau is better than Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is unfair for You to love Jacob and hate Esau."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To this, God would reply, "I simply love Jacob and hate Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What do you have to say about this?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When I hate, I have the position to hate, and when I love, I have the grace to love."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Who are you Esau or Jacob, a good man or a supplanter?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We all must confess that we are Jacobs, heel-holders, supplanters.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The church is filled with heel-holders.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you are not a heel-holder, you will miss God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are true heel-holders, but we are heel-holders in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>No one can deny this.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I can shout and declare, "Praise the Lord that I am a heel-holder in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Grace makes me different."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Although in chapter twenty-eight Jacob was a supplanter, by the time we come to chapter forty-eight we see that this supplanter has been thoroughly transformed into a man of God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This man of God is the pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In a sense, the house of God was built with this pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When you enter into the temple of God in the universe, the first thing you see is this God-man, this Israel standing before God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After Jacob was transformed into Israel, he stood in front of God's building as a signboard of God's house.</S>
