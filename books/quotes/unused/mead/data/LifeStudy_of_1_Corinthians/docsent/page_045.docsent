   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEAKNESS, FEAR, AND TREMBLING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 3 Paul goes on to say, And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Weakness here refers to the apostle s physical weakness due perhaps to his physical sufferings in the persecutions he endured for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul did not display himself as a physically strong man among the Greeks, who sought to be strong not only psychologically in their philosophies, but also physically in their gymnastics.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul reminds the Corinthians that he was with them in fear and in much trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Fear is the inward feeling; trembling is the outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The apostle was in fear of missing Christ in his ministry to the wisdom-seeking Greeks and in trembling lest he be influenced by their prevailing aspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By such fear and trembling he stood faithfully and steadfastly in his God-appointed ministry according to the heavenly vision and avoided any deviation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The religious Jews were proud of their traditional religion, and the philosophical Greeks were haughty in their worldly wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In ministering Christ to both, the apostle was in fear and in much trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What a contrast between him and them!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul realized that it is difficult to preach Christ to philosophical people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is easy to be snared by philosophy or tempted to try to subdue the other person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we speak to others about Christ, it is best to forget what kind of people they are and simply proclaim the testimony concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Like Paul, we should be in fear and trembling lest we miss Christ as we talk to philosophical people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>DEMONSTRATION OF SPIRIT AND POWER</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 4 says, And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and power.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Persuasive words of wisdom issue from the human mind; demonstration of the Spirit comes from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The apostle s speech and preaching were not from his mind with words of speculation, but from his spirit with the release and exhibition of the Spirit, hence of power.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verse 5 Paul says, That your faith may not be in men s wisdom, but in God s power.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Men s wisdom is the elementary philosophy; God s power is the all-inclusive Christ 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verses 4 and 5 Paul repeats what he has said previously.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His words are different, but his concept is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul did not exercise persuasive words of wisdom, but the demonstration of the Spirit and of power.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The power demonstrated by Paul was Christ crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The result of such a demonstration was that the believers faith would not be the result of Paul s wisdom overcoming their wisdom, but would be in God s power, the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In centuries past both the Nestorians and the Jesuits attempted to convert the learned Chinese to Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some Chinese did embrace the Christian religion because of their efforts; however, they did so without actually receiving Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Mainly they were influenced in certain aspects of culture and learning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By this we see that it is a mistake to come down to someone s level when we preach Christ to him and try to use his language and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In preaching Christ we need to maintain our level, and this level is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let those who are willing come up to this level and receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then they will become genuine believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The efforts of both the Nestorians and the Jesuits ended in failure simply because they came down to the level of local ethics and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many Christians today are making a similar mistake, a mistake we must learn to avoid.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A VISION OF GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We in the Lord s recovery must have a clear vision of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we need to be governed, controlled, and directed by this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because I have seen this vision and am directed by it, I have never changed my tone throughout the years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I know what I have seen, I know what I am teaching, and I know what I am ministering to the Lord s people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we have the vision of God s economy, we shall automatically have only one choice, preference, taste, and ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We shall care only for the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ and for the genuine and proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today we in the Lord s recovery must be strong and unshakable in the vision of God s economy, God s eternal will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because Paul had seen this vision and was faithful to it, he could be very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all need to be strong and steadfast in this way.</S>
