in the Appointment of Elders</h2>
<p>Since we have learned the lesson, there will be a number of conditions in our appointing of these elders. There are no rules concerning retirement, but there will nevertheless be several conditions. First, the appointment of elders at this time is temporary, not definite. I have been overseas for many years, and only the current elders know everyone well. Therefore, I cooperated with them to make these appointments. However, no one can do a thorough and adequate job in appointing forty-six brothers to be elders within only a few days. We can only make a temporary arrangement according to the urgent need. After a period of time we may need to make adjustments. In some places there may be a shortage of elders, in other places there may be too many elders, and in still other places the arrangement may not be appropriate. We will make adjustments according to the situation, and there will inevitably be some corrections when the adjustments are made.</p>
<p>Second, we hope that those appointed to the eldership would be at the height of their physical and mental strength; that is, they should be between thirty and fifty years old. This has a biblical basis. The Levites in the Old Testament entered into the tabernacle to assume their services at the age of twenty-five and continued serving until the age of fifty (Num. 8:24-25). They had many responsibilities that they would not have been able to fulfill after they were fifty years of age. Hence, the duties of the Levites fell on the shoulders of those who were between the ages of twenty-five and fifty. We will apply this principle to ourselves. The responsibility of the elders should fall on the shoulders of those who are between the ages of thirty and fifty. Unless a person is exceptionally strong physically and mentally, it is not so easy for him to function as an elder after the age of sixty-five. In all the countries around the world the retirement age is around sixty-five years. This principle is the issue of history and human experience. Since a person&rsquo;s physical energy decreases when he turns sixty-five, he should no longer assume certain responsibilities. Therefore, this will be a condition. This is not a rigid rule, but it is good to have such a principle.</p>
<p>Third, even though a brother might be able to bear the responsibility of an elder, his condition can change in three or five years. It is not necessary for him to remain in the eldership when he can no longer meet the need of the church. Suppose an elder who is not yet fifty years old becomes ill, and his illness is not serious enough to confine him to bed, but his physical strength is not enough for him to bear the responsibility in the church. In this situation it is not necessary for him to remain in the eldership. Otherwise, not only does he suffer harm by remaining in the eldership, but he may also hinder the work of the church. Under such a circumstance, he should not wait for the church to ask him to resign; he should take the initiative to resign. This is a proper situation.</p>
<p>Suppose the elder&rsquo;s situation has not changed, but his vision and experience enable him to take care of only a meeting hall or a church with one hundred saints. If, after a period of time, the number in the church increases to three or five hundred, this elder will be unable to bear the heavier burden. If he forces himself to remain in the eldership, he is limited in his service, and he will also hinder the work of the church. According to the practical need, he should step down and allow someone more able and qualified to be appointed. We need to know ourselves, and we need to know our situation. When the environment changes and we are unable to meet the need of the church, we should resign and let others bear the responsibility. We hope that these additional conditions will be explained in all the localities.</p>
<p>Fourth, in the New Testament there is only one portion that speaks of how a sinning elder should be punished. First Timothy 5:20 says, &ldquo;The ones who sin reprove before all.&rdquo; This should also be included as one of the additional conditions in the appointment of elders.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUPPLYING THE WORD,<br />
TEACHING, SHEPHERDING, AND VISITING</h2>
<p>The new elders should not only administrate but also promote the work. The saints who handle administration need to be experienced and have a vision, and those who promote need to have energy. For a church to be strong, not only should it establish small groups and have an adequate eldership; it should also be in the supply of the word, teaching, shepherding, and visiting. The supply of the word is related to teaching, teaching is related to shepherding, and shepherding and visiting are also related. Hence, for a church to be strong, it needs to pay attention to these four things: the supply of the word, teaching, shepherding, and visiting.</p>
<p>If there are one hundred saints in a church, twenty saints should be involved in shepherding and caring for others. This is related to the small groups. The saints who shepherd and visit must have some experience in life; they need a certain measure of life and some knowledge of the truth. A person who is experienced in life and knows the truth is able to teach. As he gains more experience in teaching, he can be a teacher and serve as an outlet for the word. This is the relationship between supplying the word, teaching, shepherding, and visiting. In learning to visit others, we must learn to speak, and what we speak needs to be according to life and truth. Hence, we must know the truth and progress in the truth. Gradually, we will be able to speak the truth in the meetings. If we progress further, we will be able not only to speak one message but also to release the Lord&rsquo;s word, which becomes the supply of the word. This is the line of supply and shepherding.</p>
<p>The function of a small group is to connect the members. The members in a group are connected and upheld. The function of an elder is to administrate and promote the work in the church. Ministering the word, shepherding, teaching, and visiting are to supply the saints. Through the supply of the Lord&rsquo;s word the saints are shepherded and receive care. One out of every five saints should be a source of supply of the word in the way of teaching. If twenty percent of the saints in a church with three thousand saints are able to supply the word, there will be six hundred saints who are responsible for supplying the word, shepherding, teaching, and visiting the saints.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, these functions are outside of the elders&rsquo; responsibilities. Some elders are gifted in the word, but because they are still burdened with a job or business and are not serving full time, they can only serve locally. Such saints are qualified to administrate and promote the work in one place. They can also share the burden to supply the word. Furthermore, it is fitting for the elders to teach and shepherd the saints. The Bible clearly says that the elders should shepherd the flock of God. First Peter 5:2-3 says, &ldquo;Shepherd the flock of God among you...[not] as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock.&rdquo; In addition, 1 Timothy 3:2 says that elders should be &ldquo;apt to teach.&rdquo; Therefore, an elder&rsquo;s function is also related to supplying the word, visiting, teaching, and caring.</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to the elders, in every church or meeting hall twenty saints should be charged to teach, shepherd, and visit. We have only recently begun practicing the small groups; therefore, whether you are an elder or a co-worker, an older saint or a younger one, you should go to lead a small group and strengthen it. As the small groups gradually become stronger, we can set aside twenty percent of our manpower to do the work of shepherding and teaching. If necessary, the twenty percent do not have to join the small group gathering. This is the way to divide the labor and cooperate with one another. The saints in the small groups should help the small groups, and those who are assigned to shepherd and teach should care for at least four or five other saints. This is a great responsibility. In this way six hundred saints will be able to care for three thousand saints. It will not be possible for a person to stop coming to the meeting or to become sick without others knowing about it. We must work in this way until one out of every five saints is a shepherd, who shepherds, teaches, visits, and cares for others. This requires much labor.</p>
<p>Thus far we have only temporary arrangements for the new elders. After three months we will make some adjustments, and in another three months we may make more adjustments. In about one and a half years, we should be on the right track. We have not yet considered who should be involved in the shepherding. We hope that the new elders will begin considering this matter. The new elders have been taking the lead in a meeting hall and understand the condition of the saints; they can begin to encourage the saints who are experienced in life and know the truth to bear the responsibility of shepherding, teaching, visiting, and caring.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING MISCELLANEOUS SERVICES</h2>
<p>There are also services in the church that are related to miscellaneous matters, such as guard duty, clerical work, accounting, maintenance, ushering, cleaning, electrical work, purchasing, transportation, baptism, and property management. In the past we wanted the saints who are more spiritual to take the lead in hospitality. Now these saints need to bear responsibility for shepherding and teaching. Other saints can be responsible for the miscellaneous services. These saints are deacons. Hall one needs only two deacons for ushering. These two responsible ones can ask fifty other saints to take turns serving as ushers. The other services should be done in the same manner. In this way everyone can function in a specific task.</p>
<p>We will also change the way in which the service meeting is conducted. In the past everyone attended the service meeting. The elders, co-workers, ushers, and piano players all attended, because the same group of saints took care of all the services. As a result, every service was delayed. This can be compared to the same group of people playing basketball, then playing soccer, and then playing for a music concert. Eventually, everyone is exhausted. In spite of all the fellowship, few things were accomplished. Therefore, there will be a service meeting for ushering, and only the saints responsible for ushering will attend. Likewise, the meetings for the various services will be attended by the saints serving in the respective services. Every saint has a particular service and does not need to come to the meeting hall for every meeting. The elders attend the elders&rsquo; meeting, and the ushers attend the ushers&rsquo; meeting. The service meetings can be held once a week or every other week. It is sufficient for a saint to take care of only his service. Hence, to ensure that a local church is functioning normally, small groups must be established, and the elders should mobilize the church, as well as shepherd and teach. These items must advance together and be strengthened. Then there will not be problems in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING PROPAGATING THE COMMUNITY GOSPEL, THE GOSPEL IN THE SCHOOLS,<br />
AND THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>In order to propagate, we need to pay attention to three aspects of the gospel. The community gospel involves people in all walks of life, including the medical field, business, education, and the military. We have saints in every occupation, and they can preach the gospel to those in their field. The gospel in the schools includes junior high schools, high schools, and colleges. The children&rsquo;s work is also related to the gospel. We hope that in one year we will have a total of ten thousand children. We need the local saints to coordinate in these three aspects of the gospel, but even more so, we need the participation of the full-timers. Without the full-timers, the work cannot be done. Hence, all the full-time brothers need to participate in the coordination for the community gospel, the gospel in the schools, and the children&rsquo;s work. Some of them may also help with the messages on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. We should all coordinate wholeheartedly to perfect the saints.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 5: Concerning Various Aspects of Church Service &nbsp; pg 33</div><br></body></html>
