<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE RECOVERY OF THE DIVINE REVELATION<br>CONCERNING THE ETERNAL LIFE</H2><P>The fourth item of the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the divine revelation concerning the eternal life. Many Christians hold the concept that eternal life is a blessing given to the believers, in which they merely go to a heavenly mansion to enjoy a better life. When I was in Christianity, no one told me that eternal life is not a blessing, but that it is simply life. In our physical body we have a biological life (bios), and in our soul we have a psychological life (psuche). We had these two kinds of life before we were saved. But when we were saved, we received another life, the eternal life (zoe).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Life That Is Not Only Everlasting<br>but Eternal both in Time and in Nature</H2><P>The eternal life is the life that is not only everlasting but eternal both in time and in nature (John 3:16, 36; 1 John 1:2). This life is unlimited both in time and in nature; hence, it is eternal.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Uncreated Life of God,<br>the Indestructible Life, and the Incorruptible Life</H2><P>The eternal life is the uncreated life of God (Eph. 4:18), the indestructible life (Heb. 7:16), and the incorruptible life (2 Tim. 1:10). Concerning the definition of the eternal life, I received much help through the writings of Watchman Nee, Mary McDonough, Ruth Paxson, and T. Austin-Sparks. Through their writings I came to know that to be regenerated is simply to receive God into us as our life, to receive a life that is divine, a life other than our human life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Life That Is in the Son of God<br>and That Is the Son of God</H2><P>The eternal life is the life that is in the Son of God and that is the Son of God (1 John 5:11-12; 1:2; John 14:6). This life is not only in the Son of God, but it is the Son of God Himself.</P>
