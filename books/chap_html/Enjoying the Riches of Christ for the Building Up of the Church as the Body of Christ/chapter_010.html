<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TEN</h1><h1 class=msg>LIFE, GROWTH, AND TRANSFORMATION FOR THE BUILDING</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:6, 17-18; 1:8-9; 4:7-8, 10; 12:9; Rom. 8:28-29</h1><p>Transformation is a matter of life. However, we must realize that transformation is not simple. Because there are certain negative factors with us, life alone cannot work out an adequate transformation. We need something further. First Corinthians brings us to transformation, but it does not say much about the way to be transformed. The word transformed is used in 2 Corinthians chapter three. Verse 6 of chapter three says, “Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.” This confirms that teachings do not work. The word letter refers to teachings and doctrines in letter. All the teachings and doctrines do a killing work. The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. Verse 17 says, “And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.” The Spirit in verse 17 is the Spirit who gives life. Verse 18 continues: “But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.” In these verses transformation is related to the Spirit who is life. The Spirit is the very life, and life is the transforming factor. It is this life that transforms us into the image of the Lord.<h2 class=head1>TRANSFORMATION BY “COOKING”</h2><p>After chapter three, however, chapter four is necessary because for transformation the Spirit alone is not adequate. For good cooking you need water in a cooking vessel, but water alone is not adequate. Good cooking requires two opposing elements. There must be water within and fire without. We need water in the pot, and we need fire under the pot. Cooking is a kind of transformation. Raw fish does not taste very good. We must cook the fish, and by cooking it we transform it from one taste to another taste. After being cooked, the fish becomes very delicious. It has been transformed by cooking.<p>Cooking requires water within and fire without. The Spirit is the real water. We all have the “water” within, but we also need the fire. If we only had chapter three of 2 Corinthians we may say, “Transformation is wonderful and marvelous. It is by the life-giving Spirit. And the Lord is the Spirit!” In our hymnal we have songs about the Spirit, but we need more songs about “burning,” “baking,” and “cooking.” We need to be put into the “oven,” and we need to stay there for a period of time. For the sisters, their dear husband is the best oven. Sometimes one oven is not good enough. The sisters also need some little ovens. After two or three years of marriage without children, many women are desirous to have a child. This is wonderful, but they must be warned: All the little ones are little “ovens.”<p>Verse 7 of chapter four says, “But we have this treasure in earthen vessels.” We are just earthen vessels, but we have a treasure within. However, verse 8 continues, “We are pressed on every side.” For the sake of the pressing, we need “helpers” on every side. I do agree that many young ones among us need to be married, and I would encourage them to marry. They should not marry too young, but sooner or later the Lord will put them into the oven. Just as a normal family always has an oven, the family itself is an “oven.” Do not try to escape from the oven. To prepare to get married is to get ready to be put into the oven. I never speak flowery words about marriage. To speak in this way is to cheat you. In a sense marriage is wonderful, but in another sense it is awful. Those who are married have experienced this. A wife is a good oven and also a good dessert. If you are going to enjoy the dessert, you must be prepared to suffer the oven.<p>Even in the church life there are some “ovens.” As we have seen, by pray-reading and by the life-giving Spirit we all are one. However, the oven is still among us. Sometimes the brothers are the oven to the sisters, and sometimes the sisters are an oven to the brothers.
