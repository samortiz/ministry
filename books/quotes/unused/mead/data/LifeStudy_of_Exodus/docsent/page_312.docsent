   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>XI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOUR CUPS SHAPED LIKE ALMOND BLOSSOMS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ON THE LAMPSTAND WITH ITS KNOBS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND ITS BLOSSOMING BUDS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Exodus 25:34 says, And on the lampstand four cups shaped like almond blossoms with its knobs and its blossoming buds.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The four cups shaped like almond blossoms on the central stalk of the lampstand with its knobs and its blossoming buds signify Christ s humanity in His shining with the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>XII.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A KNOB UNDER EVERY TWO BRANCHES</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 35 says, And a knob under two branches of it, and a knob under two branches of it, and a knob under two branches of it, for the six branches going out from the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These three knobs do not hold blossoms but branches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that the branches are growing in order to branch out.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The knob, or calyx, holding the branches signifies life growing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The branches are branching out through the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, we have the life, the growth, and the branching out.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This signifies the resurrection life s branching out for the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Life is branching out by growing in order to produce the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although there is mention of blossoms, nothing is said of the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Actually, the fruit is simply the shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This can be applied in our daily life with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we grow in resurrection life, we shall bud, blossom, and bring forth fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we compare Galatians 5 with Ephesians 5, we shall see that this fruit is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Galatians 5:22 Paul speaks of the fruit of the Spirit, but in Ephesians 5:9 he speaks of the fruit of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Actually, the light is the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a result of growing, budding, and blossoming, we bring forth fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This fruit is the shining of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How is it possible for our relatives, friends, neighbors, colleagues, and schoolmates to see the light shining from us?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They can see it only when fruit is brought forth in our Christian life, for this fruit will be the light.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let us consider as an example the case of two sisters, one called Mary and the other, Martha.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Mary is growing in the Lord and is budding, blossoming, and bringing forth fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Martha, however, does not grow, but remains in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Martha comes in contact with Mary, she sees fruit in Mary s life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This fruit is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With Mary herself, it is fruit, but in relation to Martha this fruit becomes the shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Martha sees this light and is enlightened by it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then she realizes that she is fleshly, worldly, and far away from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this way she is enlightened by the fruit of the light which is growing, budding, and blossoming in Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Often the saints are enlightened in the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even when no message is given, we may experience this shining.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, certain young ladies may attend the meetings dressed in a way which is somewhat immodest or inappropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Spontaneously, they become conscious of the way they are dressed and desire to be fully covered.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This consciousness comes from the shining of light in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These young ladies would not have the same realization if they were sitting in a place of worldly entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This indicates that there is light in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are enlightened in the meetings because here we see the fruit, the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, with the lampstand we have the budding, the blossoming, and the shining of the light as the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>XIII.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE LAMPSTAND AND ITS KNOBS</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>AND BRANCHES ALL BEING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>BEATEN WORK OF PURE GOLD</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verse 36 says, Their knobs and their branches shall be from it all of it one beaten work of pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The fact that the lampstand and its knobs and branches are all of one beaten work of pure gold signifies that the entire entity is all purely of Christ s divinity without anything added to it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The knobs and the branches were not added to the lampstand; they were part of the lampstand, part of one beaten work of pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This indicates that in the lampstand there is no mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Mixture in our Christian life brings in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But when our Christian life is purified through the divine nature, we have light.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>XIV.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>SEVEN LAMPS</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Exodus 25:37 says, And you shall make its lamps, seven.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The seven lamps signify the seven Spirits of God and the seven eyes of the Lamb Zech 4:2, 10; Rev 4:5; 5:6 as the full expression of the Triune God.</S>
