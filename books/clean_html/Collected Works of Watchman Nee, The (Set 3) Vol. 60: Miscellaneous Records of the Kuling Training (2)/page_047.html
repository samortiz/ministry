<h2 class="head1">MAKING ARRANGEMENTS</h2><p>Fourth, in addition to being mindful of possible problems that one may encounter and counting the cost, one has to make constant decisions. He has to be clear in his mind as to how he should place the right people in the right place, and what they should do. The previous point deals with gathering information; one estimates the time, money, and manpower necessary to do a job. All these are information. They give us an idea of the different kinds of problems that need to be solved before we can accomplish a task. We must write down these points one by one. For example, if we are going to leave the mountain now, we have to find out how many people need to leave on sedan chairs and how many chairs we now have. We need an accurate count of all these things. When all the facts are in place, we can go on to the fourth point, which is to make the proper arrangements. If the facts are wrong in the first place, it is impossible to make the right judgments. Therefore, before we can talk about a proper arrangement, we must have reliable facts. This means that there is the need for much thinking and deliberation. No one can accomplish anything without giving thought to his work. The Lord Jesus taught His disciples how to manage business affairs when He was on the earth. Once He asked them to distribute bread to five thousand people. Another time He asked them to distribute bread to four thousand people. This is the reason they were able to baptize three thousand and then five thousand people at Pentecost. In feeding the five thousand, the Lord asked them to arrange the crowd into rows; there was no confusion. At that time the crowd was hungry, and if the people had pressed against one another, it would have been chaos. The Lord asked them all to sit down so that there would not be any confusion. He made them sit down in groups of fifty and one hundred. There was no confusion, and there was no monotonous repetition; everything was in order. After the disciples learned this, they repeated the lesson again at a later time. This is the reason that there was no confusion at Pentecost, even though three thousand and later five thousand were baptized. They had a pattern to follow. The multiplication of the bread was a miracle, but the distribution and consumption of the bread depended on human arrangement. The Lord performed a miracle in the multiplication of the bread, but He did not perform a miracle in the distribution and consumption of it. He did not perform a miracle by dropping the bread into each person's stomach directly. He trained the disciples to do things in the proper way.</p><p>In doing things we must first find out the facts in a detailed way and then make arrangements accordingly. When we face a task, the first thing we should do is think it over and then find the proper way. Only after we have taken these steps should we make the proper arrangements. Many people fail to get things done because they have never come up with the proper way. We must first think things over carefully and then do a detailed analysis. After we are clear about all the facts, we have to pray much. We have to ask the Lord what we should do with all the things that are laid before us. The Lord told the five thousand to sit down. Once they sat down, they became stationary. This was wisdom on the Lord's part. The crowd was already trampling upon one another when they listened to the word. How much more would they have trampled each other if they had started squabbling for the bread! The Lord told them to sit down. Once they sat down, all the problems were solved. The Lord was very wise in making these arrangements. In making arrangements there is much need of prayer. We have to pray until we get wisdom. The Lord's arrangement not only allowed the crowd to eat in an orderly fashion but also took care of all the crumbs expeditiously. Hence, in doing things we have to know how to make proper arrangements. We should never leave anything to chance, and it is not enough to exercise just our mouth. In finding the proper way of doing things, it is better to be as specific as possible; one should not be general in anything.</p><h2 class="head1">EXECUTING THINGS PROPERLY AND<br />GIVING ADEQUATE EXPLANATION</h2><p>The fifth crucial thing to remember in doing things is that we need a good plan of execution. Before carrying out a job, we must first have enough information, and this information must be accurate and reliable. Our assignment of personnel must be suitable; everyone should have his or her own responsibility, and there must not be confusion of any kind. In building a house, we put one stone upon another. If one stone falls, all the ones attached to it will fall as well. Those making the arrangements should consider who is capable of doing each aspect. The arrangements should suit the capacity and aspiration of each person. It is important that in charging anyone to do anything, we have to speak to them ahead of time. Everyone should understand what they are supposed to do. We should not assume that others understand; we should explain with our own words. We should not be afraid of being repetitious. It is not a matter of how many times we repeat a statement, but a matter of how much the charged ones have understood. We should not wait until others encounter problems in the work before opening our mouth. Rather, we should clearly explain the method and the way ahead of time and then assign the jobs. Those who are giving orders are responsible for making perfectly clear what the charged ones are supposed to do. If the ones giving the orders are not explicit in their explanation, they bear the responsibility for any failure. If a leader does not have the assurance that he can take the lead, he should not be a leader in the first place.</p>
