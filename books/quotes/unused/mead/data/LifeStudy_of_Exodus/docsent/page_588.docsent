   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S INTENTION TO HAVE THE ARK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Exodus reveals that God s intention is to have the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This ark is the ark of testimony, and this causes the tabernacle to become the tabernacle of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What God wants is the ark of testimony in the tabernacle of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We, however, may want nothing more than our own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because we care for our salvation, we may not have any thought concerning God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our salvation is at the altar, but God s testimony is at the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Most of today s Christians do not have any idea about God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are mainly concerned with their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you were to talk with them about other matters in the Word of God, they may say, Does this have something to do with my salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Will this determine whether I go to heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the way many Christians view things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today s Christians do not have much thought regarding God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you know what is the main subject of the book of Revelation, the last book of the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In answer to this question, some Christians would say that Revelation is a book of prophecy that tells us about a beast that comes from the sea and another beast that comes from the land.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But this is not the main subject of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the first chapter of Revelation we see the main subject of this book the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The last book of the Bible is concerned with the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once again we must appreciate the wonderful fact that the Bible truly is the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The human mind is not capable of composing such a book.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, in the last of the sixty-six books of the Bible, we have a book concerned with the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This testimony is the ark of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to Revelation, the ark of God eventually consummates in a tabernacle which will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate fulfillment of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is God s eternal goal to have the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In our reading of the book of Exodus, we need to pay careful attention to the significance of the ark of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I hope that all the young people especially will see the importance of the ark of testimony in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In reading and studying the Word of God, we should not be controlled by our natural mind, religion, or culture.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not merely be concerned with receiving some kind of blessing from God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to see that what God desires is the ark of testimony in the tabernacle of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the revelation of the tabernacle and its furniture, the ark is mentioned first.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the making of the tabernacle and the furniture and in the two records concerning this matter in chapter forty, the ark of testimony also has a central place.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have seen that the ark of testimony typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first item of furniture to be put into the tabernacle was the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The ark, therefore, is the central item of the tabernacle and its furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>TWO BEGINNINGS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Exodus 40:2 says, On the first day of the first month you shall raise up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is very significant that God commanded Moses to erect the tabernacle on the first day of the first month of the second year.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We know that the first month of the first year was the time of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, from the Passover to the erection of the tabernacle was one year.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Exodus 12 and 40 we see that God s people had two beginnings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first beginning was with the Passover, which was for the salvation of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The second beginning was their beginning with God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These two beginnings are clear types or signs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The first beginning is to be saved, to experience the Passover, to have God s judgment pass over us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every genuine Christian has experienced this beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But what about the second beginning, the beginning related to the building of God s dwelling place?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is a fact that not many Christians realize the need to have this second beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I was young I read some books that spoke about a so-called second blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Pentecostal people would say that to have this second blessing is to experience the baptism of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They encourage believers to seek this second blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But those Christians who emphasize the inner life claim that the second blessing is something inward.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They may say something like this: You need to experience the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you experience the cross, then inwardly you will be filled with life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This inward filling is the second blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But have you ever heard anyone speak about a second blessing, a second Abib, in the second year?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The first month of the holy calendar is called the month of Abib, which means green ears, and signifies a new, fresh beginning in life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We all need to have the two beginnings, one typified by the Passover in Exodus 12, and the other, by the erection of the tabernacle in Exodus 40.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is a matter of great significance.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The second beginning is not related to tongue-speaking nor even to the inner filling for the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Neither is it the second blessing spoken of by so-called holiness people.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They say that if we receive holiness, we have received the second blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But from Exodus we see that the second beginning is related to the building of God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When in our Christian life we experience the building of God s dwelling place in a practical way, we have the second beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What is the dwelling place of God today?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God s dwelling place is the church, which is called the house of the living God 1 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The building of this house is the second beginning, the genuine second blessing, the beginning that takes place on the first day of the first month of the second year.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How glad I am to have the assurance that I have experienced the second beginning!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Many among us also have the assurance that we have had this second beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is truly a blessing!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To have the second beginning with the building of the dwelling place of God is much better than tongue-speaking, inward filling, or holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>None of these things can compare with God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>None of them can compare with the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When certain ones hear this, they may say, Witness Lee is always talking about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Wherever he goes he emphasizes the church because this is his cargo.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Actually, I am not promoting my cargo I am promoting God s cargo.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What do we see at the end of Exodus?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We see God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We see a tabernacle occupied by God and possessed by Him in the way of glory to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We see the same thing at the end of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the last chapters of the book of Revelation we see a tabernacle, the New Jerusalem, occupied and possessed by God in the way of glory for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In Exodus 40:34 we are told that the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle, and in Revelation 21 we see that the New Jerusalem has the glory of God Rev 21:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Both at the end of Exodus and at the end of Revelation we see the glory of God filling the tabernacle, God s dwelling place.</S>
