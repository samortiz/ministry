   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the above three items were in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The fourth item of the contents of the tabernacle was the ark in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The ark was the place where God met with people and spoke to people Exo 25:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It signifies Christ in His redemption as the place where God meets with man and speaks to man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the ark was the law of the Ten Commandments, which by its holy and righteous requirement exposed and condemned the sins of the people who came to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, by the lid of the ark, with the propitiating blood sprinkled on it on the Day of Propitiation Lev 16:15-17, 34 , the entire situation on the sinner s side was fully covered.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, upon this sin-covering lid God could meet with the people who broke His righteous law, and He could do this without, governmentally, any contradiction to His righteousness, even under the observing of the cherubim that bore His glory and overshadowed the lid of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, the problem between man and God was appeased, enabling God to meet with those who come forward to His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a prefigure of Christ as the Lamb of God who took away the sin that caused man to have a problem with God John 1:29 by offering Himself once for all on the cross as the sacrifice for sins Heb 9:14; 10:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moreover, through His own blood He entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, thus accomplishing an eternal redemption for us and appeasing the problem between man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, because of the blood of Christ we and God can meet together, have peace with one another, and communicate with and speak to one another in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Within the ark there were also the golden pot that had the manna, Aaron s rod that budded, and the two tablets of the covenant, all of which signify our deeper and more inward experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Golden Pot That Had the Manna</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After the exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt, God gave them manna from heaven as their food.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, He commanded Moses to take a golden pot, put an omerful of manna therein, and lay it up before Him to be kept throughout the generations Exo 16:33-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This manna is called the hidden manna Rev 2:17 , signifying our deepest experience of Christ as our life supply, which is deeper than that which is signified by the table of the bread of the Presence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a special portion reserved by the Lord for those who overcome the degradation of the worldly church, as their daily supply today and as their special enjoyment to be their reward in the coming kingdom.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Aaron s Rod That Budded</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After the judgment of God on Korah and his company for their rebellion in the wilderness, in order to vindicate the proper authority of leadership, God told the leaders of the twelve tribes to each take a rod and lay up their rods before the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the next day, the rod of Aaron had sprouted, put forth buds, produced blossoms, and born ripe almonds Num 17:3-8, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The rod that budded signifies our experience of Christ in His resurrection as our acceptance by God for authority in the God-given ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is deeper than the experience of Christ as the incense for our acceptance by God.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The law of commandments regulates us from without by and according to its dead letters; the law of life as the issue of Christ s being our life enlightens and regulates us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is deeper than the experience of Christ as the shining lampstand in the Holy Place.</S>
