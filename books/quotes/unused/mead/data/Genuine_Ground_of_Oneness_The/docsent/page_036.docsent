   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DWELLING TOGETHER IN ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The last psalm we shall consider here is Psalm 133.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 1 says, "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in oneness!"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This verse speaks of the goodness and pleasantness of dwelling together in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to verse 2, such a dwelling together in oneness "is like the precious ointment upon the head, that spread upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Notice that this verse speaks of ointment, not just of oil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ointment spreads more slowly than oil does.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the church life the ointment does not run; rather, it spreads slowly, gradually, and gently.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The precious ointment spreads from Aaron's head even to the skirts of his garments.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that it comes down from the Head to the entire Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 3 the dwelling in oneness is likened to the dew of Hermon and to "the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hermon, a high mountain, signifies the heavens, from which the dew descends.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The mountains are the local churches, and the dew is the grace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This dew that descends upon the local churches is very refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can testify that the refreshing element of Christ descends upon us in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Praise the Lord for the heavenly dew that descends upon the local churches for our enjoyment!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The ointment and the dew bring in life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 3 says, "For there the Lord commanded the blessing, life forevermore" v. 3, Heb . Note that this verse does not say, "The Lord gave the blessing"; it says, "The Lord commanded the blessing." In the church life as the house of God, we enjoy the commanded blessing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even in Old Testament times, when God's people came to a material temple, they enjoyed a wonderful life in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They gathered together around the temple and offered the top portion of the rich produce of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then they enjoyed these offerings with God and in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was their life, their living, and their worship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They worshipped the Lord through enjoying the riches of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because this was their living, they were planted and flourished in the house of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a picture, in typology, of what can happen on the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>GOD'S REQUIREMENT</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The ground of oneness is not simply a matter of one city, one church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The ground of oneness is deeper, richer, higher, and fuller than this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all must learn that in this universe God has chosen only one place, and that place is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God requires us to go to this place He has chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Spiritually speaking, we must destroy every place other than the church and every name other than the name of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that we must destroy our culture and religious background.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You were born in a particular region of this country.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You need to destroy the influence of that place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Perhaps you had a religious background in a particular denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now you must destroy that denominational place within you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The places that we must destroy include our disposition, temperament, and habits.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must destroy everything that damages the oneness of the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to Colossians 3:11, in the new man "there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church with Christ is the unique place of God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to fulfill the word of Colossians 3:11, every other place must be utterly destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must destroy everything that is not the church with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then we shall simply be in the church life enjoying Christ as the riches of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As we enjoy Him with God, we shall be planted in the house of the Lord, we shall grow, and we shall flourish.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the proper way to have the Christian life and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On this ground it is not possible to have division, for the basis of division has been destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our temperament, disposition, natural characteristics, and preferences have all been eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our religion, culture, and particular ways have also been destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Having destroyed all the pagan places, we simply go to the place of God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church life has been weakened because of the lack of willingness to destroy the heathen places.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Deuteronomy 12 has great spiritual significance for us today.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In our human life and culture there are many places that remain to be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must destroy them all and then go to the unique place of God's choice, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the church there cannot be anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christ must be all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is easy to say this, but it is not easy to practice it in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Nevertheless, we have no excuse for not practicing this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In every place that is to be destroyed there is a dedicated pillar, a symbol, or image.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This means that even in our character or disposition there may be such pillars, symbols, or images.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, we must destroy all the places with their pillars, symbols, and images.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do not preserve any place.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Rather, destroy them and go to the place of the Lord's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As we have pointed out again and again, this place is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Having come to the church, we should have nothing other than the Person of Christ and the unique way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then we shall enjoy Christ in the church as the top portion of the rich produce of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As we enjoy Him before God, this enjoyment will become our worship, our church life, and even our Christian daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then we shall grow and mature on the ground of oneness.</S>
