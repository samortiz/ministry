<h2 class="head2">According to the Spirit&rsquo;s Leading<br />
and the Practical Situation</h2>
<p>To pray or not to pray before one speaks makes a great difference. You must pray before you go out. Without enough prayer, you should not go out. Get yourself qualified by praying. Then the Lord will be sovereign in leading you. We surely have to follow the Spirit. To follow the Spirit, the basic principle is to drop our own things, our personal things. We should not do anything on our own, but do everything according to the Spirit&rsquo;s leading.</p>
<p>The proper way for the church to carry out this new way for the Lord&rsquo;s spread is that the elders must take the lead. This is absolutely different from the past. In the past the saints did things, and the elders were just giving directions or orders. But now the elders must realize that they should knock on doors much more than the other brothers and sisters. For the elders to merely sit in the church office is not a real profit. A real profit for the church is that the elders would go out. This corresponds to the biblical principle concerning the elders. The elders should take the lead not to rule over the saints or to give commands or instructions, telling people to do things. The elders should take the lead by doing it themselves. Then all the others will follow (1 Pet. 5:2-3).</p>
<p>Furthermore, all the leading ones, the elders, should bear the responsibility to form the teams. The teams have to be formed through the elders&rsquo; arrangement, not just by the saints. This may seemingly contradict the points I told you concerning going out according to the Spirit. You may feel that to go out according to the Spirit is one thing, and to go out by the elders forming the teams is another thing. The Bible gives us the principle, however, that if there is no church you should follow the Spirit according to the situation; but if there is a church, you must follow the Spirit through the church.</p>
<p>Philip was a good model. He followed the Spirit directly in Acts 8 because at that juncture there was no church where he was. But Barnabas and Saul of Tarsus did not go out on their own. Five brothers were praying who were in the church at Antioch (Acts 13:1). Those five brothers were the living and acting members of the church there. They represented the church at Antioch. They prayed together and received the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s leading. By this we can see that if there is a church, we have to receive the leading of the Spirit through the church. We are not here in an independent way, but we are here living the church life. It is not you individually taking this new way, but the church corporately taking this new way. The elders are the leading ones in this matter, so they must bear the responsibility to form the teams.</p>
<p>There is the need of some human way under the guiding of the Spirit to form the teams properly. According to our experience, one team should not exceed four persons. If you had seven persons going out to visit a family, the family would be apprehensive, to say the least. Also, it would be hard for them to receive you all. The best number is three. Always try to have one older person, one younger person, and one middle-aged person. Do the best to form the teams in this principle. If three young men go out to knock on one door, some people may be afraid that you are coming to rob them. For three girls to go out together by themselves is dangerous. It is neither wise for three older brothers or three older sisters to go out as a team. A good team could be composed of an older sister, one younger sister, and a middle-aged brother or of one older brother, one younger brother, and one middle-aged sister.</p>
<p>Every team must have a brother. The brother will be for baptizing. There is nothing in the Bible to indicate that sisters can baptize people, so the brothers have to bear the burden to baptize. Everyone has to learn not to do anything on his own. We must learn to go out to do a proper job, and this proper job includes one thing&mdash;to baptize people. For the teams, it is best to have one brother matched by two sisters. Sometimes two brothers could be matched with one sister.</p>
<p>When the elders form the teams, they should also have the following point in their consideration&mdash;of the three, one must be at least a little stronger in life and in speaking. A good number of the saints would not dare to stand up to say anything in a meeting, but in a small group going out to visit other people, they may all like to take the lead in speaking. This is not good. In a visiting group, only one should be the main speaker, and the other two should learn how to coordinate. The elders should do something to train the saints in this way. You cannot collect five people and expect them to work together as a basketball team without any coaching. If you pass the basketball to them, they will not know how to play. There is the need of some amount of training. What I am giving you are some principles. I hope that the elders would take these principles and put them into practice to train all the saints.</p>
<p>A certain group could be composed of an older brother, a middle-aged sister, and a younger sister who is only sixteen or seventeen years old. In life, in spirit, and even in knowing the Word, this younger sister may be stronger than the older brother and the middle-aged sister. Thus, they should let the young sister take the lead to open her mouth to talk to people. When the elders arrange the teams, they should realize that the proper speaking person should be this younger sister. The younger sister should be bold, the older brother should give in, and the middle-aged sister should understand the situation. When this young sister &ldquo;makes a deal&rdquo; for baptism, the older brother should be ready to baptize, and the middle-aged sister should also be very strong to urge the wife of the household to fill up the bathtub with water.</p>
<p>According to the Spirit&rsquo;s leading, the elders need to consider the practical and particular situation of the saints. First, the ones who form a team need a car, so among these three there must be one who has a car. Three persons going out will only need one car to travel in. If none of the three has a car, the elders should rearrange the group so that one person in the group has a car. It is also better to put three into one team from the same vicinity so they can go out together easily. They will not need to wait for someone else from another neighborhood. Also, the elders have to consider the functions of the ones in the group. One of them may have a car, and they all may be in the same neighborhood, yet each one of them may not be skilled in speaking to others. Based upon this, they could not be formed into a team. The elders need to realize that it is not an easy thing to put these principles into practice. There is the need of much labor on the part of the elders. The saints need to forget their considerations regarding the formation of the teams. No one should have the freedom to choose with whom they will go because the elders will form the teams.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to set a time for all the teams to come together to pray in the meeting hall is awkward. This means that they will all have to travel to the meeting hall and will have to wait for latecomers. This practice will kill the Spirit. Let every team in their own place pray, and let them make a decision as to the proper and profitable time for them to go out to knock on people&rsquo;s doors. This will save time and travel. But what the elders should charge each team to do before going out, is to have at least fifteen minutes to pray together. You must have a time to pray yourself into the spirit, to pray to have the impact, to pray to have the faith with boldness. All of the teams should pray, but there is no need for all of the teams to come together for this.</p>
<p>Do not consider my fellowship as commandments that I am giving you. This is a leading composed of principles. I am not in your situation. When you practice, you will find that some aspects should be adjusted in your situation. There is nothing wrong with this.</p>
<p>To go out to spread the gospel with the truth is a great thing. Our going will open the door for the Lord to go on. No one can tell how far the Lord will go. We are still studying our situation and putting the results of this study into practice. You must learn to do things in a new and living way, dropping your old concepts. In doing anything, do not keep the old way. Try the best to get some new way to improve what you are doing.</p>
