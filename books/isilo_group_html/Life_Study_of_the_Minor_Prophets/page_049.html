Preaching the Gospel of Peace to the Gentiles</h2>
<p>Christ is revealed in Jonah&rsquo;s typifying Christ preaching the gospel of peace to the Gentiles (3:2; Matt. 12:41). Jonah was a prophet who turned from Israel to the Gentiles. In this he was a type of Christ, who turned from Israel to the Gentiles (Luke 4:25-27; Matt. 21:43).</p>
