<p class="bold">WEEK 11 — DAY 4</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 14:22-25, 28-32</h2><p>22 &nbsp;And immediately He compelled the disciples to step into the boat and to go before Him to the other side, while He sent the crowds away.</p> <p class="bold">23 &nbsp;And after He sent the crowds away, He went up to the mountain privately to <sup>1</sup>pray. And when night fell, He was there alone.</p> <p>24 &nbsp;Now the boat was already in the midst of the sea, being battered by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</p> <p class="bold">25 &nbsp;And in the fourth watch of the night He came to them, <sup>1</sup>walking on the sea.</p><p class="bold">28 &nbsp;And Peter answered Him and said, Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.</p><p class="bold">29 &nbsp;And He said, Come. And Peter, coming down from the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus.</p><p class="bold">30 &nbsp;But <sup>1</sup>seeing the strong wind, he became frightened; and as he began to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me!</p> <p class="bold">31 &nbsp;And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him and said to him, You of little faith, why did you doubt?</p><p>32 &nbsp;And when they got up into the boat, the <sup>1</sup>wind ceased.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>23<sup>1</sup> Standing in the position of man (4:4), the heavenly King, as the beloved Son of the Father (3:17), needed to pray privately to His Father who was in the heavens, that He might be one with the Father and have the Father with Him in whatever He did on earth for the establishing of the kingdom of the heavens. He did this not in the deserted place but on the mountain, leaving all the people, even His disciples, that He might be alone to contact the Father.</p><p>25<sup>1</sup> While His disciples were distressed by the waves, the Lord walked on the sea. This testifies that He is the Creator and the Ruler of the universe (Job 9:8).</p><p>30<sup>1</sup> Peter came down from the boat and walked on the water by faith in the Lord’s word (v. 29); however, when he saw the strong wind, his faith vanished. He should have walked by faith in the Lord’s word, not by looking at the circumstances (i.e., by sight). In following the Lord we should walk by faith, not by sight (2 Cor. 5:7).</p><p>32<sup>1</sup> This miracle testifies not only that the Lord is the Ruler of the heavens and the earth but also that He takes care of the hardships endured by His followers as they follow Him on the way. When we have the Lord in our boat, the wind ceases. The record of the two miracles in this chapter implies that during the time that Christ was being rejected by people in the religious and political circles, He and His followers were in a deserted place and on a stormy sea. Whatever the situation, He was able to provide for their need and carry them through the hardships.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>The storm in chapter fourteen indicates that on the pathway where we follow the rejected King there will always be troubles.…Because our destiny is in the Lord’s hand, there is no reason for us to be afraid of anything. The contrary winds and the opposition are under His feet. The Lord is on a high mountain praying for us and interceding for us.…He laughs at the wind and seems to say, “Little wind, you mean nothing to Me. What are you trying to do? You can’t do anything with My church. Those in the boat are My followers. In fact, they are just Me. Although I am here in the heavens, I am also with them.”</p><p>In being quick and bold to step out of the boat and walk on the sea, we must take care of four things: first, that we act upon the word of the Lord, not without hearing a word from Him; second, that our direction is toward the Lord Himself; third, that we get into the Lord’s presence; and fourth, that we come back to the boat. If we take care of these four things, we will be right, even if we appear to be wrong.
