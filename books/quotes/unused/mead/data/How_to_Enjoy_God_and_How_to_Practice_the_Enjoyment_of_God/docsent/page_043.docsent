   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BIBLE BEING GOD S FOOD FOR US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since we desire to be persons who eat, drink, absorb, and breathe in God, we need a drastic change in our concept concerning the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to see that the Bible is the food God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We read the Bible with the purpose of eating, drinking, absorbing, and breathing in God, because we know that the Bible is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John 1 says that the Word of God is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God s Word is God s coming forth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When God is expressed and presented to us, we have the Word, the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since God wants to be our food, His expression and manifestation to man as the Word means that the Word is man s food.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some people think that God s words are only precepts and commandments, but in John 12:50 the Lord Jesus said that God s commandment is eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God s commandment is life because it is food.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we receive God s commandments, we receive them in the way of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When these commandments enter into us as food, we spontaneously receive life and nourishment from them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who have experienced this can testify that when we read the Bible with a heart to absorb God, it becomes food to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even a commandment such as husbands loving their wives can become food to us when we receive it in the way of absorbing God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we do this, we are filled with God s supply and His presence as we love our wives.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>While we are loving our wives, God is life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The commandment love your wife becomes eternal life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The more we receive this commandment to love our wives, the more we sense God s presence, supply, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the same principle, if we read the portions of the Bible that command children to honor their parents, with a heart to absorb God, we will receive this commandment as our food.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then when we obey this commandment to obey our parents, we will sense the moving of the Holy Spirit; we will experience the Holy Spirit as life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more we honor our parents, the more we will be filled and satisfied, and the more we will eat and drink God and be saturated with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is what it means for God s commandment to be eternal life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus Being Food to Man</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>through His Word</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The entire Bible, from the first word to the last, is God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is God s expression and His breathing out.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God s word is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John 1:1 says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This Word is our Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Jesus is God s Word because He is God s expression and explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He manifests God; hence, He is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When man receives Him, he receives God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With the Word is life, nourishment, and supply.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God is contained in the Word; hence, when a man receives the Word, he receives everything that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the Word came to earth, He was received in the way of food.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He said that He is the bread that came down out of heaven to be eaten by men.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The hearers, however, were confused.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord sympathized with their weakness and explained to them, using the type of the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the Jews celebrate the Passover, they slaughter a lamb, shed its blood for the remission of their sins, and eat the meat of the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every Jew was familiar with this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord said that His flesh is true meat and that His blood is true drink.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that they were to eat Him in the same way that they slaughtered and ate the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The lamb was slaughtered to meet the need of man s sinfulness and emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the lamb was killed, its blood was shed for the remission of sins, and its flesh was eaten for the satisfaction of man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since the Jews understood the type, they should have also understood that the Lord was the Lamb prepared by God for them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was killed, His blood was shed, and His body was broken.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His shed blood redeemed man from his sins, and His broken body released His life to enter into man for man s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His flesh is true food, and His blood is true drink.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those who eat His flesh and drink His blood eat Him, and those who eat Him will live because of Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>55-57 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Jews, however, were confused when they heard these words.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They wondered how this man s flesh could be their food.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This word was too hard for them, and they could not receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Brothers and sisters, the Jews were confused, and we are often confused when we read John 6.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For this reason, the Lord Jesus also said, It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing v. 63 . He was not giving them His visible flesh as food.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If they ate His physical flesh, they would still die; they would not have lived.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This proves that the Lord did not intend for them to eat His visible flesh but to eat the invisible Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>His desire is to enter into man s spirit as Spirit, to be man s food and man s life, and to cause man to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Here the subject of the Spirit is introduced.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Prayer is to breathe in the Spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is to touch the Spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Because the Lord was concerned that the people would still not understand, He continued, The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life v. 63 . This shows that the Lord is food to us in two ways first as the Spirit and second as the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In other words, the Lord today is first the Holy Spirit, and second the Holy Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Today we can breathe in the Spirit by prayer, and we can touch the Word by reading.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord is in the Spirit, and He is also in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is Spirit, the Word is the Spirit, and the Lord is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hence, the Lord, the Spirit, and the Word are three in one.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord is in the Spirit, and He is also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord is in the Word, and He is also the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Word is also Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Let me repeat: our Lord is in the Spirit, and He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He is in the Word, and He is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Not only so, the Word is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He is the Spirit for us to breathe Him in; this is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He is also the Word for us to read; this is to study the Bible.</S>
