   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENCOURAGED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 11 Paul also tells the Corinthians to be encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The apostles are encouraged by the God of all encouragement 1:3-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Corinthians were much discouraged by the apostle s first Epistle to them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now, in the second Epistle, he encourages them with the encouragement of God 7:8-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we study the whole book of 2 Corinthians, we shall understand that in this Epistle encouragement is an important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this reason, Paul s words be encouraged in 13:11 are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Being encouraged means that we are first comforted, then made calm, and then satisfied, strengthened, and enabled.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then as a result of all this we are encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We do not lose heart, and we are not discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here Paul seems to be saying, Believers at Corinth, the work of perfecting I have been doing on you should not cause you to be sad.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead, you should be glad and joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You should even voice out your joy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, you need to be encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Corinthians, do not lose heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The book of 2 Corinthians is a book of encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Chapters one and seven are both full of encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a book of encouragement, this Epistle brings comfort, satisfaction, strength, enablement, and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It brings us whatever we need.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we have been satisfied, strengthened, and thereby encouraged, we shall be energized to go on in the Christian life and in the church life without losing heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THINKING THE SAME THING</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 11 Paul also charges the Corinthians to think the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thinking the same thing should be the main factor for the distracted and confused Corinthians to be perfected, adjusted, put in order, and restored.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In his first Epistle 1 Cor 1:10 , Paul had already exhorted them to think the same thing: But I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Greek word translated attuned in 1 Corinthians 1:10 is the same word that is translated mending in Matthew 4:21.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It means to repair, to restore, to adjust, to mend, making a broken thing thoroughly complete, joined perfectly together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a whole, the Corinthian believers were divided, broken.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They needed mending to join them perfectly together that they may be in harmony, having the same mind and the same opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may take as an illustration the keyboard of a piano.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Each key needs to be properly in tune in order to be in harmony with all the other keys.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Likewise, Paul exhorted the Corinthians to be attuned in the same mind, that is, to think the same thing and not to have peculiar thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all need to learn by grace to think the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>TO BE AT PEACE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 13:11 Paul also exhorts the Corinthians to be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means to be at peace with one another and probably with God as well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul knew that there had been strife and rivalry among the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First Corinthians 1:11 says, For it was made clear to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of the household of Chloe, that there are strifes among you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This clearly indicates that among the believers at Corinth there was not any peace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here in 13:11 Paul urges them to be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Christian life is a life of rejoicing and also a life of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, to strive against others or to have rivalry with them is contrary to a basic principle of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Strife and rivalry are characteristics of the life of fallen mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today the world is full of strife and rivalry.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In every aspect of human society, rivalry, and fighting are common.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Christian life is absolutely different from this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a heavenly people, we should always be at peace with one another.</S>
