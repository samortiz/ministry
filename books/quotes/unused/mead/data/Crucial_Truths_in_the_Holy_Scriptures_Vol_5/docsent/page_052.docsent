   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>This Day Being Called the Lord s Day</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I was in spirit on the Lord s Day Rev 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John spoke of the Lord s Day while he was on the island of Patmos.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His word shows that during the age of the apostles, the believers frequently met together on the first day of the week, the day of the Lord s resurrection, and that they called it the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was called the Lord s Day because it was the day of the Lord s resurrection, and it was a day that particularly expressed the Lord and was for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some say that John s use of the expression the Lord s Day was in reference to the day of the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If this were the case, then being in spirit, which John also spoke of, would only be for the day of the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This does not make sense.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the Lord s Day must refer to the first day of the week, the day of the Lord s resurrection, the day on which the saints gathered together.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John was exiled to the barren island of Patmos, and although there were no saints there who could meet with him on the Lord s Day, he could still contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>While he was contacting the Lord, he was in spirit, and he saw heavenly visions concerning the church, the ages of the world, the kingdom, and eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In these visions the Lord showed him things from his time all the way to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The things from his time until eternity were revealed to him on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the Lord s Day, the first day of the week, is a day for the Lord s servants to see visions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sometimes on the Lord s Day a store will display a sign, saying, We are resting today because it is the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is like me, Mr. Lee, wearing a sign that says, Mr. Hwang.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord s Day is the first day of the week, and it has nothing to do with the Sabbath, the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not consider the Lord s Day to be the Sabbath nor keep it like the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not keep the Lord s Day as if it were the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This mixes up the New Testament and the Old Testament, the heavenly and the earthly, the resurrected new creation and the natural old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is what the Roman Catholic Church does.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This kind of mixture is condemned by the Lord; we must simply consider the Lord s Day to be such, and we must not keep it as if it were the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must not mix the Lord s Day with the Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How the Believers Should Act</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>with Respect to the Lord s Day</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the day that Jehovah has made; / Let us exult and rejoice in it Psa 118:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Psalm 118:22 says, The stone which the builders rejected / Has become the head of the corner.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Acts 4:10-11 Peter said that this verse refers to the Lord s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the day that Jehovah has made must be the day of the Lord s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The day of the Lord s resurrection was not an accident but was made by Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Old Testament types and prophecies God told us about this day Lev 23:10-11; Hosea 6:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before the Lord died, He also spoke clearly about this day John 2:19; Matt 16:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, God specially ordained this day, and it is a day with special significance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On this day we should exult and rejoice in it because the Lord resurrected on this day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He began the new creation on this day, and He made us the new creation on this day.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, this day is a day when we should exult and rejoice in order to testify of the Lord s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not be quiet and sad with no resemblance to a person in the resurrected new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the first day of the week, when we gathered together to break bread, Paul conversed with them... and he extended his message Acts 20:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although we remember the Lord s death by breaking the bread, we do this in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because we are in resurrection, we have the life of Christ and are His Body; this is the only reason we are able to come together as one loaf to testify that we are one Body 1 Cor 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, the day most appropriate to the significance of breaking bread is the day of the Lord s resurrection, the Lord s Day on the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The early believers broke bread on this day.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Acts 20:7 says that on that Lord s Day in Troas, Paul not only broke bread with the believers in their meeting but also preached the word to them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, there should also be ministry of the Lord s Word on the Lord s Day; there should be preaching of the Word to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the first day of the week each one of you should lay aside in store to himself whatever he may have been prospered 1 Cor 16:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Believers should also make their offerings on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The believers should meet on the Lord s Day to break bread, worship the Lord, and make offerings to Him, because the Lord does not want His people to come empty-handed to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When His people worship and thank Him, the Lord wants them to also make an offering to Him in response to His grace Deut 16:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, according to what we have seen in the Bible, the Lord wants us to exult and rejoice on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Besides wanting us to meet on the Lord s Day to break bread and to give our offerings, there is nothing else He wants us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He does not want us to keep the Lord s Day as the Old Testament Israelites kept the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, it is best if we could stop our work on the Lord s Day to wholly focus ourselves on worshipping and serving God, but if we cannot, we do not break any law.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, we must do our best to set aside a time when we can meet, break bread, worship the Lord, and make offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>New Testament believers do not need to keep the Old Testament Sabbath, and we do not need to keep any regulations concerning the New Testament Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible does not even require New Testament believers to keep the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should not keep the Lord s Day according to the dead letter of the law; instead, we should live the Lord s Day according to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is not a matter of keeping the law but of living out grace.</S>
