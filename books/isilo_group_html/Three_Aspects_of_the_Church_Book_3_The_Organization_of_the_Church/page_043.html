<h1 class="title">RECEIVING PEOPLE IN THE CHURCHES</h1>
<h2 class="head1">AN EXPLANATION OF THE FACT AND THE PRINCIPLE</h2>
<p>We now come to the question concerning our receiving of people in the churches, that is, how to determine whether to baptize someone. To baptize someone is to receive him. This matter is clear to us in principle, but we still need to carefully consider its practical aspect. For the past few years our principle for receiving people, that is, for determining whether or not to baptize people, was right. However, we must confess that we have been weak and short in carrying out this matter. We may not have been clear at the time, but looking back, the facts indicate that our practice had certain defects. For example, some who did not have a relationship with the Lord were baptized.</p>
<p>We were clear concerning the principle that only a saved person should be baptized, that is, a person who has believed, who has been saved. We should not baptize those who receive the Lord Jesus nominally but do not receive God&rsquo;s life and have no inward relationship with the Lord. In our practice, however, we have baptized some who we thought were saved but who did not actually have a relationship with the Lord or have God&rsquo;s life within them. In some localities we have met people like this. Consequently, we should reconsider our practice. Although our principle is right, the dependability of our practice is questionable.</p>
<p>In the past, at certain times, we baptized many people; however, few among them remained after being baptized. One reason is that we were not able to take care of such large numbers adequately. Although they were truly saved, they eventually became cold due to their environment or inadequate care. Some may have remained cold for two years but turned and were revived during the third year. Nevertheless, we cannot deny that some, perhaps a small number, were never clear concerning salvation, yet due to our inaccurate judgment, we baptized them. In the end, they left after being baptized.</p>
<p>We can point to several people whose salvation we initially doubted and who, we are now quite certain, were never saved. Despite our initial doubts, we indeed baptized them. Now they neither meet nor bear the testimony of being Christians. This compels us to reconsider our practice.</p>
<p>We must admit that we have viewed the matter of receiving and baptizing people too lightly and inadequately, without realizing its seriousness. This is especially true of the brothers who contact people and are responsible for deciding whom to baptize. It seems that we have made the decision regarding receiving and baptizing people an easy and convenient matter. Our basic problem is that we have not taken this matter seriously.</p>
<p>Many times we have simply accepted a person&rsquo;s word; however, the basic principle is that we must be serious when determining whether one should be received and baptized. If not, I am afraid that due to our negligence in this matter there will be confusion among us.</p>
<p>The matter of whom to receive and baptize has been a great controversy in the church from the time the first apostles passed away. Various Christian groups and sects all hold different views concerning this matter. Our principle in this matter is that we follow the Bible. Only those who believe should be baptized (Mark 16:16; Acts 8:12). This principle is correct, but how do we identify a person as a believing one, a saved one? This involves a number of difficulties. How can we determine whether or not a person has been saved? For him to be saved is one matter, but for us to determine whether he is saved is another matter. There is much room for interpretation. Perhaps one brother thinks that a man is not saved, but another thinks that he is saved. We may all agree to the principle of baptizing only those who are saved, but the difficulty lies in verifying the details. One brother may think that a certain person is saved, but I may think otherwise. Hence, there is much to consider when determining whether or not a person is saved.</p>
<p>The definition of salvation among different believers also varies. Since there is variation in determining who is genuinely saved and in our understanding of what it means to be saved, there are always problems related to this matter. We do not have any problems in regard to principle, but we face difficulties in regard to carrying out the principle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO ASPECTS OF SALVATION&mdash;<br />
BELIEVING AND BEING BAPTIZED</h2>
<p>According to our observation, for the past few years we have not had the wrong principle, but we have had an inaccurate understanding of salvation. We also were not accurate in determining who was saved; hence, certain problems arose.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be saved? Who is a saved one? What is the definition of salvation? To be fully saved requires first that we believe and second that we be baptized. Mark 16:16 says, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; The Bible does not say that he who believes and is saved shall be baptized but that he who believes and is baptized shall be saved. Hence, baptism is based on believing, not on being saved. To receive complete salvation, we must believe and be baptized. However, believing and being baptized are not two steps but can be considered as two &ldquo;feet.&rdquo; Only when both feet step forward can they make a complete step. To believe and be baptized is one step, a complete step involving two &ldquo;feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To receive salvation requires only one step: believing and being baptized. The Gospel of Mark says clearly that in order to receive God&rsquo;s salvation, one must believe and be baptized. However, this matter is not so simple. Strictly speaking, some portions of God&rsquo;s salvation can be received and obtained immediately through believing. In similar manner, when we enter a house, we must first put one foot forward. As soon as we put one foot forward, we have entered halfway. Once we bring our other foot forward, we are able to fully enter into the house. As soon as we believe, we receive a portion of God&rsquo;s salvation. It may not be complete, but it is at least partial salvation. Strictly speaking, baptism is based on believing, and baptism is also based on salvation. When a person believes, he truly receives a portion of salvation, and based upon this portion of salvation, he can be baptized. In another sense, baptism is not based upon salvation. A person is first baptized and then saved. It is true that a portion of salvation can be received only through baptism. Hence, being saved through believing, through baptism, and through believing and being baptized are three ways of describing the steps of salvation, and they do not conflict with one another.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 3, The Organization of the Church &nbsp; pg 43</div><br></body></html>
