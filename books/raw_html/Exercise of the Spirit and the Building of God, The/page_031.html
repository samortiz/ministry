<h1 class="title">BALANCING THE WORD WITH THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 6:63</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BALANCED SUPPLY<br />
OF THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The church receives the supply from the Word and from the Spirit. The church is always revived and supplied by the Word and by the Spirit. According to church history, in some situations the supply to the church was focused on the Word. However, this does not mean that the Spirit was not involved, because once the Spirit is lost, the Word becomes dead letters and is unable to supply the church. In other situations the supply to the church was focused on the Spirit, but the Spirit cannot supply without the Word. Without the rich Word as the means and content, the Spirit is powerful but not rich in our experience. Thus, without the Word, the Spirit cannot render the supply in a full way.</p>
<p>With regard to the Spirit, the Pentecostal movement that emerged in China thirty years ago was living and powerful, but it was poor with regard to the release of the Word to the children of God. The meetings of the Pentecostal movement were living and strong, but they were poor because they were short of the rich Word as the means and content.</p>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s wise arrangement, the church is to be supplied by the Word and the Spirit in a balanced way. The church needs the supply from both the Word and the Spirit. The Word that the church needs is supplied by the Spirit; the Spirit that the church needs is revealed and unveiled through the Word. Without the Word, the church is poor; without the Spirit, the church is dead and weak. In other words, if there is the Word but not the Spirit, the church will be dead and weak. If there is the Spirit but not the Word, the church will be poor. We must see that in His wisdom, God&rsquo;s provision is a balanced combination of the Word and the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals that God, in His desire to have a relationship with man, is the Word and the Spirit. God is the Lord, but if He is not also the Word and the Spirit, we cannot understand, know, touch, and contact Him. We can know Him and contact Him because He is both the Word and the Spirit. The Word explains and reveals God. His Word opens our mind and enlightens us so that we may understand and know Him. The Spirit enables us to contact, touch, gain, experience, and enjoy Him; otherwise, we have no way to know such a mysterious God. God&rsquo;s being both the Word and the Spirit is His great grace to mankind. This is also a crucial point in the Gospel of John.</p>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;The Word was God.&rdquo; In other words, God is the Word. Verse 24 of chapter 4 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit.&rdquo; Verse 63 of chapter 6 says that the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit and life. This verse links the Word and the Spirit. God is the Word and the Spirit, and God as the Word is the Spirit. These verses are not found in Matthew, Mark, and Luke; they are only in John, because John speaks of the wonderful, mysterious, unfathomable, invisible God who can now be known, contacted, touched, gained, and enjoyed by men. The way to know and touch such a wonderful and mysterious Lord depends on His being the Word and the Spirit. If He were not the Word, we could not know Him, and if He were not the Spirit, we could not touch Him. Therefore, we worship Him as the Word and the Spirit. As such, we can know and touch Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO GREAT GIFTS</h2>
<p>God gives two great gifts to those who are saved: the Holy Bible, that is, the Word, and the Holy Spirit. The Bible and the Spirit, who is God Himself, have been given to mankind. We have not only the Holy Bible in our hand but also the Holy Spirit in our spirit. The Bible explains God, and we can read it any time. It opens our mind and guides our thoughts so that we may know, understand, and comprehend God. Furthermore, the Spirit, who is God Himself, has entered our spirit so that after knowing God, we can receive, experience, eat, drink, and enjoy Him in our spirit, based on the words in the Bible that we have read. This is God&rsquo;s twofold provision of grace, neither aspect of which should be neglected.</p>
<p>God is the Word, and God is the Spirit. How do we experience Him as such? The Word of God that is not only presented to us but also heard, understood, and received into us becomes the Spirit. We read and comprehend the Bible, but after we take it in and are touched by it, we receive inspiration. This is how the Word becomes the Spirit in us. We read the Word, but after we take it in, it becomes the Spirit. The Bible in our hands is the Word, but when the word is in us, it is the Spirit. This also applies to the messages that we hear. The words that we understand and are touched by should be received into us, and then we will receive inspiration. We hear the words, but they become the Spirit who enters into us. When we read a spiritual book or listen to the testimonies of the saints, we first read, hear, and understand the words, and then we are enlightened by the words. As soon as we receive these words into us, they immediately become the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Word is God explained and revealed to open our mind and enlighten our thoughts so that we may understand Him. After we understand, we receive inspiration. When we receive inspiration from the Word, it becomes the Spirit in us. This Spirit is the life supply. Hence, if the Word does not come into us and become the Spirit, it cannot become our supply. The Word of God that is in our hand inspires, unveils, and enlightens us so that we may know God and know His deeds, His nature, and His riches. The words that we receive become the Spirit in us for our life supply.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
