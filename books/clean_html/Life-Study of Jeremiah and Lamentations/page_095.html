The more we study these aspects, the more we are brought into the excellency of the knowledge of Christ (Phil. 3:8). Through this excellency of the knowledge of Christ, we enter into the rich experience and enjoyment of Christ. In this message we will consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the son of David and the son of Abraham.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST AS THE SON OF DAVID</H2><P>The New Testament opens with the words, "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham" (Matt. 1:1). In this verse there are two titles of Christ: son of David and son of Abraham. It is surely significant that the very first verse of the New Testament mentions these two titles.</P><P>If we know the New Testament as a whole, we will realize that the entire New Testament is wrapped up with these titles. In Revelation 22:16 the Lord Jesus refers to Himself as "the Root and the Offspring of David." In His divinity, Christ is the "Root of David," his source; in His humanity, He is the "Offspring of David," his issue. Hence, Christ is the Lord of David as the Root, and He is also the seed, the branch, of David as the Offspring (Matt. 22:42-45; Rom. 1:3; Jer. 23:5).</P><P>Some may think that Matthew 1:1 is simply a revelation telling us how Christ came into mankind through being the son of Abraham and the son of David. However, the titles son of David and son of Abraham are not simply for us to know the revelation concerning Christ's person. These titles are for us to experience Christ and enjoy Him.</P><P>The Gospel of Matthew emphasizes the fact that Christ is the son of David (9:27; 15:22; 20:30-31; 21:9). Solomon, the son of David, was a type of Christ in three main aspects. First, he was a type of Christ inheriting the kingdom (2 Sam. 7:12b, 13; Jer. 23:5; Luke 1:32-33). Second, Solomon had wisdom and spoke the word of wisdom. In Matthew 12:42 Christ, the greater Solomon, also had wisdom and spoke the word of wisdom. Third, Solomon built the temple of God (2 Sam. 7:13). As the son of David, Christ builds up God's temple, the church.</P>
