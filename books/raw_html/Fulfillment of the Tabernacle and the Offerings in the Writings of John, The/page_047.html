<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWELVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SERPENTINE PEOPLE BECOMING THE UNIVERSAL INCREASE OF THE UNLIMITED CHRIST BY THE IMMEASURABLE SPIRIT WITH THE ETERNAL LIFE</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 3:5-6, 8, 14-16, 29-30, 31-36</h1><p>In our reading of John 3 we need a proper realization and appreciation of five matters: the serpentine human being (vv. 6,14), the universal increase of Christ (vv. 6, 30), the unlimited Christ (vv. 29-36), the immeasurable Spirit (vv. 5-6, 34), and eternal life (vv. 15-16, 36). Actually these five matters form the title of this message: “The Serpentine People Becoming the Universal Increase of the Unlimited Christ by the Immeasurable Spirit with the Eternal life.” I would call your attention to the adjectives used to describe people, increase, Christ, Spirit, and life. The people are serpentine, the increase is universal, Christ is unlimited, the Spirit is immeasurable, and the life is eternal. Let us now go on to consider each of these five matters.<h2 class=head1>THE SERPENTINE NATURE</h2><p>In John 3 the serpentine nature of human beings is unveiled. The Lord told Nicodemus, “That which is born of the flesh is flesh” (v. 6). In verse 14 the Lord said to him, “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.” This word implies that Nicodemus had a serpentine nature. Nicodemus may have been a gentleman, but he was a serpentine gentleman. Furthermore, Nicodemus may have considered himself a moral and good man. But no matter how good or moral he may have been outwardly, inwardly he had the serpentine nature. The Lord indicated to Nicodemus that as Moses lifted up the brass serpent in the wilderness, so He would be lifted up on the cross to die as Nicodemus’ Substitute. This surely indicates that, like all the other fallen human beings, Nicodemus was serpentine. Hence, in this chapter we definitely have the unveiling of the serpentine nature.<h2 class=head1>THE UNIVERSAL INCREASE OF CHRIST</h2><p>John 3:30 refers to the increase of Christ. The universal increase of Christ is related to the spirit, the spiritual part of a human being. John 3:6b says, “That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” We believers have both a serpentine nature in our being and also a spiritual part of our being. We all need to recognize the fact that we have these two kinds of being. If we do not live in our spirit, then surely we shall live in our serpentine nature, no matter whether what we do is good or bad. It is possible for both good things and bad things to be done in our serpentine being.<p>The title of this message speaks of serpentine people becoming the universal increase of the unlimited Christ. Our regenerated human spirit is part of the increase of Christ, and this increase is Christ’s multiplication and reproduction. Through the process of regeneration, serpentine human beings can become part of Christ’s increase.<h2 class=head1>THE UNLIMITED CHRIST</h2><h2 class=head2>From Above</h2><p>In chapter three of John we can see at least nine aspects of the unlimited Christ. First, the unlimited Christ is from above, that is, from the heavens: “He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth is of the earth and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all” (v. 31). At that time, Christ was in the flesh, and the flesh is from earth. But within Him there was a part that was from above, from the heavens.
