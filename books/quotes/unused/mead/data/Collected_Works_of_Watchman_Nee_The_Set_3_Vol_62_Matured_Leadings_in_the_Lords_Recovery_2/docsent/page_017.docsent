   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SERVICE 4 Date:Saturday evening, February 18, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Weigh Kwang-hsi: Lord, we thank and praise You for becoming flesh, living a life on the earth, bringing God's will, His work, and His word to the world, and showing us a clear way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, we confess that the church in Hong Kong is in a fallen state.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We cannot hide from the shining of Your great light.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But we thank and praise You.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through Your servants You have presented Your will and way before us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Grant us the grace and power to go on in the way that pleases You.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, how we thank and praise You for giving the spiritual gifts and inheritance to the church throughout the past two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We also praise and thank You for revealing Your will and heart's desire to us through Your servants.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You have put us in this closing period of the end time when Your coming is so imminent, and You have shown us such abundant light and such a clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>May we not miss the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>May all of us be willing and able to forsake everything to serve You as our Lord and our King.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE NEED FOR THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>TO SUBDIVIDE INTO DISTRICTS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Witness Lee: According to the Bible, a church should be local.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The boundary of the locality is determined by the boundary of its civic administrative unit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible shows us local churches, but it does not have churches on a street or churches in a district.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The justification for starting a church is not based on its number of members.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A local church may cover a large geographical area and may have a large number of people, but it is still one church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, it is hard for a church that is large geographically or numerically to take care of the needs of every brother and sister.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church in Jerusalem began with three thousand and then five thousand saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Paul returned to Jerusalem to meet James, there were tens of thousands of believers in that city Acts 2:41; 4:4; 21:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not an easy thing for a church of this size to carry out something or to meet the needs of every brother and sister.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, there is the need to subdivide such a church into districts to facilitate the work and to reach and visit the saints easily.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The districts are not the church, but they are almost like mini local churches; they fulfill many of the functions of a church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They have their own meetings, they cover many practical affairs, and they exercise care over all the brothers and sisters.</S>
