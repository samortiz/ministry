Furthermore, men are afraid of a high place and of terrors on the road; the almond tree blossoms.<h1 class=scripture>(Ecclesiastes 12:1, 3-5a)</h1><p>And that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness.<h1 class=scripture>(2 Timothy 3:15-16)</h1><p>We have two verses, one in the Old Testament and one in the New Testament; one concerning your Creator and one concerning the Scriptures, the Bible. &#8220;Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth,&#8221; and, &#8220;From childhood you have known the sacred writings.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>REMEMBER YOUR CREATOR</h2><p>&#8220;Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth.&#8221; God is our Creator. This verse tells us we have to remember God because we are created by God. God is our source. In the days of your youth, when you are young, you need to remember God.<h2 class=head1>BEFORE TROUBLES COME</h2><p>&#8220;Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come and the years draw near when you will say, &#8216;I have no delight in them.&#8217;&#8221; Young people do not understand what the evil days here are, because the evil days are days of trouble that come to the old men, to the old people. When people become old, every day is a day of trouble. They have all kinds of trouble.<p>When you are young, you don&#8217;t have many troubles. You enjoy yourself every day. The younger you are, the more you enjoy your life. But the older you become, the more trouble you will have. Everyone knows that parents have more troubles than their children have. For the most part, children do not have troubles. Troubles are all evil, so evil days are just days of trouble. When you are young, the evil days have not come yet. You should remember God when you are young, when you don&#8217;t have that many troubles, before the evil days come. This is the time to remember your Creator.<h2 class=head1>NO PLEASURE</h2><p>&#8220;The years draw near when you will say, &#8216;I have no delight in them.&#8217;&#8221; Here delight means pleasure. This verse means that I will have no pleasure in those years. The younger you are, the more pleasure you have. All the young ones only know how to play, to have pleasure, to enjoy themselves. But old people do not have as much pleasure as the young ones do. Before these years draw near, before you become old, you need to remember God.<h2 class=head1>DON&#8217;T WAIT</h2><p>All the verses from Ecclesiastes 12:1 through 7 tell us to remember God when you are still young. Don&#8217;t forget Him. Don&#8217;t wait until you become old. When you become old, your days will be evil days, and your years will be years of no pleasure. Verses 2 through 7 give you a picture of the old people, of what it is like to be old.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | First | Prev | <a href="page_002.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Remember Your Creator &nbsp; pg 1</div><br></body></html>
