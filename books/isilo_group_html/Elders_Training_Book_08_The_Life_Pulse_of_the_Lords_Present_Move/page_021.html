THE BASIC TRUTHS IN AN EDUCATIONAL WAY</h2>
<p>At this point, we want to focus our attention on the truth lessons. In 1 Timothy 2:4 Paul tells us that God desires everyone who has been saved to be brought not just to a partial knowledge but to a full knowledge of the truth. Basically speaking in this century, regardless of what country a person lives in, he must have a basic education. The United States practices compulsory education until a person is sixteen years old, and everyone is encouraged to at least have a high school education. Without this education as a base, it would be hard for a person to do anything with his human life. For so many years we missed the way to teach the truths in a lesson way, in a way of education, to let the saints have a basic knowledge of God&rsquo;s revelation. Every person should have a basic knowledge of human education, so he needs to pass through elementary, junior high, high school, and then college.</p>
<p>Throughout the past years what we have been practicing was like the giving of lectures by experts and specialists. We had a college with no classrooms, no classes, no teachers, and no textbook. We would always invite two or three specialists to give lectures. Just consider a university with five thousand students without classrooms, without professors, and without a textbook, only having famous specialists come in to give lectures. Every lecture given is marvelous and wonderful. But after four years what will the students receive? All they will receive is some terms and some principles. They will not have received the proper, basic education. This has been exactly what we have been doing in the past years. Many messages were like lectures, and every church expected the top expert to come to give the lecture.</p>
<p>My present burden is not to go to any place to give lectures. I would rather go somewhere to set up classes. To have a school to educate the young people, we need classes, we need grades, we need lessons, and we need a textbook. If I had not attended any classes in mathematics, and I had just learned from my parents or friends, I may have some fragments of the knowledge of mathematics, but I would not be able to teach others. Whoever composes a textbook for mathematics considers the entire realm of mathematics and picks up some crucial points with some crucial lines. When children study a textbook on mathematics, they should have a clear view of the matter of addition. But we have not done this. Our practice has been to give messages or lectures on topics such as sanctification and redemption.</p>
<p>I know some saints who have been in the church life and under the church&rsquo;s speaking for over thirty-seven years. If they were asked, however, to give a clear word concerning the Lord&rsquo;s redemption or concerning sanctification to a group of newly saved believers, they could not do it. Their feeling is that only I and the co-workers trained by me for years can do such a thing. We heard that Christ is our Person and we also heard something concerning the essential Trinity, the economical Trinity, and God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. But many of the saints cannot tell us what God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is. The saints have heard many messages concerning Christ&rsquo;s death, but who can speak something concerning the seven aspects of Christ&rsquo;s death? Very few can give a proper message on justification in a good sequence and in a full way. It is even harder for many of the saints to speak the deeper truths concerning God&rsquo;s economy, God&rsquo;s dispensation, and God&rsquo;s dispensing. Many messages have been published concerning the divine Trinity, but how many of us can present a full word concerning the divine Trinity according to what we have heard in the past years? This is due to the fact that we had no proper way to acquire a spiritual education. We did not adopt the educational way by classes with a textbook.</p>
<p>The popular educational system in the world today is for a person to pass through elementary school, junior high school, high school, and then college. If we are going to educate the saints, we must take this system. The good point of this educational system is that it gives people the popular, the common, and the normal basic knowledge. I have come to the conclusion that we must practice this educational system in the spiritual lessons. This is why I have been burdened to publish <em>Truth Lessons.</em> The one hundred ninety-two lessons of this series are meant to be covered in four years&mdash;forty-eight lessons per year. With these truth lessons my burden is to upgrade the standard of Christians&rsquo; understanding of the truth.</p>
<p>Many Christians only have a very limited knowledge of the truth. They know that we were once sinners destined to go to the lake of fire. But God loved us and gave His Son for us. His Son came to die on the cross for our sins. If we believe in Him, we will be forgiven of our sins and we will be saved. Then we need to live a good life and when we die we will go to heaven. This is the extent of the truth which many Christians have. But now we will have a series of truth lessons that will cover all the crucial points of the entire Bible.</p>
<p>In the first two volumes there are lessons which give us a key view of the entire Old Testament. If you read or study all these lessons, you can have a general view concerning the Old Testament. The view given in these truth lessons is not in the way of today&rsquo;s seminaries. My burden is not to give people lessons concerning the history, the geography, or the literature of the Old Testament. I care to give people the spiritual significance. The lessons on Adam, Abel, Enosh, and Enoch unveil the spiritual significance seen in these Old Testament saints. Through two lessons we are given a key view of the Old Testament in the entire book of Genesis from Adam to Noah (Lesson Seven) and from Abraham to Joseph (Lesson Eight). After studying these two lessons, you have a clear view of the first book of the Old Testament and all the great men in the book of Genesis are covered. By this fellowship you can realize the purpose of the truth lessons.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 08: The Life-Pulse of the Lord's Present Move &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
