By the Life-giving Spirit<br>as the Writing Ink in Our Ministry</H2><P>The way to enjoy Christ is also by the life-giving Spirit as the writing ink in our ministry (2 Cor. 3:6b, 3). Second Corinthians 3:3 says, "Since you are being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone but in tablets of hearts of flesh." This verse refers not only to the believers who receive the apostles' ministry but also to the ministers who minister the word of God to others. Both the believers and the ministers should be written on by Christ with the life-giving Spirit as the writing ink. Today we are under the writing of the life-giving Spirit. The more Christ writes upon us with the inking Spirit, the more we enjoy the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the gospel.</P><P>I can surely testify that the more I speak, the more I am written upon. Today there is writing going on within me. When I began to write the outlines for these messages concerning the way to enjoy Christ, a great deal of writing took place within me. The more I wrote, the more writing took place within me. It is in this way that we become ministers of the word. The ministry comes out of the inward writing of Christ with the Spirit as the writing ink. This writing Spirit is the life-giving Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>13. By Beholding the Glory of the Lord<br>for Our Transformation from the Lord Spirit<br>with the Element of the Lord</H2><P>We enjoy the all-inclusive Christ also by beholding the glory of the Lord for our transformation from the Lord Spirit with the element of the Lord into His image from glory to glory (2 Cor. 3:18). Today we all need to have an unveiled face, a face not covered by any veil. With such an unveiled face we can behold the glory of the Lord. The more we behold the glory of the Lord in this way, the more we are transformed from the Lord Spirit. The phrase from the Lord Spirit indicates a transmission. As we are beholding the Lord, a transmission takes place. This transmission is from the Lord Spirit with the element of the Lord. Transformation requires the addition of another element; without such an addition, transformation cannot take place. Through the transmission from the Lord Spirit, within whom is the element of the Lord, we are transformed from glory to glory.</P><P>We are all busy in the morning, but we must do our best to save ten or fifteen minutes each day to behold the Lord. To do this is not a waste of time. If possible, we should reduce our time for sleep. If we normally rise at six o'clock in the morning, we can gain fifteen minutes by rising fifteen minutes earlier. If we take another ten minutes from the time given to our business, we can have a total of twenty-five minutes for beholding the Lord each day. By beholding Him we will receive an element from the Lord that will transform us into the glorious image of Christ, even from glory to glory. This is the way to enjoy Christ.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_110.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_112.html">Next</a> </body></html>
