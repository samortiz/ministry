<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>15. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;<br>the Emphasizing of Methods<br>More Than the Inner Anointing,<br>and External Big Success More Than<br>the Experience of the Inner Life</H2><P>"There has been too much emphasizing of methods more than the inner anointing, and external big success more than the experience of the inner life. This is surely a deviation from the central lane of God's economy."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>Yes, we do need the inner anointing and the experience of the inner life. However, if we lack the proper external methods to match the inner anointing, and an adequate external success in fruit bearing to encourage the experience of the inner life, and we emphasize the inner anointing without the adequate methods with which to labor, and the experience of the inner life without the success of fruit bearing, we will not have the capable way to carry out God's economy in the central lane. Such a situation would be a real abuse of the central lane in God's economy. No one should put forth the accusation that to emphasize the necessary methods that we may work prevailingly through the inner anointing and to emphasize a satisfactory success that we may be encouraged to seek more experience of the inner life are a "deviation from the central lane of God's economy." To abide in the vine is a matter of the inner life, and it is for fruit bearing. If the abiding does not issue in fruit bearing but in barrenness, such an abiding should be condemned as an abusing of the inner life of the vine.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE WAY TO FACE THE DIVISIVE SITUATION</H2><P>Based on our study concerning the genuine oneness, the proper one accord, and the tests of these two matters, and based on the listing of some practical truths versus some dissenting accusations, we can come to consider the way to face the present divisive situation among us. This way can be considered a scriptural remedy to meet our present need.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. To Pay Full Attention to the Truth<br>concerning the Church as the Body of Christ<br>and as the House and Kingdom of God</H2><P>To face the present divisive situation, we need to pay our full attention to the truth concerning the church as the Body of Christ and as the house and kingdom of God. First Timothy 3:15 tells us that the church is the pillar and base of the truth. Thus, we must help the saints to have the full knowledge concerning these matters.</P>
