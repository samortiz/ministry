   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO THE SEVEN SPIRITS 3 Scripture Reading: Rev 2 3 THE SPEAKING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Based upon what we have seen in Revelation 1, we now want to see this wonderful One in Revelation 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these two chapters the most striking point is that this all-inclusive, excellent, marvelous, mysterious, and wonderful One speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He spoke seven times to each of the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In these seven times of speaking He always declared what He was.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Based upon the claim of what He was, He spoke something.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the beginning of each of the seven Epistles recorded in chapters two and three it is the Lord who speaks 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the end of all seven Epistles, however, it is the Spirit speaking to the churches 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a strong indication that the actual speaker is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This shows us that Christ and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Firstly we see Christ speaking and then Revelation tells us that the Spirit is the One who speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The oneness of the Trinity here is economical based upon the essential aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ and the Spirit are one economically because they are one essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because Christ, the Spirit, is speaking, this does not refer to existence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This refers to the move, the motion, the action, of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ and the Spirit s being one economically depends upon their being one essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I hope this shows us more concerning the depth of the truth of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the end of the book of Revelation the Spirit and the bride say 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the first chapter we see many titles for this wonderful One the One who is, and who was, and who is coming, the seven Spirits who are before the throne, Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, the Ruler of the kings of the earth, the Redeemer, the One who made us a kingdom, priests to His God and to His Father, and the One who comes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Also, in Revelation 1 we see the Son of Man appearing as the High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the last chapter of Revelation, however, in the finalization, there will only be the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The all-inclusive, compound, sevenfold intensified, life-giving, processed, indwelling Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God, the Spirit, in Revelation 22:17.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word processed indicates all the procedures that the Triune God has gone through.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Revelation 1 are many titles for this wonderful One, but in chapter two are Christ, the all-inclusive Head, and the speaking Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that whatever He is in chapter one has been condensed into the all-inclusive Christ and the speaking Spirit in chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the end of the book of Revelation we see the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The all-inclusive Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The bride is the consummation of the processed tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the processed Triune God will be the bridegroom and the processed tripartite man will be the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The processed God and the transformed and glorified tripartite man become a divine couple in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Revelation 2 and 3 are composed of seven epistles and are the Lord s last words written to His churches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this chapter we want to see who the speaker is in each of these seven epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We want to see this speaking One s status and we also want to see what He promises to the overcoming church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to see all the main points of this Person and His promise.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Revelation 2 and 3 we see that the all-inclusive Christ as the Head of the church, walking in the midst of the churches and searching and infusing the churches, speaks to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST Holding the Seven Stars in His Right Hand</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the epistle to the church in Ephesus we see the all-inclusive Christ as the One who holds the seven stars in His right hand Rev 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The brothers who are taking the lead in the churches as the messengers Gk. angels Rev 1:20 are held in this One s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This One is the holder of all the church leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, some of the so-called church leaders may not be held by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He only holds those He recognizes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To be held by Him, you must be recognized by Him first.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must realize that the leading ones in the churches in the Lord s recovery are held in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Revelation 2:1 also tells us that He walks in the midst of the lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a wonderful scene!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>While the Lord is sitting at the right hand of God as our High Priest interceding for us, the churches Heb 7:25 , He is holding the messengers of the churches and walking in the midst of the churches to care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This One who holds the leaders in His hand and who walks in the midst of the churches is the all-inclusive, excellent, marvelous, mysterious, and wonderful One.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although we have been experiencing and enjoying One who is so rich, we did not have much realization that this One was so all-inclusive, excellent, marvelous, mysterious, and wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why the book of Revelation is needed to unveil such a One to us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to realize that this One is the Spirit, the Father, the Son, Christ, Jesus, the Son of Man, the Son of God, the High Priest, and many other items.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many readers of the book of Revelation consider this as a strange book because of items such as the beast coming out of the sea, the scarlet beast having seven heads and ten horns, and the seven seals, seven bowls, and seven trumpets.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we come to the book of Revelation, however, we primarily need to care for this wonderful One who is holding all the church leaders in His right hand and who is walking in the midst of all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A number of times some of the saints came to me and told me that it seemed to them that I never became disappointed or discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They wanted to know why this was the case.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The reason for this is that by His mercy, I have seen this marvelous One and I have seen that I am in His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To see this strengthens me to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I enjoy and experience the all-inclusive, excellent, marvelous, mysterious, and wonderful One.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is why the opening word in Revelation 2 says, These things says He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands v. 1 . To listen to this One s words you have to see who this One is.</S>
