   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EFFICACY OF CHRIST S REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have pointed out that the ashes from the sacrifices that burned on the grating fell to the bottom of the altar, whereas the fragrant aroma of the sacrifices ascended to God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus, the one who presented the sacrifice could see the ashes and thereby have evidence, confirmation, proof, that he had been forgiven and accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As believers, we may have the assurance that because Christ s redemption reaches the level of God s requirements the standard of His righteousness, holiness, and glory we have been accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we must go on to see the significance of the height of the part of the altar above the grating being the same as the part underneath the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This signifies that the efficacy of Christ s redemption is according to its standard.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The fragrant aroma of the sacrifices ascended for God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This refers to the efficacy of Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The efficacy is according to the same standard as the accomplishment of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How is it possible for God to be satisfied with Christ s redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God can be satisfied because Christ s redemption fulfills all His requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a result, this redemption has an efficacy, and this efficacy is according to the same standard for God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These matters are difficult to explain, but we realize them by experiencing them in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever we enjoy Christ and His redemption, we have the sense deep within that Christ s redemption is fully according to the standard of God s requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, we realize that the efficacy of Christ s redemption is such that it satisfies God according to His requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You may have had this kind of experience when you were saved, although you may not have had the words to describe it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I can testify that I experienced this when I was saved more than fifty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I had full peace because I realized that Christ s death on the cross fulfilled all of God s requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The requirements of God s righteousness, holiness, and glory had been fulfilled by the redeeming death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Knowing that because of this I was no longer short of God s requirements, I was at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No longer could anything condemn me or drive me away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I could not be blamed or cast into hell.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I had the full assurance that Christ died to fulfill God s requirements for me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What else could God require of me?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I had such assurance and peace that I could even challenge God and say, God, the death of Christ has fulfilled all of Your requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What else can you demand of me?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All new believers should issue such a challenge to God, knowing that Christ has fulfilled the requirements of God s righteousness, holiness, and glory for us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you challenge God in this way, asking what else He can demand of you, He may reply, I have no further demands.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The unique death of Christ has fulfilled all of My requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because the grating is on the same level as the propitiation-cover, God can come to converse with us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here on the propitiation-cover we can have fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hallelujah, the requirements have been fulfilled, and we do not have any shortage!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I was saved, I had a deep realization that God was pleased and satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the fragrant aroma ascending to Him for His pleasure and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the efficacy of Christ s redemption being according to God s standard for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Praise the Lord that we have peace and that God has satisfaction!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, both we and God are happy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the enjoyment and experience of Christ with His redemption in the four rings, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Underneath we have the ashes, and above we have the sweet fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Both the ashes and the fragrance are according to the standard of God s requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, we are not carrying the altar in an individualistic way, but in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church is bearing the poles in the rings to testify the redeeming Christ in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
