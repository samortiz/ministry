   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SUPPLY OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us first speak concerning the supply of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then we will come back and talk about the way of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Supply of the Word</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>for Edifying New Believers</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Regarding the ministry of the word, for now we will use the following arrangement: We will have fifty-two topics for the regular year.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In addition, we will have one or two topics on the side for use in the leap years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Please remember, when we are strong in the matter of preaching the gospel, many will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once many have been saved, there will be more trouble for the church because all kinds of people will come in. All kinds of fish will be pulled into the boat; therefore, we will need to take good care of them, providing the new believers with edification once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We do not plan to change the topics for the meeting for edifying new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every local church in every locality will speak the same topic on every Thursday or Friday.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Tsingtao will do this; Shanghai will do this; Foochow will also do this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every locality will be working in the same steps.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From now on we do not plan to modify the topics used in the meeting for edifying new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It will not be one way this year and another way next year.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We desire that every group of new believers that comes in would receive the same edification by being brought together in each locality every Thursday or Friday.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to spend an entire year to touch all the main matters in the Word of God and the way to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this way there will be no lack with respect to the supply of the word for the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not be afraid that something might be lacking if there is no Lord's Day message meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At least with respect to the new believers, there will be no lack; the supply will still be there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I hope that the brothers who go out to work will not change these topics, but simply work accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you want to change, let us wait until our next gathering to discuss how to make adjustments.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today I believe the topics which we have selected are already prevailing enough and sufficient to supply them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once we have the work related to the gospel, plus the fifty-two topics for the edification of the new believers, I believe it will be very easy to meet the need of a local church regarding the matters of the faith and our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this way the brothers will not need to search everywhere for food.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Word and the Anointing Being Repeated</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you are living, then these things will be living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you are dead before God, these things will become like publicly recited prayers; they will become dead things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If all of you are living, then even that which is dead will become living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If all of you are dead before God, even the living things will become dead, even a book as living as the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the same way, if you are living, I believe that by speaking the things we have arranged year after year, both the words and the anointing can be repeated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The words can be repeated, and the life can also be repeated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this way you can edify the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Supply for the Gospel and</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>the Supply for Edification</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now you have seen that there are two meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first is the Lord's Day morning gospel meeting, stressing gospel preaching for saving people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once some have been saved and brought in, you must pay attention before God to give the new believers a clear leading in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord's Day morning supply of the word is related to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The supply of the word on Thursday or Friday night is related to edification.</S>
