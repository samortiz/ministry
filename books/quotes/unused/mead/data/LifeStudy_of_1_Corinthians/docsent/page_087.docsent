   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PLANTING AND WATERING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As believers, we should also be those who plant and water.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From reading verses 6 and 7, we may get the impression that only certain ones like Paul and Apollos can plant and water.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But we should not think that only the leading ones or those who share in the ministry of the Word can do the planting and the watering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No, everyone of us should both plant and water.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some saints may have the concept that we are either planters or waterers, but not both planters and waterers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A brother who does the work of planting may feel that he should not water what he has planted, regarding that as the work of another brother.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He may think of himself as the planter and suppose that someone else should do the watering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To view the matter of planting and watering this way is to be according to our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we turn to our spirit and exercise our spirit, we shall not care whether we are a planter or a waterer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, we shall simply carry on the work of planting and watering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some may not water other believers because they are afraid that they will damage them by watering them too much.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, it is better to make a mistake and cause some damage than to not water others at all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although you may make some mistakes, you will help many others to grow in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I encourage you all both to plant and to water.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE GREATEST NEED</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although feeding, drinking, eating, planting, and watering are all important, the greatest need is growth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can plant and water, but God alone makes to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As far as the growth in life is concerned, God is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because only God can make to grow, in our feeding, planting, and watering, we must be one with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that we need to carry on the feeding, the planting, and the watering in the organic union with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then, whenever we feed, He will also feed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He will feed in our feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The same should be true of our planting and watering.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before I give a message, I desperately pray, Lord, speak in my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Lord, cause me to be one spirit with You in my speaking in a very practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then I can have the full assurance that while I am speaking, He is speaking also.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have the boldness to declare that I am one spirit with the Lord and that He is now one spirit with me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without Him, whatever I speak will amount to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I may plant and water, but I have neither the ability nor the substance to cause others to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Growth comes from God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever He comes in, He causes us to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although only God can make to grow, He Himself will do neither the planting nor the watering.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He will not plant or water apart from us, just as He will not appear and speak to the saints directly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, He speaks to others in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that God must have a man to cooperate with Him for speaking, planting, and watering.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we plant and water, He will also plant and water.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How wonderful that we are not serving a dumb idol, but are serving the living God!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In our service, He serves the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not trust in my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>My speaking in itself does not carry any weight.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, I often have the assurance that when I open my mouth to speak, He speaks also.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Through my speaking, He flows forth into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>My trust is altogether in the Lord s speaking in my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>My only secret is the Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Apart from the Triune God, I am nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If it were not for Him, I would die.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all first need to enjoy the Lord by breathing, drinking, and eating.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are many ways to drink of Him and also many ways to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can partake of the Lord by pray-reading, by attending the meetings, and by having fellowship with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We can also receive the life supply by reading certain spiritual books.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There are many ways to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more we enjoy Him, the more we shall be saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then we shall have the burden to feed others, to plant, and to water.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we are one with the Lord in our feeding, planting, and the watering, the Lord will come in spontaneously to cause others to grow in life.</S>
