   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>At Home in the Fellowship of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Body is not a teaching; it is a life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Anyone who acts contrary to the demand of this life will not feel comfortable or be at ease.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This life not only demands that we love and be patient; it also demands that we behave as Body Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Twenty years ago, God might have tolerated your being an independent Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But all those who want to meet God's demands today feel the need of fellowship, the Body fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once a person is in this fellowship, he feels at home.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Christian life is a matter of life; everything issues from the demand of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Offering Up Everything for the Body Life</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I was saved twenty-three years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time I did have the opportunity to make money.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet, when money came into my hands, after a few months I did not have the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In reading the history of the early martyrs, we find a story about a group of soldiers who once rounded up some Christians in order to torture them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One Christian could not stand the pressure and withdrew.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But a soldier who saw the glorious expressions on the faces of the martyrs ran up and asked to fill in the place of the one who had withdrawn.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From today on, if you are still an independent Christian, you will not feel comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not simply a demand of love, it is a demand of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All those who will not offer up themselves will go away sorrowing, just as the young ruler did Matt 19:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All those who offer up themselves will say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every time you meet God's demand, He will become your strength.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today, we need to meet all of God's demands.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you only meet part of His demands, He will not work for you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only when you meet the Lord's full demands will He work for you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One sister hoarded many legs of ham in her house.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord constrained her to consecrate.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When she took up one leg, she felt that it was too big and tried to change for a smaller one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When she took up the second one, she still felt that it was too big.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When she picked up the third one, she still felt that it was too big.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In desperation she said to Satan, "Satan, if you say one more time that this is too big, I am going to give every one of them away!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's commandment to the Israelites was that they first had to put their feet into the waters of the Jordan before the waters would open up and the power would come.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brothers and sisters, give yourselves boldly to the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not worry about anything any longer!</S>
