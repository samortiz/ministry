   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>X. THE PRINCIPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF REPRESENTATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible contains a very important principle the principle of representation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have spoken of this before, and I would like to reiterate it here.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As Christians we walk according to two different principles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One is that we walk as individuals before God, and the other is that we walk in the capacity of a representative before God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the eyes of God we not only live the Christian life individually, but representatively.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If I am not deceived, I believe that in the coming judgment we will be judged not only individually but also according to what we do as representatives.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A. As a Master</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Suppose we have a master with a few servants in his house.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The master is a brother, but he treats his servants unrighteously, unjustly, unmercifully, and unreasonably.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He will be judged by God in the future for his unreasonableness, unrighteousness, and meanness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the matter will not stop here.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He will receive another judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This brother is responsible not only for his relationship with his servants.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the eyes of God and as a master, he represents the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever we are masters, we represent the Lord as the Master.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The way we treat our servants should represent the way the Lord treats His servants.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we treat our servants poorly, we sin as individuals and also as representatives; we have misrepresented the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If I am not deceived, I believe that we will be judged for our own sins and for the sin of misrepresenting the Lord in the coming judgment before God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>B. As a Servant</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Suppose I am not a master but a servant.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose further that as a servant, I steal, lie, and am slothful in my work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I only pay lip service to my master and deceive him in all kinds of ways.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have sinned, and I will be judged for my sinful conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the judgment will not stop here.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the one hand, I am a servant individually, and on the other hand, I stand as a representative of all the servants who are subject to the Lord in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I could afford to cheat, steal, and be slothful if it were just a matter of my personal service before man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But every time the Bible speaks of a servant, it reminds us that we have another Lord in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we are not only servants individually; we represent all those who are servants on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This expresses another relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>C. The Example of Moses</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Moses was at Meribah in Kadesh, he was angry at the Israelites because they tempted God, and he struck the rock twice.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God immediately rebuked Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moses lost his temper, and this was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If this had only been a personal matter or an independent act as a leader of Israel, Moses could have been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He had lost his temper previously.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When he saw the Israelites worshipping the golden calf at the foot of the mountain and then broke the two tablets with God s own writing, he displayed an even greater amount of anger Exo 32:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, God did not rebuke him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He represented God s wrath when he lost his temper then.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was angry on God s behalf, and his representation was right.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But what did God say when Moses lost his temper and struck the rock twice?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God said, You did not believe in Me, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the sons of Israel Num 20:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In other words, you have not separated Me from your actions; you have misrepresented Me. The Israelites thought it was God who was angry.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Actually, God was not angry.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>D. Individual Standing</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>and Representative Standing</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Personal sin is one thing, while representative sin is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>First Corinthians 11:3 indicates that every sister, that is, every woman even though such a woman cannot be found outside the church must realize that she has an individual standing as well as a representative standing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God is the Head of Christ, Christ is the Head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, the woman must have her head covered.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The woman must realize that she represents others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the very least she has to realize that she represents herself as an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>E. Individual Head Covering</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>and Representative Head Covering</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When a sister covers her head in speaking or in prayer, she is proclaiming before God that no one in the world can assume any headship before Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>She is saying that no head can be exposed before God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No one can be the head before Christ; no one can offer his suggestion or opinion to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Everyone has to cover his head before Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He should hide his own suggestions and opinions and say to the Lord, You are my Head.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A sister has to cover her head as an individual, and she has to cover her head in the position of a representative.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>She stands as a representative in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The sisters are declaring to the world the proper standing that everyone should take before Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Head covering may appear to be a small thing; yet it is a great testimony!</S>
