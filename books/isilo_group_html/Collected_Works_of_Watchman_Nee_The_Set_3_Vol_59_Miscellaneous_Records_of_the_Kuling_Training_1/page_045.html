He sent for Dathan and Abiram, but they said, "We will not come up. Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness, that you must also make yourself a ruler over us? Moreover you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up" (vv. 12-14). Then Moses was angry. He prayed to God, and this precipitated God's judgment. God wanted to consume the entire congregation, but through Moses' intercession, He agreed to destroy only those who rebelled. Moses told the rebellious ones, "In this shall you know that Jehovah has sent me to do all these works, and that it has not been of my own mind. If these men die the death that all men die, or if they are visited by what is appointed to all men, then Jehovah has not sent me. But if Jehovah creates something new, and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up, and all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into Sheol, then you shall know that these men have despised Jehovah" (vv. 28-30). After he spoke, the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up with all their goods (vv. 31-32).</p><h2 class="head2">Rebellious Ones Living<br />in the Realm of Reasonings</h2><p>Korah, Dathan, and Abiram had reasons for seeing things their way. They reasoned that the whole congregation was holy. Therefore, they said that Moses should not have assumed authority in himself because God was also with the congregation. Moses and Aaron readily acknowledged that God was with the congregation. The rebellious ones went on to say that Moses and Aaron had exalted themselves above the congregation of Jehovah. They had their own reasons for saying this. Then Dathan and Abiram accused Moses for leading them up out of the land flowing with milk and honey and of not leading them into Canaan but into the wilderness. In comparison with the wilderness, they regarded Egypt as a land flowing with milk and honey. Since the wilderness was not a land flowing with milk and honey, they accused Moses of thinking that they were blind. They were very clear that they were in the wilderness. Their eyes were clear and they saw the situation. They boasted that Moses could never make them turn a blind eye to the situation. They had their reasons, and they could argue a great deal. Please remember, however, that those who only touch reason are slaves to reason, while those who touch authority are servants of God. If a man lives by teaching, he will walk by reasonings. If we are to serve our God, we cannot tolerate the evil of these two companies of men. If we want to take God's way, we have to learn to walk not by sight or by reason. In Dathan and Abiram's own words, sometimes we have to "put out" our own eyes and walk by faith alone. A man often does not have spiritual eyesight unless his fleshly eyes first become blind. If a man has spiritual eyesight and is under God's authority, he will see that Canaan is a fact and the wilderness an empty mirage. All those who submit to authority with blind eyes will enter Canaan.</p><p>We have to ask ourselves, "By what principle do we serve God?" If we are in the principle of Korah's company and Reuben's tribe, we will concur with their arguments and live in the realm of reasons. Moses and Aaron, however, were the ones appointed by God to oversee the conquest of Canaan. Those who obeyed them would enter Canaan. Those who rebelled would die in the wilderness. This is a very solemn principle. The principle of the church is diametrically opposed to the principle of Hades. The principle of the church is obedience, while the principle of Hades is rebellion. If a man rebels, his way is the way of Hades and death. When Korah, Dathan, and Abiram rebelled, the earth opened and they went down to Hades. Such a way is a dark way, and leading them to Caanan is the last thing that such a way could accomplish. Obedience, however, is the way of light; it is a way that leads to Canaan. Brothers and sisters, please remember this word: Those who close their eyes will enter Canaan, while those who open their eyes may not enter it.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 59: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (1) &nbsp; pg 45</div><br></body></html>
