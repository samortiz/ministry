   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE FORTY-FIVE WALKING BY THE SPIRIT AS SONS OF GOD 2 Scripture Reading: Gal 3:26; 4:4-6; 5:16; John 1:12-13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that the books of Romans and Galatians reveal not only God s redemption, but also the economy of God s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is rather easy for us, the children of God, to know God s salvation, but not so easy to know the economy of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although the word economy cannot be found in either Romans or Galatians, God s economy in His salvation is nonetheless implied.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In both its ancient and modern usage, the word economy denotes a plan with a certain arrangement, management, administration, and even dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The economy of God has its arrangement, management, and stewardship related to God s dispensation of Himself in the Son through the Spirit into His chosen and redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>SONSHIP THE GOAL OF GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we must go on to see the goal of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God s goal in His economy is sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God s intention is to produce many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we read the Bible carefully, we shall see that God has a good pleasure, a heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The desire of God s heart is that He be expressed through many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible reveals that God is a great Father with a very large family.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In New Testament terms, God has a household.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Who can say how many sons God has?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since every genuine believer in Christ is a son of God, God s sons must number in the millions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because God has so many sons, He truly is a great Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even the sisters are counted among the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nowhere are we told that Christ, the firstborn Son of God, has sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, He has only brothers, and these brothers of Christ are the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, it is important for the sisters to realize that they are brothers of Christ and sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the Bible, the function of a son is to express the father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, the Son of God is the expression of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus once said, He who has seen Me has seen the Father John 14:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, John 1:18 says, No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The New Testament also indicates that as the Son of God Christ is the image of the invisible God Col 1:15; 2 Cor 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>An image is an expression of something or someone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For God to have millions of sons means that He, a great Father, needs a vast, universal, and eternal expression.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As sons of God, we express our Father, for we have been born of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s economy, His administration, is to carry out His purpose to have many sons to be His corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ephesians 1:4 and 5 say that God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world, having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before anything was created, God chose us and predestinated us, put a mark on us, unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God has marked us out to be His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, many Christians are not aware of God s choice and predestination.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to their concept, we are merely fallen sinners in need of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They have never dreamed that God has destined us for sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the Bible, sonship involves having the life and nature of the Father to express Him and inherit all that He is, has, and does.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To inherit whatever the Father is, has, and does actually is to inherit God the Father Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sonship in the Bible means to have God s life and nature to express God and to inherit God with all His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, sonship implies perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As sons of God, we must be perfect even as He is Matt 5:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Perfection is synonymous with maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A small boy is the genuine son of his father, but this boy does not yet have the full sonship, because he is not mature.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even if we have the Father s life and nature and have the maturity, the perfection, to express Him and inherit Him, the sonship will not be full until our body is transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Romans 8:23 Paul says, And not only so, but we ourselves also, having the firstfruit of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly expecting sonship, the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The redemption of our body refers to the transfiguration of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One day our body will be changed, not simply outwardly, but organically and metabolically by having the divine element wrought into it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today our faces may be rather bright, but they are not yet shining.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But when our body has been metabolically and organically transfigured through the supply of the divine life, not only our faces but our whole physical being will shine.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That will be the full sonship, for then we shall express God in full.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We shall express Him spiritually, psychologically, and even physically.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From our faces light will shine to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Concerning this 1 John 3:2 says, Beloved, now are we the children of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is lit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>. When we see Him, He will be shining with the glory of the Father, and we shall be shining with this glory also.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is full sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, from the New Testament we see that as sons of God we have God s life and nature to inherit God with all His wealth and to express Him to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This sonship is the desire of God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our wonderful, eternal Father wants a universal expression of Himself through many sons.</S>
