<h1 class="title">DEAD IN SINS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Eph. 2:1</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The meaning of death
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Death means the loss of function; spiritually, this is the inability to do good.</li>
	<li>Death also means the loss of feeling; spiritually, this is the unconsciousness of sin.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The fact of death
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The condition of man today is altogether one of death. He is unable to do good and is without the consciousness of sin. Having lost his function and feeling, he is ungodly toward God and unrighteous toward man; he is without the strength to be godly or righteous.</li>
	<li>Illustrate the facts of death. Show the inability to do good and the lack of consciousness of sin.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The source of death
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Death comes from sin.</li>
	<li>All who sin abide in death.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The result of death
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The death of the spirit occurs first.</li>
	<li>The death of the spirit results in the death of the body.</li>
	<li>It also causes the soul to suffer in Hades.</li>
	<li>In the end it will cause the whole being to be cast with its body, soul, and spirit into the lake of fire to suffer the second death, that is, eternal suffering.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to be free from death<br />
