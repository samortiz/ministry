S.</h2><p>I was born into a non-Christian family. Through my sister's death, God turned me to believe in Him. At that time I was not clear about salvation, but I felt that I was different inside. Every time I confessed my sins to the Lord, my heart was filled with joy and peace. After I believed in the Lord, I began to study the Bible and was interested in attending the meetings. In 1928 I worked at the China Inland Mission. Later I did not have the peace to stay there, and in 1937 I quit. The pastor in the C.I.M. Church rebuked me, saying, "You want to follow Watchman Nee. Is not our Hudson Taylor just as good?" That pastor had loved me very much, but after I resigned, he treated me like an enemy. In 1941 the meetings in various places in Chekiang were going on well, and the Lord heard many of our prayers. Later the condition of the church turned for the worse, and I began to bear more responsibility. I wanted to resign and ask God to raise up others. I could not drop the work, yet I could not advance in any way either. It was a painful experience. I found that there was a training in Kuling, but I was not a co-worker. Later one brother recommended me; he knew that my spiritual condition needed this training, and I was granted permission by Brother Nee to come. In looking back at my work, I find that I have come short of the Lord in many things. I have repented in tears, and the Lord has granted me mercy. Now I am rejoicing. I do not know what the way ahead of me is. May the Lord speak to me through our brother.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our brother needs to learn more lessons in the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Other than this one need, he has no great problems. His pathway is straight, and his spirit is pure. But he is short of some basic dealings. It is right for you to feel that the responsibilities in the church are too great. I would like to point out that your measure of service is determined by the amount of training you have received in the spiritual pathway. All the things you spoke of, including the services you have taken up in the church and your obedience to the truth, are all commendable. But you have to learn some personal lessons as well. A worker must learn obedience not only to the truth in the church or in the work; he must also learn to submit to the discipline of the Holy Spirit in the environment. The Spirit's discipline is God's building work, which He carries out through a man's personal environment. We should be like Paul, who learned his lessons through his many afflictions and who was able to comfort those who were in every affliction (2 Cor. 1:4). Some learn their lessons through biblical truth. Others learn them through the environment that the Spirit orders for them. A man who has totally committed himself to God will find Him to be unrelenting; he will find God operating on him through the permitted environment. I have said many times that it is a pity so many people have not learned their lessons through God's arranged environment.</p><p>We have to hand ourselves over to the Holy Spirit and yield to His arrangements in our environment. We should learn what we need to learn and not waste time. Whether or not you are rich depends on the kind of lessons you have learned in your ordinary daily life. The more you learn, the richer you will be in the church service. If you are not that rich, you will only be able to lead others according to the biblical truth. Some are able to guide and help others with the things that they have learned from the Lord through the Spirit's discipline. A person who has experienced much discipline from the Spirit should be richer than others. But I know of many brothers and sisters who have not learned much, even though they have experienced much discipline of the Spirit. I know of one sister in Shanghai who was stumbled every time she was disciplined by the Spirit. Such ones are like broken vessels littered in a pottery factory; no new vessel is produced. This is a pity. When the discipline of the Spirit is shallow, the earthen vessel of these ones remains intact. But as soon as the discipline of the Spirit becomes stronger, their earthen vessel breaks. May the Lord lead you to beseech Him every day to learn something through the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>We have to differentiate between the way of guidance according to the teaching of truth and the way of guidance according to the discipline of the Spirit. Some have not obeyed the truth, yet they have obeyed the discipline of the Spirit. Others have not obeyed the discipline of the Spirit, yet they have obeyed the truth. There is the need for a balance between these two kinds of obedience. One cannot neglect either kind. When a worker applies himself to his work, he has to know whether or not the brothers and sisters are balanced in these two aspects in their daily walk. I am saying this to those children of God who have learned some lessons in the spiritual pathway. When a man comes to us, we should know whether or not he is balanced in these two kinds of obedience. Many brothers and sisters have learned good lessons in the discipline of the Holy Spirit, but they are short in their obedience to the truth. We cannot be short in either aspect. We must have the proper balance so that God's pathway will be straight before us.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_075.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_077.html">Next</a> </body></html>
