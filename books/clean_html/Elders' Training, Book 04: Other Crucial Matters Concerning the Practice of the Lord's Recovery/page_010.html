<p>George Müller did not agree with this either. He said that you should not consider a brother such as Hudson Taylor a “companion of sin.” Hudson Taylor was George Müller’s friend in the Lord, and George Müller greatly helped the China Inland Mission financially. George Müller maintained that Hudson Taylor’s personal Christian life might have been better than some of the brothers in the Brethren Assembly. As a result of these differing opinions, there was a division among the Brethren. This was the origin of the so-called Exclusive Brethren and the so-called Open Brethren; the leader of the Exclusive Brethren was John Nelson Darby and the leader of the Open Brethren was George Müller.<p>On the one hand, I agree with George Müller and not with John Nelson Darby. He was wrong in this point. Hudson Taylor was called by God and received his burden for China from God. This was wonderful. In China I never said anything or did anything to discredit the China Inland Mission because I appreciated their work of bringing the gospel to the interior of China. That was a marvelous work which I appreciate and treasure. On the other hand, we cannot deny that even with this wonderful work there was an element of deviation which still remained.<p>This element of deviation can be seen in the practice of the China Inland Mission concerning the matter of the church. The China Inland Mission collected many devoted believers to pick up the burden to go to the interior of China to preach the gospel of Jesus there, yet all these believers came from different denominations. Some were Episcopalian, Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, and some even came from the Brethren. Hudson Taylor was very general. The decision was made that if you joined the China Inland Mission to bring the gospel to the interior of China, you could establish a church according to the denomination you came from. If you came from the Methodists, you could establish the church in the interior of China according to the Methodists. If you came from the Presbyterians, you could establish a Presbyterian style church in the interior of China. Therefore, under the name of China Inland Mission, the divisive forms of denominations still remained.<p>China Inland missionaries under the leadership of Hudson Taylor tried not to bring divisions to China, but they compromised with all the divisions. Actually, in the eyes of the Chinese Christians, the China Inland Mission was the same as the other denominations. Some of the denominational forms were still there under the one name of the China Inland Mission.<p>I agree that Hudson Taylor’s biography is a great help to the individual Christian life. However, once a reader gets the help from that book, it might be hard for him to have a clear and accurate view concerning the church. Mostly, the reader who receives so much help from such a book would just “swallow up” the whole book. Even if the reader did not swallow the entire book, there would be an unconscious entrance into his being concerning this deviation. Some young saints who read this book might think, “Could such a great evangelist who was used by God to such an extent be wrong? Could he be wrong in the way he established churches?” Then there would be a question in this young one’s mind concerning the recovery. This shows us that the subtle serpent is here. I passed through this stage as a young man. When I read Hudson Taylor’s biography I unconsciously asked myself whether or not he could be wrong. I asked myself whether or not we could be right in this matter. By the Lord’s mercy, I had passed through many kinds of testing situations before I read his biography. Thus, I was not affected.<p>We must consider the young ones among us. In such a biography some germs are there. The food is nourishing, but are you sure that the germs there would not poison the eater? This biography is very good, but it is not absolutely pure. At least, some element of deviation is there. Truthfully speaking, we must also realize that Mrs. Howard Taylor, who was Hudson Taylor’s daughter-in-law, was a good writer who was very promoting. This is why I stopped the publication of my writing of Brother Nee’s biography. I am still considering whether or not I might be promoting there. I do not like to give people an impression that I am writing a biography of Brother Nee just to promote something. One must be a very pure person to write a biography or a history without promoting.<h2 class=head1>CONDUCTING THE SAINTS TO THE RIGHT WAY</h2><p>We do not need to control the saints, and even more we do not need to stop them from reading what they want. As leaders in the Lord’s recovery, however, we should conduct the saints to the right way. We do not need to tell them not to go a certain way, but we must tell them to take the right way. We are here for the Lord’s recovery. The publications which can help and serve the Lord’s recovery in carrying out His New Testament economy for the fulfillment of His heart’s desire, I still would say, are the Life-studies, and the Recovery Version with the notes. Since this is the case, why would we not wisely conduct the church toward this way? For example, if someone asks us the best way to drive to Phoenix, we should conduct him to the straightest way.<p>We are not here merely for the individual Christian life, a mission work to the foreign field, or bearing the Lord’s name to the heathen countries. These are all good things, but this is not our commission. Our commission is to let the Lord carry out His New Testament economy by His New Testament ministry. This is why I feel very sorry that in certain places the leadership was not that strong or adequate. If the leadership in that part of the world had been strong and adequate, it would have conducted all the saints in every church to the right way. We should not waste time, we should not delay people, and we should not let confusions come in. We should not fail the Lord in His New Testament economy.</p>
