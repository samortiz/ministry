The Breastplate of Righteousness</H2><P>Ephesians 6:14 also speaks of the putting on of the breastplate of righteousness. The breastplate of righteousness covers our conscience, signified by the breast. Satan is our accuser. Therefore, in fighting against him we need a conscience void of offense. No matter how good we may feel our conscience is, we still need to have it covered with the breastplate of righteousness. Righteousness is a matter of being right with both God and man. If we have a little problem with either God or man, Satan will accuse us, and there will be holes in our conscience through which all of our faith and boldness will leak out. Hence, we need the covering of righteousness to protect us from the enemy's accusation. Such righteousness is Christ (1 Cor. 1:30). He is the breastplate of righteousness that covers our conscience. Hence, we are covered not by our own righteousness but by Christ as our righteousness. Furthermore, the breastplate of righteousness is related to the blood of Christ. In experience we cannot separate the blood from Christ. Apart from His blood, Christ cannot cover us. Under the cleansing of His blood, He becomes our righteousness as our breastplate of righteousness to cover our conscience.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>c. The Firm Foundation of the Gospel of Peace</H2><P>Ephesians 6:15 says, "And having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace." Our feet must be shod in order to strengthen our stand in the battle. The firm foundation of the gospel of peace means the establishment of the gospel of peace. Christ made peace for us on the cross both with God and with man, and this peace has become our gospel (Eph. 2:13-17). This gospel of peace has been established as a firm foundation, as a readiness with which our feet may be shod. Thus, we will have a firm footing that we may stand to fight the spiritual warfare. The peace for such a firm foundation also is Christ (v. 14).</P><P>As we fight against the evil powers, the peace which Christ has accomplished is a firm foundation for our feet. If we would take part in the spiritual warfare, our feet must be shod with this firm foundation. We fight in peace and with peace. Christ is the peace for us to be one with God and with the saints. This peace is the firm foundation that enables us to stand against the enemy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>d. The Shield of Faith</H2><P>Ephesians 6:16 continues, "Besides all these, having taken up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the flaming darts of the evil one." We need truth to gird our loins, righteousness to cover our conscience, peace as shoes to cover our feet, and faith as a shield to protect our entire being. If we live by God as reality (truth), we have righteousness (4:24), and righteousness issues in peace (Heb. 12:11; Isa. 32:17). Having all these, we can easily have faith as a shield against the flaming darts of the evil one. Christ is the Author and Perfecter of such faith (Heb. 12:2).</P><P>The shield of faith is not something that we put on, but something that we take up in order to protect ourselves against the attacks of the enemy. Faith comes after truth, righteousness, and peace. If we have truth in our living, righteousness as our covering, and peace as our standing, we will spontaneously have faith. This faith is a safeguard against the fiery darts, the attacks, of the enemy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>e. The Helmet of Salvation</H2><P>In Ephesians 6:17 Paul said, "And receive the helmet of salvation." This is for covering our mind against the negative thoughts directed at us by the evil one. Such a helmet, such a covering, is God's salvation. Satan injects into our mind threats, worries, anxieties, and other weakening thoughts. God's salvation is the shield that we put on to cover our mentality against all these. Such a salvation is the saving Christ whom we experience in our daily life (John 16:33).</P><P>Satan's darts come to us through our mind. Therefore, just as our conscience needs the breastplate of righteousness and our will needs the shield of faith, so our mind needs the helmet of salvation. We need truth, righteousness, peace, faith, and salvation. Righteousness issues in peace, and peace gives us the ground to have faith. Then faith brings in salvation.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth Lessons, Level 2, Vol. 3 &nbsp; pg 37</div><br></body></html>
