From the beginning we want to declare that we are not here to expound the Scriptures; rather, we are here to learn a lesson
As such we are using these two portions of the Word to proclaim what we should have experienced and what we have experienced
Although all were Levites belonging to God and to one tribe, the majority among them were only worthy to minister to the house
There was a small minority, who were not only Levites but also the sons of Zadok, who could minister to 'Me' that is, minister to Jehovah
If you come to the Lord's presence, focusing only on Him, you will spontaneously be able to minister to the brothers also
In the following sections, we will see the basic difference between ministering to the Lord and ministering to the house
We must see clearly that outwardly there may not be much difference between ministering to the house and ministering to the Lord
You may try your best to render help to the brothers, to diligently save the sinners, and to labor much in the service to manage the church
According to his nature, he likes to preach the gospel; so he is happy to do it and feels that he is ministering to the Lord
A sister may think it is dull to stay home and take care of the children, to be someone's wife, and to do all the household chores!
If she could be set free to speak of spiritual things here and speak of the Lord's things there, how good it would be!
Suppose an Israelite wanted to worship God and offer up a peace offering and burnt offering, but he could not drag in the cattle or sheep
The peace offering speaks of a sinner's drawing near to the Lord, while the burnt offering speaks of the consecration of a believer
In the Levites' work, not only were sinners brought to believe in the Lord, but believers were also brought to consecrate themselves
Brothers and sisters, please remember that ministering to the Lord is much deeper than leading men to the Lord
Ministering to the Lord is one step further than leading men to the Lord and leading believers to consecrate themselves to the Lord
In God's eyes, leading men to the Lord and leading believers to consecrate themselves to the Lord are merely ministering to the house
Although outwardly they are ministering to sinners and the brothers, inwardly they are ministering to their flesh!
For this reason, we must pray to God to grace us that we may know what it is to minister to God and to the house
Many like to exercise their muscles outside because by killing cattle and sheep, they can exercise their strength and fleshly energy
Brothers, we cannot find a genuine servant of God or true minister to the Lord who does not minister in this way
Others will praise you, saying that you are wonderful and strong because you have killed many cattle and sheep and tied them to the altar
The basis for the ministry to the Lord, the basic requirement for ministering to the Lord, is to draw near to the Lord
Many times even though they are in a room, their heart is wandering outside, and they can no longer come near to the Lord
In order to come to God and kneel before Him for an hour, there is the need for one to exert the strength of his whole being
Indeed, if one does not strive in such a way, he will not be able to maintain such a work; he will not be able to persevere
The disciples could follow the Lord from a far distance, but none of those who followed in that way could minister to Him
It is possible to follow the Lord secretly at a distance, but it is impossible to minister to Him in such a way
We can easily recognize that as Christians we should not take part in evil unclean and lustful things and that these things are intolerable
We may think that such a thing is not bad or that there is nothing better, and we may do it without asking if it is the Lord's will
Indeed, every time we rebel against God, it is because we presume that something is good, and we go ahead and do it
Standing means to not walk or move; it means to remain in a place, to stand still and wait for the Lord's order
Thank the Lord that although every believer does not do this, some are standing before the Lord and following Him in the journey ahead
Without the shedding of blood or the remission of sin, without man paying a price for his sin, God will never be satisfied
All those who would come before God to minister to Him must answer to God's holiness, righteousness, and even His glory
The entire Bible both the Old Testament and the New Testament focuses on these three things Gods holiness Gods righteousness and Gods glory
God's glory refers to God Himself; God's holiness refers to His nature; and God's righteousness refers to His way
As a result, we can approach God without any conflict because His blood has cleansed us from all unrighteousness
In other words, the blood deals with everything in the old creation, and the fat speaks of everything in the new creation
The blood dispels everything of the old creation, so that we no longer have a problem concerning holiness and righteousness
The fat is of the new creation, which signifies the offering of ourselves to God, so that we no longer have a problem with God's glory
Verse 16 says They shall enter into my sanctuary and they shall come near to my table to minister unto me and they shall keep my charge
Brothers and sisters, we are not willing to minister in the house because our hope and our task are greater than this
The things we are seeking here are greater than many other things, and our labor here is greater than that of many who do great works
Those who ministered to God before Him had to be clothed with linen garments linen bonnets on their heads and linen breeches on their loins
Genesis 3 tells us that, due to Adam's sin, God punished him by saying, 'In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread'
Due to Gods curse the ground ceased to yield its fruit due to the absence of Gods blessing human effort is necessary and this causes sweat
Although outwardly one may be very busy, he is very restful within; although outwardly it is hot, within it is very calm
If you ask them to wait quietly before God and listen to His speaking, they cannot do it because the flesh is not capable of doing this
The reason there are so many advertisements, promotions, and proposals is because men are not praying before God
If we are sweating from morning till evening, then we can surely say to ourselves that we are ministering to the house and not to the Lord
If all our business and laboring are to meet outward needs, we can conclude that we are ministering to people and not to God
God has no way to demand everyone to minister to Him; God cannot do this since many are not willing to minister to Him
Because when the children of Israel turned against the ways of the Lord and forsook Him, the sons of Zadok kept the charge of the sanctuary
They saw that what was on the outside was beyond repair; what was on the outside had collapsed and was contaminated
We know that there are two kinds of soldiers in an army: one kind volunteer to join the army, and the other kind are drafted by the country
God desires to have those who will minister to Him directly and receive the commission by the Holy Spirit directly
We go forth, out from our ministry to the Lord, rather than out from our own desires, which have no basis in the ministry to the Lord
Beyond the veil there is another matter which is just as important Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp bearing His reproach
It is only when we have left the camp to minister to the Lord that He will speak and lead; at other times, He will not speak
These works cause those who have not received the Lord to receive the Lord and those who have received the Lord to be fed
The meaning of eating and drinking is the enjoyment that comes out of our recollection of the work we have done
How often, after we have made some proud achievements, do we think about them even while we are sleeping and relish them in our memory
The first priority is to minister to the Lord because ministering to the Lord is more vital than all the plowing, feeding, and working
Although we have worked much and suffered much, this cannot take the place of the ministering that He should receive
We need to ask God to show us where we should stand in His presence and how we should really minister to Him in His presence
In theory it seems easy to make such a distinction; yet to be able to inwardly distinguish the difference in our experience is a blessing
Many times it requires the putting down of our life and the killing of our opinions before we can truly comprehend it
We need to ask the Lord to grant us grace, revelation, and light, so that we may see what ministering to Him means
