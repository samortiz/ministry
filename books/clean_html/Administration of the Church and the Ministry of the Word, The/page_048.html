<h2 class="head1">NOT CONVERTING THE MESSAGES<br />
INTO TEACHING MATERIAL</h2>
<p>The basis and principle for selecting material are to supply people with life, to solve their problems, and to generate a feeling of need within them. This is how material should be selected for the young people&rsquo;s meeting. Although our messages may be educational, we should avoid turning them into a course of instruction. For example, the so-called Sunday school has become a course for fifty-two topics of study. A child may participate in all these lessons without gaining much inwardly related to spirituality, the content of the gospel, and the experience of life.</p>
<p>For example, I attended a Christian elementary school and was one of the top students in Sunday school. I even served as a teacher&rsquo;s assistant in Sunday school. But I did not gain anything from the Sunday school. For this reason, I said that we should drop the word <em>school</em> from the children&rsquo;s meetings. We do not want a Sunday school; we simply want children&rsquo;s meetings. We should not give children the concept that the children&rsquo;s meeting is a course of study, and that they are required to recite and memorize. They should feel that they are touched and inwardly supplied when they come. Hence, our children&rsquo;s meetings should focus on making these children godly young people who live before the Lord. If they can be impressed with matters concerning how to be a proper human being, fearing God, or salvation, it will be a help to them.</p>
<p>In a children&rsquo;s meeting in Manila, the serving ones wanted to tell the story of Samson and Delilah because several movie houses in Manila were showing the love story of Samson and Delilah. This is a basic mistake in selecting material. This way is wrong. We should not randomly speak to children about Samuel today, David tomorrow, Saul the following day, and then Peter, giving them outlines to memorize and then testing them on the material. This is futile, and it is wrong. We need to touch their feeling.</p>
<p>For example, the children&rsquo;s meetings that D. L. Moody conducted looked like Sunday school but were not. Moody was burdened for people&rsquo;s souls. One time he invited a little girl to attend his Sunday school. The girl promised to come but did not show up. Several days later Moody saw her on the street. As soon as she saw Moody, the girl ran into a tavern and hid under a bed. Moody ran after her and pulled her out from under the bed. After this, the little girl attended his Sunday school. If we are as burdened as Moody, we will succeed. We need to pay attention to this matter; all the other things are secondary.</p>
<p>We should not give lessons like elementary school teachers, who divide the children into groups and conduct classes. We should not give lessons to children and begin the class by asking, &ldquo;What was the lesson last week? Right; it was on David. Who is David?&rdquo; The children reply, &ldquo;David was a person who is after God&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo; &ldquo;David was a king for forty years.&rdquo; We then say, &ldquo;Very good, you get one hundred percent.&rdquo; If our children&rsquo;s meetings are like this, we are doing a work of death, which should be stopped. The children&rsquo;s meeting in Taipei still has this flavor.</p>
<p>The material we use should be living. We might speak to the children about loving their brothers and sisters, about God&rsquo;s love, and how God created men with a loving heart. We do not need to speak about spiritual love. We should give them the feeling that the love within them comes from God and that they should love their brothers and sisters. They would then feel guilty if they do not love their brothers and sisters. In the next meeting we can speak about honoring our parents, asking them to obey their parents. This speaking is living. This does not mean that we should not use Bible stories. We can use a story in the Bible to illustrate loving our brothers and sisters. It is not a course of study, but a living application.</p>
<p>This should also be applied to the work with the young brothers and sisters. Those who serve the young saints must understand that we should not depend on edifying meetings. If we depend on edifying meetings, we will fail. From 1946 to 1948 there were no young people&rsquo;s meetings in Shanghai. We did not even have such a term. At the time the care for young people was from a burden. The saints shepherded them individually. It is a pity that our college conferences are conducted like classes teaching a subject. All of those who speak for the Lord must learn that our speaking should edify without being like a class. We are not conducting classes. This is dead, and it will not enliven people.</p>
<p>Those who speak must receive a burden to labor on the young people one by one. Through prayer and other ways we should shepherd them so that the Lord can gain them. We should not always teach them what Adam, Abel, Enoch, and Abraham did. They may memorize all this one week and forget it the next week. Teaching them in this way is futile. We should touch their feeling in a way that they will never forget. Mental exercise and recitation are but dead letters. There is no need to pay much attention to such things. Furthermore, we should not be concerned about how many are in attendance. Instead, we should endeavor to learn some living lessons, have living experiences, and receive a living burden to labor on the young brothers and sisters. We should do a work of kindling the fire in them that would cause them to kindle the fire in others. Only this kind of work is a living work.</p>
