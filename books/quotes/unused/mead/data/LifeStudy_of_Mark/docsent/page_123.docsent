   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE FORTY-TWO THE PREPARATION OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR HIS REDEMPTIVE SERVICE 9 Scripture Reading: Mark 14:1-11</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 13:1 14:42 the Lord Jesus is preparing the disciples for His death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 13:1-37 He prepares them by telling them the things to come.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then in 14:1-11 He prepares them by enjoying their love, while His opposers conspire to kill Him, and one of His disciples plots to betray Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 14:12-26 the Lord prepares the disciples by instituting His supper that they may remember Him and finally by warning them of their stumbling and charging them to watch and pray 14:27-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this message we shall consider the preparation carried out in 14:1-11.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 14:1-11 three matters are merged: the opposers conspiracy to kill the Slave-Savior, the Lord s enjoyment of His followers love, and Judas plot to betray Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to seize Him by craftiness and kill Him v. 1 , the Lord s followers were showing their love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Simultaneously, Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went off to the chief priests that he might deliver Him up to them v. 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A TYPE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Mark 14:1 speaks of the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread after two days.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although the chief priests and the scribes wanted to kill the Lord Jesus, they said, Not at the feast, lest there be an uproar of the people v. 2 . Eventually, under God s sovereignty, they did kill the Lord Jesus at the feast Matt 27:15 for the fulfillment of the type.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Passover was a type of Christ 1 Cor 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is the Lamb of God that God may pass over us, the sinners, as portrayed in typology by the Passover in Exodus 12.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, it was necessary for Christ as the Passover Lamb to be killed on the day of the Passover for its fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the type, the Passover Lamb had to be examined for blemishes during the four days preceding the feast of the Passover Exo 12:3-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before His crucifixion, Christ came to Jerusalem the last time, six days before the Passover John 12:1 , and was examined by the Jewish leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There was no blemish found in Him, and He was proved to be perfect and qualified to be the Passover Lamb for us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE HOUSE OF SIMON THE LEPER</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Mark 14:3 says that Christ was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Outside of Christ, it was not possible for anyone to find God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This One had left the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He had condemned the temple to be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, the disciples were still occupied with their religious concept of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to their understanding, God was in the temple, for it was His house.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I doubt that the disciples realized that God had left that house when the Lord Jesus walked out of the temple in chapter thirteen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since Christ Jesus is God, when He left the condemned temple and forsook it, God forsook it as well.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Going to the Mount of Olives with some of His disciples, He prophesied to them that the temple they admired would be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, that temple would be replaced by Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In chapter fourteen we see that after leaving the temple, the Lord came to a house of a cleansed leper in Bethany.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A leper signifies a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Simon, as a leper, must have been healed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Being grateful to the Lord and loving Him, he spread a feast in his house for the Lord and His disciples in order to enjoy His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A saved sinner would always do this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today God s house is with cleansed lepers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As believers in Christ, we all are cleansed lepers represented by Simon.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Simon loved the Lord Jesus and prepared a feast for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When He was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as He reclined at table, a woman came having an alabaster flask of ointment, of pure nard, very costly; and breaking the alabaster flask, she poured it over His head v. 3 . This woman truly loved the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God s house, the church, is composed of those who love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His house is composed of cleansed lepers and those who anoint Him.</S>
