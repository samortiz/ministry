   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DO NOT JUDGE ACCORDING TO HOPE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many people are not really convinced that there is no God; they merely hope so.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They would rather that there were no God in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For them it would be much more convenient in respect to many things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I myself was one of those people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I was a student I claimed that there was no God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although I was extremely strong in my claim, something within me seemed to be protesting and saying, "There is a God."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I knew deep in my heart that God exists.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But my lips refused to admit this so that I could have an excuse for sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By declaring the nonexistence of God, going to sinful places was justifiable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If there were no God, I would become bold to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When you believe in God, you dare not do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When you do away with God, you feel free to commit the worst sins without any fear whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you sincerely hope to raise your moral standard by asserting the nonexistence of God, then your arguments are still plausible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, the only reason men claim that there is no God is for an excuse for lawlessness, immorality, license, and indecency.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For this reason, their whole argument is not worthy of consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The question is, "Are you qualified to claim that there is no God?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If your hope is merely for an escape from justice, you have lost your ground already.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>IS MAN THE GREATEST?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One day a young man came to me and said, "I do not believe in a so-called God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man is the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is the noblest among all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no God in this universe; man is everything."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We were sitting opposite each other.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After hearing what he said, I stood up, went to one side of the room, stooped down, and gazed at him intently.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I said, "You are really great!"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then I walked to the other side of the room and looked at him from another angle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"That is right," I said deliberately; "You are great!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Kiangsu province there are thirty million who are like you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are at least four hundred million of your kind in China.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The world contains only two billion who are the same as you are.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do you realize that during the last few days there has been a flood in the south?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The dykes along the river are in jeopardy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The whole population in Hsing Hwa with more than two hundred thousand people have been recruited and rushed to the dykes in a panic.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are carrying earth with them to reinforce the banks.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The repair work is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"Suppose that the world is recruited to hollow out the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A hole is drilled through the surface, and everyone has to remove a load from the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Assuming that no one will be burned to ashes, do you think that they can do the job?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even if all the people themselves were inside, they would not fill up the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you put several hundred planets the size of Earth inside and started shaking it, you would still find that the sun would be very empty inside.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How many suns are there in the universe?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do you realize that the number of solar systems is in the hundreds of millions?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>HOW VAST IS THE UNIVERSE?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I then said to the young man, "And here you are!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You have not even walked through the whole earth, and yet you consider yourself greater than the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Let me ask you, do you know how vast the universe is?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Take light for example.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Light travels at 186,000 miles per second.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Try to calculate how far light travels in one minute, or one hour, or a day, or a year.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There are some stars whose light takes three thousand years to reach us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Go and work out how far they are from us!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>And you think you are so great!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I would therefore advise all atheists and young men alike to admit the incompetency of man not only morally, but intellectually and academically as well."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>CAN MAN EXTEND BEYOND THE BOUNDS</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>OF TIME AND SPACE?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Another time when I was in Kaifeng, I met another one of those young, stout atheists.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I walked up to him and patted him on the shoulder, saying, "I saw God today!"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He stared at me in curiosity and demanded a further word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I replied, "You are God!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you know that there is no God, then you have to be God."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He asked for an explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I said, "Since you are convinced that there is no God, you must have traveled over the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If God is not in Shanghai, He may still be in Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You must have been to both places.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>That is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If God is not in Nanking, He may be in Tientsin.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You must also have been to Tientsin.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But you cannot draw this conclusion simply by being in China; God may be in another country.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>So you must have been to every country on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If God is not in one place, He may be in another.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore, you must have traveled throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>One never knows if God is hiding at the North Pole or the South Pole, or in the woods or wilderness somewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>So you must have combed through all those regions as well.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If God is not found on earth, He may be found on the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You therefore must have been to the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God may also be on other planets or in outer space.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This means that you have traveled through space and all the other galaxies as well.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you can say that there is no God, it must mean that you have traveled throughout the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If this is the case, you must be God yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>"This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Even though you know that God does not exist in Shanghai today, how about yesterday?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Perhaps God will come tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You say that you know there is no God today, but what about last year?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>And how do you know that God will not come next year?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You say that there is no God this year, but what about a thousand years ago?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Very well, you must be an everlasting one who knows everything about the past and future.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You have to be a being beyond time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>You must be in Tientsin and in another country at the same time; you must be omnipresent from the east to the west, from the North Pole to the South Pole.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Who else but you can be the very God?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If you are not God, you can never be qualified to say that there is no God."</S>
