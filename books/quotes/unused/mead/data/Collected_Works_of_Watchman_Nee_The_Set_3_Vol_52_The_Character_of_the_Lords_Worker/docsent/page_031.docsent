   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A worker of the Lord must speak accurate words; he must not be careless with his tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He can only be a conveyer of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If he is disciplined in his tongue, he will be spared of any entanglements.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our heart aches when we think of the lack of restraint among God's workers in the things they say.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The brothers and sisters may be entertained by our gossip and interesting tales, but we will fail to command their respect when we speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not think that it is all right to joke and make fun with our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There may be much fun in the joking and jesting, but when we turn around to speak God's word, they will consider our words to be of the same value as our stories, and our words will lose their weight.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some brothers can gain others' ears when they say something, while others may say the same thing yet not command any attention.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should consider the reason some have an audience while others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Their words may be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Certainly God's word is the same, but the way they speak at ordinary times differs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may be the same as far as speaking God's word is concerned, but if we are different with our other speakings, we will be different when it comes to the power behind God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are used to loose words and always indulge ourselves in unrestrained conversations, the impact of our words on those who listen will be the same when we speak for the Lord as it is when we speak in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There will be very little impact at all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brothers and sisters, let us remember that a spring cannot send forth from the same opening sweet and bitter water.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It cannot supply sweet water at one time and bitter water at another time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The bitter water is always bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Its bitterness may be moderated sometimes, but it is still bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When clean water and filthy water are mixed together, the filthy water does not become clean; rather, the clean water becomes filthy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many brothers have no impact in their speaking, not because they are wrong in the words they preach, but because they are wrong in their other speakings, the ordinary speakings outside the platform.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When they preach God's word, nobody listens to them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must remember that the words we speak on the platform are governed by the words we speak off the platform.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we talk foolishly off the platform, our words on the platform will be completely spoiled.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The sweet water will become bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is no need for laborious preparations before we preach, but there is the need for constant precaution in our ordinary, everyday conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We cannot expect to have any power in our service to the Lord if we are not restricted in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are loose and inaccurate in our words, confuse truth for falsehood, joke and jest all the time, and even lie, we cannot have any power in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must begin by controlling our tongue so that we can preach God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Accurate words have much to do with one's reading of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Bible is the most accurate book in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's word is the only accurate word in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not have a habit of speaking accurately, we cannot read the Bible, much less preach the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some brothers cannot read the Bible in the condition that they are in. It takes a certain character to be a gospel preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It also takes a certain character to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A sloppy person cannot read the Bible because God's word is accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A sloppy person will miss everything in God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In fact, he will understand it in the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let us give an example to show the meaning of being accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to Matthew 22, the Sadducees did not believe in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One day they came to the Lord and posed a question, saying, "Teacher, Moses said, If anyone dies and does not have children, his brother as next of kin shall marry his wife and raise up seed to his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now there were seven brothers with us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And the first married and died, and having no seed, he left his wife to his brother; likewise also the second and the third until the seventh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>And last of all the woman died.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be of the seven?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For they all had her" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>24-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Resurrection was unthinkable to them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They thought that it would be better if there was no such thing as resurrection, because it would complicate things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They preferred to believe that there was no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They came and reasoned with the Lord, coming up with a seemingly unsolvable problem.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Jesus answered, "You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob'?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>29-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Sadducees certainly read the Scriptures, but the Lord said they did not know the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They spoke so carelessly that it was impossible for them to appreciate the absolute accuracy of God's utterances.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our Lord only quoted a short passage from Exodus 3 to prove resurrection God calls Himself the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How does this short word prove resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord went on to explain, "He is not the God of the dead, but of the living."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To the Sadducees Abraham was dead, Isaac was dead, and Jacob was dead; all three were dead.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Would this not make the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob the God of the dead?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Yet God is not the God of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>How can this be?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Since God is not the God of the dead, Abraham must not remain dead forever.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The same must be true of Isaac and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But how can dead men no longer be dead?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They must be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob will all be resurrected because God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord Jesus answered the Sadducees this way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Our Lord was very accurate in the things He said.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It exposed the inaccuracies of the Sadducees and their ignorance of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we are careless in our speaking, we will not appreciate how accurate God's word is.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A sloppy character does not care for accuracy and is incapable of accuracy; it is not capable of holding and containing God's accurate word.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Bible is the most accurate book; it is accurate to the last iota and serif.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Lord said, "One iota or one serif shall by no means pass away from the law" Matt 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God is purposeful in every iota and serif; He is never loose.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Since God is so accurate in His words, His servants should also be accurate in their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Brothers and sisters, God is never ambiguous in His speaking; He is never careless.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>His words are always firmly established; every one of them is sure and unshakable.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The more we read His Word, the more we will realize that not a single word can be added or deleted.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must pay attention to this point: no one who is loose in his speaking can be a servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>A loose talker will have no impact among the brothers and will not even be able to handle God's word himself.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Some brothers are a suffering to others when they speak from the platform.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>One only has to listen to a message from such ones and he will realize how sloppy these ones are.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>A sloppy person can only speak sloppy words.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Even when God's word is before him, he will speak in a sloppy way.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If he is sloppy when he walks off the platform, how can he be anything but sloppy when he stands on the platform?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>No sloppy person can read the Bible, and no sloppy speakers can speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>May God be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>May we receive mercy to have an accurate mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We should offer up a prayer to the Lord: "Give me the tongue of a learner so that I will not be loose, careless, or flawed in words.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I do not want to lose many things.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I do not want to lose my testimony."</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If we are careless in speaking, we cannot read and understand God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In studying the Bible, we have to dig out the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>But a sloppy person cannot find any facts.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We have to learn to speak carefully and cautiously before we can appreciate the accuracy of God's every word.</S>
