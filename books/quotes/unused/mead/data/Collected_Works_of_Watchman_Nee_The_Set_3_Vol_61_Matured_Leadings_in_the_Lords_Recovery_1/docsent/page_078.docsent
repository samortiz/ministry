   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A SIGN BEFORE THE LORD'S SECOND COMING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ACCUMULATION OF WEALTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>James 5 begins with the words come now.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is an exclamation that is rarely used in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the apostle James came to this point, he uttered a sigh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He even wrote down his sigh, because he considered what followed to be totally wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was something that should not happen at all.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He lamented, "You rich, weep, howling over your miseries."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Weeping is soft crying, while howling is loud wailing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the rich men cry in a loud or soft voice because "miseries...are coming upon you!"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They were about to go through God's ordained sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They should not rejoice but should sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What has happened in recent days should not be surprising to Christians at all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before the Lord's imminent coming, there will be clear signs.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>During this time, men will accumulate wealth in an unprecedented way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, no other age will see as much wealth as the age immediately preceding the Lord's return.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the end time, the world will pay much attention to the accumulation of wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When men talked about wealth just a half century to a century ago, they meant something different from what is implied today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In every age there were rich men, but there has never been a time when there were so many rich men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the past rich men were called millionaires.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now some people make U.S. 1,300 every second.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In less than twenty minutes, they are millionaires.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The rich of the past cannot be called rich when compared to the rich of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>OVER-ACCUMULATION BEING THE GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>OF GOD'S JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul said in 1 Timothy 6:8 that we should be content with having food and covering.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today men not only have food and covering; they have many more things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They have much gold and silver in the bank.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the reason James sighed that the garments of the rich have become moth-eaten, and their gold and silver have rusted.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is more than a matter of just having food and covering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is a matter of unused garments being eaten up by moths.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, it is not a matter of exhorting men to be content with their covering.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They have too many garments, and they have no more use for them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since these garments are useless, they are eaten up by moths.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today the world is accumulating wealth at a maddening pace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The number of garments some have accumulated could last for two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many of them are just idly laying around.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These ones also accumulate much gold and silver.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This gold and silver have become so useless that they have become corrupted and rusted.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>James pointed out that when garments are moth-eaten and gold and silver have rusted, it is time for judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the ground for God's judgment on men.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Please remember that all men will stand before the judgment seat of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some will defend their accumulation, but no matter what they say, God will point His finger at the holes in their garments and the rust on their gold and silver and ask, "Why did you accumulate so much when you had no need?"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The rust of the gold and silver will not only be a testimony against them, but it will eat their flesh like fire.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This probably refers to the burning of the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This fire will scorch them and burn away their flesh; it will try them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As a man accumulates more, he will have more trouble, he will be more bound, and he will fall into more sin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Areas under Communist rule have learned the truth of James 5.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let me relate a story to you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A brother from the countryside had a set of redwood furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He was moved in his spirit to sell it but was unwilling to give it up.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Later his village experienced a change, and he decided to give the furniture away, but nobody wanted it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He was so afraid of being purged by the Communists that eventually he ran away to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The book of James was written nineteen hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet it speaks of the worker-capitalist dispute.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It says that problems arise because the rich are too rich, and the workers are exploited.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is unfortunate that the Marxists do not pay attention to the word of the Bible which precedes them by eighteen hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The word withheld means to keep back the wages of the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Everyone who studies Marxism knows that this is the exploitation of workers, the so-called "surplus value" of the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Karl Marx lived in the last century.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He wrote a book called Das Kapital in which he talked about the capitalists investing money in factories and hiring workers to manufacture goods.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Does the profit belong to the capitalists or to the workers?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I have no interest in discussing who is right and who is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>My interest lies in his claim of the usurpation of the workers' surplus value.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The profit is earned through the labor of the workers, yet the employer takes it into his own pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>While a worker receives a dollar, he actually may be making two dollars, with one of the dollars being retained by the employer.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>James said that the wages retained by the employer cry out and reach "the ears of the Lord of hosts."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Today the changes in China are under God's sovereign hand.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is hard to believe that one-fifth of the inhabitants of this earth are undergoing such a change without God's intervention.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I believe God's judgment is in it.</S>
