   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>REMOVING THE VEIL AND HAVING A PURE HEART</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The veil mentioned in 2 Corinthians 3 refers to anything that hinders us from seeing the glory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Anything that frustrates us from beholding the glory of the Lord is in principle a veil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our husbands, wives, children, fame, the world, and riches can all become veils.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Anything that causes us not to see the Lord's glory is a veil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To turn our hearts to the Lord means to have a pure heart for the Lord; only people with such a heart do not have veils.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord says that the pure in heart are blessed, for they shall see God Matt 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE WORK OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Christian living and work issue from life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>An artificial flower looks much the same as a real flower.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the artificial flower cannot withstand the scorching of the sun or the beating down of the rain, whereas a real flower can withstand them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a Christian's living and work do not issue from life, they are like artificial flowers and will not be of much use.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE TESTIMONY OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are four categories of work in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first is the gospel work, the second is the children's work, the third is migration, and the fourth is the work of visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Sparks emphasizes a personal ministry today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But our work today is to maintain a testimony of the church, which is why we have to build up everything at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The co-workers should do their best to transfer the work to the local brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our work should produce more apprentices, instead of just producing the products.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the coming days, we need to put out three kinds of hymnals.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first is the general hymnal, which only Brother Nee himself can be responsible for.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second is the gospel songs, which I will be responsible for.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The third is the children's songs, which Sister Ruth Lee and others will be responsible for.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is one kind of work which only Brother Nee can do, and for which no other person can substitute for him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the future, the work in central China and southern China should have more fellowship.</S>
