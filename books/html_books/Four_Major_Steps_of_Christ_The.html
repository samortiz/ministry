INCARNATION</H2><P>It is my burden that in the following messages we should see something very basic in the work of Christ. This may be divided into four major steps: (1) the incarnation, (2) the crucifixion, (3) the resurrection, and (4) the ascension.</P><P>Firstly, we need to say a few words regarding the eternal purpose of God. Scripture reveals to us that in eternity past God designed a plan according to His own good pleasure. In that plan God purposed to express Himself through His Son Jesus Christ and to have Jesus Christ expressed through a group of people. This is how the hidden, invisible God would be manifested (1 Tim. 3:16) and at the same time Christ would be glorified. Christ should have the preeminence, the first place in all things (Col. 1:18). But all this depends upon one thing: that Christ be wrought into a people as their all in all. These people, mingled with the full measure of God's life in Christ, would be a living Body to Christ (Eph. 1:23). This is the central point of all Scripture.</P><P>We must realize, however, that God's divine plan must be wholly accomplished in and through the Holy Spirit. Although it had been planned in eternity past by God and was accomplished by Christ, yet it must be realized in us by the Holy Spirit. In these messages, therefore, we will see what it means to experience the work of the Holy Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE INCARNATION</H2><P>Let us start at the first major step of Christ, the incarnation. What does the incarnation of Christ mean? We know that Christ is God incarnated as a man. Christ is the God-man. He is not only a man of God; He is also a God-man. Therefore, the incarnation of Christ simply means the mingling of God with humanity. Mingling is much more than mixing together; it is an intrinsic union. In the entire history of mankind such a thing had never occurred. For four thousand years, God was God and man was man. Yes, man had something to do with God, and God sometimes made contact with man; yet the two remained separate. However, when Christ was born as a man, a strange and wonderful event took place. A child was born, a child who was called the Mighty God (Isa. 9:6). Can you believe this&#151;a child called the Mighty God!</P><P>Have you ever considered the difference between the God of the Hebrews and the God of the Christians? The God whom the Hebrews believe is only the Almighty Creator, but the God in whom we believe is more. He is still the Almighty God, but He is the Almighty One who came into humanity, born of a virgin. All that our Mighty Creator is and has, was in that little child. This little child was not born into a noble family nor raised in a city of fame (Matt. 2:23; John 1:45-46). He was brought up in a lowly family to do the work of a carpenter (Matt. 13:55; Mark 6:3). He was a child; yet He was God (Heb. 1:8). He was a laborer, a carpenter; yet He was the Almighty Creator of the whole universe (John 1:3; Heb. 1:2).</P><P>Perhaps we have been Christians many years, yet have never been impressed with this. It is indeed inconceivable to our natural mind that the Almighty God would one day mingle Himself with a man. But this was accomplished in Jesus Christ, and this is the very desire of God for you and me&#151;that He be mingled with us.</P><P>Do you know what it means to be a real Christian? To be a Christian simply means to be mingled with God, to be a God-man. It is not enough to be a good man; we have to be a God-man. A good man might be a man of the tree of knowledge, the result of which is death (Gen. 2:17). A God-man is a man of the tree of life (Gen. 2:9). In his spirit, God is mingled; in his heart, God is dwelling; in his soul&#151;mind, emotion, and will&#151;God is occupying. This is a real, normal Christian.</P><P>The first person who was mingled with God was Jesus (Matt. 1:21-23). Do you realize why He is so precious to us? Because in Him is the universal mingling of God with humanity. We should spend some time before the Lord, and say, "Lord, reveal to me the meaning of the mingling of God with man." We should ask ourselves, "Do I realize it, do I experience it, do I live in it?" If we would bring this to the Lord, I believe our whole life would be revolutionized. We would realize that we are "peculiar," "strange," set apart from society because God is mingled with us. Think how wonderful it is that human beings such as we could have God as life, dwelling within and occupying our whole being!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD EXPRESSED IN MAN</H2><P>Now we come to the second point of this first major step of Christ. In the incarnation of Christ, God is expressed in a man. This is contrary to our natural concept. We always think it would be wonderful if God would manifest Himself directly to us, but this is not His plan. God's plan is to manifest Himself in man and through man. This is the key to the four Gospels: God is expressed in a man&#151;a man who is truly man, a man who lived a human life on this earth, yet who expressed God.</P><P>In the Gospel of John we are told that the Lord is the Word of God, that this Word is God Himself (John 1:1), and that one day He became a man (John 1:14). We see the Lord on this earth acting, living, walking, working, and doing things exactly as a man. Although He performed miracles, His life was a human life, His walk a human walk. Sometimes He was hungry, sometimes thirsty. Once He asked a woman for some water to drink (John 4:7). Sometimes He felt tired (John 4:6), and sometimes He even wept (John 11:35). He was one hundred percent a man! Yet, in this man&#151;in His life, His walk, His work&#151;God was manifested. This is what God still desires today; He desires to be manifested through humanity.</P><P>Do you realize that Christians should be very human? When I was young, soon after I was saved, I had a wonderful thought: I thought the more different I was from others, the more spiritual I would be! But one day the Lord opened my eyes and caused me to see that what I was considering was not spiritual, but peculiar. It is not peculiarity that must be manifested through me, but God Himself. I must be filled with God and possessed by Him. Then I will manifest God in my life. I must be very human, yet very spiritual. Today some people think that to make themselves peculiar and different from others is to be spiritual. No, the more spiritual we are, the more ordinary we will be.</P><P>Let me tell you a story. About twenty-two years ago we were living and working in a certain city in North China. At that time many of us were seeking to grow in love to the Lord and be more spiritual. Some of the sisters were influenced by certain writings; so they tried to imitate what the books taught. They tried to be quiet, they tried to be gentle, they tried to do things slowly and speak softly. But after a short time, I found that this was not spirituality, but altogether imitation. It was imitation without life. One day I talked with these sisters and said, "Sisters, if you would be spiritual, you must move quickly, speak quickly, and seek never to be quiet. If one of you lose your temper, then you will be spiritual." They exclaimed, "Oh, Brother Lee, you are really too much for us! We go to one extreme, and you want us to go to the other." Then I asked them where they should be. They answered, "Neither at one extreme nor the other. We must be in the middle, we must be balanced." To be spiritual is not to be quiet and gentle; neither is it to lose your temper. To be spiritual is simply to be occupied by God. We must realize what kind of life God desires us to have. It is not just a life of doing good. It is a life full of Christ, occupied by God and mingled with God in every way.</P><P>When our Lord was on earth, though He was wholly a man, He lived by God (John 6:57). He never did anything of Himself (John 5:19, 30; 6:38; 8:28); He never spoke anything from Himself (John 7:16-17; 14:10). Our Lord had no sin; He did not have a sinful nature. From a natural point of view, He did not even know what sin was (2 Cor. 5:21). Yet He denied and rejected Himself. He always took God as His life. He walked in God, worked through God, and spoke only from God. This is the life which God desires us to have. The Christian life is to have God in Christ as our life and our all, day by day and moment by moment. We must deny and reject ourselves. We need to abandon ourselves and take God as our life. This is not just a doctrine. This is a life! It is a life of taking God practically, moment by moment, as everything to us.</P><P>Christ was what we should be. Christ is the pattern. He is the Head, and we are the Body. God has done the most wonderful thing in the universe in mingling Himself with a man, Jesus Christ. But God did not stop there. He is going onward, doing the same thing today. God is mingling Himself with thousands upon thousands of people! Through the past two thousand years He has been doing this, but man has simply not understood. God wants to mingle Himself with us, but we have not cooperated. In these two centuries, there have been many Christian teachings, but something has been lacking&#151;the mingling of God with man. Oh, may we realize that in Christ God desires to be our life and our everything, even as He was everything to Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ACCOMPLISHED BY THE SPIRIT</H2><P>How may this be accomplished? First, we must see how it was accomplished in Christ. We are told that He was born of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:18, 20). After that, not much is said of Him until He was thirty years of age, but we believe that during those early years He must have been filled with the Holy Spirit. He was born of the Holy Spirit and He was filled with the Holy Spirit; yet, when He started His work for God, He came to John the Baptist to be baptized. The meaning of baptism is to be put to an end by death and burial. Brothers and sisters, this is a deep experience. We have been born of the Holy Spirit and perhaps have some experience of being filled with the Holy Spirit, yet we must learn this lesson: if we are going to be used by God to fulfill His purpose in this age, we must once more hand ourselves over to the Lord that He might bring us to an end. We must be put to death and buried. Even if we are just as spiritual as the Lord Jesus at thirty years of age, we must once more hand ourselves over to be buried. It was after the Lord was baptized that the Holy Spirit descended upon Him (Matt. 3:16) and He received the baptism of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>This is an example of the experiential workings of the Holy Spirit. The Lord Jesus Christ had been born of the Holy Spirit and filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit; yet He still needed more of the Holy Spirit to equip and strengthen Him for fulfilling God's purpose in this age. He needed the Holy Spirit to come down upon Him. From this example we see that there are three steps in the working of the Holy Spirit: (1) begetting, (2) filling, and (3) clothing or baptizing. Inwardly, we must have the life of God in us through the Spirit of life and we must be filled with this Spirit of life. Outwardly, we must be clothed and baptized with the Holy Spirit. This is our equipment, our qualification for fulfilling the purpose of God in this age.</P><P>We need to go to the Lord and consider before Him the experiences He has had of the Holy Spirit. We too need such experiences. Inwardly, we need to be born of the Holy Spirit and filled with Him; we need Him as our life. Outwardly, we need to be baptized in Him and clothed upon with Him so that we will be equipped with power for the work of God. All this depends on one thing: we must continually learn the lesson of denying ourselves, of giving up ourselves and contacting the Lord all the time. If we would have a life mingled with God Himself and be in the way of fulfilling His purpose, we must be in the Spirit. Only then will we be able to realize a life and a work which are well-pleasing to God.</P><P>Pray much about this matter. Let us seek the real experiences of the working of the Holy Spirit, the inward filling and the outward clothing.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>II. CRUCIFIXION</H1><P>Now we come to the second major step of Christ: His crucifixion. Let us at the outset consider why it was necessary for Christ to be crucified on the cross. He was the manifestation of God and the mingling of God with man. He lived a life full of God. There was nothing sinful, nothing wrong about Him. His was a life in which only God could be seen. Yet, according to God's eternal purpose He had to die. Why? Before I was saved, I heard that because we are sinful, Christ must die for us. This is true, but there are more important reasons why Christ had to die. May the Lord grant us to see them more fully.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FIRST REASON FOR CHRIST'S DEATH</H2><P>There are at least three reasons why Christ had to be crucified. First, man was fallen, and creation was corrupted by the enemy. Therefore, both man and creation must be judged. Man is contradictory to the holiness and righteousness of God and has "come short of the glory of God" (Rom. 3:23), and creation is subject to vanity under the bondage of corruption (Rom. 8:20-21). Man and creation must be dealt with by God.</P><P>Let us look at it from another direction. God had a plan. Satan came in to frustrate and stop God's plan from being accomplished, but he could never succeed. He can frustrate and delay, but he can never stop God's eternal plan from being realized. God will certainly accomplish what He has purposed. So the question is, how would God accomplish His eternal purpose when man was fallen and creation corrupted? The answer is&#151;by redemption through judgment. That is why Christ had to die on the cross. That is why He had to be judged on behalf of fallen humanity and the corrupted creation. Through judgment God could redeem fallen humanity and recover the corrupted creation. Thus, the death of Christ on the cross is on one hand the judgment of God, and on the other hand redemption. Herein lies the wisdom of God. God seized hold of the work of Satan and turned it to His own account.</P><P>We all know that we were sinners (Rom. 5:19). We were born sinners, for we are children of Adam. In this country, the children of foreigners born here are automatically Americans. They do not need to be naturalized; they are born Americans. So it is with us&#151;we were born sinners. No matter how good our parents were or how good we are, we are all sinners by birth and we "all have sinned" (Rom. 3:23). God must judge sinners. But where and by what were we judged? We need to be redeemed, but where and by what were we redeemed? We must answer these questions before God and to ourselves. We must have full assurance that we have already passed the judgment of God and have been redeemed. We must be able to say that this day we are free from God's judgment and redeemed by Him! Brothers and sisters, not only were we judged two thousand years ago on the cross in Christ, but we were likewise redeemed then by Christ. Praise the Lord! Christ, by His death, was judged on our behalf (1 Pet. 2:24; 3:18), and by this judgment God has redeemed us. Whatever God judges, He is able to redeem. God only redeems that which He has judged. No sinner can be redeemed without the judgment of the cross. But, praise the Lord, since Christ suffered the judgment, He likewise accomplished redemption for us (Heb. 9:12; Rom. 3:24). The moment we were judged in Christ on the cross, we were also redeemed. God judged both sinful man and the corrupted creation and at the same time redeemed them back (Col. 1:20-22). Why? Because God needs both humanity and creation to fulfill His eternal purpose. This is why Christ had to die.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SECOND REASON FOR CHRIST'S DEATH</H2><P>The second reason for Christ's death is deeper than the first. Christ had to die in order to bring the old creation, including mankind, to an end. Only then could He produce a new creation. In the universe, there is such a principle: the old must go that the new may come. The old humanity and the old creation must pass away so that the new may be ushered in. How could this be accomplished? By the death of Christ. And who is this Christ? He is the Head of all creation (Eph. 1:22). All creation subsists in Christ (Col. 1:17); He is the Head, He is the center, He is the representative of the whole creation. Christ's death on the cross, therefore, means that the whole creation as represented in Christ was brought to an end. Through, by, and in the death of Christ we and the whole creation were terminated.</P><P>The economy of God is that Christ must bring to death all creation. In God's economy, we were crucified (Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20; 5:24) even before we were born! Perhaps you were born just fifty years ago, but you were crucified two thousand years ago. In man's reckoning such a thing could not be, but in God's economy it is so. The whole creation was brought to an end by the crucifixion of Christ. That is why Christ had to die.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE THIRD REASON FOR CHRIST'S DEATH</H2><P>A third reason for Christ's death is that He might impart Himself to us as our life-supply. Have we ever realized that every meal we have eaten is composed of things that have passed through death? Take, for example, a fish. Would we eat it alive? No, the fish must die. Everything we eat must die, even an apple or an orange. Day by day, while we are eating, we are killing, for we must chew the food. We kill the fruit, we kill the fish, we kill the cattle! Nothing can be our food unless it is dead. A little grain of wheat if put into the earth will grow, for there is life in it. But if we would take the grain as our food, we must kill it by eating it. We must realize that Christ had to pass through death in order to impart Himself to us as our life-supply. Even if we were not sinful, Christ still must die for us. He had to die that He might be our life-supply.</P><P>In some parts of the world it is the women who kill the chickens to prepare them for food. Do they kill them because they are sinful? Do they say, "O chicken, I am a poor sinner; so you must die for me"? Of course not. The chicken's dying has nothing to do with their sin. The reason for its dying is that they may be supplied with life.</P><P>Christ is the food of life from heaven. We can only take Him into us by the way of death. What He said in John 6:53-56 regarding Himself as the bread of life to us indicates death. He had to die&#151;and He did die, praise the Lord! Every time we come to the Lord's table, we see the symbols, a piece of bread and a cup of wine. The bread signifies the body of Christ, and the wine signifies His blood. The blood is separated from the body, signifying death. At the Lord's table we show forth His death (1 Cor. 11:26). Christ died in order to give Himself to us as our life-supply. This is the deeper reason why Christ had to die.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ALL-INCLUSIVENESS OF CHRIST'S DEATH</H2><P>We have seen the reasons for Christ's death; now let us go on to another point regarding His crucifixion&#151;the all-inclusiveness of His death. About thirty years ago, I heard a servant of God ministering. He said, "If you ask the Jewish people who was crucified on the cross, they will tell you it was a little man. To them, He was just a little man by the name of Jesus. If you come to believers and ask them who died on the cross, they will tell you it was their Savior, their Redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ. But if you ask the improved Christians, those who know the Lord more deeply, they will tell you, 'It is not only my Lord Himself who died there, but I and all other Christians were crucified there too.'" That servant of the Lord went on to say, "If you go to God and ask Him to tell you who it was that was crucified on the cross, He will reply, 'All creation, everything, was crucified on the cross.'"</P><P>At that time it was rather difficult for me to comprehend this. I asked, How could this be? Then the Lord showed me what transpired with the ark of Noah. The ark was surrounded by deep waters. It passed through the judgment of the flood. And while the ark was passing through the flood, everything in the ark passed through the judgment also. If we were to go to Noah and ask him if he passed through the flood, he would surely answer, "Yes, I passed through the flood in the ark!" If we could go to the cattle and all the living things, they would tell us the same thing.</P><P>The ark typifies Christ, and the eight persons of Noah's family typify us. The living things in the ark typify the whole creation. All the redeemed people and all the creation were in Christ, passing through His death. When Christ was crucified on the cross, all things contained in Him passed through death also. His death is an all-inclusive death.</P><P>Let me give you another illustration. When Christ died on the cross, the veil of the temple was torn from the top to the bottom. On that veil cherubim were embroidered. Thus, when the veil was torn, the cherubim were torn also. That veil is also the type of Christ, and the cherubim are a type of the living creatures. All the living creatures were torn in Christ on the cross. The death of Christ on the cross is an all-inclusive one. You died there, I died there, and the whole creation died there.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, we must realize that this all-inclusive death of Christ on the cross is the settlement of all the problems in the universe between God and His creation. The problems of Satan, sin, sickness, death, the world, and the fallen human nature&#151;all problems&#151;were solved at the cross. We have sinned, and from sin come sickness and death. In the universe is Satan with all his hosts: the principalities, powers, dominions, authorities, and evil hosts in the air. There is ourselves, the biggest, most subjective problem of all. There is also the world, which is the kingdom of Satan, as our environment. These are not only our problems, but also God's problems. These are the problems which frustrated God in the accomplishing of His eternal plan. God, therefore, had to deal with them and settle them all. How? By the death of Christ.</P><P>After God created Adam, He committed all things into his hands, making him the head and representative of all creation. Consequently, after man's fall, Satan, with all his related evil powers, was located in man. Then Christ became a man, representing the whole creation. We must realize, therefore, that when Christ became a man, Satan was already located in him. One strange Old Testament type bears this out, the type of the brass serpent hanging on a pole. We know that this is a type of Christ. The Lord said in John 3:14, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up." How could a serpent be a type of Christ? Because Christ put upon Himself a man occupied by Satan. Satan is the serpent, and man became identified with him. All humanity, permeated by Satan, is just the same as a serpent in the eyes of God. Whatever is in the serpent is in us. Have we ever come to the Lord and confessed, "O Lord, I am as sinful as Satan the serpent. Lord, in Your eyes I am a serpent also!" When the Lord Christ became a man, He put on "the likeness of the flesh of sin" (Rom. 8:3, A.S.V. note), in which is the likeness of the serpent. But, praise the Lord, the brass serpent had only the likeness, not the nature. Christ never put on the sinful nature. He put on only the likeness, the form, of sinful flesh. In God's eyes, when Christ was crucified on the cross, He was in the likeness of the serpent! This means that not only was man crucified with Christ, but Satan also was put to death on the cross. By His death, Christ destroyed the devil (Heb. 2:14; John 12:31) and all his host. All things related to Satan&#151;evil forces, evil powers (Col. 2:15), the world (John 12:31; Gal. 6:14), sin, sickness, death, and sinful people&#151;have been dealt with on the cross. The cross is an end to all things, the settlement of all problems. Even the ordinances of the law that were against us were nailed to the cross (Col. 2:14).</P><P>The cross is exceedingly meaningful both to God and to ourselves. Can we not go and say to the Lord, "Lord, now I am clear. All things of the old creation have been put to an end. All problems&#151;sin and sins, sickness and death, Satan and his evil forces, the world, my sinful nature, and even the ordinances of the law&#151;have been settled once and for all on the cross. Praise the Lord!"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE APPLICATION OF CHRIST'S DEATH</H2><P>Now the question is, how can we apply this death of Christ? It was accomplished once for all by Christ on the cross, but how do we apply it personally today? Let us remember that it was through the eternal Spirit that Christ offered Himself (Heb. 9:14) to die on the cross. Thus, it is only through the Holy Spirit that it is possible for us to apply the death of Christ to ourselves. We cannot comprehend it mentally. Nor can we, by exercising the mind, reckon ourselves dead. It doesn't work. The death of Christ is not in our mentality; it is in the Spirit of Christ. We need to be in the Spirit of Christ in order to apply the death of Christ to ourselves. We must contact the Lord, and be in living touch with Him. We must be in the Spirit instead of in the mind, the will, or the emotions. We cannot just reckon ourselves dead. The more we reckon ourselves dead, the more we will find we are alive. But when we are in the Spirit, having living contact with the Lord, we will experience the death to ourselves.</P><P>Let me give you an illustration. A certain brother had a very dear sister as his wife. This brother was frank and simple, but the sister was always murmuring and exceedingly mysterious. She was a real test to that brother. One day he came to one of the co-workers for fellowship, saying, "Brother, what shall I do? I have such a lovely wife, but she is continually murmuring and so mysterious." The co-worker answered that according to the fifth chapter of Ephesians he must love her. The husband replied, "Brother, I know that, but I cannot love her! Whenever I am with her, I cannot be patient with her." The co-worker, finding that the fifth chapter of Ephesians did not help, recommended the sixth chapter of Romans, saying, "Well, brother, you must reckon yourself dead." The husband took the word and went home to "reckon." But before long he returned, saying, "Brother, it doesn't work. The more I reckon myself dead, the more I am alive! I cannot be dead by reckoning!"</P><P>What was the reason? It is very simple. We must be in the Holy Spirit. We need living contact with the living Lord. Then His death will be effective to us in the Spirit! The effectiveness of the death of Christ revealed in Romans 6 is in the Spirit mentioned in Romans 8. When we have that living contact with the living Lord in the Spirit, there is the "killing" of His death within us. After many struggles, the brother was finally helped. He realized his need to experience the effectiveness of the Lord's death by having living contact with Him. He learned the lesson and practiced it. All the time he tried his best to contact the Lord. Sometime later he testified: "The more I contact the Lord Himself, the more I am dead, and the more there is a 'killing' power within me."</P><P>Brothers and sisters, I would recommend that we go to the living Lord day by day, and even moment by moment, to touch Him in the Spirit. Then we will experience the power of the death of Christ. The more we contact the Lord, the more we will be slain by His death. We must live in the Spirit in order to experience the death of Christ. I repeat, the only way for us to have the real experiences of the "killing" of Christ's death by the Holy Spirit is to have living contact with the living Lord.</P><P>We must realize that nothing from ourselves is good or desired by God. God has put everything of ourself to an end by the crucifixion of Christ. Now He has given us the Spirit, who dwells within us. We must simply live and walk according to this Spirit and have living contact with the Lord. Then the effectiveness of the death of Christ will be realized in us through the Holy Spirit.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>III. RESURRECTION</H1><P>We now come to the third major step of Christ: His resurrection. After His death, Christ was resurrected. What was the divine thought in this? God had planned that all creation should both be created through Christ and subsist in Him (Col. 1:16-17). Christ must be the means of creating and the center of the creation. Then, at a certain point, God's thought was to bring all things to an end by putting them to death in Christ. But that is not the end, because God in Christ could never be conquered by death. Death can never hold Christ (Acts 2:24), for He is the fountain of life. He went into death willingly, and He stepped out of death boldly. Even as all things were created through Christ and brought to death in Christ, so now all things are resurrected in Christ. This is the divine thought: to create all things in Christ, to bring all things to death in Christ, and then to resurrect all things in Christ.</P><P>We, as believers, must pass through all these processes. We know we have been created and, by the mercy of God, put to death. Now we must realize that we have also been resurrected in Christ. Unbelievers may know only the first step of the process. They were created, but as they have never experienced the death of Christ, they likewise have no share in His resurrection. We, however, share both His death and His resurrection. We were dead in Christ, and we were raised up in Him too. Christ's history is our experience. He was in death, and we were in Him. Now He is in resurrection, and praise the Lord, so are we! We are in this resurrection because we are in Him.</P><P>Perhaps you ask, Why did God put all things to death in Christ and then later bring all things to resurrection in Him? The answer is foreign to our thinking. At creation, nothing of God Himself was mingled with the creature. If we search the Scriptures, we must conclude that at the time of creation man did not receive the life of God. Nothing of God was mingled with man. But through the death and resurrection of Christ, God mingled Himself with man!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD AND MAN MINGLED</H2><P>How did God mingle Himself with man? This is beyond our natural conception. Christ was incarnated as a man, and within this man is God, the source of life itself. This man, Christ, likened Himself to a grain of wheat (John 12:24). Life, we know, is in the grain of wheat. But the life needs to be released; it is limited within the grain. How can this life be released? It is released through death. If we plant the grain into the earth and it dies, the life in it will be released to grow and bear fruit. It will produce many grains, the result of the release of life. The grain is the man, Jesus; the life in this grain is the divine life of God Himself; the many grains are all those who are regenerated (1 Pet. 1:3). We are the many grains with the divine life of God. Formerly we had nothing of God mingled with us, but now, through the death and resurrection of Christ, God Himself is mingled with us in life. We have the life of God. We have God Himself in us as life. We have been recreated. Christ, who is now our life, is the very embodiment of God in us. To be a Christian is much more than being forgiven, redeemed, and saved. It is also that we are mingled with God in Christ through His Spirit. We are one with God; He lives in us! Christ created us, brought us into death, and also brought us into resurrection. We are joined to Christ. His experiences are our experiences: when He died, we died; when He was resurrected, we were resurrected. To be dead is to be released; to be resurrected is to be joined to someone else. By death we were freed from everything of Adam. The fall of Adam put us into prison, but the death of Christ opened this prison, and now we are free! But this is not the end, because by resurrection we are joined to everything of Christ. We are dead to everything of Adam and raised up to everything of Christ, because we are joined to God in Christ through the Holy Spirit.</P><P>I have been traveling for a number of years and have met quite a number of Christians of various backgrounds and teachings; yet I find very few who understand the resurrection of Christ. The Apostle Paul said that he wanted to know Christ and the power of His resurrection. There is something here which is mysterious and beyond human conception. You may say, "Brother, I understand the resurrection of Christ." But I would ask you, What does it mean? I have spent considerable time collecting hymns on the resurrection of Christ; yet there is hardly one that is really useful! These hymns merely relate the history of the resurrection of Christ. "Christ is risen, Hallelujah!"&#151;that's all. You can hardly find a hymn telling you that the resurrection is to be inwardly experienced by you, that it has brought Christ into you and that you are one with Him in it!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST OUR LIFE</H2><P>About 25 years ago a brother asked me if I had experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit. I said, "Please excuse me if I do not answer your question until I've asked you one! Do you understand the resurrection of Christ?" He replied, "I know that after the Lord died and was buried for three days, He was raised up." I said, "Brother, do you know that this resurrection has something to do with you?" He said, "Oh yes, I know! If the Lord had not been resurrected, He could never be my Savior! He would never have gone to heaven as my High Priest to pray for me!" I said, "That's true, but that's only the objective aspect. Can you tell me something subjective about the resurrection?" He replied that he did not know what I meant by the word "subjective," so I changed my question. "Brother, do you have a spiritual life?" He said, "Yes." Then I asked, "What is the spiritual life you have?" He said, "Oh, my spiritual life is the life of God in the Holy Spirit." Then I asked, "What is this life of God in the Spirit?"</P><P>If you ask such questions in detail, most Christians cannot answer satisfactorily. Today I hope you will understand that our spiritual life is nothing other than the resurrected Christ Himself. Christ resurrected is our life. To this very moment, Christ is still the resurrected Lord as our life. We usually speak of the life of Christ, but in the Scripture you cannot find such a term. It is not the life of Christ; it is Christ as life.</P><P>In 1944, in China, I said to a group of believers, "Suppose you took only the Gospel of John to Mongolia and did not tell the people anything else; you only preached to them according to that Gospel. Then after a time, you asked the believers, `Friends, where is Jesus Christ today? Has He ascended to the heavens or not?'" This would not be an easy question to answer. If they were to say, "No," I would say, "Yes." If they were to say, "Yes," I would say, "No." Luke and Mark tell us clearly that certain days after the resurrection, the Lord ascended to the heavens, but not so the Gospel of John. It seems that the Gospel of John does not mention Christ's ascension to the heavens. But, be careful. On the day of resurrection, early in the morning, He did ascend to heaven. But He came down again on the same day. In the morning He ascended, but in the evening He came to the disciples. And from then on He has never left His disciples. Read the Scriptures again! In chapter 20, in the morning, Mary of Magdalene tried to touch Him, and the Lord said, "Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father" (vv. 16-17). Then, on that very day, in the evening, He came into the room where the disciples were (John 20:19-20). After one week, He did the same thing and said to Thomas: "Reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side" (John 20:26-27). The Lord invited Thomas to touch Him, but Mary was forbidden, because He had not yet ascended to His Father. Surely this means that in the interval the Lord had gone to His Father in heaven, but that He did not stay there. It seems He went there secretly and came back secretly.</P><P>Suppose you saw me in Los Angeles in the morning and again in the afternoon. You would assume I had been there all the time, for you would not have known that I had flown to San Francisco! I went there secretly, and I flew back secretly. This is what the Gospel of John portrays.</P><P>After the Lord came to the disciples in the evening of that resurrection day, there is not a word that He left them again. He came and according to the Gospel of John, He never left them. He had told them, I will not leave you orphans. I will leave you for a little while, but I will come back to you (John 14:18-19). The Lord left them when He died, and He returned after the resurrection. He was gone not more than seventy-two hours.</P><P>Before His death the Lord was in a physical body; He could only be among His disciples, never in them. But after the resurrection when the Lord came back to His disciples, He could enter into them. How could that be? While He was in the body, He could not be in them; He would have to be transfigured. Therefore, by death and resurrection He was transfigured from the body into the Spirit. That night when the disciples were gathered together, the doors were closed; yet the Lord came in! And He breathed on them, saying, "Receive ye the Holy Spirit" (John 20:22). Thenceforth, the Lord never left them, for He was in them. First, the Lord was incarnated to be a man, limited by a human body. Then, by His death and resurrection, He was transfigured from the body into the Spirit. First, He was with us, but now He is in us! Now the Lord in the Spirit is always with us, living in us (John 14:16-17; Rom. 8:9-10). He is our resurrection life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE APPLICATION OF CHRIST AS LIFE</H2><P>Let us be very practical about this matter. As a regenerated Christian, how do you deal with people? As a brother with Christ as your life, how do you deal with the brothers? Do you deal with them by Christ, or by yourself? To deal with a brother by Christ is to be in the Spirit. We must deal with one another in the Spirit.</P><P>What does it mean to be "in the Spirit"? First, we must realize that Christ is now living with us in the Spirit. He is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), the "Lord Spirit" (2 Cor. 3:18, Greek), because He was transfigured from the flesh to the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). He is in us today as our life (Col. 3:4). Second, having Christ as our life, we must live by Christ (John 6:57) and not by ourselves. This is a problem, for there are many of us who have Christ as life, but do not live by Him. Third, we must know that Christ is living in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:16)&#151;not in our mind, emotion, or will. Have we not often had the experience of something deep within contradicting us&#151;contradicting our mind, our emotion, or our will? That "something" is really the Lord Spirit. Sometimes we intend to talk with a certain person, but that something within says, "No!" Don't we all have this experience? Even in ministering the Word it is often so. We make up our minds to speak on a certain subject, but something within does not agree. He tells us, "Forget about what you are going to say." It seems that the Lord is always troublesome, never giving us a free hand, but always asking us to follow Him. Yes, we must follow the Lord Spirit (Rom. 8:4), not He follow us! He is the resurrection life living within us, and we must follow Him.</P><P>We all have a natural life, but we must give it up and take Christ alone as our life. We must not serve the Lord by our mind or by our emotion, but in our spirit (Rom. 1:9). When we come to the meetings, we must be dead to ourselves, our desires, our thoughts, and that which we love. We must tell the Lord, "You are my life; I live by You and not by my will, my mentality, or my knowledge." So often we have a certain thought or a certain emotion that we want to express in the meeting. But we must forget our thoughts and emotions and only remember the Lord Himself as life and live by Him. Brothers and sisters frequently come to talk with me about the right way to meet together. I always answer that the right way is Christ Himself in the Spirit. We must forget about forms, opinions, and our way of thinking. We have to say, "Lord, You are my life. Whatever I do here in ministering or serving, I do by You as life and not by myself. I wish to learn how to live by You."</P><P>This is why I asked how you deal with people and with the brothers and sisters. We must learn to deal with people by CHRIST. If we actually take Him as our life, He will be real to us!</P><P>We need to know Christ, even as the Apostle Paul said, "That I may know Him and the power of His resurrection" (Phil. 3:10). We need to know Him as the resurrection life. We must not know Him in knowledge, teaching, doctrine, the mind, the emotions, the desires, or the will, but in the Spirit.</P><P>One day a brother came to me and asked if I thought Christians should joke. I said, "There is no regulation. There is no law in the Scriptures. Christ did not give us such a law; so I dare not say whether it is right or not. But there is one thing I must say. If you would joke, you must first consult Christ. You must take Him as your life. If you can joke by Christ, go ahead. If He is your life in joking, it is quite right. You yourself know whether or not Christ will go along with your joking. The only rule is Christ Himself!" Today there is only one law, one rule, one regulation: Christ Himself, the all-inclusive Christ as our life in resurrection.</P><P>How should we deal with people? Simply by taking Christ as life! Christ is risen to be our life. May we realize this positively in our daily lives. Listening or reading is not enough. We must put this into practice. We must take Christ as our life for every occasion. How very real and practical it is! If we do this, we will very quickly be filled with Him in our spirit (Eph. 5:18). We will be full of Christ and our whole being will be saturated with the Spirit. The Lord is seeking this kind of people today. To live by Christ is true spirituality!</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>IV.  ASCENSION</H1><P>We come now to the fourth major step of Christ: His ascension. We already have seen the incarnation, the crucifixion, and the resurrection. By the resurrection the creation was brought to a new standing, and we were regenerated to be members of the Body of Christ. But the Body was not yet formed. It was by the ascension of Christ that all these members were formed into a living Body. After Christ ascended to heaven, He baptized His whole Body by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1-4, 16-18, 33), and it was by this baptism in the Holy Spirit that all the members were formed into one Body (1 Cor. 12:13). After His ascension, He also gave many gifts: apostles, prophets, evangelists, teachers and pastors (Eph. 4:8, 11-12). The purpose of these gifts was to build up the Body.</P><P>At each of the four major steps of Christ, there was one main accomplishment. In His incarnation Christ joined Himself to the creation. By His crucifixion He put all the creation to an end. By His resurrection Christ brought in the new creation with all the regenerated as living members of His Body. This, however, was only the preparation of the materials and still not the building. It was not until He ascended to heaven and poured down the Holy Spirit of power that the Body was formed. It was also then that He gave gifts for the building up of that Body.</P><P>We were indeed put to an end in Christ on the cross and also regenerated to be living members of Christ. But do we live as members of the Body and take Christ as our life? Many Christians today simply are not like members of Christ because they are not living by Christ. When we live by Christ and take Him as our life, then we are living members and real brothers. Sometimes a brother will say to me, "That brother is a real brother!" When I ask him what he means by "real brother," he says, "Oh, he is so sincere, so nice and so lovely!" I shake my head. "No, brother. A nice brother may not be a real brother!" We may be quite lovely, quite nice, and still not be living by Christ. We may be born "nice," or born "lovely." I have met many people both in the East and West who are naturally "nice," though they have never received Christ. We should not say that a lovely brother is a real brother. To be a real brother means to be living by Christ, to be a living member for the Body. I do not say "of the Body," but "for the Body."</P><P>We may be a living member, a real brother, but have we been built up together with others? I know we have been joined to Christ and put to an end on the cross, and that we do take Christ as our life, but are we now members in the Body? We must be in the ascension of Christ as well as in His resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ADVENT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</H2><P>Christ told His disciples that if He did not go away, the Holy Spirit would not come (John 16:7). When the Holy Spirit came, Jesus also came in the Holy Spirit (John 14:17-18). He was transfigured from the body into the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). So, after His resurrection, He came back in the Spirit in a resurrected body (John 20:19). In the Spirit He breathed on the disciples saying, "Receive ye the Holy Spirit" (John 20:22). Thus, by the resurrection, He brought Himself as the Spirit of life into the disciples.</P><P>Many people today think that the Holy Spirit never came before Pentecost. But in the evening of the day of resurrection, Christ came and breathed on the disciples, saying, "Receive ye the Holy Spirit." That means the Holy Spirit came into the disciples that very night. On the day of resurrection, early in the morning, the Lord went to the Father for a short while (John 20:17). Then, in the evening, He came down to the disciples with the Spirit of life.</P><P>This is confirmed by another instance. Before Pentecost the one hundred and twenty disciples prayed together for ten days in harmony (Acts 1:13-15)! Do you believe that without the Holy Spirit of life within them they could be in such accord for ten days? Try it. I'm afraid you will soon be quarreling with others. We remember how the disciples contended with one another before the Lord died (Luke 22:24). Everyone wanted to be the greatest. But after the resurrection, those poor fishermen of Galilee boldly left their country and went to stay in Jerusalem, though the place was filled with threatening against them (John 20:19). Not only did they go and abide together there, but they also prayed in one accord for ten days. This was not something that came from themselves; it was something of the Spirit of life. They had the Holy Spirit of life within them. Peter could even stand up and give a message from the Scriptures showing the fulfillment of prophecy (Acts 1:15-20). That came from the Spirit of truth. Thus we see that the disciples received the Spirit of life before Pentecost. They became living members, though not yet formed into one Body. Therefore, they waited for the power from on high (Luke 24:49), the baptism in the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:5, 8) through which they would be formed into a living Body.</P><P>The Lord's children today confuse these things. Some people say the baptism of the Holy Spirit is the second blessing. Others say it is for sanctification. This is nothing but confusion. The baptism in the Holy Spirit is for the formation of the Body (1 Cor. 12:13). The resurrection of Christ is for the regeneration of living members for the Body, while the ascension of Christ brings down the Holy Spirit of power so that we may be baptized into one Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TWO ASPECTS OF THE WORK<br>OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</H2><P>We must realize that there are two aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit. One aspect is that of the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of life indwelling us. The second aspect is that of the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of power coming upon us. Here in one verse both aspects are mentioned: "For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body..and were all made to drink of one Spirit" (1 Cor. 12:13, A.S.V.). Both of these matters&#151;the baptism and the drinking&#151;are related to us, but we cannot say that they are one and the same. To be baptized in water is one thing, and to drink water is another. Likewise, to be baptized in the Holy Spirit is one thing, and to drink of the Holy Spirit is another. We must drink of the Holy Spirit in order to be filled with Him, and be baptized in the Holy Spirit in order to be clothed by Him.</P><P>In the Gospel of John, the Lord uses two figures for the Holy Spirit. In chapter 7, He likens the Holy Spirit to water for drinking; in chapter 20, He likens Him to breath. Water and breath are something for life. But in the writings of Luke two other figures are used. In Luke 24:49, the Holy Spirit is likened to clothing; in Acts 2:2, He is likened to a mighty wind. Breath is for life, but the mighty wind is for power. As a Christian, we must on one hand drink of the Spirit of life to be filled with life, and on the other hand we must be clothed with the Holy Spirit of power to be equipped with power for service and ministry.</P><P>Let me illustrate. When I am home in my room, I can sit in my chair drinking cup after cup of tea till I am full of water. That would suffice for my living at home, but it would not suffice for my going to the meeting to minister. To go to the meeting I must dress properly. I cannot say it does not matter how I dress, as long as I am full of water! I cannot go to the meeting to minister in pajamas. We must be fittingly dressed for everything we do.</P><P>The disciples received the Spirit of life on the day of resurrection, but when the Lord was about to ascend into the heavens, He said to the disciples, "Tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on high" (Luke 24:49, A.S.V.). This means that on the day of resurrection the Lord brought living water for the people to drink, but on the day of Pentecost He clothed them with the proper uniform for power. Then they were qualified and equipped for ministry.</P><P>Suppose, however, that I am dressed and properly clothed, but still hungry and thirsty. I must go to minister, but there is no way for me to get some water to drink. I go to the meeting, but I am thirsty. Outwardly I am suitably clothed, but inwardly I lack something. As a Christian we need both the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of life inwardly, and the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of power outwardly. Then we will be strengthened in life and equipped with power.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, what is our condition? Are we filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit of life? And are we clothed outwardly with the Holy Spirit of power? If we would be a living, functioning member of the Body of Christ, we must be filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit as life, and we must be clothed outwardly with the Holy Spirit as power. Then we will be strong in life and equipped with power for our function in the Body. If, when we come together as believers meeting before the Lord, there is a lack of function in our midst, it is due to these two matters. On one hand, not many believers are really filled with the Holy Spirit of life inwardly. And more, very few are really clothed with the Holy Spirit of power outwardly.</P><P>When I was called by the Lord to serve Him, I soon realized that I lacked something both inwardly and outwardly. Oh, how I knew it! I went to the Lord and prayed and prayed, and thus I discovered that inwardly I needed the life of the Holy Spirit, and outwardly the power of the Holy Spirit. I went to the Lord and consecrated myself to Him over and over again. I waited on the Lord, willing to be dealt with. I learned how to exercise my spirit to cooperate with Him, and I learned how to deny myself. Moreover, I learned more about my need to experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Praise the Lord, after a time I knew that I had been both filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly and clothed with the Holy Spirit outwardly. Oh, from that time everything was different. My ministry was changed and there was a real release.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOW WE CAN EXPERIENCE THE HOLY SPIRIT</H2><P>Perhaps you are now wanting to ask, "How can we have this kind of experience?" The answer is so simple that you will hardly believe it! For the filling of the Holy Spirit inwardly, you only need: (1) to learn how to exercise your spirit to contact the Lord in a living way, and (2) to deny yourself continually. Be assured, you will be inwardly filled with the Holy Spirit! Whenever a struggle arises between you and the Lord, always let the Lord defeat you. Never try to defeat Him! Always be ready to say, "Lord, I surrender." Never try to be strong like Jacob. If you wrestle with the Lord, He will touch your thigh and make you limp. Learn to exercise your spirit and deny yourself all the time. Then you will be inwardly filled with the Holy Spirit. Do not ask when. The matter of time is not in your hand. And do not ask how it will be manifested. Leave that to the Lord.</P><P>Then, how can we be clothed with power from on high? Let me illustrate: I am a brother who knows nothing about cooking. I only know how to eat! So it is very simple&#151;I just sit down and eat what is ready! Everything is on the table. I just take it. Do you know that the baptism in the Holy Spirit has been accomplished already? It was accomplished almost two thousand years ago. Now all we need to do is just to take it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT</H2><P>In the book of Acts there are five cases of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. The first is on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4). The second is with the Samaritan believers (Acts 8:14-17). The third is that of the Apostle Paul after he was saved (Acts 9:17). The fourth is in the house of Cornelius (Acts 10:44-47; 11:16-17). And the fifth is with the believers in Ephesus (Acts 19:1, 2, 6). All these five cases have nothing to do with the infilling of the Holy Spirit; they are all related to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon us. On the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit came upon the disciples. In Samaria, when two of the apostles laid their hands on the believers, the Holy Spirit came upon them. It was the same in the case of Paul, in the house of Cornelius, and with the believers in Ephesus. None of these five cases are concerned with the infilling of the Holy Spirit; yet only two of them are called the "baptism in the Holy Spirit"&#151;the one on the day of Pentecost and the one in the house of Cornelius. On the day of Pentecost, Christ the Head baptized the Jewish part of His Body in the Holy Spirit; and in Cornelius' house, Christ the Head baptized the Gentile part of the Body in the Holy Spirit. Thus both parts were made one and baptized into the one Body in one Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13). By this, the baptism in the Holy Spirit was accomplished once for all. Now what we need is not to be baptized in the Holy Spirit again, but simply to experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit already accomplished. Even as we need not be crucified again because of the finished work of Christ on the cross, so also we need not be baptized in the Holy Spirit again. Christ the Head has already baptized the whole Body in the Holy Spirit. We need only experience what the Head has already done to the Body.</P><P>In the five cases of Acts, only two are called the baptism in the Holy Spirit; the other three cases include the laying on of hands. This means that the Body was baptized in the Holy Spirit already and that this baptism was transmitted by a representative of the Body to new members. Through this kind of transmission, we too may experience what the Body already has. The only need is that we be rightly related to the Body. That is the meaning of the laying on of hands&#151;a right relationship to the Body. Through a representative of the Body laying hands on a new member of the Body, what has already been done to the Body is transmitted to the new member. Even Paul when he was Saul needed a little disciple by the name of Ananias to come and lay hands on him. Did Saul say, "Who are you? You are too small! I must have Peter!" If Saul had done that, he would have been wrong with the Body. This was a test to him&#151;and he passed it! He submitted to the Body, for he would be rightly related to it. Then, Ananias, representing the Body, laid his hands upon this newly saved one. The Holy Spirit of God, like the oil from the head, flowed down to the new member, and he in turn was clothed with the Holy Spirit.</P><P>If we would experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit, we must firstly realize that the Lord has ascended, establishing His Lordship and His Headship. Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost, telling the people: "Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ" (Acts 2:36). Because He was established as Lord and Head, He poured down the Spirit of power upon His Body (Acts 2:33).</P><P>Secondly, we must have a right relationship with the Body. Thus we may say to the Head, "Lord, I know Your Body. I am a regenerated member of it and I am rightly related to it. On this standing I claim the baptism in the Holy Spirit already accomplished upon Your Body." Then we will indeed experience the wonderful baptism in the Holy Spirit. If we do not understand the ascension of Christ or have a right standing with the Body, no matter how much we pray and tarry, it will be difficult to have the experience. It is already accomplished. The food is on the table; come and take it!</P><P>Here are two things on the table for us. One is the infilling of the Holy Spirit, and the other is the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. If we would be filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly, we must learn to exercise our spirit to have living contact with the living Lord, and we must learn to deny ourselves all the time. I assure you, we will be inwardly filled with the Holy Spirit. If we would experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, we must realize that the Lord today is ascended, that He is the Lord and Head of all to the church, and we must stand in a right position in respect to the Body. Then we may claim what the Body already has, and we will be clothed with power from on high. Let us do it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCLUSION</H2><P>The incarnation, the crucifixion, the resurrection, and the ascension&#151;all these&#151;have already been accomplished. When we accept the crucifixion of Christ, we receive forgiveness, justification, redemption, and much more. When we accept the resurrection of Christ, we are regenerated. When we accept the ascension of Christ, we receive power from on high. All this Christ has already accomplished. They are the items of the good news, the gospel. If we are going to preach the gospel, we should tell people about these four items: His incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Then they can receive forgiveness, justification, redemption, regeneration, and the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Inwardly they will be filled with the Spirit of life, and outwardly they will be clothed with the Spirit of power.</P><P>Let us all go to the Lord and pray about this. I do have the assurance that something will happen. Do not be satisfied with the words. This is something we must do. Let us go to the Lord and deal with Him about these matters. We must be clear where we are today. We need to be born again with the Holy Spirit, filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit as life, and clothed outwardly with the Holy Spirit as power. Then we will be those who are filled with the triune God and clothed with the triune God. We will be saturated and mingled with Him, and we will be living and functioning members of the Body of Christ.</P></body></html>
