   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before his visit to the Brethren, Brother Nee had two conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He called these conferences "victory conferences."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One was in 1928, and the other was in 1931 when the Brethren came to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1934 he had the third victory conference.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In that ten-day conference, he gave messages on the centrality and universality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I was in that entire conference.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brother Nee asked me to give a message on the Lord's Day to all the visitors as an introduction to the conference.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I was also responsible for keeping a record of all these messages by longhand notes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I received a deep impression from this conference and the greatest help.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That was a real turn in my Christian life and church life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In that year, 1934, Brother Nee entrusted more to me in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When he went away from Shanghai, he put his work upon my shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In October of 1934, he held a conference in Hangchow, a city beside the West Lake, and he spoke on God's overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the end of the conference, he got married, and he asked me to be his best man.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 1935 he had the burden to go to London to visit Brother T. Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before leaving for Europe, he first made arrangements in the summer to stay in my home in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, he and Sister Nee stayed in my home.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He had a conference there that brought in a deeper revival among us by speaking concerning Christ as the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then he canceled his scheduled trip to Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He returned to Shanghai to give a conference there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That was a great turn of the church life among us in 1935.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through the Lord's move at this time, the church life spread to other cities.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1937 Brother Nee began to see that the co-workers needed to travel from one city to another to establish local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He then gave a series of messages firstly in January of 1937 in Shanghai to a small number of co-workers, among whom I was one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then he repeated the same messages in October 1937 in Hankow.</S>
