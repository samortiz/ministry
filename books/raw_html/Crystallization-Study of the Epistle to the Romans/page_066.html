<ol class="upper-roman" start="4">
<li>In his writings, Paul unveils to us that the grace of God is:
	<ol class="decimal" start="15">
	<li>The grace that was given to the Corinthian believers based upon which the apostle thanked God&mdash; 1 Cor. 1:4.</li>
	<li>The grace that God gave to Paul which made him a wise master builder&mdash;3:10.</li>
	<li>The grace that made Paul an apostle who labored more abundantly than all the other apostles; such a grace is just God Himself working through the apostle&mdash;15:10.</li>
	<li>The grace which is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself and which is always with all the believers&mdash;16:23.</li>
	<li>The grace by which the apostles conducted themselves in the world&mdash;2 Cor. 1:12.</li>
	<li>The apostle Paul&rsquo;s visitation to the Corinthian believers was considered as grace, which is God Himself&mdash;1:15.</li>
	<li>The grace which abounded through the greater number, causing the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God&mdash;4:15.</li>
	<li>The grace which the believers should not receive in vain&mdash;6:1.</li>
	<li>The surpassing grace of God given to the Macedonian churches by God, which was the cause of their liberality in giving&mdash;8:1; 9:14.</li>
	<li>The grace that became the fellowship of the Macedonian churches to minister to the need of the saints&mdash;8:4.</li>
	<li>The grace that is a business in which all the believers should participate for its accomplishment&mdash; 8:6-7.</li>
	<li>The grace that is the Lord Jesus Christ&rsquo;s becoming poor that the believers may become rich&mdash;8:9.</li>
	<li>The all grace which God causes to abound unto the believers that, in everything always having all sufficiency, they may abound unto every good work&mdash;9:8.</li>
	<li>The sufficient grace of Christ to the apostle Paul as the power of Christ that was perfected in weakness and that overshadowed the apostle&mdash;12:9.</li>
	<li>The grace of the Lord Jesus, of which the love of God is the source and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the application&mdash;13:14.</li>
	</ol></li>

<p>Prayer: Lord, we believe that this meeting is of You as grace to us. We look unto You to make everything in this meeting grace. Our sharing and prophesying all would be grace. Cover us, Lord, against the enemy. You know in all these days we are in a struggle with the enemy about the release of the crystallization of Your Word. Lord, fight for Your truth, fight for us, and fight the enemy to the uttermost. Bind him and destroy him. He is the defeated foe who was defeated and destroyed on the cross. Lord, even rebuke him every day for us and destroy all his power of darkness, the evil spirits and the demons. We hide ourselves in You. Give us the word of grace to speak Your grace. We want the reality, and we know the reality of this grace as the processed and consummated Triune God is the all-inclusive Spirit as God&rsquo;s consummation. Be with us in everything as this life-giving Spirit. Amen.</p>
<p>We have seen that John&rsquo;s writings begin and end with the grace of God. John shows that when God became incarnated, that was grace coming. John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh, full of grace. Then verse 17 says that the law was given through Moses but grace came. This grace in John 1:17 is personified. Grace came when God came to be a man. John&rsquo;s writings end with grace as the consummation of the entire Scriptures (Rev. 22:21).</p>
<p>After covering so many items of grace, we can see that in the New Testament, for the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s economy, God was processed and consummated to become everything to His chosen people. We are nothing, and He is everything. We who come forward to God must believe that God is and we are not (Heb. 11:6). The first three commandments of the Ten Commandments are concerning God Himself (Exo. 20:1-7). The fourth commandment is concerning keeping the Sabbath (v. 8). This indicates that if we are going to receive God as everything, we must stop our work, that is, we must keep the Sabbath. The entire New Testament time is a Sabbath. The Sabbath means that God is everything, does everything, and gives everything, and man has to stop. Do not do anything, be anything, or give anything. Just receive God as everything.</p>
<p>In the last message we covered grace in the writings of John, in the writings of Peter, and we saw fourteen items concerning grace in Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the Romans. Now we want to see more items of grace in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles to the Corinthians.</p>
