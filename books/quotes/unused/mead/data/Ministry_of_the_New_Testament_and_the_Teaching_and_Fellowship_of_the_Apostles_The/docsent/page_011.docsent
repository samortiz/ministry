   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Fellowship of the Divine Life,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>between the Believers among Themselves</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>in Their Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The fellowship of the apostles is also the fellowship of the divine life, between the believers among themselves in their spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>2-3, 7; Phil 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Among the believers there is a wonderful thing called fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This fellowship is carried on by the Spirit in the believers' regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, in Philippians 2:1 it is called "fellowship of our spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Fellowship of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>in All the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The fellowship of the apostles is also the fellowship of the Holy Spirit in all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These three love, grace, and fellowship are not three separate things; rather, they are three aspects of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fellowship of the Spirit carries with it the grace of Christ, and within the grace of Christ is the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, these three items are just one divine gift as a portion to us, that is, the Triune God Himself in three aspects: in the Father as love, in the Son as grace, and in the Spirit as the fellowship, the application.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Fellowship of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>in the Oneness of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This fellowship is the fellowship of the Body of Christ in the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ephesians 4:3 tells us to be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit, and then verse 4 follows immediately to say, "One Body and one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These two verses indicate that the oneness of the Spirit is just the fellowship of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This fellowship of the Body is in the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we do not have the oneness of the Spirit, we are not enjoying the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Exclusions from the Unique Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the New Testament there are four kinds of exclusions from the unique fellowship of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Removal of the Believers Living in Gross Sins</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The believers who live in gross sins should be excluded from the unique fellowship of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some of the believers in Corinth not only committed gross sins occasionally but also lived in gross sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 1 Corinthians 5:9-13 the apostle taught us to remove this kind of person from our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, many Christians interpret the word remove as excommunicate.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The sense here is not excommunicate but remove.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The removing here is not an excommunication but a form of quarantining, as is used to isolate those who are sick of a contagious disease cf.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>2 Cor 2:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In his writing of 1 Corinthians 5:13 Paul quoted the word remove from the Septuagint.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Leviticus and Numbers God charged the Israelites to "remove" a leper from their fellowship that this one might be healed Lev 13:45-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After his healing, such a one was to be brought back into the fellowship Lev 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The dealing here with a leper was a quarantining.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This, not excommunication, is what is meant in 1 Corinthians 5:13 by the removal of one who is living in gross sin.</S>
