<h2 class="head1">I. A BOOK OF CONCLUSION</h2><p>Revelation is a book of conclusion. If the book of Revelation were deleted from the Bible, there would be a great shortage, for there would be a beginning but no ending. Although there is the beginning in the book of Genesis, without the book of Revelation there is no conclusion or consummation. After having a good start and after passing through so many works, there is the need for God to have a consummation. Without Revelation, there is no conclusion of God&rsquo;s economy. God is great; He is a God of purpose. For the fulfillment of His purpose, His economy must be accomplished. Many Bible students have neglected the matter of God&rsquo;s economy. If we did not have Revelation, we could not see the consummation of God&rsquo;s economy. In fact, we would even find it difficult to realize what God&rsquo;s economy is, because we would not see the result, the issue of His economy. But in this book the revelation of God&rsquo;s economy is so clear because it contains the conclusion of God&rsquo;s economy.</p><p>Without Revelation, we would also have no conclusion to the redemption of Christ. Christ came in the flesh and died on the cross to accomplish redemption. But what does redemption accomplish? To say that Christ&rsquo;s redemption only saves sinners and brings them to heaven is a very poor conclusion. This kind of conclusion is not so meaningful. But in Revelation we see that Christ redeemed us, purchasing us with His blood, to make us a kingdom and priests. Hence, this book discloses the conclusion of Christ&rsquo;s redemption.</p><p>Revelation 1:6 says that Christ has &ldquo;made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father.&rdquo; The believers redeemed by the blood of Christ have not only been born of God into His kingdom (John 3:5), but have also been made a kingdom for God&rsquo;s economy, which is the church (Matt. 16:18-19). John, the writer of this book, was in this kingdom (1:9), and all the redeemed and reborn believers are a part of this kingdom (Rom. 14:17).</p><p>One of the main aspects of this book is that God is recovering His right over the earth to make the whole earth His kingdom (11:15). When Christ came, He brought in the kingdom of God with Him (Luke 17:21; Matt. 12:28). This kingdom has been enlarged into the church (Matt. 16:18-19), which will bring in the consummation of the kingdom of God to the whole earth. On the one hand, the kingdom of God today is in the church, but on the other hand the kingdom of God is coming through the overcoming believers (12:10). Then Christ and the overcoming believers will reign over all the nations in the millennial kingdom (2:26-27; 12:5; 20:4, 6).</p><p>The redemption through Christ&rsquo;s blood has not only made us a kingdom to God but also priests to Him (1 Pet. 2:5). The kingdom is for God&rsquo;s dominion, while the priests, being those who express God&rsquo;s image, are for God&rsquo;s expression. This is the kingly, royal priesthood (1 Pet. 2:9) for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s original purpose in creating man (Gen. 1:26-28). This kingly priesthood is being exercised in today&rsquo;s church life (5:10). It will be intensely practiced in the millennial kingdom (20:6), and it will be ultimately consummated in the New Jerusalem (22:3, 5).</p><p>The book of Revelation also presents a wonderful and marvelous consummation of the church. In this book we see God&rsquo;s economy, Christ&rsquo;s redemption, and the church&rsquo;s testimony. Without Revelation, we could read the Epistles again and again without realizing that the church is Christ&rsquo;s testimony. In which of the Epistles do we see the churches shining as lampstands in the dark night? Only in the book of Revelation do we see this. In Revelation, the churches firstly are the shining lampstands. Eventually, in eternity, the church will be the New Jerusalem, a golden mountain. This is the wonderful consummation of the church. The present situation is a lie, and we should not believe it. Do not just say, &ldquo;How evil is the Catholic Church and how pitiful are the Protestant churches.&rdquo; We must look at the other side, the eternal side, where we see the New Jerusalem. Even today, during the dark night, we have the shining lampstands.</p><p>Along with God&rsquo;s economy, Christ&rsquo;s redemption, and the church&rsquo;s testimony, Revelation also discloses the enemy&rsquo;s destination. If we did not have the book of Revelation, we would not know what Satan&rsquo;s destiny is, and no one would be able to understand why God has been and still is tolerating the subtle, evil, dirty Satan. However, if we get into this book and see the conclusion of Satan&rsquo;s record, we shall be happy and laugh at the serpent. Therefore, in Revelation we have the conclusion of four major things&mdash;God&rsquo;s economy, Christ&rsquo;s redemption, the church&rsquo;s testimony, and Satan&rsquo;s destiny.</p>
