   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Beloved Husband</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible, in the most pure and holy sense, is the record of a divine romance, the romance of a universal couple God in Christ as the Husband and His redeemed people as the wife.</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 2:3 she both appreciates and enjoys him: As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>An apple tree is not only for appreciation but also for enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>She sits under his shadow enjoying rest and feeds on his sweet fruit for satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Finally, in 8:14 she urges him to come quickly: Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The type of the beloved in Song of Songs is fulfilled in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is revealed as our Husband, and the believers are revealed as His counterpart, as His wife.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 2 Corinthians 11:2 Paul says, I betrothed you to one Husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Great Light</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Isaiah 9:2 speaks of a great light shining in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Matthew 4:16, which is a quotation of this verse and its fulfillment, applies it to Christ: The people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in a region and shadow of death, to them light sprang up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Christ departed from Jerusalem to Galilee, He was a great light shining in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At His birth He was a star, but in His ministry He was a great light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One day He said, I have come a light into the world, that everyone who believes in Me may not remain in darkness John 12:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ came to this world as the shining of light, the manifestation of God as light John 12:46; Heb 1:3 , so that men would not remain in darkness but believe in this light and thereby become sons of light John 12:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The light in Matthew 4:16 is Christ as the light of life John 8:12 shining in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Him was life, and the life was the light of men John 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Christ, the embodiment of the divine life, shines within us as the light of life, we are under His enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Having received Him as the expression of God, we have Christ within us as our life Col 3:4 , and this life is the light shining within us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the divine light is the divine life in the Son operating in us.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we follow this light, the light of life, we shall by no means walk in darkness John 8:12 .</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This sign is fulfilled in Luke 2:32 which says that God has prepared a light for revelation of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This was the word of the righteous and devout man Simeon, in praise to God regarding the newborn Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ is not only the glory of God s people Israel; He is also the light for the Gentiles, who are alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise Eph 2:12 .</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This horn of salvation which was typified by the horn of God s anointed, David the king 1 Sam 2:10; Psa 132:17 , is Jesus the Savior, who came out of the house of David Jer 23:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A horn signifies fighting power.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, the horn of salvation is the fighting power of God s salvation in the house of David.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The phrase the house of David indicates that this salvation is in the humanity of the Lord Jesus.</S>
