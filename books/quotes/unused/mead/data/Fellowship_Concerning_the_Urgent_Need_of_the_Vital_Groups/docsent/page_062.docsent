   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A WORD CONCERNING THE BAPTISMS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND CARE FOR OUR GOSPEL CANDIDATES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now I would like to say a word concerning the baptisms of our gospel candidates.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I do not think it is wise to baptize our new ones hastily, especially the Caucasians.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we baptize them lightly, that will spoil them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to seek the Lord s leading in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Perhaps we could set up a baptism meeting on the Lord s Day to make their baptism a very stately matter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then we can bring those who are really ripe for baptism and baptize them in a stately meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you feel that some of your candidates can be brought to the church life in the Lord s Day morning meeting, you may do this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But you have to make our meeting understandable to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To bring in the Chinese is somewhat easy today, especially with those who have come here from mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But we cannot expect this with the proper class of Caucasians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many of them are very considerate.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They may have a religious background, but they do not want to go to their denomination because it does not satisfy them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A number of denominations are full of old people, but they do not have many middle-aged members.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many middle-aged people do not meet regularly in a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead, they are church wanderers, church travelers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But some of them still have a seeking heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you present something real of Christ to them, they will be attracted.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But you have to be careful not to give them the impression that you are involved in some religious formality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Otherwise, they will be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the time you have to keep them in a feeling that you are ministering to them something really spiritual of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That will convince them, and that will keep them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It might be easier to bring them to Christ but more difficult to bring them into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You should anticipate the need to spend much time on them in prayer and labor.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This year you may bring them into Christ, but that still may not be the time to bring them to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may have to wait another time for this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is no need to be anxious and hurried concerning their baptism or their coming into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must keep in mind that the vital groups need to gain the proper Caucasians through much prayer and labor.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In conclusion I would encourage us to sing and to pray Hymns, #279 to the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First the blood, and then the ointment,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Cleansing, then anointing comes;</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we pass not thru Golgotha,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ne er to Pentecost we ll come.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the blood has never cleansed us,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ne er the Spirit s pow r we ll know,</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If for Christ we d truly witness,</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Self-life to the Cross must go.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through the Cross, O Lord, I pray,</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Put my soul-life all away;</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Make me any price to pay,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Full anointing to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ, the Rock, must first be smitten,</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That the living water flow;</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without death the Spirit s fulness</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ne er could dwell in man below.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If with Christ we die completely,</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Willing thus our all to lose,</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He will clothe us with His power</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And to win the world will use.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>First the altar, then the fire,</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If no loss, there ll be no gain;</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If our all has not been offered,</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To the throne we ll ne er attain.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If to sacrifice we re willing,</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All forsaking, God t obey,</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He to us will be committed</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>And thru us His pow r display.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>First we must prepare the vessels</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That the Oil they may contain;</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Dig the valley full of ditches</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>That they may be filled with Rain.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>First we must go thru the Jordan</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Ere anointed from above;</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>First in death we must be baptized,</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then experience the Dove.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we see the ripened harvest</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Of the golden countryside,</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We may know that many seeds have</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Fallen to the earth and died.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Ere the fruit of life may blossom,</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must surely suffer death;</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If with Christ we ve not been buried,</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We ll not feel the Spirit s breath.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Since it must be thus, I pray, Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Help me go the narrow way;</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Deal with pride and make me willing</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Thus to suffer, Thee t obey.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I for greater power pray not,</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Deeper death is what I need;</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>All the meaning of the Cross, Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Work in me for this I plead.</S>
