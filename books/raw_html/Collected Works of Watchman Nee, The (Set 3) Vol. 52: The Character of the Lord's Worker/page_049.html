<p>We have to see the glory of God's truth. We cannot project our own feelings into His truth. When we stand beside God's truth, we should not just consider ourselves to be smaller than it; we should consider ourselves to be non-existent. If we involve the self even a little, we will end up with trouble immediately. A brother, who had been criticized in some quarters, came to the church and felt quite happy about the contacts he made. He felt that he had been unjustly criticized where he had been, but he did not really touch the truth before the Lord. He was merely impressed by a few of the brothers. Such a brother was very undisciplined in his conduct. Some time later another brother said to him, "Brother, you have been too loose," and he proceeded to point out some of the things that the new brother had done. This was a speaking of truth in love. But when the new brother heard this, he left, remarking in anger, "No wonder so many people are against this church. It should be criticized." Brothers and sisters, this brother was not absolute to the truth. If he had been absolute to the truth, he would not have said this when he was rebuked by others. Because he was not absolute to the truth, he changed his tone as soon as he was rebuked.</p><p>What does it mean to be absolute to the truth? It means to set aside feelings, to ignore personal relationships, and to not stand for the self. The truth is absolute. Our personal feelings, relationships, experiences, and encounters should not be mixed up with it. Since truth is absolute, what is right is right and what is wrong is wrong. There is a brother who is a leader in many places. He has taken our way and has decided to stand for the testimony of the church. If the way we take is right, it is always right; it does not become right because this brother is taking this way. If the way we take is wrong, it cannot be made right simply because this brother is taking this way. Whether or not the way is right has nothing to do with this brother. Even if this brother becomes fallen, the way is still right because truth is absolute. However, many people have their eyes set only on this brother. They think that if this brother is right, the way he has chosen must be right as well, and if the brother is wrong, the way he has chosen also must be wrong. Are their eyes on the truth, or are they on the person? This does not mean that we can be careless. We should never be careless; we should uphold God's testimony. This is a fact. Yet at the same time, whether or not this way is the right way is based on truth, not on men. Does this mean that when other Christians sin we are no longer Christians? Does this mean that when other children of God fall, we are no longer children of God? Does this mean that when many children of God lose their testimonies, we are no longer believers? No, brothers and sisters, truth is absolute. Even if many Christians have failed, the Lord is still worthy of our trust, and we must still trust in Him. Even if many of God's children have sinned, we remain children of God; there should be no change. This does not mean that God's children have license to sin or that Christians have license to fail. It does mean, however, that the truth is absolute. If it is right to believe in the Lord, we should believe in Him even when others do not believe. If it is right to be a Christian, we should be a Christian even if all others have fallen. The issue is not what others are doing. The issue is whether or not something is the truth. Many divisions in the church, many problems in the work, and many disputes among workers will cease when personal relationships, feelings, and problems are set aside.</p><p>It is not a small thing to be absolute to the truth. We cannot be indifferent about this. If we are loose in this, we will be loose in everything. In order to uphold the truth, we have to abandon ourselves completely. If we do not have such a heart and habit for the truth, we will have problems sooner or later. Some brothers say, "I thank God for bringing me to this meeting. I have received much help." This does not mean that this brother is absolute for the truth. He may only be emotionally attached to this place. When something unpleasant happens to him, he may change his mind and decide that he is in the wrong place. Truth, however, is absolute. If this place is right, it is right. If it is wrong, it is wrong. It cannot be right just because it is good to him, and wrong because it is not good to him. If the justification of a place is dependent on its treatment of him, he must be the most important thing in the whole world! Truth is not important to him; he is important! He is not absolute for the truth. This is where many problems come from. God demands that we be dealt with to the extent that we set ourselves and our feelings aside in everything. It matters little whether we feel happy or hurt. Our direction should never be affected by our own personal feelings. If God says it is right, it is right. If God says it is wrong, it is wrong. If God says this way is right, we have to take this way even if everyone refuses to take it. We do not take this way because it is exciting or because a certain brother has taken it. If this way is right, we should take it, even if none of the brothers take it. Truth is absolute, and no human being should influence us in any way. If we bring in the element of human consideration, we have made man greater than the truth.</p>
