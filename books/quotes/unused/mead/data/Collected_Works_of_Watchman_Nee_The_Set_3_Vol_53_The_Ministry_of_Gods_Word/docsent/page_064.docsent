   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What is a word that releases life?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When God grants us revelation, He grants us life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He dispenses life to us through His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This revelation becomes a burden to a worker or a minister.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When this burden is discharged, life is released.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If this burden is not discharged, life is not released.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The heavier the burden is, the more powerful its release will be when it is discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the burden cannot be discharged, it remains in us, and it will become heavier and heavier as time goes on.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Suppose we have a large bag full of water that is very heavy in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we puncture the bag, the water will be discharged, and our hands will not feel the weight after a while.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The release of the word works in this same way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we have a burden within us, we should also have suitable words within us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One sentence will be enough; our burden will be discharged like water being discharged from the bag.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if we do not have this one word, we will feel like a water-tight bag.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What then is a word of revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A word of revelation is a word that releases life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Previously, life was locked up, but through the discharge of our burden, it is released to others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must have suitable words to release the pressure within.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do not have such a word, we cannot release life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every time we have a burden, no matter how heavy it is, we will receive a word related to it if we wait long enough before God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes we may have to pray for days before we have a word to match the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In capturing the light, our mind may understand what is involved, but we may not have the words to express our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are times, however, when we receive the words at the same time that our mind captures the light.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the weight of the burden is felt, the words come instantaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We cannot dictate when the words will come.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes God gives us the words immediately upon seeing something.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes we have to wait, and the words come only after the burden has become heavier and heavier.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No matter when the words come, they are always suited for the occasion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These words become our light.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It seems as if the entire revelation that we have received can be summed up in one word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The one or two words that we have received are as rich in content as the entire revelation we received earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These words are like the cork of a bottle; when the cork is removed, the content bursts out.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God has to give us one or two words.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We call these words the inner words.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These words come from God, and they are given to capture the revelation and to hold the revelation together.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is God's intention for the revelation that we received from Him to be contained in these one or two words.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we release these words, the revelation is released.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once we utter these words of revelation from God, His light is released.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should be clear about this before the Lord: Without light, there is no ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Without the mind retaining the light and transforming it into thoughts, there is no ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But even after the light is retained and translated into thoughts, there is still the need of the word, the word of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This word is what Paul referred to as "words taught by the Spirit" 1 Cor 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Spirit has to give us a word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He must not only give us revelation, but He must also give us the revelation in words.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Such words of revelation may be only one or two sentences, but they are concise and to the point.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As soon as these one or two sentences are uttered, life ushers forth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may say many things, but if we do not utter these one or two sentences, life will not flow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As soon as these sentences are uttered, however, life flows out.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's life is released through revelation and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Take, for example, the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As far as the fact is concerned, the Lord has died for everyone in the whole world already.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But has everyone received His life?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As far as the fact is concerned, He has died for every person in this world, but not everyone has received this life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is because not everyone has received the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even if a person can recite the truth of the Lord's death, it will not do him any good if he has not received the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Others, who have received the revelation, can utter thanksgiving and praise from their inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Seeing brings life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Holy Spirit enlivens man through His word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As soon as we see such a word, we are enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today God is supplying the church through the word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>His intention is to dispense Christ and the life of Christ to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But it seems that this life can only be released through the burden we bear.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When a burden comes to us, there must be a corresponding word to release the life in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some words do not release life even when they are spoken for two hours.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Other words release life immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some words can be spoken repeatedly without carrying any life in them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Other words usher in life as soon as they are uttered.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A minister of the word must have the word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Without the word, he will not accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Every time a person receives a revelation, he has to receive one or two words as well.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When such words are released, life flows.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>These puncturing and life- gushing words release life as soon as they are uttered.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Before they are uttered, no life is released.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But as soon as a person speaks these words, others touch life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Without such words, one cannot touch life no matter how hard he tries.</S>
