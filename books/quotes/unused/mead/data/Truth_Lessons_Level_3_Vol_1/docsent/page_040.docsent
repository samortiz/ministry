   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Savior Who Gives People</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Bread of Life to Save Them from Death</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Regarding Joseph s being the sustainer of life to distribute food, the record of the Bible is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Pharaoh had two dreams, the first of cows and the second of ears of corn Gen 41:1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Both the cows and the grain are good for food, and they represent the animal life and the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to God s ordination, before the fall man ate only of the vegetable life 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After the fall, however, man was told to eat meat because of the need for the shedding of blood for redemption 9:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, the fallen man had to take as his supply the vegetable life and the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the Lord s table we see the bread and the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The blood comes out of the Lord s sacrificial life for redemption, and the bread comes from His regenerating life for life s reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In John 1:29 John the Baptist said, Behold, the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the animal life for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 12:24 the Lord compared Himself to a grain of wheat falling into the earth to reproduce by life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the vegetable life for regenerating.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Both kinds of life are mentioned in Genesis 41.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, Joseph s becoming the One who distributed food to save the people from dying of famine typifies Christ s being exalted by God to become the Savior who gives life to people to save them from death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>JOSEPH TAKING AN EGYPTIAN WOMAN</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>AS HIS WIFE TYPIFYING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>ACQUIRING THE GENTILE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although Joseph was rejected by his brothers, after he was released from prison and enthroned with authority in Egypt, he took as his wife Asenath, the daughter of Potipherah, priest of On.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Joseph s wife was a heathen, an Egyptian.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This also is a type portraying how Christ, in His resurrection and exaltation after the time of His rejection by the Israelites, has acquired the Gentile church in the Gentile land.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of his wife, Asenath, Joseph begot two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The name Manasseh means causing to forget.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With the birth of Manasseh Joseph forgot all his afflictions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates that when the church is productive, Christ will declare that He has forgotten His afflictions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The name Ephraim means fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Joseph not only forgot his afflictions but was also fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that when we preach the gospel and produce fruit, Christ will be happy and declare, There is no more affliction but fruitfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>JOSEPH MAKING HIMSELF KNOWN</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>TO HIS BROTHERS TYPIFYING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>MEETING WITH THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Scriptures prophesy that the children of Israel will be forced to turn to Christ just as Joseph s brothers were forced to turn to Joseph for food Gen 42:1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Zechariah 12:10 says, They will look upon Me, whom they have pierced; and they will wail over Him with wailing as for an only son and cry bitterly over Him with bitter crying as for a firstborn son.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Romans 11:26 Paul says, And thus all Israel will be saved, as it is written, The Deliverer will come out of Zion; He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the future, Israel will be forced to turn to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Joseph s brothers turned to him, Joseph recognized them, but they did not know him Gen 42:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, Joseph tested them again and again 42:9-16; 44:1-13 , disciplined them 42:17-24 , and repeatedly showed love to them 42:25; 43:29-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, they did not know him and were ignorant of his love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually, Joseph acknowledged his ignorant brothers 45:1-4 , and his brothers also recognized him 45:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All these things are types.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Joseph s making himself known to his brothers in his reigning is a type of Christ s meeting with His flesh relatives, the children of Israel, when He will obtain the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At that time, the nations will gather together to besiege Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the very moment of peril, Christ will descend and His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split at its middle toward the east and toward the west into a very great valley.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then the persecuted Israelites will flee into the valley Zech 14:1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At that time they will lift up their heads to look and they will see the Messiah, their Deliverer, Jesus the Nazarene, whom they had pierced.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then they will repent and turn to the Lord and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord will send His angels to gather them together from the four winds to the good land that God gave to their forefathers Matt 24:30-31 .</S>
