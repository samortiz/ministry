   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ANNULLING OF MARKS OF PIETY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The last distinction spoken of in Colossians is the distinction between the circumcised and the uncircumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This speaks of the distinction of outward marks of piety.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We know that the Jews are circumcised with a mark on their bodies, indicating that they belong to God, that they fear God, and that they deny the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In doing so they put themselves under God's covenant and become a part of God's covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many people specifically the Jews love circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They think that only those who are circumcised are under God's covenant, while those who are not circumcised are not under His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A Jew cannot marry an uncircumcised person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Acts 15 says that even the believing Gentiles were forced to be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Jews paid much attention to this mark of piety in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today we can fall into the same pitfall as the Jews, paying too much attention to external signs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, I may be baptized by immersion while a certain brother may be sprinkled instead of immersed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's Word tells us that we should be baptized by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is true that a brother should be baptized by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, if I consider myself to be better than my brother, who is not baptized by immersion, then I have made baptism by immersion a mark of piety.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have, in effect, claimed that in one thing in the flesh I am better than my brother.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If I consider my brother wrong in the eyes of the Lord because he has not gone through an outward immersion, I have made baptism by immersion a cause of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Head covering carries a spiritual significance to the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, it can become a mark in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The breaking of bread has a spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But it can also become a mark in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The laying on of hands has a spiritual significance, but it can become a mark in the flesh as well.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These things indeed carry much spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if they are used to separate God's children, they will lose their spiritual significance and become mere marks of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In reality they will become something similar to circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Please do not try to misunderstand me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, try to understand what I am saying.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not think that we disagree with baptism by immersion, the breaking of bread, the head covering, or the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am trying to show you that once you separate God's children by these things, you are making distinctions according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Christ there is no circumcision and uncircumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Physical symbols must not be used to separate God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Christ we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The life that is in Christ is one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is good for something with spiritual reality to have a physical symbol as well.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, if a person has the spiritual reality of something but is unconcerned about its physical symbol, we should not isolate him because of this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In short, God's children should not allow physical symbols to damage the oneness that they have in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is true that some of God's children do not have an accurate view concerning certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But as long as they have the spiritual reality, we should be satisfied with our spiritual oneness and should not insist on the symbols.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, a sister may be very submissive before the Lord and before the brothers; she knows where she stands before the Lord and before the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If she is short only of a sign on her head, we should not ostracize her.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The moment we separate God's children, we damage the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul stated quite clearly that circumcision is not for the purification of fleshly blemishes but for the removal of fleshly activities.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the eyes of God, what counts is the inward reality, not the outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the inward revelation is the same, one should not make separations based on outward differences.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a person has neither the inward reality nor the outward sign, that is not our concern.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a sister does not take the place of submission, or if a brother's baptism is not a separation from the world or a burial and resurrection with the Lord, he or she is too far off from the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In such cases the responsibility does not rest on us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But if a person sees baptism as one's burial and resurrection with Christ, yet holds a slightly different view in the matter of the outward signs, we cannot damage the oneness because of this slight difference.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You cannot set yourselves apart from others just because you are obedient to the Lord with respect to certain physical symbols.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is wrong to separate God's children according to these things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are all brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Christ we are a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are fellow members in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the church we have annulled all distinctions outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Everyone stands on a new ground.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Everyone is in the one new man that the Lord has established and in the one Body which the Lord has created.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must see that all of God's children are one.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We cannot look upon anyone with a special frame of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must thoroughly eradicate denominationalism and sectarianism from our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we do this, we will have taken another step forward.</S>
