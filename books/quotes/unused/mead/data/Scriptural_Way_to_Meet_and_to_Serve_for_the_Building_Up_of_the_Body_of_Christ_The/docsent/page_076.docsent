   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR LIFE AND FRUIT-BEARING Scripture Reading: John 15:1-8, 16; 12:24, 28</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we want to see the matters of life and fruit-bearing in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to be brought into a full realization that today we all are the branches of the divine, true vine v. 5 . In order to see the intention of the Lord s speaking in John 15, we have to realize that the section from John 12:12 through John 17 is one section on the multiplication of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many readers of the Bible have never seen this secret of understanding this section.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The crucial and controlling verse in this section is John 12:24.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus likened Himself to a grain of wheat that falls into the earth and dies.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This one grain then becomes many grains, which are the multiplication of that one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE TRUE VINE BEING A MATTER OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The subject of John 15 is still the multiplication of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ is the vine tree, and this very Christ needs to be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This tree multiplies by the branches of the tree bearing fruit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The vine tree is like the one grain of wheat and its fruit is like the many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For the one grain to be multiplied into many grains, there is the need of the dispensing of the very life of that one grain into many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the same principle, for the vine tree to be multiplied, there is the need of the dispensing of the very life of the tree into the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The true vine is a matter of life John 15:1, 4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The vine tree is the organism of the Triune God with the divine life for the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The true vine dispenses the very Triune God into all the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is the embodiment of the processed Triune God Col 2:9 , and the very organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>An organism, of course, is something organic and living.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is the opposite of a dead organization.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our human body is something living and something organic, so it is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because our body is an organism, it functions in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our body functions to contain us, express us, and take action for us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We could not move, act, or have any kind of activity without our body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In like manner, the organism of the Triune God, which is His very embodiment, Christ Himself, functions to contain the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The very Triune God is here in this organism, in this vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, this organism expresses the Triune God and is the means by which and through which the Triune God can act and move.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE BRANCHES OF THE TRUE VINE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>BEING FOR FRUIT-BEARING</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John 15 presents a full picture of the organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How good, how miraculous, how wonderful, and how excellent it is that we all are a part of this organism!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is here as this organism, and we are included in this organism.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is the tree, and we are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As far as we, the branches, are concerned, the tree lives to be our support, our supply, and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The tree in its entirety is not for itself but for the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Also, the tree does everything through the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The tree needs the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It cannot do anything apart from the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today Christ as the very embodiment of the Triune God can do nothing without us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Without us Christ is unable to act, to work, or to have any kind of activity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Triune God is in the tree, and the tree is within the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Where is the Triune God today?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Triune God today is in Christ, and this very Christ is the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Where is Christ, the vine tree?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is within the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Without the branches, the tree cannot express itself or do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In John 15:5 the Lord says, Apart from Me you can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As the branches of Christ, we can say the same thing to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Without Him, we can do nothing, and without us, He can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We surely need Him, and He surely needs us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The branches need the tree, and the tree needs the branches for what purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is not only for the purpose of our enjoying the wonderful, excellent, and marvelous divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Eventually, the purpose of this divine organism is fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Fruit-bearing is the multiplication and the enlargement of this divine tree, the divine organism of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We all have to be the fruitful branches of this vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Fruit-bearing is the unique and particular characteristic of all the branches of the divine organism.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All of us need a new start, a new turn, so we all have to consecrate ourselves anew.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all need a renewed consecration for the purpose of fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Suppose a branch of a vine tree only bears one piece of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This branch will not look very nice because the branches of a vine tree should bear clusters of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As branches of Christ, we have to bear clusters of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The branches of the true vine are for fruit-bearing John 15:5 , and the purpose of the Lord s choosing of the branches is for fruit-bearing v. 16a . A vine tree has branches for the unique purpose of bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A pine tree is good for building material and good as fuel for burning, but not a vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A vine tree is good for only one purpose the purpose of bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have been chosen as the branches of Christ for the unique purpose of bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many of us have to admit, however, that instead of bearing fruit, we have been barren for years.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is why I was compelled to study our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I realized that we had to find a way to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We need to abide in the vine to receive the life supply for fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord chose us for fruit-bearing, and our abiding in Him is also for fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>First we receive the life supply by abiding in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then we will grow with this life supply to produce fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The branches of the vine bear fruit for the glorification of the Father for the multiplication of the Father in the Son John 15:8; 12:24, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In John 15:8 the Lord said, In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Glorification means multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>A single grain of wheat by itself has no glory.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But when it dies in the earth, grows up, and bears many grains, these many grains are the one grain s glory, the glorification of the one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This glorification is the multiplication and expression of the one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>At one time, Christ was the only grain.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But He, as the one grain, passed through death and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In resurrection, He was multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The death and resurrection of the one grain issued in many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When Christ was resurrected, we all were resurrected in Him and with Him Eph 2:6; 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It was not only the individual Christ who was resurrected, but a corporate Christ with His many members.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Before the grain is sown into the earth and dies, it is alone.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But when this one grain grows up from the earth, it bears fruit and becomes many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The many grains are Christ s multiplication as His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We believers are the many grains as Christ s multiplication and His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When the Lord was walking in Judea and working in Jerusalem, He was the only grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But after His resurrection and through His propagation, we are here as His glorification, which is His multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We are the multiplication of that unique grain.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Christ is glorified in His multiplication, and we together with all the believers on this earth are His multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The glorification of the Father is the multiplication of the Father in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>For this purpose the Father prunes the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>His pruning is for the fruit-bearing of the branches John 15:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When we are praying and making a thorough confession, that confession is the practical and actual pruning.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The more we confess to God the Father, the more we will get pruned.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Have we ever realized that our confession of sins is a pruning?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>God the Father prunes us by showing us all our defects, failures, and wrongdoings, that we may make a thorough confession to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Through this thorough confession, we are cleansed from our defects, imperfections, defeats, failures, wrongdoings, mistakes, and sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Many Christians only realize that God prunes us by chastising us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I am not saying that this is wrong, but God does not prune us mainly by chastising us.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Whenever we make a thorough confession, we have the sensation that we are so clean and cleared up from many negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The Father shines over us and exposes our defects and sinfulness under His divine light.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Our confession of everything exposed through His divine light is our cooperation with the Father s pruning.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Suppose that you, as a branch of Christ, go out to visit people without having a thorough confession, without the pruning.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Then it will be hard for you to bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This is why we all need to make a thorough confession, which is our cooperation with the Father s pruning.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We need to be pruned daily, time after time.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Just as we wash our hands many times throughout the day, we need to be pruned many times.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>To be pruned is to be washed.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>From morning to evening, we need to make confessions again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Every confession is a washing, and every washing is a pruning.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The word prunes in John 15:2 is literally translated cleanses.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>As branches, when we are pruned, we are washed and cleansed through our confession according to God s exposing.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>When we come to Him, we are exposed under His light because He is light 1 John 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Our confession accomplishes or completes the Father s pruning.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Then we become clean, new, and fresh, and it is so easy for us as a clean, new, and fresh branch to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The danger of not bearing fruit is to be cut off from the enjoyment of the vine John 15:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>The Lord says clearly that if we are branches not bearing fruit, we are in danger of being cut off from the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>This does not mean that we will suffer eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>To be cut off from Christ here is to be cut off from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>As the branches abide in the vine tree, they enjoy its life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>If a branch is cut off from the vine tree, it is cut off from enjoying the riches of the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>When we are barren, not bearing fruit, we have the sensation that we are not enjoying Christ that much.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>There is hardly any enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>This indicates that we have been cut off from the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>I have received many letters telling me that visiting people for the gospel not only saved sinners but also revived the visiting ones.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>This means that visiting people for the gospel by knocking on their doors revives our enjoyment of the rich Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Many saints have testified that going out to visit people in this way revived them to contact Christ, enjoy Christ, and absorb all the riches out from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>This is the recovery of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ for bearing fruit.</S>
