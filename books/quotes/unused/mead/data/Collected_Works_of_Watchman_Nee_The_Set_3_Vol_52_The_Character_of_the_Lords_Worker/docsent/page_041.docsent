   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE TOWARDS MONEY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What should be the attitude of a Christian worker, a servant of God, towards money?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is quite a serious question, and unless a worker has a definite breakthrough in this matter, he cannot work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If a worker has a problem towards money, he cannot go very far.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A worker finds frequent occasions to touch money.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is at stake, therefore, is a very fundamental question.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Mammon stands in opposition to God, and we should reject its influence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the proper Christian view towards money.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must be on the alert lest we come under its power.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No worker who is bound by the power of mammon can persuade others to be freed from its power.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not possible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are bound and controlled by mammon, it will be impossible for us to help the brothers and sisters to be free of its control and bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A worker should hate laziness, and he should also loathe the power of mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Otherwise, he will be useless in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Money is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let us look at a few things related to money.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>ONE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the first place, let us note the relationship between money and a worker's pathway and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Old Testament there is the history of Balaam, and in the New Testament there is the way and teaching of Balaam.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Balaam is referred to in 2 Peter, Jude, and Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This shows us the amount of attention God pays to Balaam.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Balaam was a prophet who worked for profit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In other words, he commercialized the prophetic ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was not ignorant of his position.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was fully aware of it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He also was not ignorant of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When Balak, the king of Moab, was set to destroy the people of God, Balaam was fully aware that God's people should not be cursed; he knew that they were a people blessed by Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But because he coveted Balak's promise, a promise to satisfy all of his wants, he went to God again and again to ask for permission.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, God granted him the permission.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many people erroneously think that this episode is an example of waiting on God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a matter of fact, Balaam would never have inquired of God at all had it not been for Balak's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He knew quite well that such a trip was not according to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's thought was of blessing and gracious care; His thought was not of cursing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But Balaam inquired of God again and again because he had received a promise from Balak.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Later, God told him to go.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But it was not God's will for him to go; it was God's permission for him to go.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To God, if Balak's offer could generate so much prayer in Balaam, He would simply tell Balaam to go.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Balaam undoubtedly was a prophet, but he allowed money to affect his pathway and lead him far astray.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Any Christian worker who has not resolved the issue of money within himself and who is still bound by the power of money is certain to relate his field of work to money.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When he has to decide where he will work, his decision will surely be influenced by financial support.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He will go where there is financial support, and he will not go where there is no financial support.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His support becomes his guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If he only goes where there is support, surely he will not go to a poor place, or, if he goes at all, he will leave that place after a short period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If another place is rich in support, he will spontaneously be drawn to their support, and he will think that God is leading him there.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some prayers and guidance follow monetary support.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This support becomes the focus of attention.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Profit and money drove Balaam to bother God again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He kept bothering God about whether or not he should go.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Over ten years ago, an elderly brother commented on the lamentable state of Christian affairs, saying, "See how many servants of God are after money!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>So many poor places are short of care, yet so many workers are frequenting big places which are already crowded with people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Is there something wrong with the guidance they have received?"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This was a strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a brother has not dealt with the problem of money, it will not be a surprise at all that his footsteps inevitably will be like those of Balaam.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His pathway will be determined by the amount of his support.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The amount of his support will become the direction for his pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If a place is poor, he will not visit it or will seldom visit it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even if he visits the place, he will leave quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a place is rich in support, he will visit more or will stay there permanently.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Money will become the source of his guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To such ones God can only say, "Go as you wish."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A worker who is not free from the influence of money is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If a worker cannot boast as Paul boasted with regard to money, he is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If a worker cannot be freed from money and its influence, he cannot be a minister of God; his way will surely be Balaam's way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some people are easily touched by money; their pathway is easily affected by money.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As a result, their way is the way of Balaam.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The way of Balaam is simply a way that is dictated by money.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>May the Lord be gracious to us so that we will all be delivered from money.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We do not wish to see any of us becoming a beggar.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May the location of our work not become the spot where we beg.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Once it does, we become a slave to money.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is a pity and shame for God's servant to be led and controlled by money!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is a shame to seek for guidance not by prostrating at God's feet but by following the direction of money!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If a man is not fully delivered from money, he may be deep in money's bondage when he says that he is under God's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is too shameful!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Of course, the matter of money is a very superficial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If the God we believe in is living, we should be able to go anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But if He is not living, we might as well retreat quickly and do nothing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is a shameful thing to preach a living God and yet have our pathway governed by money.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is a great shame!</S>
