Co-kings of Christ</h2><p>We have seen that the believers are priests of Christ. Now we need to see that they are also co-kings of Christ. Those believers who live in the reality of the kingdom in this age will be co-kings with Christ in the millennium.<h2 class=head3>a. In Resurrection</h2><p>It is in resurrection that the believers are co-kings of Christ. Speaking of the overcoming believers, Revelation 20:4c says, &#8220;They lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.&#8221; Here the word &#8220;lived&#8221; means that they were resurrected.<p>Revelation 20:6 says, &#8220;Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection: over these the second death has no authority; but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with Him a thousand years.&#8221; The first resurrection here is the best resurrection. The Greek word translated &#8220;first&#8221; is the same word rendered &#8220;best&#8221; in Luke 15:22, where the father commanded that the best robe be put on the returned prodigal. Hence, the first resurrection in Revelation 20:6 may actually be translated &#8220;the best resurrection.&#8221; Those who are co-kings of Christ will enjoy this resurrection. The first resurrection is also the out-resurrection, for which Paul sought (Phil. 3:11). This is a resurrection that is set apart from the common resurrection; it is a resurrection with honor. This is a resurrection of kingship as a reward to the overcoming believers. Hence, the first resurrection is also the resurrection of reward.<p>Revelation 20:6a says, &#8220;Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection.&#8221; This must be the highest blessing-to inherit the kingdom manifested on earth and even to be co-kings of Christ in it.<h2 class=head3>b. In the Consummation of Their Maturity in the Divine Life</h2><p>Being co-kings of Christ is in the consummation of the believers&#8217; maturity in the divine life. Until we reach maturity in the divine life we are like young princes, those who are too young to be kings. A king must be a matured person. Before a prince can be a king, he needs to grow and mature in the kingly life. Then he will be qualified to be a king. Likewise, we need to grow in the resurrection life. Eventually, this growth will reach the consummation of maturity in the divine life. Once we have reached this maturity we shall be qualified to be co-kings of Christ.<p>Second Timothy 2:12a says, &#8220;If we endure, we shall also reign with Him.&#8221; This verse implies being a co-king of Christ in the consummation of maturity in the divine life. If we endure in this age, we shall reign with Christ in the coming age.<h2 class=head3>c. Reigning Over the Nations and Shepherding Them on Earth</h2><p>Those who are co-kings of Christ will reign over the nations and shepherd them on earth. Revelation 2:26 and 27 say, &#8220;He who overcomes, and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations, and he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces, as I also have received from My Father.&#8221; Reigning with Christ over the nations is a prize to the overcoming believers. As they reign over the nations, they will shepherd them, for in the millennial kingdom the ruler is the shepherd.<p>In Psalm 2:9 God gave Christ authority to rule over the nations. Here in Revelation 2:26 and 27 Christ gives the same authority to the overcoming believers.<p>Two other verses that speak of the believers reigning over the nations on earth are Revelation 12:5 and 5:10. Revelation 12:5 says that the man-child will &#8220;shepherd all the nations with an iron rod.&#8221; This man-child signifies the stronger part of God&#8217;s people. The fact that the man-child will shepherd the nations with an iron rod indicates that the man-child consists of the overcoming believers, as mentioned in Revelation 2:26 and 27. Furthermore, Revelation 5:10 says that the believers will reign on the earth.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 099-113) &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
