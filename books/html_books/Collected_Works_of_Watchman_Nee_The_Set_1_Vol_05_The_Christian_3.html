Prophetically speaking, Ephesus, Smyrna, and Pergamos are a historical representation of three aspects of the whole church. Thyatira also represents one period of the church. However, Thyatira is different from the previous three churches which supersede one another and were raised up consecutively. Thyatira came after Pergamos, yet she remains until this day. Ephesus, Smyrna, and Pergamos have in reality passed away and have become churches in history. However, Thyatira, which comes after Pergamos, does not pass away like the other three churches. It remains until the Lord comes back (v. 25). Although after Thyatira there is still Sardis, the church in Sardis does not replace Thyatira or supersede it. On the one hand the church in Sardis comes in. On the other hand, the church in Thyatira still remains.</P><P>We have seen how the church in Ephesus represents the church after the time of the apostles, how Smyrna represents the suffering church after this, and how Pergamos represents the corrupted church that was welcomed by the Roman emperor. Historically, Thyatira represents the Roman Catholic Church in the Middle Ages, which continued until the time of the Reformation. Here the Lord Jesus is revealing Himself as the Son of God. He reveals His person and His discerning power, how He walks in the midst of the churches, and how He searches man's inward parts and heart. In revealing Himself in this way, we can find out the condition of the church. In Ephesus, although there was no apparent failure before men, in the Lord's eyes the first love and the first works were forsaken already. After this, the Lord detected the teaching of the Nicolaitans in Smyrna. Still after this, in Pergamos, the church began openly to be mingled with the world. The church began to live in the world and housed many heresies in it. Now in Thyatira we see how the children of Jezebel are allowed to remain in the church. This gradual apostasy of the church and steady increase in sin are all under the Lord's searching!</P><P>In all previous letters, the Lord did not mention His name, but in this letter the Lord mentions His name for the first time. What John saw was the Son of Man, yet here He declares Himself to be the Son of God. Here, as in His revelation to John in chapter one, He unfolds His own nature. It mentions here His eyes, which are like a flame of fire. As such they can search out all sins and can put fear into the sinners. His feet are like shining bronze, which are for His vengeance. Everything that His eyes condemn will be trampled by His feet. Here it says that the Lord's feet are as bronze, for bronze is the hardest and strongest of all metals. Micah 4:13 says: "Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass [bronze]: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people."</P><P>Here, unlike in Pergamos, He does not appear as "He who has the sharp two-edged sword." We know that the sword is God's word of judgment. The Lord Himself said, "He who rejects Me and does not receive My words has one who judges him; the word which I have spoken, that will judge him in the last day" (John 12:48). In chapter nineteen we see how the sharp sword that comes out of His mouth slays many. Here, however, the word is merely a prophecy of judgment alone. At the time of Pergamos, He was still reminding men of this word, warning men of the future judgment, and piercing to the dividing of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, so that all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we are accountable (Heb. 4:12-13). Although many have rebelled against God's word in Pergamos, the same word testified against them in Pergamos. However, in Thyatira, there is no more word. What we hear now is just the teaching of Jezebel. Her disciples consider her words to be from the prophets, clearer and more sure than the teaching of the Bible. Man considers the word of the church more reliable than the words of God. This is why we do not see the Lord Jesus speaking as the One who has the sharp two-edged sword. Rather, He reveals Himself as "the Son of God." Here He is executing His authority and dealing with a church that has raised itself to an inordinate position. Now He is unveiling Himself as God. Only He has eyes as a flame of fire. Besides Him there is no one who has the real holy and clear insight. Furthermore, only He, the One with feet like shining bronze, is able to execute the overpowering judgment.</P><P>Up to this point, He must reveal His own person, because the one who calls herself the bride has contemptuously lowered His status. The church has abused the Lord's humility, grace, and incarnation by putting Him under a human mother. It reckons that since He is called God, Mary must be "the mother of God." The teaching of the Roman Catholic Church greatly depreciates the Lord Jesus and ranks Him as one of the many mediators and interceding saints. The foremost among all these saints is the "queen of heaven." The Roman Catholic Church claims that her heart is more compassionate than the heart of Jesus! Thyatira, the type of the Roman Catholic Church, says that the Lord Jesus is the son of Mary. However, the Lord Jesus revealed Himself as the Son of God.</P><P>Since man has confused the authority of the church with His own authority, He is here revealing His own status as the Son of God. His eyes are like a flame of fire. Is the church the same as He is? He has feet like shining bronze. Does the church have the same? If what it binds on earth must be bound in heaven, as the Roman Catholic Church claims, can it bind up God's throne just by its command? Can God's omniscience be compared to the childish babbling of the church? Can God's holiness be compatible with the church's sins and weaknesses? Although this passage refers specifically to the Roman Catholic Church, we know that the Lord's word is also addressed to all those who champion the authority of the church. The Lord is revealing His own qualifications to those who are uplifting the church. He reveals His own qualifications in this way to show others that the church is not qualified. He alone is the Son of God. He occupies a position which His people can never attain. He has a glory which no one else can ever share. He alone is the Head of the church. The church is His Body. He deserves to have all the rights to rule over everything. Although He has a very close relationship with the church, the church nevertheless can only remain as the submitting one. It is always under Him. In the same way that the body submits to the head, the church should submit to the Son of God.</P><P>The Lord Jesus is the Son of God. As such He is sitting on the throne of His Father. This shows Him in His Godhead. No other creature on earth can share with Him in this respect. Later, in His words to Laodicea, He indicates this: "He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne" (3:21). In the future the overcoming saints will sit with the Lord Jesus on His throne. However, they will not be able to sit on the Father's throne. At the beginning of this book, John saw the Lord Jesus like the Son of Man. Soon, He will receive His throne in His status as the Son of Man. Both He and His redeemed ones can sit on this throne. Yet this is something for the future. Before that day comes, these ones should fight for the Lord and should labor and strive to overcome in the battlefield, as He has overcome. This teaching shatters Thyatira's dream! According to the teaching of this Scripture, how can the church exercise authority in this age? Either the Roman Catholic Church hopes to exercise authority before Christ exercises His, or it hopes to sit with Christ on the throne of God the Father and exercise authority from there. What an absurdity this is! This is why the Lord Jesus purposely reveals Himself here as the Son of God.</P><P>Matthew 18:18 says: "Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven." We must realize that this word does not refer to the authority of the church in the world. This verse refers to the matter of the excommunication of the saints. We can see this fact from the context of Matthew 18. This act of excommunication is an act originating from the zeal of God's people concerning His holiness. God's goal towards His people is to have them express His holiness in a definite way. If some among them fail, the rest should bear the responsibility before God to execute God's command of excommunicating the sinful saints. If God's children act according to His commands, God will be with them. Whatever they bind, God will also bind, and whatever they loose, God will also loose. No one can bind anything apart from the word of God. No one is commissioned exclusively by the Lord to open up His word. If anyone obeys God's word, God will work with him. Authority is with the word of God; it is not with the people. If a person has no guidance from God's word, yet Christ binds and looses according to him while he continues in his disobedience to God's word, such binding and loosing is to shame Himself.</P><P>Hence, all authority of the church, unless derived from an obedience to God's word, is rebellion to Christ. No one can serve two masters. Our conscience can be responsible to God alone. All holiness and morality begin from here. If there is any deviation from God's word, no right can be right, and no wrong can be wrong. There will no longer be any distinction between right and wrong. God's purpose is for man to obey His word. It is true that we have to "listen to the church." Yet, it is only when the church is obeying God's word that the saints have a responsibility to obey it. Otherwise, to obey the church is to rebel against God. All those who are telling others to listen to the church without listening to the Bible are under the teaching of Thyatira. They should listen to what the Lord says, that He is "the Son of God" and that He alone has eyes like a flame of fire.</P><P>Even now, only the Son of God has eyes like a flame of fire. We have to be careful about how and what we hear. Other than His word, nothing should have any authority to dominate us. Because Thyatira has forgotten that the Lord is the One with the sharp two-edged sword, He reminds them that He is the One with eyes like a flame of fire and feet like shining bronze, which trample under them anything that His eyes do not approve of.</P><P>In spite of this, the faithful saints in Thyatira can receive consolation through this title. Particularly if we look into the place of the Son of God in the Bible, we will find the meaning of this title here. In John 5 we see how as the Son of God He is the source of life and the life-giver. Since the life we receive from the Lord Jesus through faith is so powerful, even when the body that contains this life dies, it will still resurrect to receive eternal life. However, those bodies that do not have this life will resurrect to judgment (5:29). Not only will we receive eternal life in the future, we even now have eternal life already (v. 24). Although we must all stand before the judgment seat, that judgment seat of Christ will not determine whether we will have eternal life or not. Rather, it is because we have life that we will have to stand before the judgment seat of Christ. The judgment there is not to determine if we have life or not. It is to determine our position in glory. Although some will have their works completely burned, the life they possess is common to all those standing before the judgment seat. This is the minimum requirement. If we think that one must wait until he dies before he can know if he has life, even though he has believed in the Lord Jesus already, it is a shame to the grace of the Lord. He said that when we believe in Him we have life. If we believe in Him, surely we will have life.</P><P>As the Son of God, the Lord Jesus not only gives us life but freedom as well. In John 8:36 He says, "If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed." Freedom and life are what the Lord Jesus gives to us as the Son of God. However, this does not mean that everyone who has life is free. Often we see many people who have life, yet they are still bound by many things. This is the experience of the person in Romans 7. He surely had life already. Yet in experience he was like a slave. He sighed, "I am fleshy, sold under sin...Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?" (vv. 14, 24). However, he was freed in Christ. Hence, he said: "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death" (Rom. 8:2).</P><P>As the Son of God, the Lord Jesus gives us life and freedom. He died for us and bore our sins. As a result we have life. He was crucified with us, so that we die to sin with Him. As a result we are free. Everyone who has life can be free, because this is the Lord's gift to us as the Son of God. When we believe in the only begotten Son of God, we become the sons of God. As sons of God, we are in the Father's house and are completely free.</P><P>Having seen this, we will realize the preciousness of the name of the Lord Jesus as the Son of God. He uses this name in order to show the saints in the apostate Thyatira the rich grace He has reserved for them. All those who follow the teaching of Jezebel receive but death and bondage. Those who follow the Son of God receive life and freedom. Although this title serves as a warning to the apostate church, it serves equally as a reminder of the Lord's power to His faithful children.</P><P>However, we have to know that although the Lord Jesus reveals Himself as the Son of God here, His intention was not to reveal Himself as the Son of God who gives life and freedom, but the Son of God who executes judgment. The present situation is very different from that in the ancient times. Other than judgment, there is no other way now. The church is too deep in degradation already; the only thing left for it is judgment. His eyes search all things, and His feet trample all things. Both of these speak of the judgment of the Son of God. How dignified He is in revealing Himself in this way!</P><P>As the Son of God He has the authority to rule over His own house. This is what Hebrews 3:6 reveals to us. He is ruling over His whole house in the status of the Son. Hence, although it mentions Him here as the Son of God, it also mentions His eyes being like a flame of fire, for He is the one who searches all things and discerns all things. As such He can freely execute His authority. His feet are like the shining bronze, which also signifies His authority. Bronze is a symbol of judgment. Hence, this signifies His firm attitude toward sin and His dealing with sin according to God's righteousness. If we consider the bronze altar in the Old Testament and the bronze serpent in the wilderness, we will know the meaning of bronze. It means God's requirement of man's responsibility before Him according to His righteousness. Among the Israelites, all those who wanted to be saved and draw nigh to God had to satisfy God's righteous requirement through the offerings.</P><P>Hence, the nature of Christ as mentioned here demands our utmost, solemn attention. This does not mean that He is now annulling His former relationship with the church in grace. Neither does it mean that His love has diminished at all towards His people. The emphasis here is His manifestation of Himself in dealing with the condition of a church in apostasy. The church should be His light and testimony in the world. In dealing with it, He is questioning whether it is in fact a light and a testimony for Him. Since the church has forsaken His authority, it has on the one hand lost its light and its testimony, and on the other hand become proud and arrogant and has forgotten that its position is but that of a slave. It has instead assumed itself to be the master. It is for this reason that the Lord told them that He is the Son of God and has the full authority to rule over His own house. All their conduct will be judged by Him. The Lord wants them to remember His all-searching and all-judging power and that He will not easily overlook sin. As long as the church is responsible for the testimony of the Lord on earth, such a nature of the Lord remains. No matter how much it has failed and lost its testimony, its responsibility before God does not change. This is true not only with the whole church but is also true with certain individuals. If we forget this fact, we will incur judgment from the Lord.</P><P>In considering the way the Lord addressed Thyatira, we realize that it has failed. The few churches that we have seen are all degrading. Thyatira is no exception. We can say that Thyatira is the most degraded of them all. When the church leaves its first love, becomes Judaistic, and receives honor in the world, it is unavoidable that it will lose its heavenly, holy, and separating characteristics. The world was never so victorious as it is now. With the erecting of a cross and the mere performance of baptism, the whole Roman population becomes the children of God! Nominally, surely Christianity has fully prevailed. Actually, this is only a cover-up of heathen teachings with Christian terminologies. We can imagine how great a loss the church suffers and how much shame the Lord bears when the church embraces the world's pitying love and turns its hope of the coming glory in the midst of earthly suffering into present greatness! Yet all the while they are boasting that they have now received the power and are able to Christianize the world. How pitiful this is! However, this was only the situation in Pergamos. By Thyatira, the darkness had deepened. This is the inevitable consequence when the heart has turned to the temporary enjoyment of sin. How can there not be a degradation when the emperor adorns himself with the cross, turning the cross of suffering into a cross of silver and gold, and when God's children receive special privileges from the government, having no more need to roam about in camel or goat skins or to hide in caves, but are instead admired by their adversaries for their positions? When Balaam's teaching prevails, spontaneously man will sacrifice the truth for the sake of wealth. By then, naturally Jezebel will have the opportunity to be the lord of all things and will be able to kill and persecute those who truly belong to God. Such a blood-shedding and idol-worshipping prophetess has indeed become the queen of the world in this dark age. Such a beginning surely will lead to such an ending. This age is known in history as the Dark Ages. According to the Lord's view, it was indeed dark!</P><P>Although the Lord's eyes were severe as a flame of fire, He is still the Son of Man, full of boundless mercy and lovingkindness. How wonderful it is that we can communicate with such a Lord. What joy it is that we can stand before Him. Although we are now in the midst of Thyatira and in a condition of corruption and sin, we see the Lord doing His best to enumerate the merits of His people. He loves mercy and not judgment. He tries His best to praise the least bit of goodness. Although it is such a corrupt church there, the Lord sees many things worthy of praise. Although the general condition tends to become darker all the time, the genuine believers become more zealous all the time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE NINETEEN</H2><P>Verse 19:"I know your works and love and faith and service and your endurance and that your last works are more than the first." </P><P>The Son of God is now turning His attention to the work of His church. First He mentions love, because love is the first item among all good works. The church has not lost its love. Hence, the Lord praises it. Neither has it lost the facts and the doctrines that the Lord has revealed to it. Hence, the Lord praises its faith. It is also diligent in supplying the physical and spiritual need of others. Furthermore, in the matter of endurance, it is especially commendable. In the original language there is the word "your" before the word endurance. The Lord's purpose is to particularly commend its endurance. This is why He says "your endurance," as if to draw others particularly to their endurance. Moreover, it has not diminished in its good works but has increased. This is absolutely different from the church in Ephesus.</P><P>Surely these are not the works of Jezebel and her children. Jezebel is the turning point for the nature of the work of the whole church at that time. When we read on, we will see that these works were inherited from the church at that time; they have nothing to do with Jezebel. Before He rebukes them, He first gathers all their bright works and commends them. Because the background at that time was so dark, these works shine out all the more brightly.</P><P>We know that the church in Thyatira refers to the age of the Roman Catholic Church in the Middles Ages. We must never forget this point. Otherwise, we will not be able to understand much of what is covered in this letter. Since Thyatira is the church of the Dark Ages in the Middles Ages, how can the Lord have so many praises for it? We have to remember the biblical principle that when the whole body fails, God reckons the faithful remnant as those who take the place of the whole body before God. For example, at the time of the apostasy of the nation of Judah, God reckoned the remnant of Judah the nation of Judah. The same is true in the church of God. It is according to this principle that our Lord takes the works of the faithful believers in Thyatira to be the work of the whole body in Thyatira.</P><P>It is a joy to think that there was such love, faith, and work at that time in the Dark Ages. Many writings have been handed down to us that show us how these ones loved the Lord and suffered for the Lord. Although these extant writings are few, they can fairly represent the work of the minority of saints in the church at that time. We know, of course, that there were many other believers who loved the Lord and likewise suffered for Him but who are unknown to us because they were not able to write. We also know that many writings are lost and are no longer available to us. In conclusion, in such a dark time it is amazing that these ones could have such works. The darker the hour, the more precious the faithful works done for the Lord become.</P><P>We can say that stories of the believers in the Middle Ages are most interesting. They are also very moving. Their faithfulness in loving the Lord, in standing for the truth, and their determination of opposition to a heretical church are most sincere. Although they suffered, labored, and were threatened and persecuted, although they suffered much more than those under the Roman emperors suffered, although they did not witness any miracles and wonders or have any organization or group to back them up, and although the people and the priests of the time invented many condemnations against them, they marched on fearlessly to maintain God's testimony and were willing to sacrifice all comfort, their families, lives, and everything in the world to testify for the Son of God that the power of Hades would not be able to overcome the church. Christ knew all these things. Although they were at times weak, and their concepts were wrong in many things, and although Satan used all his wiles to mix errors with their good works and was sometimes quite successful at that, their works were recorded in heaven and were commended by Christ. While the writings of many world-lovers and comfort-seekers have disappeared and turned into dust, the record of the believers' works is shining brightly in heaven. This is the way the Lord commended the saints in Thyatira. They were not among those in the church then and are not among those who are wise now. They are just the ones who are totally for Christ. We have to take note of the Lord's commendation of Thyatira. It does not mean that everyone in Thyatira had such good works. Rather, it was only those faithful ones in Thyatira that had these good works. This is what is revealed in verse 24: "But I say to you-the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this teaching...." Clearly the Lord has separated the whole body in Thyatira from the remnant in Thyatira. If we notice the order of the Lord's word here, we will be clearer concerning this matter. The works of the whole body in Thyatira were the works of the Pope. Yet his works before God had no merit. However, the Lord Jesus is here commending one kind of work. It is then very clear that this kind of work is not the works of the Pope.</P><P>The Lord Jesus mentions love first because love is God's nature. Hence, love is the motive behind all spiritual works. After this, the Lord mentions faith, the faith which issues forth from love. Later the Lord mentions service, endurance, and good works. When believers increase in their love and good works in the midst of the fires that befall them, they receive the Lord's commendation. The whole body of Thyatira has followed the teaching of the Pope. They have reckoned work to be of merit before God for their salvation. This is totally different from the order presented here. There must first be love, then faith, and then afterwards service and good works.</P><P>Hence, when we read of the Lord's word of praise, we should distinguish the ones to whom these words were addressed from Jezebel and her children. Although we know little of how these ones walked humbly and secretly with God at the time when the Roman Catholic Church was dominating everything and the Pope had haughtily placed himself in an improper position, the most comforting thing is to see that Christ fully acknowledged their good faith and declared it before all men. Although many believers at that time were wrongly accused and were branded as heretics, and although many believers were given the meanest and most frightening judgment by the Roman Catholic Church, at the day when the Lord of judgment appears, they will receive their rightful crown. Jezebel was constantly testifying against God's Naboth, condemning him as having "blaspheme[d] God and the king" (1 Kings 21:10). Yet, for what reason was she doing this? Was it not for the reason that he would not sell his possession for a small price? All those who will not sell their possession for a small price in the world will be slandered as being blasphemous to God and the king and will be "stoned to death." Under these circumstances, can one imagine what kind of trials there were for the works, love, and faith of these nameless, or rather "ill-famed" Thyatiran believers? How is it that under such discouraging circumstances they were still so diligent? For one to be able to endure under such circumstances is true endurance indeed!</P><P>However, their highest attainment had not been achieved yet. God's work of power is unlike man's feeble struggling. Their last works were not only a match to the first; their "last works are more than the first." Under such adverse circumstances where all the powerful rulers of the world rose up to oppose them, it was difficult enough to maintain the same attitude as before. Yet what they did was more than before. This is indeed a growth. Thank and praise the Lord that He has given us eternal life and that with this life there is the divine power. As such, it is unavoidable that it grows. Although the bondages are strong, He is able to break them all. Although He is tightly shut up, He breaks out from within. The Holy Spirit is indeed powerful in our lives. Is there any hindrance in the world that can stop us from advancing for the Lord? All the sojourners who have passed the valley of Baca (the valley of tears, Psa. 84:6) will go from strength to strength, for the power of Christ is made perfect in weaknesses.</P><P>If we read the history of the day, we will see that the zeal of these enduring witnesses increased day by day. The light they received increased day by day, and their boldness also increased more and more. The Reformation that happened later was not a sudden occurrence. There were many forerunners before the Reformation already. Although one died, another was raised up. The torch of truth was transferred from one hand to another, and the more time went on, the brighter the torch became. Furthermore, the teaching of separation became more and more apparent as time went on. This is the greatest and the most crucial point, because when we read on, we find the Lord Jesus rebuking the saints for the reason that they had tolerated the teaching of Jezebel. Although sin increased and pressures mounted, the voice of testimony of those who opposed this kind of work became louder. It was this gradual increase that eventually made the success of the Reformation possible.</P><P>Although they were full of power and zealous works, among them the greatest sin was already at work. Although the Lord gladly acknowledged their abundant goodness, the most shameful thing existed among them. Although the Lord did praise them, He could not refrain from rebuking them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE TWENTY</H2><P>Verse 20:"But I have something against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself a prophetess and teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices."</P><P>Jezebel was a heathen queen. She induced her husband to worship idols and changed the ordinances concerning the Israelites' way of worship. She persecuted those who worshipped Jehovah and led the Israelites astray to worship Baal. Baal was the enticer outside the church. It typifies the world as the one enticing the church. Jezebel, on the other hand, was the enticer within the church. She typified the church being shamelessly joined to the world and idols. Although there was not much difference between the sin of Baal and Jezebel, their positions were entirely different. Jezebel was within the church. Hence, the sins she committed were much more severe than those of Baal outside the church. In Pergamos there were only "individuals" who sinned. Although the number of "individuals" might have been many, yet the "whole body" of the church was free. In Thyatira, only "individuals" were free from sin, and while this number of "individuals" was not small, the "whole body" of the church was defiled.</P><P>What was the special characteristic of the church in Thyatira? What made it different was that it allowed a woman who called herself a prophetess and who assumed to have inspiration from God to teach there. Jezebel reminds us of the Israelites worshipping idols and God's servant and His people being persecuted in the old days. She was an outsider, yet she reigned among God's people. This is why the Lord said, "She teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices."</P><P>God's servants often compare the seven parables in Matthew 13 with the seven letters in Revelation 2 and 3. The result of their study is that the seven parables and the seven letters are parallel and correspond with each other. Because of the shortage of space, we did not make the comparison between the first three letters and the first three parables. However, we know that the seven parables in Matthew 13 are prophecies concerning what will happen in the kingdom of the heavens during the time between the first and second comings of the Lord Jesus. The seven letters in Revelation also speak of the journey the church goes through from the time it was established until the second coming of the Lord. Since the parables and the letters in these two passages both speak of things of this age, we have to consider their similarities here. We have no time now to consider the other parables and how they correspond with the letters in Revelation 2 and 3. Here we will only consider the fourth parable, that of leaven in the flour, and how this parable corresponds to the fourth letter sent to those in Thyatira.</P><P>In the fourth parable the main character is a woman. In this fourth letter that we are considering the main character is also a woman. If we study carefully, we will see that these two women are the same woman. Although many people have different interpretations of this parable, if we take the way of interpreting the Scripture with the Scripture, we will readily find out the meaning of this parable. First let us study this parable, and then we will compare it with the letter we are considering. We have to remember that both passages are spoken by the Lord Jesus Himself.</P><P>"Another parable He spoke to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened" (Matt. 13:33). We know how many people have explained this parable. They consider the gospel as the leaven with a potential nature to affect everything that comes into contact with it. The world is like the lump of meal. When the gospel is preached, it will be fully victorious in the end, and the whole world will be influenced by the gospel. This kind of interpretation is of course very much welcomed. However, allow me to investigate without controversy by referencing other parts of the Scripture to find out if this is indeed what the Bible promises. Before going on, let me ask one question: what does the Lord Jesus mean when He says that the kingdom of the heavens is like leaven? If the Lord Jesus compares the kingdom of the heavens to leaven, then we must conclude that leaven is something good. If that is the case, then surely the kingdom of the heavens will gradually spread throughout the whole earth, and leaven leavens the whole lump. However, if we study carefully, we will find out that the question cannot be settled this way.</P><P>"The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven." If we read this sentence alone, we will think that this leaven typifies the kingdom of the heavens, but if we read through this chapter and compare this parable with the other parables, we will not be so bold to say that the Lord intends to use leaven to typify the kingdom of the heavens. For example, in reading the second parable, one may ask if the kingdom of the heavens refers to the sower that sows the good seed or to the whole parable with its different kinds of people and their different kinds of endings. Take another example: if we take the leaven as a symbol of the kingdom of the heavens and apply this principle to the fifth parable, then in the kingdom of the heavens there will be the treasure, instead of the person that has found the treasure. Furthermore, in the sixth parable, the kingdom of the heavens will be the man that has found the good pearl, instead of the pearl itself. Does this then sound unreasonable? Therefore, the kingdom of the heavens must refer to the whole parable and not just one point of the parable. This does not mean that everything said in the parable is positive. While it is true that in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens there is no evil, at the present time there are many counterfeits, and as such, there are many negative things. This is why when the man sleeps, the enemy can come in and sow the tares among the wheat. Furthermore, in the first three parables, each subsequent sin mentioned is greater than the preceding one. The first parable mentions the partial failure of some good seeds. The second parable mentions the enemy's sowing the bad seed. The third parable mentions how the smallest seed can grow to be the biggest tree under which evil spirits in the air can lodge themselves. If the fourth parable here speaks of the victory of the gospel, it would not follow the same line as the first three parables, but would instead be contradictory to them!</P><P>If we are willing to allow the Scripture itself to expound the meaning of this parable, we will see that every point in this parable is very meaningful. From Leviticus 2 we can find the help to explain this parable. The fine flour in the meal offering is the three measures of meal referred to here. It should not contain any leaven (v. 11). Hence, the crucial point here is that the woman has done something that God has forbidden. She ought not to have done this! In this way we see that this parable is the same in spirit as the first three parables. Sin has become more serious and more hidden here than in the first three parables. The meal offering typifies Christ as the bread of life and as food for the priests of God. To put leaven in the meal is to change the nature of Christ. What the woman is doing is a symbol of what renowned churches are now doing.</P><P>This is an important point, and we must spend more time to consider this. In the Old Testament there was a feast, the Feast of the Unleavened Bread. At this feast the Jews were to eat unleavened bread for seven days. In the first day all leaven had to be removed from their houses. From the first day to the seventh, anyone who ate of leavened bread would be removed from the Israelites. Even while our Lord was on earth, the Jews were still keeping this feast according to the letter. When the Lord Jesus mentioned this parable, the Jewish disciples could very easily understand the meaning of this leaven because the practice and work of removing leaven was so common and widespread among them already. Judging from the act of removing the leaven at the feast, the leaven must refer to something negative. The Jews who were listening to the Lord's parable knew definitely that no leaven could be used in the meal offering. Moreover, God clearly forbade that any offering offered to Him by fire contain leaven. It was not hard for the audience of that day to understand the meaning of leaven.</P><P>If we read through all the passages in the Bible that refer to leaven, we can see that in no place is leaven referred to as something positive. The passage that we are considering now is no exception. If we put this parable together with the preceding three parables, we can see that leaven here is not positive. Moreover, when we consider the Lord's own definition of leaven, we have no choice but to consider leaven as negative. Leaven refers to the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees (Matt. 16:12).</P><P>Christ is our spiritual food, dispensed to us through teachings or doctrines. The Bible often considers the Word as food. We can receive it by faith to meet our need. Christ is the truth. We enjoy Christ through the truth. The teaching of the Pharisees pays attention to outward forms and self justifications. The teaching of the Sadducees is the teaching of the modernists of today. Both teachings oppose the Christ revealed by God and understood by faith. In Mark 8:15, we see in addition to these two things the leaven of Herod. This is the teaching of fame and fortune. According to the Lord's own word, leaven means lust, the devil, and the world. These combine to corrupt the truth of Christ.</P><P>After understanding the style of this parable, we are reminded that Paul has similar words. The Lord Jesus says, "A woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened." Paul said: "A little leaven leavens the whole lump" (1 Cor. 5:6). After reading these two examples, we have to conclude that these two portions are parallel to and complement one another. However, in 1 Corinthians 5, unlike Matthew 13 where the meaning is hidden, the apostle pointed out the meaning of the leaven. Since these two portions are parallel passages, we can find out the meaning of leaven from 1 Corinthians. In verse eight, the apostle explained to us the meaning of leaven. It means "malice and evil." The meaning of being unleavened is "sincerity and truth." In this way, we can draw a conclusion for our study of the meaning of leaven.</P><P>Why does it say three measures of meal? In the Bible, meal refers to nothing other than Christ. If we read the Old Testament, we will see that three measures of meal is a unit of food. It seems that three measures of meal is the basic unit of food. When Abraham offered hospitality to the heavenly guests, he made unleavened bread out of three measures of meal. If we identify Christ there and in this parable, we will readily understand the meaning of this parable. In His status as the Son of Man, the Lord Jesus gives to us food which abides unto eternal life (John 6:27). Because He is man, He can be the food that we need. However, what is the number of "the man Christ Jesus" (1 Tim. 2:5)? Three is the number of God; it signifies the Triune God and the sufficiency of God. "For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily" (Col. 2:9). Any number smaller than three will not match the truth revealed here.</P><P>The woman here put leaven into the three measures of meal, but who is this woman? No doubt she is the church. In the Bible, a woman is always a type of the church, whether physical or spiritual, but of the two, which one does the woman here typify, the real church or the nominal church? After reading this parable, we will readily find out what church is symbolized by this woman. The previous parable is in the nature of Babylon because the small seed there grows into a big tree, just like Nebuchadnezzar did. This tree is a symbol of the church's reigning in the world. Once it has an inclination to reign, it unavoidably comes under the influence of emperors and kings. It becomes natural for them to adjust ordinances and change doctrines on the church's behalf. At such times, the leaven is put into the three measures of meal.</P><P>The teachings of Christ have fallen into the hand of this woman. She has the power to turn and upset them at will. She can add to them her traditions and ordinances so that these latter become as authoritative as the word of God. She can expound at will and can determine the interpretation of God's word. This is where the leaven lies. The teaching of the church is the leaven. Whatever teachings they are, wherever they are found, and with whatever outward appearance they come, they always quench the Holy Spirit, offend the teaching of God's Word, and set up another master other than the Lord Jesus Christ. However, they come in the name of the Lord and assume His authority. As such, the Lord's people are intimidated from opposing these false commandments.</P><P>Let us now turn back to the woman Jezebel. Her name is very meaningful. We know that the Bible always packs a lot of meaning into a little word. Many times the name of one person can tell us a lot of stories. The name Jezebel, together with the history associated with her, causes one to realize that the Lord is referring not only to the one church in Asia Minor at that day alone, but to a woman in apostasy.</P><P>She was the daughter of the king of Sidon. Through her influence, Ahab was led astray to worship and serve Baal. As such, he "did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him" (1 Kings 16:33). He strongly promoted idolatry among the Israelites. At his table he dined with eight hundred fifty prophets of Baal and Asherah. He was determined to kill Elijah, God's prophet. He murdered Naboth just because the latter was not willing to give up his God-given inheritance. He was indeed the head and the chief instigator of sin among the Israelites at that day. In 1 Kings 21:25-26 it says: "But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up. And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel."</P><P>Before we go on, we have to mention another matter. In Revelation 17 another woman is mentioned. Her name is "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH" (17:5). The woman that we are speaking of now is only the Jezebel in Thyatira. By the time of the great tribulation, she will develop into the woman described in Revelation 17. We will cover that woman when we come to Revelation 17. Now we will only point out the fact that she is the same one as the woman in Thyatira.</P><P>Let us come back to our subject. The words concerning Jezebel here are very simple. It only mentions her as the one "who calls herself a prophetess." The result of such calling is to entice people to fornication and idolatry. When we read history, we do not find Jezebel calling herself a prophetess. She was a queen, an idolatrous queen, but the Jezebel in Thyatira is not a queen. However, if we consider the fact that the Lord promised the overcomers that they would reign over the world, we can deduce that the name Jezebel does contain the sense of a queen. We know that the Lord's promise to the overcomers in the seven letters corresponds to the condition of the churches where these overcomers were. Hence, when we see Christ promising the overcomers to reign in the future, it means that these overcomers were not willing to reign together with the church at that time. That is the reason why the Lord promised them a future reigning. Although only Jezebel's name is mentioned here, it shows that the hypocritical church of that day reigned in the world as Jezebel did. Moreover, with the coming Babylon the Great there is also the reigning. Hence, these two passages are related to one another.</P><P>The hands of Babylon are stained with the blood of the saints. Yet in Thyatira, we do not see the woman stained with blood. However, the name "Jezebel" suggests to us that she was the one who persecuted the faithful people of God. Only when we bear this fact in mind can we fully understand the meaning of this letter. At the same time, although the fourth parable in Matthew does not mention her being the queen or her persecution of others, it does clearly point out the nature of her calling herself a prophetess. Therefore, this letter to Thyatira joins the other two prophecies together, and the three passages combined, Revelation 17, Matthew 13, and this letter, give us a full knowledge concerning the work of this woman.</P><P>Of course, all these things are speaking about the Roman Catholic Church. These are the Lord's evaluation of the Roman Catholic Church. Although man may think that she is not that much wrong, we have to judge her according to the Lord's view and the Lord's valuation. God's judgment is final. In all the things that we will discover in the future, we will see that God's decision never changes. How solemn this is. From the prophecy, that is, from Revelation 17, we see that this woman will reign in the future. The Protestantism that will be in name only will still be under her power. We desire God's children to know God's view concerning her so that they will be careful. The works of Jezebel are worse than that of coveting unrighteous wages. Her sin is greater than that of Babylon. Thyatira here is allowing this woman to teach and to preach the dark, cruel, and idolatrous teachings. She even considers herself to have God's command and God's authority. For her to call herself a prophetess means that she is assuming to speak for God and that God is behind her speaking. However, such sin can never be hidden from the eyes of the Lord. She not only preaches fornication but practices it also. This sin of fornication symbolizes a union with the world. As Israel had committed fornication when it married Canaanites, in the same way, the church and the Christians have committed fornication when they have made friends with the world.</P><P>The second result of her teaching is to eat idol sacrifices. This symbolizes how she is having direct fellowship with Satan. The sacrifices offered by the Gentiles are sacrifices "to demons and not to God" (1 Cor. 10:20). These two things are most offensive to God. In Pergamos only a minority listened to the teaching of Balaam, ate idol sacrifices, or committed fornication, but here in Thyatira the whole body of the church has allowed Jezebel to teach others and to entice them to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices. This is indeed a step-by-step degradation in sin!</P><P>The teaching of Jezebel is the teaching of the church at that time. In these few letters, the Lord warns His people at length that the teaching of the nominal churches on earth today is no longer trustworthy. Although they are supposed to be the Lord's luminaries on earth, in these few letters the Lord warns His children that their teachings are not necessarily safe anymore regarding their soul, regarding the truth, and regarding sanctification. Yet how many are there today who still consider the teachings, ceremonies, and traditions of the church to be full of God's authority and bear God's blessings! Many think that since the church dares to do and to preach these things, they must surely be right! Such people should remember that the Lord has said that Ephesus is fallen, Pergamos is dwelling in Satan's place, Thyatira is following the teaching of Jezebel, Sardis is living in name and dead in reality, and Laodicea will be spewed out of the Lord's mouth. Man considers listening to the church as listening to God, yet this is the basis of the Lord's rebuke! Man thinks that it is obedience to God when he follows the teaching of Jezebel, but actually, Jezebel was not God's prophetess; she only called herself such. The saints should know that in the present church, as revealed to us from the Lord's letters, there are many who have rebelled and forsaken the Lord and who have added to and deleted from the Lord's word at will. Therefore, we must be careful whose teaching we are following now.</P><P>There are three sins of Jezebel. First, she calls herself a prophetess. God's order is that a woman should not teach a man. Even if what is taught is the truth, it is still forbidden (1 Tim. 2:12). Since God considers her a woman, this shows that she does not have the right to teach the truth. Second, although the Jezebel mentioned here is not a physical woman, spiritually speaking, God considers her a woman, which means that she should never teach God's servants. Third, she teaches heresy. Hence, God's people should beware and should not think that they are safe. Even the most steady ones are liable to fall! When one follows man's tradition, it is unavoidable that he be tempted. This woman is not only teaching fornication in doctrine only but is actually tempting others to practice it. With the teachings, there naturally come the works. Many traditional teachings continue until today because there are those who promote them and practice them!</P><P>The word "woman" in many manuscripts is "your wife." If the latter is indeed a better rendering, then we can see further meaning to the word. The words "your wife" mean that this woman is subject to you and is under your authority. Ahab represented the Israelites; he bore the moral responsibility of the Israelites. The messenger of Thyatira is the representative of the church in Thyatira, who also bears the moral responsibility of the church there. The first sin of Ahab was to marry Jezebel and to participate in the worship of Baal. The second sin was to allow her as a Gentile and an idolator to rule over the religious affairs of his country and to call herself a prophetess in a land of God's jurisdiction. This was what was practiced during the period in church history after Pergamos at the height of the Roman Catholic Church. At that time, the church was joined to the world. The Roman Catholic Church claimed to have the authority of God and introduced many idolatrous practices into the church. Actually, historically the Roman Catholic Church was closer to Jezebel than Thyatira of the day. Like Jezebel, the Roman Catholic Church not only introduced to God's people the heathen sins, but also shed the blood of many who refused this introduction. In the Bible there is a great principle that when a woman is introduced as a type, this refers to a condition. If the Bible introduces a man as a type, it refers to the act done under a certain condition. Hence, whether it is rendered a "woman" or "your wife," the significance is the same. Whatever it may be, God holds the messenger responsible for the teaching of Jezebel. Ahab was responsible before God for his country, yet he allowed Jezebel to exercise authority and to teach. As a result, there was apostasy unprecedented in the history of Israel. The name Jezebel suggests that she was the wife of the messenger in the church in Thyatira. This means that she represents the condition of the church at that time. Those who bear the responsibility of the church for Christ should bear the responsibility of such a condition there. The Lord is not only rebuking the existence of such worldly and corrupt teaching in the church, but the assuming of authority of such teaching and the spreading of such in the name of the Lord as the faith of the church!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSES TWENTY-ONE TO TWENTY-THREE</H2><P>Verses 21-23:"And I gave her time that she might repent, and she is not willing to repent of her fornication. Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her, into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works; and her children I will kill with death; and all the churches will know that I am He who searches the inward parts and the hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your works." </P><P>This is the way the persecutors of God's people receive their rightful judgment from the hands of God. When such judgment comes, the heavens will assent and rejoice, saying, "After these things I heard as it were a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah! The salvation and the glory and the power are of our God. For true and righteous are His judgments; for He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and He avenged the blood of His slaves at her hand. And a second time they said, Hallelujah! And her smoke goes up forever and ever" (Rev. 19:1-3). Those who do not have the true mercy would say that God's judgment here is too severe. In addition, He is exhorting God's children at present to "come out of her, My people, that you do not participate in her sins and that you do not receive her plagues" (18:4).</P><P>We know how the works of the Roman Catholic Church are judged. Yet often we do the same works that the Roman Catholic Church is doing! We have to remember that the Bible considers the Roman Catholic Church "THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH" (Rev. 17:5). Although we may reject the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church as a whole, we may adopt the principle of Roman Catholicism! We have to realize that within the shell of Protestantism there are many popish things. Some among them are now even trying to bring about a recovery back to Rome. Many denominations and proposals, though free of the pope, are filled with popish ideas. They consider their teachings as being infallible! Such haughtiness is indeed an echo of the voice of the woman who called herself the prophetess, though the name may not necessarily be called Jezebel!</P><P>Although many present organizations and individuals have not considered their teachings infallible like the Catholic Church does, and although they have not considered the church to be something that should assume high authority in the world, we can still detect the shadow of Roman Catholicism among them. Any group of Christians who considers that its teachings are the teaching of the church and are therefore authoritative, though such a group may not consider itself the unique catholic church on earth or the descendant of Rome, it is already sounding the voice of the woman! Although the name of that woman may not be Jezebel, and although many organizations have no conscious intention to add to God's Word, but are instead willing to accept the leading of God's Word, they consider what their group has or had decided and is now handed to them to be things that saints ought also to keep and honor. Such organizations may not have the name of Rome, yet in reality they are Romish. Concerning this point, almost all of Protestantism is standing on the same ground! Many even consider that without these human creeds and regulations the stability of their faith would become questionable. Of course, we know that there are many modernists who are doing their best to remove all human creeds. Those who do not believe in the Bible have such demands. So do those who do not believe in eternal judgment. Those who believe in Christianity without believing in Christ also have such demands. It is because some have opposed the creeds and the human traditions that the zealous apologists consider these creeds and traditions to be indispensable. We have no time to discuss these matters here, but we can say one thing: according to the Bible, the church should not have any teaching. Other than God's inspired Word, no person or group can have any authoritative teaching. The real teaching is the Holy Spirit teaching from the Bible. Other than the truth, the Bible has nothing else. The false claim of Jezebel is that she has the authority to teach. If you believe in the principle of Jezebel, you cannot stop anyone from following the teaching of Jezebel. If a leader or a group has the authority apart from the Bible to teach, who can then guarantee that he can be inerrant? If he can err, then surely those who follow him can err as well. If the blind leads the blind, will not both fall into the pit?</P><P>However, some say that the present creeds can be proved to be the very teaching of the Bible by many scriptural proofs. Very well. If the Bible teaches what the creeds teach, and if the Bible is as authoritative as the creeds are, why then do we need the creeds in addition to the Bible? Some have conceded that the teachings of the Bible are specific and complete. If the teaching of the Bible is, indeed, so specific, why then is there the need to make it more specific with the creeds? If the Bible is indeed so authoritative, why then is there the need to prove its authority with the creeds? Can the authority of the creeds prove the authority of the Bible? To do this is to put the Bible to shame. It is not to honor the Bible! The Bible testifies of itself: "All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work" (2 Tim. 3:16-17). For man to consider the creeds as authoritative is for him to annul the authority of the Bible! It causes man to take the creeds as the standard instead of taking the Bible as the standard! If unfortunately there are faults in the creeds, man must uphold these faults in the same way that he upholds all the truths, and if there are shortages in the creeds, the Bible will have no opportunity to make up these shortages. Simply put, this way annuls the high place given to the Bible and bars man's conscience from being directly responsible to God. Hence, all God-fearing men should now rise up to oppose all ordinances used by man to replace God's word. Jezebel may seem very wise. She thinks that she herself can teach others. As a result, she becomes dominating over others as well. Her problem lies in the fact that she is not willing to have her counterfeit teachings to be judged by the Word of God itself and to test if her teachings are indeed true or false. She knows that God's inspiration is authoritative. That is why she counterfeits God's inspiration. However, she forgets whether the way she thinks she is inspired is itself something that is warranted by the inspiration of God. She can entertain no questioning of her authority; one must accept it fully. The same is demanded by the Bible; it requires absolute acceptance. It is for this reason that during the past ages there have been numerous tests. The more man tested it, the more obviously the authority of the Bible manifested itself. All true things can withstand tests. Tests will only expose the false things! It is foolishness and superstition to believe in anything Romish. On the contrary, it is wise and very reasonable to believe in the Bible.</P><P>According to the Bible, the church cannot teach. Although the prophets can prophesy, all the others must "discern" (1 Cor. 14:29). Everyone must discern according to God's word. Every conscience must be responsible to God directly. Everyone should be concerned about what is said. Not only should we pay attention to how we hear, we should pay attention to what we hear. This attitude will turn many to trust in God. Many times we are inclined to listen to man's philosophy and traditional teachings, but God's intention is to break us away from these things so that we may come afresh before His word and hear the teaching of the Bible. In this way, what we believe in will not be of man's wisdom but will be of the power of God.</P><P>The teaching of the authority of the church is, of course, most acutely found in the Roman Catholic Church. However, this seed is now sown everywhere and is found almost everywhere. Other than this teaching, there is another Romish practice which is also found almost everywhere. Certainly, the Roman Catholic Church represents the pinnacle of it, but its rudiments are scattered everywhere. This is the practice of the church's occupying a high position in the world. The Roman Catholic Church is, of course, the greatest example of this. Jezebel is a queen. She is not a widow, and she never sees any sorrow. She reigns, and under her feet are the neck of the kings. She takes the Lord's word on future kingship to be her lot in this age: "Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet" (Psa. 91:13). Although many Christians do not believe that they should rule the world like the Catholic Church does, they are nevertheless affected by its poison and consider it right for Christians to play a part in the world arena. To play a part means to take up an office there. Who can be more qualified than Christians to be the kind of persons the world desires? They never consider that before the Lord Jesus came, Satan was already the prince of this age and that everything that this age does is opposed to God and His Son Christ. Only when the Lord Jesus comes again in His power will Satan be driven out and will the world come under His subjection. Actually, if the saints receive power in the world, they will be changed by the world. They will not be able to cleanse the world. Moreover, God's command is that believers must not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. To obtain political status in this way will naturally make those who serve alongside the world lose their position as the children of God.</P><P>We know that the fornication and idolatry taught by Jezebel are the same as the fornications and abominations seen in the great harlot in chapter seventeen. There we see that the kings of the earth commit the sin of fornication with her. Through her corrupt teachings, she has received power and authority in the world, while her Lord has only received a cross and a grave in the same world. It is an unimaginably evil thing that the church wants to gain authority in a Christ-rejecting world, but then, is this not common now? Many who oppose the Roman Catholic Church are taking part in many worldly things. They think that they are much superior to the Roman Catholic Church. Actually they are the same as the latter.</P><P>In Jezebel, we see that she considers the church to have authority not only in doctrines but in politics as well. This greatly changes the original nature of the church. The church is now no longer a genuine church but has become hypocritical and is only the continuation of what was once genuine. The principle of the world has leavened the whole lump, and she has lost all her testimony.</P><P>"And I gave her time that she might repent, and she is not willing to repent of her fornication." The Lord's call now is not for repentance, nor for them to do the first works, nor to recover their first love. These are no longer suitable for the church in Thyatira. The opportunity for repentance was already given before, but it was rejected. There is now no more opportunity for repentance. What is now left is judgment. This judgment is most dreadful, because during the long delay much of her deserved wrath has accumulated. "Behold, I will cast her into a bed." The Lord has grace and patience, yet those who have forever rejected this grace and patience will receive His judgment. The failure of Thyatira is final and severe. The church has gradually failed. By the time it reaches Thyatira, it has reached the ultimate point.</P><P>Here we should pay attention to three kinds of people. First is Jezebel. Second are those who commit adultery with her. Third are her children. God's judgment towards these three kinds of people is different. The Lord knows what kind of sins they have committed, and He knows how to differentiate the degree of closeness of different groups in relationship to her. No one who sins can be free. Judgment is sure. The only difference is in the verdict. The Lord will reward and punish man according to his works.</P><P>Jezebel rejected God's grace and was not willing to repent. Hence, her judgment is sure. Today is the day of God's grace, and He is slow to wrath. He is not oblivious to man's sin. Although a sinner can misunderstand His grace and can treasure up His wrath, God is always willing to bestow grace and to see man repent. However, God's patience did not produce any result in Jezebel. She rejected God's continuing kindness. As a result, there was no other way left for her except judgment. "I will cast her into a bed." A bed of sin is now turned into a bed of pain. In her suffering she will come to realize the displeasure of the Most High. She has committed a mortal sin, and there is no hope left for her.</P><P>Those who committed fornication with her still have a little chance and a little opportunity for repentance, but if they lose that opportunity and will not repent, they will suffer "great tribulation." This tribulation is surely not for this life only. Romans 2 says: "Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man who commits evil...In the day when God judges the secrets of men according to my gospel through Jesus Christ" (vv. 9, 16). Hence, there is tribulation waiting in the future. It is difficult to point out if these people have committed moral fornication or physical fornication. However, we know that whether it be moral fornication or physical fornication, judgment is inevitable. According to our view, these fornicators are probably saved ones. They were men in the apostolic churches. Yet they will be punished. Therefore, a Christian must be careful. Although he is saved, this does not mean that God will gloss over his unrepented sins. Every sin that has not passed through the blood of the Lord Jesus will be judged.</P><P>We can find out the activities of Jezebel from the fact that she has "children." Who are these children? They are the ones produced and begotten by her teaching, the ones who have consecrated themselves to propagate her teaching. It is a pity that there are numerous such people nowadays! We can find them not only in the Roman Catholic Church but even in the Protestant churches which are fully opposed to the Roman Catholic Church. What use is there for one to bear the name of Protestantism when he is still Romish at heart?</P><P>The Lord speaks of another punishment for the children of Jezebel. The word "kill" in the original language is the same used in Exodus 5:3 and 9:15 and Leviticus 26:25 where it is translated as "pestilence." Those who committed fornication with the Moabite women also died of pestilence (Num. 25:8-9). Hence, literally speaking, the ones mentioned here will die of pestilence. Spiritually speaking, they will suffer similar punishments from the Lord.</P><P>What is the purpose of the Lord in doing this? The purpose is that "all the churches will know that I am He who searches the inward parts and the hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your works." The Lord admitted that there were other churches beside these seven churches. The Lord put judgment on one church for the purpose of helping all the other churches. When the Lord judged Ananias and Sapphira, the Scripture recorded, "And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all those who heard these things" (Acts 5:11). God executes His judgment in order to warn those who are not yet judged, with the hope that they would fear and would stop sinning.</P><P>The Lord said that He did this to show all the churches "that I am He who searches the inward parts and the hearts." Based on this, we can say that the sin committed by Jezebel and her accomplices must have been very hidden and unknown to ordinary men. However, the Lord is the One who searches the inward parts and the hearts. There is no hidden sin that will not manifest itself before Him. When the Lord comes to judge, He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts. Even sins as hidden as fornication will be exposed by the Lord.</P><P>There is another purpose to the Lord's judgment. It is to let all the churches know that "I will give to each one of you according to your works." The word "you" here means that the Lord is dealing with the church. The principle the Lord applied here is the same both for believers and unbelievers. Psalm 62:12, Matthew 16:27, and Romans 2:6 all show this principle. We have to know that no one in the world can receive eternal life through his own works, and no Christian who has eternal life can perish through evil works. The Lord Jesus' righteousness and God's love has delivered every saved person from perdition. However, this does not mean that saints will henceforth not be punished, nor does it mean that believers will no longer stand before the judgment seat of Christ. Although it is an established and unchangeable fact that we will never perish, the Bible also tells us that those Christians who have received eternal life "must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad" (2 Cor. 5:10). "So then each one of us will give an account concerning himself to God" (Rom. 14:12). Many workers who have labored for the Lord will be rewarded then. Those whose works will be burned will still be saved, yet they will suffer loss. However, those who have sinned and have not repented of or confessed their sins, though they will not perish, will reap in the millennium what they have sown (Gal. 5:19-21; 6:7-8; Rev. 20:4-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSES TWENTY-FOUR TO TWENTY-FIVE</H2><P>Verses 24-25: "But I say to you-the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this teaching, who have not known the deep things of Satan, as they say-I put no other burden upon you; nevertheless what you have hold fast until I come."</P><P>Our hearts are truly comforted at hearing the Lord's word to the faithful ones in such dark situations. The Lord is the Lord who searches all things. He knows the condition of the whole church in Thyatira. He also knows the condition of a small number of faithful ones in the church in Thyatira. Although the whole body has sinned, a few remain clean. We have to know that before the Lord, the whole church is not considered the church. The Lord only considers the remnant His church. What are the characteristics of this remnant? They rejected the fashionable teachings of the day. They did not tolerate the worldliness and corruption allowed by these teachings. Naturally, in opposing these teachings that the church at that time recognized, they were considered mad (Isa. 59:15). The sinning ones considered that those were the ones who knew "the deep things of Satan," which means that they were the ones who were deceived by Satan and who had fallen into Satan's snares. Why were these slandered here? It is because they would not go along with the others but would have a clear separation from sin in the world and in the church. They were willing to follow the way of holiness and truth. It is for this reason that Jezebel and her accomplices with her children considered this minority to be those who had private fellowship with Satan! They considered these to be deceived by Satan to frustrate "the spirit of oneness in the church!" How history has repeated itself! Every time God's children follow God's word to leave the nominal churches and to cleanse themselves from being vessels of dishonor, they are met with misunderstanding and slander and are considered deceived. However, all those children of God who are like "the rest in Thyatira" should be at peace and should rejoice, for they have the Lord's declaration with them: "who have not known the deep things of Satan, as they say." Everyone who would honor Christ should be satisfied with the Lord's acknowledgment.</P><P>In mentioning the remnant, it shows that the Lord has here forsaken the whole group. This is a solemn matter. It seems to say that the Lord has removed the lampstand there already, yet the Lord acknowledged that they are precious in His eyes.</P><P>Here we must take note that the church in Thyatira is but a rudimentary form of the Roman Catholic Church. It has not yet been fully developed to the utterly corrupt and loathsome position in Revelation 17. Therefore, here the Lord did not call His faithful children to leave the church. Although Thyatira is a type of the Roman Catholic Church, at the same time it is also an actual church in the province of Asia Minor. Hence, in speaking to the faithful believers in the actual church of Thyatira, the Lord did not exhort them to leave their church. However, the Roman Catholic Church typified by Thyatira is different; in Revelation 18:4 men are exhorted to depart from her. One cannot confuse an actual church with the church that it typifies. The Lord only requires the remnant in Thyatira to hold fast to what they have. He did not ask them to depart from her. However, those in the Roman Catholic Church, which Thyatira typifies, He told to depart.</P><P>What is the reason for this? Although the actual church in Thyatira at that time was corrupt, it was still a meeting in the Lord's name. It was the Lord's only lampstand in Thyatira. To depart from this corrupted church was to depart from the church. Although as a whole they had tolerated Jezebel's teaching, and although there were heresies among them, this church was the only church in Thyatira. It had not yet changed its name to a church named after a man. It is only when a church has changed its name and the Lord has lost His ground in it, as it was in the Roman Catholic Church, that the Lord calls His faithful ones to come out of her. What we were speaking about previously was the Roman Catholic Church typified by Thyatira, but we must never forget that on the one hand, Thyatira represents the Roman Catholic Church, and on the other hand, Thyatira itself was an actual church. In biblical exposition we have to differentiate between the part that applies to the type and the part that applies to the actual thing itself.</P><P>We must make the distinction here: it is those sects in which the Lord has lost all ground and the denominations which work under the principle of the Roman Catholic Church that we have to depart from. If there is a place in which a church is purely meeting in the Lord's name, if that church (not denomination) is the only church in that locality, if that church is the church of God in that locality, and if that church has not acted contrary to the scriptural teaching of God but has acknowledged the freedom for the Holy Spirit to work among it, we cannot depart from it just because it is corrupt. It is forbidden that one should leave a church for reason of corruption. God wants us to leave the sects, not the church. Although a church that is not a sect may be corrupt, God does not want us to depart from it. Of course, we have to cleanse ourselves and should have nothing to do with the corruption. On the contrary, we should cast out from among us those who teach the corrupt teachings, or we should stop their teaching.</P><P>We know that teaching and work are closely related. It is when man believes in wrong teachings that the result is wrong works. We have to be responsible for the teachings we hold because the teachings we hold govern our lives. The Lord praised the rest in Thyatira based on the fact that they had not followed these teachings.</P><P>"Who have not known the deep things of Satan, as they say." We have said that this is a slander on the believers, but there can be another meaning to this expression. It may mean that those who follow the teaching of Jezebel base their work on a kind of deep teaching, and that God's remnant is opposed to them because the remnant is too shallow and does not understand the deep teaching. However, the Lord considers their deep teachings to be the deep things of Satan.</P><P>Here the Lord acknowledged that these Christians are standing on a proper ground. Although the outward church has failed, the Lord fully approves those who are faithful to Him. Hence, He said, "I put no other burden upon you." What they have is indeed good and desirable, and He will not demand that they learn or do anything more. They only need to hold fast what they have. The Lord said, "What you have hold fast." Until when must they hold fast? It is not until Jezebel repents, for that will be too late. Nor is it until they die, for what they are waiting for is not death. They are those who have a living hope. "Hold fast until I come."</P><P>Now the Lord is not caring for the past but for the future. Beginning from the church in Thyatira, the Lord mentions His return. We have to see that in Thyatira, Sardis, and Philadelphia, the Lord explicitly mentions His return. However, in the last church, Laodicea, the Lord mentions its total rejection. This shows us that these four churches will all remain until the Lord Jesus comes back again. Although Sardis comes after Thyatira, it does not mean that when Sardis comes, Thyatira is no more. Instead, both will exist until the Lord returns. After Sardis, there is Philadelphia, and after Philadelphia there is Laodicea. The principle there is the same.</P><P>Now the Lord is upholding His return as a hope for His faithful people. The Lord often draws His people's attention to this matter. When man rejects Him, and when the church turns its heart to love the world, He mentions His return to those faithful to Him so that they would wait patiently for Him.</P><P>Our future is with hope, but what should we do now? Now we should hold fast to what we have. Although this is not a big thing, it is in no way insignificant for one to stand firm and unmoved and to hold fast to the truth acquired when everything around is in a corrupt condition and men oppose the faithful lovers of the Lord and exercise their full power to persecute, oppose, and entice those who would follow the truth. Many have drifted and have lost what they once had. Many were once zealous for the Lord's truth, His place, and His glory, but the delay of the Lord has caused them to lose their testimony. The most crucial thing now is to hold to what we have until the Lord returns. Under what circumstances are we to hold fast? We are to hold fast not only in the midst of persecutions from the world, but in the midst of confusions in the church. Thank the Lord. This holding fast will not be for long because that day is coming soon.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSES TWENTY-SIX TO TWENTY-EIGHT</H2><P>Verses 26-28:"And he who overcomes and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations; and he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces, as I also have received from My Father; and to him I will give the morning star." </P><P>These overcomers in the church should bear three characteristics. First, they should hold fast to what they have and should walk a pathway that is separated from the world in the midst of various persecutions, oppositions, and corruptions. Second, they should keep the Lord's words until the end. Jezebel has her words, and those who follow her words cannot keep the Lord's words. In order to keep the Lord's words, one has to repudiate the teaching of Jezebel. If these overcomers truly want to overcome, they should depart from all the teachings of Jezebel and all the traditions associated with these teachings, and should keep the Lord's words alone. When the teachings of Jezebel are found in the church, it is easy for one to follow the church instead of following the Lord. This is why the Lord here is calling His children to follow His own words directly. Third, one has to keep His works until the end. What works are these? These are the works mentioned in verse 19, that is, the love, faith, service, endurance, and good works. These are the works that please the Lord. These are also the works that the Lord Himself did while He was on earth. They had these works at the beginning, and their latter works are more than their former works. They should hold fast to these works and should not lose these works of the Lord just because circumstances have become darker.</P><P>The phrase "My works" is a special expression. It is what Paul meant when he said: "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus" (Phil. 2:5). A Christian should be a "duplicate" of Christ in this age. We have been made alive together with Christ. As such we should express Christ in our walk. While He was on earth, He was completely blameless and absolutely faithful, serving God in everything amidst sufferings and trials. For this reason, Christians should express the life of Christ in conduct and in word amidst the present sinful, corrupt, and unfaithful church. Those who take part in the works of Jezebel will be punished, and those who hold fast to the works of Christ will be rewarded.</P><P>If believers are willing to walk on the Lord's ordained way, to follow the Lord's footsteps single-heartedly, to keep the Lord's words, to do the Lord's works, to daily be encouraged by the Lord's second coming, and to hold fast to what they have, they will receive what the Lord promises here. These promises bear two characteristics: first, to reign with Christ, and second, to have the morning star.</P><P>In these seven letters, the Lord's word to the overcomers divides every one of these imperfect churches into two classes of Christians. When believers accept the Lord's substitutional death and His perfect work accomplished on the cross, they are accepted in the Beloved and are the same. Here, every Christian is joined one to another, and there is no distinction among them. Here the basis of acceptance is the work of Christ; there is no regard for the sinner's own work. Since everyone is accepted based on the work of Christ, spontaneously everyone is the same before God. However, we have often said that salvation is one thing, and the receiving of God's reward is another. When the Lord Jesus comes again, He will recompense the believers according to their work. Some will be rewarded, while others will suffer loss, be chastised, or be punished. Since the future reward and punishment is according to the believers' work, there is a distinction among all the saved believers in the church. In these seven letters, we find the differences, dissimilarities, and distinctions among the saved believers. The overcomers will receive the reward. The ones who fail, of course, will not receive the reward the Lord promised to the overcomers.</P><P>"To him I will give authority over the nations." Here the Lord is comparing the attitude of the faithful believers with the works of Jezebel. It is of course wonderful to have authority over the nations, but this will happen only when the Lord comes back and not before. The saints will reign together with Christ. For Christians to reign alone is a sign of rebellion against Christ. It is true that Christ is now already reigning, but He is now reigning on the Father's throne, which cannot be shared by His people. For this reason, Christians cannot exercise authority or reign now. In the Lord's eyes, Satan is the prince of this age. All those who reign in this age are under his hand. Therefore, Christians should not reign in the territory of the enemy of Christ. When we consider the place Christ occupies in the world today, we will realize that Christians are not to reign now. It is when He ascends to His own throne as the Son of Man in the millennial kingdom that we will share with Him. This is His promise to the overcomers in Laodicea: "He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne" (3:21).</P><P>What kind of reward is this? If we suffer with Him, we shall also reign with Him. At present, Jezebel and her disciples reign and are exalted in the world according to their desires. Those Christians who want to be separated from their sins must give up their position and right in the world. They will be rejected together with Christ here, but they will receive their promise, which is to be glorified with Christ in the future. They can give up all that Jezebel is acquiring because what they will gain in the future will be far beyond what they are losing today. The church's position should be one that serves Christ faithfully and that testifies to the light expressed by God in His Son's grace. Such a testimony can only be given by a heavenly sojourner who takes temporary lodging on earth, who seeks no power from worldly organizations but instead rescues men away from the world. How can a witness of suffering who testifies for the rejected Christ receive high places in a Christ-rejecting world? The world is still in rebellion against God. How can a Christian be a reigning one in such a world? The believers' hope at present should not be the reformation of the world nor the revival of the church. The Lord's promise to us is not found in the present age. It is found in the second coming of the Lord Jesus and the advent of His kingdom.</P><P>This is a new age. Paul warned the saints before that it is untimely exaltation for one to reign at the present time (1 Cor. 4:8-14). At present, we should humble ourselves under the hand of the rulers (Rom. 13:1) and should wait until the Lord gives us the authority to reign (Rom. 14:17). What we are waiting for is the coming of the new age.</P><P>The authority over the nations as mentioned here by the Lord is, of course, the same as that mentioned in Revelation 20:4. First Corinthians 6:2-3 also speaks of this time. What the Lord is telling us here is that not only will the martyrs reign, those who hold fast to the works of Christ will also have a share in the kingdom and will reign. After reading the Lord's word here, it will become very apparent to us that not every Christian will reign in this way. Those who will have authority over the nations are not all the saved Christians in Thyatira, nor are they the Christians who hold fast initially to the works of Christ, nor are they the Christians who have received initial commendations from Christ. Rather, it is the overcoming ones who hold fast until the end and who keep the Lord's works until He comes who will receive the authority. The saints should know now that they will not all enter the kingdom. Even if they are to enter, they will not all receive the same position. We should not be satisfied with eternal life alone. We should strive forward and should pursue after the coming glory. Is it not good that we can shine and be as the sun in the millennial kingdom?</P><P>"And he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces, as I also have received from My Father." On that day, the Lord will reign over the nations with an iron rod in His hand. This is the Lord Jesus' place anyway, but here we see His people sharing His place. Here the Lord is clearly quoting the words of Psalm 2. If we compare this psalm with Psalm 110, we can see that at Christ's request, God will give to Him the nations as His inheritance and the end of the earth shall be His portion. Hence, He will break up the nations with an iron rod and will crush them as vessels of pottery. Although man's fortresses are strong now, and although those who oppose God and His Son Christ are adamant in their attitude, on that day they will all be broken to pieces by Christ, and like vessels of pottery they will not be able to withstand the iron rod. This will happen in the future and will be Christ's position then. However, He promises His overcomers to share the same such position as He will have.</P><P>We should pay attention to one thing here: the world is not being reformed gradually by the Lord's gospel and is not improving day by day. If it were, why will the Lord have to rule it with a rod of iron? Some people only read Psalm 2:7-8 and consider that the gospel of Christ will eventually win the victory, but we must remember that while victory is sure, it will not come about by the gospel but by authority. The iron rod mentioned in Psalm 2:9, as shown by the Lord in Revelation, refers to His authority. In chapter nineteen, when we see Christ coming from the air, "out of His mouth proceeds a sharp sword, that with it He might smite the nations; and He will shepherd them with an iron rod; and He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty" (v. 15). This is not the gospel! This is the might of Christ! The nations will become the Lord's inheritance, and the end of the earth will become the Lord's field, not through the influence of the gospel but through the establishing and the execution of His kingdom with His authority and power at His coming on this earth. The gospel does have its work to do, but God's goal in the gospel is merely to call out and to save a group of people in the world. The Bible does not have the teaching of the whole world being reformed by the gospel and being turned into the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>Actually one wooden rod is already enough to rule over a flock, but the nations are not tame like sheep. This is why the Great Shepherd with His companions must have the iron rod before they can rule. If we read 19:15-21 again, we will see the attitude the nations will take when Christ comes again. They will gather their armies and will battle with the Son of God. Hence, without the ruling of the iron rod, they will not submit. Even in the millennium, other than the whole nation of Israel which will become righteous, not all the Gentile children who enter the millennium will necessarily be submitting to Christ. When they enter into the millennium, although they will all be called the righteous and will be the kingdom of the sheep, still the children of the regenerated ones are not necessarily regenerated themselves. This is why in Zechariah 14 God warns those who will not go up to Jerusalem to keep the Feast of the Tabernacle of their impending judgment. These passages show us that the heart of men even in the millennium will not necessarily be holy. Furthermore, when we consider how at the end of the millennium Satan is released to deceive Gog and Magog to rebel against God, we realize that man's nature, except through regeneration, will never be changed. Hence, in the millennium the Lord and His servants have to shepherd the nations with a rod of iron.</P><P>We know that a man of flesh has his strength and stubbornness. The Lord compares this nature to the vessels of pottery. Although it is strong, it cannot withstand the iron rod of God's power. When the iron rod strikes, these ones will be broken into pieces. If they were of mud, they could still be remolded. However, they are vessels of pottery; once they are broken, they could never again be made whole. This kind of breaking is the kindest work of the Lord. If this is not done, the public peace and order of the world will be affected. Our endurance will not have to last until eternity, and Christ's righteousness will not forever be cast aside. When the day comes, He will execute His righteous discipline. At that time, when His attitude changes, we will change with Him. This half of the promise speaks of things related to the Lord's kingdom.</P><P>However, before the Lord's kingdom comes, the saints must first be raptured by Him. Hence, the Lord says, "And to him I will give the morning star." The meaning of the morning star is explained to us at the end of this book. When the prophecies contained in this book are about to be fully expounded, He turns back to explain to us the meaning of the morning star. "I Jesus have sent My angel to testify to you these things for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright morning star" (22:16). This is the way the book of Revelation, or the New Testament, concludes-with a declaration. If we read the declaration in the book of Malachi, the end of the Old Testament, we will be amazed how the Old Testament as well as the New join as one to testify for Christ. The declaration in Revelation is concerning the Lord Jesus. The declaration in Malachi is also concerning the Lord Jesus. The book of Revelation says that He is the bright morning star. Malachi says that He is the Sun of righteousness (4:2). It seems as if the Old Testament speaks more perfectly than the New Testament speaks. The morning star comes first, then the sun comes. It seems to be more complete to receive the sun than to receive the morning star, for to have the day is better than to have the promise of the day. However, the significance here is not the day or the promise of the day but a question of sequence in time. The Lord Jesus is the root of David. This means that he will be the King of the kingdom. This is the Sun typified in the Old Testament. In the millennium, the Lord Jesus will reveal Himself as the Sun, but for His people, He will first be the bright morning star in the dark world. Since this promise is so precious, when the true church hears this promise, it cannot refrain from its love, zeal, and desire in His return and from crying with the Holy Spirit, "Come!" (22:16-17).</P><P>As the Sun of righteousness, the Lord Jesus will manifest Himself in the world with extraordinary power. However, at the same time, He is the morning star, unveiling His heavenly beauty in the heart of His people to be their hope. The appearance of the morning star is the proof of the imminent approaching of the day. Those who look up to Him in darkness will see Him and will be comforted by Him. The morning star is not the appearance of Christ. It is not the revelation of His glory before all men. That will be the work of the Sun. When He said that He is the morning star, it means that He is not seen by the sleeping church and the slumbering world, for they are all glorifying themselves in the world and have forgotten about the cross of Christ and that now is the time of night. An overcomer is one who is watchful in the night. He cannot sleep and slumber with the sinful world and the corrupted church. He looks to the Lord in the dark. As such, the Lord gives to him a song in the night and a glimpse of the morning star. What he cares for are the future events, because the morning star is already risen in his heart.</P><P>Even if the church throughout the ages had been faithful, the world still would be in a dark night. However, now, on top of this, the church has become corrupted. When the sun goes up, it is time for men to go forth to work in diligence, but the morning star is shining for those who will not sleep with others. Some will see the light only when the sun goes up, but how good it is that we can see the light of the morning star even before the sun comes up! What this means is that we will enjoy Christ in the dark. Christ did not say to us, "I am the morning star." Rather, He says, "And to him I will give the morning star." This means at least two things: (1) Christ reveals Himself especially to those who are looking for Him and becomes available to them for their present enjoyment, and (2) before He comes again with His saints and manifests Himself in the world as the Sun, He will first rapture the overcomers unto Himself. Thyatira is at the darkest hour of the church. However, it is at this darkest hour that the morning star is revealed. Hence, all those who desire the morning star should know that when circumstances are dark, the time for the appearance of the morning star is near.</P><P>However, there is another significance to the morning star. Although the morning star shines from the heavens, it does not brighten the earth. It is only shining and bright within its own sphere. In the future Christ will bring day to the world, but to us, He is the morning star because we are heavenly people. He shines in the heavens, and only those who live in the heavens can see His brightness. Although we will reign with Him over the whole earth, our home is not the earth but our Father's house. That is our eternal habitation. This morning star is our habitation. Since our life at present and our thoughts are all above, we can enjoy the full brightness of the morning star. The farther we are from the earth and the closer we are to the realm of the morning star, the more we will receive the brightness of the morning star.</P><P>However, this morning star is not only our habitation in which we can enjoy God's provision. Our greatest enjoyment is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. "I Jesus...the bright morning star." We will enjoy Him. What a wonderful thought this is!</P><P>The morning star speaks of the fact that the Lord Jesus will appear to us in darkness and will receive us unto where He is. The morning star speaks of our eternal home. It also speaks of the fact that we will forever abide with the Lord and will enjoy and linger with the Lord. These three thoughts are linked together for us in John 14. The Lord Jesus said, "In My Father's house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, so that where I am you also may be" (vv. 2-3). The Lord will come again and will prepare a place for us. He Himself will also abide with us forever.</P><P>The morning star speaks of the imminent coming of the day. Before the Lord Jesus sends the tribulations to judge the world, He will first receive us back to Himself. At that time we will reign with Him. At that time the staff will not be turned to a serpent; rather, in His hand, the staff will become a symbol of righteousness, and no opposer in the world will be able to withstand His power. At that time we will share with the Lord in His government. What a blessing that will be! Hence, the Lord is speaking here of the future rapture and reigning of the saints so that their hearts will not take the present age as their goal, but will take the future glory as their focus. Those who can be attracted by these things of the future will be overcomers in Thyatira. We must know the Lord and the future things in this way in order that we will not be affected by the present apostasy and corruption around us. Naturally speaking, our hearts easily turn to vanity and hope for prominence in the world. If there is not the hope of the future, our hearts will not be preserved to relinquish the present evil age.</P><P>Actually, every sin in the present world and the church is also in our hearts. Indeed, if we do not judge before the Lord the root of evil hiding in our hearts, we cannot reject the fruit of corruption appearing in the present world and the church. These sins are produced when man allows the flesh to remain. If Satan is to operate, he must have his sphere of operation. Because man is unwilling to remove everything of the flesh in himself, many failures result. The most important thing for us to do now is to ask God to do a deeper work in us through the cross so that we can be single-heartedly attracted by the coming rapture and kingdom. If we want our hearts to be preserved and to be kept away from the multifarious perils in our environment, we must have this hope. The Lord is now presenting these two things before the weary saints so that they would lift up their heads, hope for the coming things, and overcome in a corrupting environment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE TWENTY-NINE</H2><P>Verse 29:"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches." </P><P>This calling was formerly placed before the promise to the overcomers, but beginning from Thyatira, this word is placed after the promise. In the previous three churches, it was first the calling of those who have ears to hear the words of the Holy Spirit, then the promise to the overcomers. However, beginning from Thyatira and continuing all the way to Laodicea, it is first the promise of blessing and glory to the overcomers, then the calling of those who have an ear to hear the words of the Holy Spirit to the churches. The last four churches will remain until the Lord Jesus comes back again.</P><P>In the first three letters, those who have ears are related to the general testimony of the church. The overcomers are the ones who are separated from among them. However, in the last four letters, they mention the overcoming first, then the calling to hear. This shows that the faithful ones are distinct from the whole. God purposely separated the remnant overcomers and showed that they are not related to the church as a whole. This shows that the present calling of the Holy Spirit can no longer be heard by the whole church. Rather, only the overcoming remnant can hear it. From this point on, only the overcomers can hear the calling of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>We know that it is very meaningful for the Holy Spirit to inspire the writing of the Bible in this way. In the first three letters, He put the calling consistently before the promises. In the last four letters, He put the promises consistently before the calling. If we understand God's mind and feeling, our hearts will be purified, preserved, and led. Those who do not know God's way will fail and will err, but those who know God's heart will see the Lord's way in everything.</P><P>In this way, we see that in the first three churches, the Lord calls the whole body to hear. Whether or not they can hear is another matter. The Lord at any rate has called them. However, in the last four churches, due to the change in circumstances, the Lord is no longer able to place the calling after His words to the whole church. Rather, He has placed the calling after the promises to the overcomers, as if to say that the Lord does not expect anyone to hear them except the overcomers. Sin has sprung up in the nominal organizations. As a result, the Lord's promise and calling can no longer be as general as before. From now on, we see a clearer and clearer distinction between God's remnant and the general majority. Formerly, the difference between the overcomers and the general majority was only a moral one. Now this difference is a manifested matter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>APPENDIX-<br>FULFILLMENT IN HISTORY</H2><P>At the time of Pergamos, the church was at the initial stage of the Roman Catholic Church, but the church in Thyatira represents the church from the time Christianity was accepted as the state religion of the Roman Empire until the Reformation. However, this does not mean that when the Reformation came, it no longer existed. It existed and will exist until the Lord Jesus comes again. In the church of this period, the Romish Pope exalted himself to be the official representative of Christ, holding the shepherd's staff to shepherd the nations. He was supposedly the successor of the apostle and bore the apostolic authority. Only he had the authority to expound the Bible. Ordinary believers could not read the Bible. In other words, they did not have to hear the Lord's word. Even if they were to read the Bible, they were told that they could not understand it. The church had the authority to expound and to teach the Bible. The church had received authority from the Lord, and whatever it would bind on earth would be bound in heaven, and whatever it would loose on earth would be loosed in heaven. It seems as if even the authority for salvation was in the hand of the church.</P><P>During this period, the church considered that the earthly kings could only rule over men's bodies, but that its own popes and priests could rule over men's souls. Even the souls of the kings were under them! As such, the church was greater and higher than even the worldly monarchies. In this way, the church reigned in the world and hoped to turn the world through its works into the kingdom of the heavens. Moreover, it actually took over political affairs and subjected the rulers of the world under it. The result of such work afforded no benefit other than making it completely worldly. It had completely forgotten all positions that the Son of God holds. It had also lost knowledge of its own position.</P><P>The word "Thyatira" means "unceasing sacrifices." At that time the church introduced many heathen religious practices into the church. As a result, many superstitious things abounded in the church.</P><P>It was at this time that many faithful children of God rose up to testify against the errors, but what they received was nothing but persecutions and bloodshed. Countless numbers of God's children were killed by Jezebel at this time. However, at this time God also had His remnant. They were the godly saints and the zealous preachers who served God faithfully. They were willing to suffer, to be rejected, and to take the narrowest way in the world.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>SUB-SECTION FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SARDIS-<br>THE REFORMED CHURCH<br>(3:1-6)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE ONE</H2><P>Verse 1:"And to the messenger of the church in Sardis write: These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead."</P><P>We have to remember that these last four churches are special. Although historically they come one after the other, all of them will remain until the Lord comes back again. They are not like the first three churches, which follow consecutively one after the other and replace one another, Smyrna replacing Ephesus and Pergamos replacing Smyrna. Here, Sardis does not replace Thyatira. It is only produced after Thyatira, and it will exist together with Thyatira until the Lord comes back again. We must remember this fact. If we know that Sardis comes after Thyatira and will exist simultaneously with Thyatira, it will not be difficult for us to discover which period of the church Sardis refers to.</P><P>If Thyatira represents the Roman Catholic Church in the Middle Ages, Sardis must represent the Protestant church, or the Reformed church. Although the word "Sardis" in the original language has the meaning of "recovery," we have to be careful not to take Sardis as the church during the time of Luther's Reformation. Although we know that Sardis refers to the Protestant church, we must find out which part of the long history of Protestantism Sardis refers to. According to this letter, the situation of the church described here does not seem to be that at the time of the Reformation, but after the Reformation. The testimony Luther and his co-workers bore in their homeland and elsewhere was a direct work of the Holy Spirit. We can say that it was the Reformation of the Holy Spirit and not the Reformation of Luther. What the Lord described in this letter was not the condition of the Reformation. Reformation is God's own work. He is not judging the Reformation itself for He cannot judge His own work. Here, what the Lord held the church responsible for was its condition after the Reformation.</P><P>At the time of Luther, the Jezebelian church was very prevailing. Other than a few who lamented for the sin of the day in private, almost no one rejected the teaching of Jezebel. God's children had completely joined themselves with the world. It became a strange thing not to eat the idol sacrifices. Other than God's remnant, no one seemed to know how to depart from sin. It was in this circumstance that God chose and prepared Luther to be His vessel. God honored Luther and gave him the privilege to call God's children back to the Bible, to realize that they were justified by faith and that they should listen to God's own words rather than man's words. Under such circumstances, a ray of light seemed to have pierced through the dark night. God was now pouring the living water out of the heavens on high and nourishing dried-up lives, providing them the strength to break away from the bondage of Rome. Thousands of people began to join the great movement of the Reformation. However, this situation did not last for long!</P><P>Of course, no one can doubt the work of the Holy Spirit in the Reformation. But after the Reformation, we saw a gradual decline in the zeal for the Word and God's wonderful blessings. That which was once God's work had now become a cold fa&#231;ade. Protestantism had become a great force. When man tries to exploit this force, the power of the Holy Spirit is gone. In the end, Protestantism becomes nothing but a protest against Rome. The light and truth that it has received become nothing more than weapons against the Roman Catholic Church. This is Sardis. Sardis does not represent the Reformation that was full of the power of the Holy Spirit, but the Protestantism that is void of power and life. This is Sardis. It is gradually corrupted, all the way to the end.</P><P>We have to realize that this letter of the Lord to the church in Sardis was a most solemn one. This letter was sent to a nominal church and covered the responsibility of this nominal church. According to the Lord's view, and in considering the name, nature, and responsibility of this nominal church, this letter should arouse every saint to a heart of solemnity. While it is true that we are presently dealing very much with the traditions of Thyatira, that is, Roman Catholicism, we do not have much of a direct relationship with the church in Thyatira. What our eyes see and our ears hear presently are mostly things related to Sardis, the reformed church. If we know the tremendous responsibility Sardis takes and the dangerous position Sardis has, we will be taught some lessons. Although the Lord's letter to Sardis was so solemn, the beginning of this letter gives us the greatest comfort. The greater the responsibility, the greater the comfort. Although everything can fail, the Lord Christ is rich. He can meet the need of His church. It was in this circumstance that the Lord unveiled His never-changing riches to show the church that His name is full of what we lack. He said that He is the One "who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars." Here the Lord mentions His own power and the fact that all those responsible for bearing the light belong to Him. Only He has the right to direct them and to demand submission from them.</P><P>In this book, the Holy Spirit reveals to us the various aspects of His works. As such He is called the seven Spirits of God. He is related to the throne of God. This is unlike the oneness found in His relationship with the Body of Christ. In chapter one, we see a distinction between the seven Spirits and Christ; we see Him as being before the throne. In chapter four, we see Him as "seven lamps of fire burning before the throne" (v. 5). The throne signifies God's supreme authority. It also signifies the glory and honor that God is about to receive. The seven lamps before the throne speak of the power of the Holy Spirit in shedding forth light to judge sin and to accomplish what the throne decrees. The accomplishment of this matter is based on the Lord's redemption. This is given in chapter five. There we see the Lord Jesus Christ as the Lamb, and the seven Spirits are the "seven eyes" of the Lamb sent to all the earth. This is not talking about the work of the Holy Spirit in the church; rather, it is about the different ways the Holy Spirit works and His different attributes for the execution of God's administration. Here, the Holy Spirit is manifesting His own power for the fulfillment and accomplishment of God's purpose on earth.</P><P>What is spoken of here is clearly a reference to the words in Zechariah 3:9 and 4:10. If we pay attention to the events at the time Zechariah prophesied these words, we will see the significance of quoting his words here. At the time the prophet prophesied this word, God had already stretched forth His hands and had delivered the Israelites out of the land of captivity in Babylon. This is God's intervention in grace in the affairs of the Israelites. How similar was the condition of Sardis to that of the Israelites then! Sardis was also under God's intervention in grace. In the church in Sardis, we do not see the many sins committed in Thyatira. This proves that Sardis had God's intervention and went through a deliverance. If we read the books of the prophets after the exile, such as Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, we can see what the remnant of Israel received and heard. We see that although Jehovah turned their attention to His temple, they should have been zealous for His temple only by abiding in the coming Christ, in the Holy Spirit which dwelt among them, and in the coming glory. God did not want them to pay attention to His outward works such as the deliverance of Cyrus, Darius, and Zerubbabel. Even the temple that they were building should have occupied only a secondary place. They should have paid attention to God's future building of His heart's desire through Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit. He laid a stone with seven eyes before Joshua, and turned this high priest's attention to the Christ who is the foundation, who is the root and source of all things, and who is full of God's wisdom and power. The seven eyes refer particularly to Christ's being full of wisdom and prudence to win God's full pleasure with respect to the temple and worship. God told Zerubbabel: "Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit" (Zech. 4:6). At that time, God wanted the Israelites to pay attention to the stone with the seven eyes. Now, God wants His church to pay attention to the Christ with the seven Spirits.</P><P>God knew what the Israelites had passed through. He knew the danger they faced and the difficulties. They had returned to their homeland, and they had not committed the sins that their forefathers committed in the holy land. They had rejected the sin of idolatry and the traditions of the Canaanites which their forefathers had practiced and had washed their hands of them to declare their innocence. What they were doing then was the building up of the Lord's temple. Outwardly speaking, there was truly an atmosphere of revival. Of course, we cannot doubt that it was indeed a revival, but God detected the danger there. He wanted to remind His people of the power of the Holy Spirit. If the Israelites had not forgotten God's teaching in Zechariah, they would not have fallen and become Pharisaical. Because they forgot what they had received and heard, they only outwardly maintained what they had recovered at their return and had already lost its inward vitality. For this reason, they were not at all prepared to welcome the first coming of Christ. When the magi from the east came, not only was Herod troubled, but "all Jerusalem with him." With their mouth they all confessed that they were waiting for Christ, but in their heart they had no desire for Christ. When He came, he was like a thief to them. They did not receive the benefit of His coming. On the contrary, the temple became desolate, and they received the greatest punishment.</P><P>This is the condition of Sardis. Although the Lord has released His children from "Babylon the Great" and has turned them back to the Bible to apprehend the gospel of grace at the time of the Reformation, and although they have left the corruption and idolatry of the Roman Catholic Church, the Protestant church has not paid attention to the seven Spirits mentioned by the Lord here. As a result, they gradually became weak and lost many fundamental doctrines of God. In the end, although Protestantism does not hold in teaching and in work the many sins and heresies of the Roman Catholic Church, it has but an empty name; it has already lost its vitality in life. The inevitable result of this will be that when the Lord comes back again, they will not be able to face Him.</P><P>Here, the Lord showed the church in Sardis that He is the One with the seven Spirits. This means that He Himself has the full power to bear much spiritual fruit. In the millennium the Holy Spirit of God will accomplish God's will on earth. In the same way, Christ is doing the same work for the church now. All the power for accomplishing works of wonder in the coming world are His now. He is now using this power to work for His saints. This power is, of course, hidden, and only the eyes of faith can detect it. Although the church can fail, Christ Himself will never fail. No matter what kind of circumstance the church is under, He still has with Him the power of the Holy Spirit. The Lord mentions this to comfort His believers. Everything around may be corrupt, desolate, and cold, but He remains the source of all power. He is the timely help to His people at all times.</P><P>If we consider Pentecost, we will find out the way the Holy Spirit works. No one can utilize or frustrate the work of the Holy Spirit. This is why the apostles had such powerful testimonies, and this is why the believers could fellowship together in one accord. Without the knowledge that Christ today still possesses the same seven Spirits of God and the fact that the source of power for faith is the same now as it was then, we would surely be disappointed when comparing the present condition with that of the apostles' time.</P><P>Here the Lord reveals Himself as the One with the seven Spirits of God. As such He has boundless power and unlimited wisdom to accomplish God's desire. If the Reformers of the day had remembered this, they would not have looked up to the patronage and support of the power of the world. By doing so, they could not have helped but allow the power of the world to occupy a place in the church. It is as equally wrong for the church to rule over the world as it is for the world to rule over the church.</P><P>The Lord is also revealing Himself as the One with the "seven stars." The seven stars refer to all the authority and all the power of the church before the Lord. They refer to the works done by the churches as the seven lampstands in the name of the Lord. Unlike Ephesus, where the Lord held the seven stars in His right hand, here the Lord is referred to as only "having" the seven stars. He is not uplifting them with His power. However, they are still His. He wants them to acknowledge His authority and trust in His power of provision for the accomplishment of His work. They belong to Him, but they are not in His right hand. If the church would remember that the Lord is the One with the seven stars, it will know that He alone has the authority to rule and direct all the responsible and shining ones in the churches. If the church recognizes this, it will not recognize the power of the worldly kings and rulers over the ministry of the church, and it will not allow its various congregations to elect and to hire their preferred teachers and pastors.</P><P>The gifts covered in Ephesians 4 are given by the ascended Head to His Body. The gifts in 1 Corinthians 12 are given to individual churches. The power for the edification of the church must be given by God. The duty and right of the church is to acknowledge and to receive these gifts. If believers are to understand God's ordained order for the church, they should differentiate between the gifts in Ephesians 4 and those in 1 Corinthians 12. The former are for the Body of Christ, that is, for the whole church, which encompasses all times and all places. The latter are for individual churches, which means that they are for single local churches. The shepherds, teachers, and evangelists established by God are for the building up of the Body of Christ, the universal church. Although individual churches can receive the benefit of these gifts, the purpose of God in giving these gifts is for the whole church and not for individual churches. For this reason, we do not see in the Bible the pastor, or shepherd, of a certain locality, or the evangelist or teacher of a certain locality. The gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12 are limited to individual places. According to God's arrangement, the gifts given to individual churches, such as those mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12, should be directed by the Holy Spirit and put to use according to the will of the Head, as mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14.</P><P>The seven stars belong to the Lord. They should be in the Lord's right hand. The direction of all the gifts in the church should be according to the Lord's command. It is a pity that the church has forgotten this and has set up many organizations and ordinances according to human thought. Whenever a place is found with manmade order, it becomes impossible for God's gifts to function. In the order of the denominational meetings, there is no place reserved for the gifts described in the Bible. In God's eyes, what man considers as order is but confusion. Man's order does not recognize the Lord's supreme authority and does not recognize the Holy Spirit's distribution of gifts "to each one respectively even as He purposes." It does not recognize the order of the church as depicted in the Bible.</P><P>The church in Sardis and the Protestant churches signified by the church in Sardis have forgotten the fact that the seven stars belong to the Lord. This is why there are so many man-made ordinations, nominations, and elections in the Lord's work among the present denominations. The result of this manipulation of the Lord's work is obvious. When such an atmosphere is encouraged, it is inevitable to see an ebbing and dwindling condition. Even that which was of God is gradually weakened until the whole situation is brought to the point of death.</P><P>Of course, as far as the truth and freedom are concerned, Protestantism is better than what went on before. However, God's goal is not that man would depart from the gross sins. Neither is it that man would be free from minor errors. Rather, God wants man's heart to be counted worthy of Him and to allow Him to work as He wills in the church. What He wants to see are His ordinances carried out and His glory manifested. If He gains what He wants, freedom is the sure result. This freedom does not come from self-will; it is the freedom in the Holy Spirit. It is a sin for believers to allow human power to assume an important place in the church. The Lord reveals Himself to the church in Sardis in this way in order to shatter all human freedom and authority. The Lord declares that all spiritual powers and outward authorities are His.</P><P>Among many Protestant churches, such as the Anglican Church in England and the Lutheran Church in Germany, the authority over the stars is given to the rulers of the nations. On the other hand, those who are opposed to the mixing of state and religion, as most common denominations are today, have themselves fallen into similar sins of placing the stars in the hands of the church. Although the churches in China at present do not yet have the government "appoint" their officers, they have fallen into the sin of the churches in selecting, directing, and ordering their preachers. The Bible never teaches us that the world or the church should have such power in their hands. Everything is still in the Lord Jesus' hands. He has not yet given up anything. If the church would recognize this fact, the Lord will begin His work. If faith would look up to Him, He surely will know how to supply the church's needs. If there is no faith, and one does not acknowledge the Lord's position, there will, of course, be the need to replace the work of the Son of God, the Head, with man's method of maintaining orders.</P><P>He is the Head of the church. He is also working as the Head of the church. He exercises His authority to rule over those who are working for Him on earth. In spite of the degradation of the church, the reason that there are still government and gifts in it is that the Lord is still the Head. The Lord knew that one day the organization which called itself the church would rebel against Him and would usurp all the powers. In the end, everything will be in confusion. For this reason, He is unveiling Himself here as the One who is greater than everything. No matter how circumstances turn, authority always belongs to Christ. If we look up to the condition of the church, we will never receive authority. Our only need is to look up to the Lord.</P><P>During the Reformation, in order to escape the yoke of the Pope, men turned the authority of the church over to the worldly rulers. Although those outside the state religions did not commit the same sin, they considered the genuine church the holder of such authority. Actually, it is Christ Himself through the Holy Spirit who is the Lord of the church. This is clearly taught in this letter. For example, some have become teachers and pastors, but based upon what authority are they commissioned? Although the apostles and their representatives did appoint men to administrate the local affairs, from the beginning there was never such a thing as the appointing of a preacher of God's word. Even in selecting a person to replace Judas's lot, the apostles were afraid to make their own decisions and would instead do according to what the Lord had planned (Acts 1:24-25). Later when the Lord chose Paul, although there was Ananias to baptize him, this did not mean that this disciple was endowed with any authority to appoint apostles. Even when others were laying hands on Paul and Barnabas, that merely meant that these two brothers (apostles being no more than brothers!) were going out to preach the word and that other men were sympathizing with them and were committing them to the Lord. There was no ordination or sending out here. As far as their spiritual gifts and abilities were concerned, these men were much inferior to the apostles. The authority of the church is in the hands of the Lord. He has never relinquished a bit of this authority. It is true that when a man sets out to preach the word, he is eager to find out from whose hand he is authorized to do such work. But if he wants to be authorized, he should at least be commissioned by an effective authority! What can a man give to another man? Of course, before the world, if there is human ordination and acknowledgement, everything will look more proper. However, we have to ask if the Lord considers the preaching of the gospel to be something that requires authorization. We do admit that the apostles did "appoint" elders and deacons, but they were not necessarily the pastors and the teachers. Philip was an evangelist, not because he was one of "the seven," but because he received such a gift from the Head. Elders and deacons are only for the managing of local affairs. For these people, the Bible does record the "appointing," but for the teachers, the shepherds, and the evangelists, we do not see one incident of ordination or that any one was ordained. For one to have such a gift of preaching is adequate proof that the Lord has given such a one the authority to do such a work. Because ordination is the most fashionable tradition of the present denominations, men consider this to be the order of the church. Man has now become accustomed to departing from God's principles! How can those who have left the true principles expect to be right? The Lord reveals His own position in this way so that His children would obey Him. Man's conscience should be governed by the Lord's authority. If a man knows that his way is wrong, surely his conscience will not be at peace. Many times, believers do not know which way is proper, but if they would depart from sin, they would find the answer. This is an indispensable step.</P><P>The two natures revealed here by the Lord are related. He has seven Spirits and also seven stars. He has seven stars and also seven Spirits. However, these things are rejected by Protestantism, which Sardis signifies. Of course, we are talking about the reality here. In all Protestant denominations, there are many spiritual men. They pay much attention to the matter of the spiritual life. This, of course, is most crucial. To them, the question of church administration is insignificant. Whether or not the Lord is able to execute His authority or to govern everything is a matter that they have neither the time nor the willingness to care about. To them, spirituality is everything-if believers can grow and be mature in their spiritual life, and if they can fellowship with the Lord and walk according to God's will for individual believers without failure, the many troublesome questions concerning the denominations can be ignored: "Even the best saints cannot be in one accord concerning the administration of the church. It is better that we give up this controversial question."</P><P>Although these believers are somewhat wrong, I can excuse their attitudes. In doing this, they are acknowledging the Lord as the One with God's seven Spirits but are denying that He has the seven stars. They pay attention to the Lord's spiritual power, but ignore the Lord's authority. However, the Lord does not go along with them for one moment. The Lord does consider the spiritual life and authority to be something that Protestant churches should have. However, if the Lord considers church administration to be something insignificant, as they do, the Lord would not have the need to unveil Himself as the one with the seven stars. Our question is not which ecclesiastical system we should follow: congregationalism, episcopalianism, or presbyterianism. What we and the Lord are seeking is that the Lord Jesus be the practical Head in the church. No worldly person should usurp His position. It is unimportant which ecclesiastical system one follows. The question in any system is whether or not the opinions of the one or the many are set aside, and whether the Lord Jesus has the full authority to direct everything in administration and meeting; whether He can use His gifts at will; whether the Holy Spirit is the "chairman" of everything; and whether His words are being honored above all human ordinances and creeds. Of course, all Protestant denominations and sects cannot answer this question directly.</P><P>Although those believers who emphasize spirituality consider that their spiritual life is the most important thing and that the church administration can be carried out at random, the Lord considers that the authority of the church, like the source of spiritual life, depends fully on Him. Of course, we have to admit that spirituality is the first thing. Without spirituality, even with the most perfect ecclesiastical order, we have nothing but a fa&#231;ade. Perhaps this is the reason the Lord mentions the seven Spirits of God first. However, after there is the spirituality, if one does not obey the Lord, keep His word, and allow Him to have the full right in everything, how can this spirituality be expressed? If the Lord is not given the proper sovereignty over the meeting, and if one is standing on unscriptural ground, how can one be mature in spirituality? We know that some saints are in the organizations, but they are not yet mature in life. However, this is not surprising at all. The nature of the spiritual life is such that if someone is hampered on one side, he can still have lopsided growth. Those believers who are not clear concerning the position of the church may grow spiritually, but their growth is lopsided! Such ones will suffer great loss as far as the Lord's mind, His will, His glory, and His word are concerned! Perhaps such ones may not realize it themselves! It is useless for believers to compare their own lives with Jezebel or Laodicea. To be higher than these cases is not a proof that one has obtained favor in the Lord's heart. If believers have not acknowledged the Lord as the One with God's seven Spirits in life and have not acknowledged the Lord as the One with the seven stars in church position, they must once again hear the Lord's questioning of the church in Sardis.</P><P>The saints should remember that the seven stars belong to the Lord. It was not just one star, but seven stars. Only those who recognize Christ as Lord and who work for the Lord by acknowledging His authority and administration can bear responsibility according to the Lord. Only those who shine for the Lord can be in one accord to do a united work. "And there are distinctions of ministries, yet the same Lord" (1 Cor. 12:5). The fleshly man divides Paul and Apollos into two and chooses between the two the one he wants to follow. "Each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos." Yet neither the planting Paul nor the watering Apollos was anything because "he who plants and he who waters are one" (1 Cor. 3:8). All works are done according to what the Lord has given and based upon His distribution. All those who shine for the Lord receive charge from the same Lord and are striving towards the same goal. Everyone has his own gift and works and his own responsibility for which he is directly responsible to the Lord. Yet everyone is called and is working harmoniously together, accomplishing harmoniously the work under the one Lord. Individual responsibility does not annul mutual dependence.</P><P>Of course every church has its own star. This speaks of the responsibility of the seven stars in their respective localities. However, this does not mean that they are independent, because He who has the seven stars is the same Lord. If a principle cannot be carried out in all places, it cannot be carried out in one place. The principle of responsibility that one locality bears is the principle of responsibility that all localities should bear together. Wherever they are scattered, the churches of God should take the same path. Although God's children everywhere cannot be united together now, we must nevertheless recognize such a thing as the church in God's will and thought. What the church of God in Corinth keeps is what "those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place" (1 Cor. 1:2) ought to keep. We have to realize that the universal church of God is only a magnification of a local church, and a local church is only a miniature of God's universal church. If God's children have an accurate view concerning the church of God, they will not be concerned only for their localities but will also have a world view.</P><P>If believers acknowledge the fact that the Lord is the One with the seven stars, this will put the responsible ones in the church in a proper relationship with the Lord and a proper submission to the Lord and will preserve them from human manipulations and orders. In this way, no work will come into conflict with another work of the Lord in another place, and believers will not be confined to the care of one locality, one nation, or one sect alone.</P><P>In spite of the condition of the church, the Lord Jesus is the One with the full power of God's Holy Spirit. At the same time, He has the full spiritual authority. The Lord reveals Himself here as such a One with power and authority because these are the things that are lacking in the church in Sardis. At the time of the Reformation, no two things were farther apart than the power of the Holy Spirit and the spiritual authority. At that time, there was an organization which called itself the church and the bride of Christ, which considered itself well able to solve all problems and confessed the church as being eternally infallible, which considered one person to be the representative of Christ, who had unimaginable authority to deal with the affairs of the church and the disputes in doctrines of faith. Although this organization has weathered many ages, in the end, it will be exposed as the greatest worldly organization in opposition to God and to His Son. Although it may contain the most pious saints, these saints were there to support the Roman Pope to secure his authority. When we study history, we will discover the way they helped the Roman Church.</P><P>Surely these serve as our lessons. If we think that we can remain in a wrong place just because genuine saints of God are there, we are grossly wrong. The goal of Satan is for good men to participate in evil works so that he can reap the benefit!</P><P>At the time of the Reformation, God raised up men everywhere to oppose this kind of evil. It was then that man separated the authority of the church from the spiritual power and would no longer consider the church as having both these things. Everything Romish began to fall into confusion. At the same time, man began to seek help from the powers of the world to release them from the reign of the Pope. From this we can see that Protestantism was wrong in its government from the start. It took the rulers of the world as the authority of the church. In the Roman Catholic Church, the church became the ruler of the world. In the Protestant churches, the world became the ruler of the church. Because of the many human ordinances and traditions, Protestantism has forgotten that the Lord is the One with God's seven Spirits. Because it has allowed the rulers of the nations to direct the offices of the church, it has forgotten the fact that Christ is the One with the seven stars. Although to a certain extent the church recognizes the Lord as having the power of the Holy Spirit and the spiritual authority, what is revealed here is not a Lord who has only some power of the Holy Spirit and who only has a few stars. Rather, He is the One with the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars. Needless to say, the number seven signifies completion. No matter how much the church has failed and how much it has gone along with the world, according to the intention of the Head of the church, all the powers and virtues of the Holy Spirit are still reserved for the church. He cares for the church, visits the church, and cherishes the church. On the one hand, the church has no excuse for its unfaithfulness. On the other hand, there is the source of supply for the faithful saints. The church is indeed in a position of failure already. Not only are the believers deceived by the heresy of Balaam, and not only has Jezebel raised up a family and begotten children in the church, but the church is at the point of death. In spite of this, Christ still has the spiritual power and the authority. This fact can never be changed. The fact that the Lord still has the power and the authority is itself a condemnation of the sin of the nominal church. However, the Lord spoke this word as a comfort and blessing to His faithful people. Although the nominal church is showing the signs of death, the Lord says that He is the One with the seven Spirits of God and that nothing can hurt His people. Although everything has fallen into corruption, all the channels of blessings for the church are still there. Although Satan is evil, and although the church is weak, the riches of the Lord are not at all diminished. Everything that can produce and preserve goodness is still in the Lord's hand. Those saints who are under the same circumstances as Sardis should receive comfort at this word.</P><P>The Lord taught the church in Thyatira to look to His coming and to consider Him as the unique hiding place in the midst of sins. The Lord reminded them of the morning star so that they would have the light shining in their soul in a dark environment. To the church in Sardis, which was alive in name and dead in reality, the Lord comforted the faithful ones and assured them that the source of all power was not yet dried up. Although the outward sources might have been stopped, He remained the same. He wanted His church to know this. He desired to uphold and to preserve His faithful people, yet He did not deliver them with miracles. Even in the Old Testament, the Lord was the same. When the Israelites worshipped the golden calf, God did not perform a miracle to deliver them from this failure. However, when Moses moved the tabernacle outside the camp, the spiritual power was with Moses. God's principle of work is not to avert man's failure by works of miracles. Rather, it is the transmission of spiritual power that preserves His children in faithfulness and undefilement in the midst of uninterrupted failures.</P><P>Except for one case, all the prophets of Judah only prophesied; they did not perform any miracles. The one case was the sun returning ten degrees. These prophets testified, only to the degree that the people had left God's ordinances, that they should receive God's ordained truths, and that He was comforting the faithful remnant. It was only when the whole nation of Israel had openly and brazenly forsaken God under Jeroboam's leadership and had worshipped Baal that God performed miracles through Elijah and Elisha. Although in His grace and mercy God often sent His prophets to testify to Judah, before Judah's manifested failure, there were no miracles. However, God's power had to be manifested to prove that He was Jehovah and that He was far greater than Baal. If a sinner who is outwardly supporting the truth receives power, he will be strengthened in his sin. It is both beneficial as well as being in accordance with the principle of God's work to testify with power against those who have forsaken the truth. Before a man's failure is manifested, God is not willing to release His power. It is only when man has failed utterly that God stretches out His arms. When man is still hiding his failures, and when his degradation is still buried like bones in the grave, God's power will only help him to disguise and camouflage his failures. When man fails, God's love will uphold and comfort him with power. This is the principle of God's work. It is perhaps the greatest principle of all. If this principle is adopted by the believers, no matter how much they have failed, they will be able to count their days and will wait on God for His work. Of course, we cannot be insensitive to the depth of our failures; it is right for us to be touched by it. Nevertheless, the sense of failure should not blind the eyes of faith from seeing the power of Christ. On the contrary, one should know that this is just the time for God to work. This will cause us to cast an objective eye (although not an objective heart) towards the church and will cause us to believe in the Lord's work and to believe that He will direct everything.</P><P>If we consider the example of Paul, we will see how he ignored all present failures to look single-heartedly to the Lord. When we read 1 and 2 Corinthians and Galatians, we find how his views transcended the defeated Corinthians and the fallen Galatians. The sin committed among the Corinthians was shocking; one committed fornication which was not even heard of among the Gentiles. Paul had to warn them, but before he mentioned the sin, he first said, "Who [the Lord] will also confirm you until the end unreprovable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord" (1 Cor. 1:8-9). Paul discerned their source. That was why he could see light amidst darkness.</P><P>The Galatians were no different. When Paul wrote to them, he rebuked them because they had begun by the Spirit but were trying to be perfected by the flesh (Gal. 3:3). They had forsaken the position of grace and were once again bound by the yoke of slavery (Gal. 5:1). The apostle could not help but warn them severely. But when the apostle considered the source of faith, his words were again full of hope: "I am confident in the Lord concerning you that you will be of no other mind" (5:10). He did not have confidence in them; he had confidence in the condition that they could be in.</P><P>Our hearts must treasure and long after everything of Christ and everything the church should be to Christ. This will deepen our sense of the failure of the church and will cause us to realize Christ's preserving power in the midst of all failures. In this way, although the sense of failure has not diminished, our faith in Christ will be increased. How steady our Christian life will then be! What we believe in is not how much the church is for Christ, but how much Christ is for the church. How kind is the Lord! What a wonderful opening word the Lord had for the messenger in Sardis! Before He mentioned their terrible condition, He first revealed Himself as the One who holds all the power of the Holy Spirit. This serves as the source for the believers' faith. No matter how much failure and sins advance, the fullness and power of the Holy Spirit is still the same, for they are not determined by the work of the believers on earth but by the worth of the Lord's work in heaven. In the old days, the Lord spoke to the defeated Israelites through the mouth of the prophet Haggai: "According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my Spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not" (2:5). In the same way now, the Lord is speaking to the defeated church, "These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars."</P><P>Now the Lord begins to speak of the condition of this church: "I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead." Here the Lord is not saying that the messenger in Sardis was not regenerated or that he did not have life. We know that Sardis is also a lampstand in heaven. The Lord was not saying that it did not have life. Rather, He was saying that it was short of life. The Lord did not say that it had become totally lifeless. Rather, He said that in works it was living in name but dead in reality. When we consider the various uses of the word "dead" in the New Testament, we will realize that here it does not mean to be altogether void of spiritual life; it merely means that there was the lack of vitality. First Timothy 5:6 says, "But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while living." The context here shows us that this widow was not void of life or unsaved. In the same principle, the Lord rebuked Peter and called him "Satan." The apostle also called a saved Christian "the evil man" (1 Cor. 5:13). Hence, the Lord was not referring to whether or not this messenger and this church had life. Rather, He was speaking of their works being dead. A Christian receives life at the time he is regenerated, but it is possible for him to be without any vitality in his work. If we consider the following warning and exhortation of the Lord, we will realize that what they lacked was not salvation but watchfulness in serving the Lord.</P><P>Of course, we believe that this word of the Lord refers also to many unsaved nominal Christians. In the Protestant churches, nominally speaking, everyone belongs to the Lord, but actually, there are many who are the Lord's in name only. They are not the Lord's in reality. But the Lord's word here refers directly to the messenger of the church in Sardis. They were saved, yet they lacked the vitality.</P><P>They have been separated from the Roman Church. The Word of God has been reinstated in its proper place. Some of the truths are also recovered. However, in their organizations they lack the most important element, the power of the Holy Spirit. In their churches, or denominations, there are still many so-called, nominal members who are saved. God's saints are scattered among many unsaved ones. They themselves are living, yet they have no strength to enliven the majority. This is the condition of the Protestant church after the Reformation. It is living in name and dead in reality.</P><P>A part of Protestantism is living. This causes its fraudulence to become more extensive than that found in the Roman Catholic Church. Now it has received a name that it is living, yet in reality, it is dead. The Reformation gave us two things: an open Bible and a gospel of grace. These two things are the greatest treasures for the believers. We thank the Lord that He has bestowed such grace upon us. We cannot honor enough those whom the Lord used to bring about the Reformation and who conveyed the truth to us. God honored them and entrusted to them the greatest work in the history of the church.</P><P>At the same time, we should not make the truth received through the Reformation the standard of all truth, as some have done. If we do this, we fall into error. God honored those who carried out the Reformation, and God honors His own work in the Reformation. In this letter to the people in Sardis, God did not judge the ones who brought about the Reformation. Perhaps God has purposely hidden the matter of the Reformation in these seven letters so that saints would not take the Reformation as the standard. Actually, those who were faithful in the Reformation would never take what the Bible had not said. If anyone comes to know the significance of the Reformation, he will never trust in the Reformation more than the Bible honored by the Reformation. The purpose of the Reformation was to turn man back to the Bible. If saints realize that the Reformation is to turn man back to the Bible, and that to turn to the Reformation is to turn to the Bible, they will be saved from errors. The greatest goal of the Reformation was to show that nothing is trustworthy except the Bible. It seems to me that the Reformers would probably have been the last ones to consider the Reformation as the authority and the standard or to agree with such a teaching. We know that the church at the time of the Reformation did receive some light, some deliverance, and some freedom, but there was no recovery concerning Christ, concerning the Holy Spirit, and concerning the truth of the church.</P><P>Since the Reformation, the disputes that we have heard among the Protestant churches are not of different views concerning the gospel. Rather, they are on the church and the government of the church. If in this aspect we would allow the Bible to speak instead of allowing the Protestant churches to speak, the question of church government will be as clear as the gospel is. Whether or not we are willing to do it, we should allow the Bible to solve all problems. If we do this, we will see that neither the teachings of Luther, the teachings of Calvin, the Anglican Church, nor the Genevan Church, has brought us back to the initial position of the church. The Body of Christ and the spiritual house built with living stones are the truths that they are ignorant of. We know that the churches then were all "national churches." This means that the churches had as their boundaries the national boundaries and were thus national churches. At the time of the Roman Catholic Church, all the nations had become Christianized already. Those who had left Jezebel were now taking Christianity as the state religion. All that the Reformation gave them was a new creed. It did not give them a new organization. Almost all the Protestant churches were national churches. This is, of course, an imitation of the work of the Roman Church. We cannot find such a method of church organization in the Bible. If believers take the Reformation as the standard of truth, they are fully wrong at least in the matter of church organization. When Luther stood up personally to oppose the Pope, we see him fearless in power and bold to contend with the strong forces. We have to admit that this is God's work manifested in a weak human being. The Reformation is truly a work of faith. On the other hand, however, we have to admit that there were elements of politics in the Reformation. Those who rose up to support the Reformation probably did so more for the reason of opposing the domination of Rome than with a zeal for the Word of God. In the end, soldiers, politicians, nations, and believers were standing on the same ground and were engaging in the same struggle. After this period of history, there was, of course, no hope for the post-reformation Protestant churches to be the same as the churches in the first century.</P><P>With such mixed elements involved, the power of God's Holy Spirit was surely not willing to join in. Under such conditions, organization becomes crucial. But how is the church to be organized? If the true church is to be preached, all the soldiers, politicians, and nations must be dissociated from it. However, to do so would invite greater persecution and shame; it would allow Rome to prevail and would take away all possibility for Rome to be removed. This was a difficult problem facing the Reformers of the day. If they excommunicated their supporters, how could they stand up to the enormous military and financial power of Rome? However, if they wanted to establish a genuine church, they had to relinquish these politically oriented helpers. I dare not say that they had never thought about what a genuine church should be, but I dare say that their joining hands with the arms of flesh had at least prevented them from seeing the genuine church. We rejoice because there was the Reformation, but we are sorrowful because the Reformation was not thorough. This inevitably brought in the national churches, the necessary creeds, and the power of politics as the backbone of the church.</P><P>This is very obvious. If creeds were necessary, God's wisdom surely would have prepared an infallible one. God's love would surely not have forgotten such a thing and would not have held it back from the church. The fact that God did not give us such a creed shows that such a creed is useless. On the contrary, God has given man a Bible. From this we should know the mind of God. Even if man's creeds are infallible, they cannot be complete. If the Protestant churches would not act according to the man-made creeds but would take the whole Bible as their guide in faith and conduct, they would not be so wrong. They would, on the contrary, have more perfect works and conduct. Why do men want creeds? It is because they want a simpler and clearer outline of the doctrines than what the Bible provides! The Bible is unlimited, but the creeds are specific. With the Bible, different people may have different views concerning it, but with the creeds, the meaning is unified. Whether to the church or to the world, the creeds provide no variable interpretations. However, we consider the words of the Bible to be more obvious and easier to understand than human words. The content of the Bible is most comprehensive; it meets the need of all ages. All the creeds of Protestantism, with all their bylaws, constitutions, and charters of organization, written or verbal, tend to lead men away from the Bible. Even if these things are scriptural, they still tend to present man's word as the standard of truth. All the creeds and constitutions of the church were drafted from the beliefs of those who established these constitutions and creeds. To do this causes many scriptural truths to become hidden. In many cases, man is even able to keep the creeds while opposing the Bible. However, the apostle said, "All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work" (2 Tim. 3:16-17). The condition for understanding the Bible is not great knowledge, great wisdom, or profound study, but a single-hearted desire to be a man of God. Even the poorest and the most foolish man can do this. As a result, it is possible even for him to understand the Word of God. If believers would be men of God in position and in conduct, it would not be difficult for them to understand the Bible.</P><P>What man wants now is not the Bible but the creeds. The creeds are there to verbalize the doctrines believed. But the Bible cannot be crystalized into a few or a dozen articles of faith. Rather, it has to be expressed as a real living in those with the spiritual life. The words of 1 Corinthians 2:14 are real. No wonder man replaces the Bible with the creeds, and no wonder the Bible is not adhered to as much as the creeds are among the national churches. Since the Bible and the creeds are basically different, it is impossible for God to have a mind for the creeds. It is not God's will to have churches with nations as units. The Lord considers spirituality as the foremost thing in the understanding of His will, but man wants to replace His wonderful Word with the shallower creeds, with the hope that those without any spiritual life would also understand the truth and would become nominal members. This is the difference between God's mind and man's mind.</P><P>All these speak of the Protestant church being like Sardis, living in name, but dead in reality. The Lord's description of their being living in name and dead in reality is a moral description of their condition. At the same time, it is a condemnation of their sin of nationalism. It is possible that there is more to the Lord's rebuke, but at least it encompasses these things. In the eyes of these persons, what is there is not the church of God, but a Christianized world in which Christ is scattered. They have received some truths. This is, of course, better than the Roman Catholic Church. However, their method of organization has put shame to the truth they preach. Their goal is not to be separated from the world, but to join the world to the saints. They do these things only to create a more proper atmosphere for the end time to come. Men can put on a cloak of Christianity, but they are "lovers of self, lovers of money,...unthankful, unholy,...having an outward form of godliness, though denying its power." God's commandment concerning these people is "from these also turn away" (2 Tim. 3:1-5), but not many people practice this command.</P><P>There is not much difference between the Protestant organization and the worldly social organizations. At this time the former is slightly more improved than the latter, but in the end both will be the same. This, of course, is something that the world welcomes. As long as there are some political machineries behind it, it is good enough. God's word becomes useless, other than to serve as a text for fables. The creeds and the constitutions of the church have become the standard of faith and conduct in the Protestant denominations. What is authoritative are the creeds and the regulations rather than the Bible. Even if someone is able to prove the unscripturalness of some church constitutions or creeds, these predetermined creeds and constitutions cannot be changed. When such things happen, the only result will be a twisting of the Bible to justify the record of the creeds and the regulations. To be an officer or a nominal member of a denomination, one has to abide by the creeds and ordinances established by the founder of that denomination. Man's establishment is to be respected, and the Bible suffers loss. This is the principle of work in the many Protestant denominations.</P><P>The Holy Spirit has also become useless. The universities and the seminaries are now able to produce the preachers and the pastors. The overseers and the senior pastors are now able to ordain preachers and pastors. The nominal members are now able to hire preachers and pastors. There is no need for the gift of the Holy Spirit anymore. As long as a man has the desire, he can be sent to school to learn to do the work of preaching, and if he lacks the money, he can sometimes be subsidized to do so. As long as one passes the vote, or passes the examination by a committee, he can be ordained a pastor, even though he may not have any calling of the Holy Spirit. As long as the members of a church have enough money, they can hire a capable and eloquent man to be the teacher. No one cares about the commission of the Holy Spirit. Some may say, "For human beings to manage the church enterprise is bound to error. However, we have to do our best!" But my friends, the suffering is self-inflicted! Where does it say in the Bible that we should take care of the church enterprise? It is Christ the Head of the church who ordains, commissions, and supplies through the Holy Spirit. These works are within His jurisdiction; others cannot substitute for Him. If you try to overrun Christ's position and take over His work, you will surely fail.</P><P>Even Christians have become useless in such an organization! Every citizen born in the country where this church is becomes a Christian at birth. Once they have registered their names and have learned the lessons and partaken of the Holy Communion, they become Christians. Other than these things, there is no standard as to who is a Christian and who is not. Other than a procedural admittance into the religion, there is no taste to have any other tests, for to do so is not only troublesome procedurally, but it demands a proper spiritual insight.</P><P>Yet many times, we still come to beseech this beleaguered and grieved Holy Spirit, asking Him to breathe the breath of life into the dead congregation. However, if the Holy Spirit is to work, He is only allowed to work within the confine of the committees, the executive meetings, the constitutions, regulations, and ceremonies. Otherwise, man will consider the Holy Spirit contentious and divisive! The strange thing is that in the history of all Protestant denominations, all divisions occur right after a great revival. If the soul is close to God, it will treasure His word, and one can no longer be a faithful servant of a denomination. How can the new wine be put into the old wineskin? Although man tries to expand his own denomination by means of revivals, more revivals result in divisions than in unions. Of course, the Holy Spirit is not for confusion but for peace and oneness. Nowadays, man considers the leaving of the denominations as a division, but those who say this should know the meaning of the word "division." The Bible speaks of "division in the body" (1 Cor. 12:25). How can this body be a certain denomination? When man replaces the Bible with the creeds, joins the living to the dead, and comes under great church leaders instead of coming under God's name, the Holy Spirit will draw a clear line between what is of man and what is of God, between the dead and the living, and between man's authority and God's authority. Often He would take out many fresh and forgotten truths from the treasure house of His word and would test to see if His people are still honoring His word and acknowledging His place. The old and familiar truths will, of course, not be able to stir up the conscience. The test of godliness is in the fresh truths. Fresh truths demand fresh recognition. The fresh price may be great. This is to make the giver and the receiver withstand the tide of the age so that they would be separated from the drifters in the world.</P><P>Sometimes this separation occurs among the most genuine Christians. This is, of course, a sin, for believers ought not to be separated. Yet those who are not willing to bear the cross, who are afraid of paying a high price, who have not heard God's calling, and whose hearts are not single enough to know the Lord's way of leading His people will have to bear the responsibility for this separation. We are responsible to tell others that the Lord never leads His own children to take opposite paths. It is possible to be diversified in our ways, but if our ways are opposite one to another, it means that some are not of the Lord. We should never believe that because the believers are simple and foolish, they therefore have no more need of God's light to shine on their path. If a man commits an error and falls, it is not because God is unwilling to give Him the light. The light of the whole body is the eyes, for they are the entrance of light. Most of man's problems come in at this point. Hence, if there is division among genuine Christians, the responsibility is not on those who leave behind the things shown by God as sin. Rather, the responsibility is on those who join and communicate with sinful things and who ostracize those who are truly for the Lord. Otherwise, if everyone leaves behind the unscriptural things, where can there again be distinctions? If one sincerely departs from evil, it is not a cause for division. On the contrary, it is an excellent help to join and unite believers together. In such a position, when the Holy Spirit is not grieved or infringed upon, He will properly join together His people and will strengthen them. The Holy Spirit cannot be united to evil. If one wants to be united to evil, that is, to everything that is contrary to the Bible, naturally the result will be division.</P><P>We do not agree with, nor do we underestimate the sin of division. The many divisions in Protestantism are a shame to Protestantism. If a man considers this as a glory, he lacks a sense of shame. Many think that the variety of denominations nowadays is good in that it provides different people with different religious flavors. This is surely a fact, but this same fact tells us the naturalness and unspiritualness of such denominationalism! Of course, errors are multifarious, contradictory, and divisive. Although truth is also multi-faceted, there is only one truth. Of course, the church of God can encompass all those who are of God, whether they be old, young, or infants. Although intelligence can vary and understanding can be different, it is still possible to preserve the oneness. To the extent that the name of Christ is not put to shame, the church of God requires that we receive those who have views different from ours. Not only should we receive them, but we should love them. This is vastly different from the creeds. If a man adheres strictly to the content of the creeds, he will not tolerate anything that deviates in the slightest. A man has to acknowledge a creed in its most crucial points as well as in its minutest details. He must believe that a baby is regenerated when he is sprinkled, in the same way that he believes in the Son of God. Of course, we know that sometimes man does not adhere to the creeds that strictly, but a righteous Christian will not do this. If he does not believe in the creed, he should leave the organization that subscribes to the creed. If he does not leave it, then his minimum duty is to adhere strictly to the creeds, even those he does not agree with. However, for those who know God and whose eyes are open, how can they follow the direction of man's creeds, charters, and constitutions in the things of God? Surely they cannot and dare not do this.</P><P>Hence, no matter which way one looks at it, "division in the body" is a sin. Whatever price one pays to separate himself from sin is good and necessary. For this reason, whenever we see God's children awakened, they are no longer able to cooperate with their former denominations. Initially, there is self-examination and zeal; eventually, one sees the sin of the denominations or other organizations and will suffer at heart. If he takes grace from God, he will forsake this sin. However, after this revival, failure comes when man does not realize God's special way which He has ordained for His children in the midst of the church's failure. Many are trying to organize an apostolic church at the present time when there are no more apostles. Surely they are bound to fail. Scarcely can we find one person who has a genuine desire to return to the primitive church. This is not surprising at all, because it is impossible to return to it anyway! Hence, the common thing that we see is the removal of an old organization only to be replaced by a new organization. When the truths received in the great revivals turn organizational, they lose their initial power. The decline of power is directly proportional to the increase in organization. If we consider the people used by God in church history to revive the life of His children, we will realize that they were all men of faith, power, love, and endurance. Those who followed them were mostly pure, simple, and clear people, but when the number of followers increased, organization came in. Then, the freshness of power was gradually lost. After the founder leaves, in three to four generations, the organization becomes the same as the old organizations that they had abandoned before! Then, there is the need of another new denomination or sect to replace it! This is the reason that there are now over fifteen hundred denominations of various sizes in the world today. To boast of the past glorious history of persons in a denomination is a proof that the denomination is sick, because it has lost its former power!</P><P>Many think that organizations and creeds are there to preserve the truth. However, have the organizations and creeds ever preserved the truths that man desires to preserve? This is the question we wish to ask. The honest ones must concede that they never preserve. What God gives to man can never be preserved by man. If man can believe in God's giving of grace, he should believe in God's preserving of such grace. God gave truth to man through His own words. Yet man turns around and creates a creed out of God's word under the excuse of the preservation of God's truth! What their posterity follows is not God's own word but the creeds of their forefathers. The Spirit and life are gone. God is kept outside of them, and He has to work again to raise up another group of people.</P><P>These are the conditions of Protestantism. They demonstrate to us the Lord's verdict: "You have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead." We should pay attention to the fact that the Lord is talking about the condition in the Protestant organization as a whole. It does not refer to any one particular denomination. Even if we are most undiscerning, we have to admit that the condition in Protestantism is indeed as described here. The situation everywhere testifies to the Lord's word. At present, almost all the real works of gospel preaching and edification of the saints are done by believers outside the Protestant-recognized denominations. They are all done outside the recognized denominations. Protestantism has become an empty name only. It is full of man-made ceremonies. This is indeed pitiful. The corruption of Jezebel is not as lamentable as this. The prevalence of sin stirs up our indignation. It is most sad that what begins as the work of God ends up in death and coldness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE TWO</H2><P>Now the Lord can say, "Become watchful and establish the things which remain, which were about to die; for I have found none of your works completed before My God."</P><P> This shows that they originally belonged to God. Although they were "about to die," they have things "which remain." However, their works were not found to be completed. The church in Sardis has not left the first love like the church in Ephesus did. Neither has it been persecuted under Satan's hand like Smyrna was. It does not live in the world and does not hold to the teaching of Balaam and the Nicolaitans like Pergamos did. Unlike Thyatira, it has not tolerated Jezebel to tempt the servants of God to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices. It has not degraded into the condition of Laodicea, where God would spew it out of His mouth. Here grace is still able to do something, which is why grace is still doing something. We have seen how the church in Sardis has forsaken the corrupt works and teachings. The failure of Sardis is a negative one, the absence of completed works. Its works are not evil; they are only short. Its goal is complete, but its works have not attained to its goal.</P><P>Here it is not a question of Jezebel, the eating of idol sacrifices, or the spewing out of the Lord's mouth. Those here have received the outward truths. They are merely lacking in the power of life. They already have the fa&#231;ade, the name, and the teachings of Christianity. However, Christ is not in their organizations. I am not saying that the Lord is not in their hearts. They have been delivered from Jezebel. However, they have fallen into the dead formalities. God is not judging the work of the Holy Spirit here. Rather, He is judging the way man applies the grace and gifts of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>We have seen that God lit the lamp at the time of the Reformation. His goal was not to put the lamp under the bushel but to have it shine on the lampstand and to enlighten the whole household. God is not judging His own work. He is watching to see if the lamp is shedding the light He has provided. In these seven churches we observe that the Lord considers some of their conditions good and some of their conditions bad. He judges the churches according to their own condition. Even if the condition of a church is very good, the Lord does not reckon that as the result of the work of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>What the Lord has built is complete. His work is just like Himself. The Lord expects the church in Sardis to be complete in its works so that it would match His original design. The Lord has His standard. According to this standard, He is judging His church. The church is judged according to what it has and according to what it can have. The Lord will never judge the church in a way that is below this standard. This is a lesson to us all. Have we demonstrated righteousness and holiness before the Lord? The One who justifies us is God. The One who expects us to be righteous practically is also God. The One who separated us is the Lord, and the One who expects us to be practically sanctified is also the Lord. There are, of course, those who confess Christ, but how few there are who would live out Christ! What the Lord is reproaching now has nothing to do with Balaam or Jezebel. What He is requiring now is completion. The extent that He has entrusted Himself to the church is the extent that He expects His church to fulfill its works. The question here is not whether or not one has borne fruit, but whether or not one has borne fruit that is meet for the Lord's use and satisfying to the Lord's heart. The question here is whether or not our fruit is up to the standard that will match the price that He has paid, so that He may feel His former labor to have been worthwhile. This is, of course, not a question of salvation. It is about a saved person's judgment which he will receive from the Lord.</P><P>Of course, we know that when Christ receives the authority and when eternity is about to begin, God will cause His grace to be fully manifested in the saints. However, before this time God entrusts this responsibility to man. Although in the future God will write the law upon the hearts of the Israelites, at Sinai He had already given the law to them. We can see this not only with Israel, but also with the Gentiles. God entrusted the world government to the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, but Babylon and all the nations which were raised up after Babylon failed. However, when the nations of the world become the nations of the Lord Christ, world government will become perfect. The same is true with the church. God has perfected the church in Christ and has granted it power to express the glory of the heavenly Head on earth. However, the church has also failed. Although it has received grace, it has not borne the fruit of grace as a proof of its receiving grace. But in the future God will have "the glory in the church...unto all the generations forever and ever" (Eph. 3:21). However, now is the time of responsibility. If the whole church has failed, then individual saints must bear the responsibility. Of course, in the future the same will be true, because at that time the nominal church will be spewed out of the mouth of the Lord. This is not a question of salvation but a matter of responsibility.</P><P>At the time of Pentecost, God gave the Holy Spirit so that His church would bear fruit, and indeed there was the fruit. But today the situation is greatly different. Corporately speaking, the church has not borne the fruit it is responsible to bear. As a result, the responsibility now falls on the individuals. "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches." This word causes us to ask ourselves what we have done individually as a witness to God's grace. Of course, our testimony before the world can never match the power manifested by the first church, but we should fulfill the measure that we have received individually. We should walk worthily of our calling according to the power that Christ has now given us. If we consider this matter before God, we will see that we have not attained individually to the measure of grace that we have obtained. What we are struggling for, striving towards, and longing after is a "name." However, the question here is how much fruit we have borne according to the grace that we have received. If a believer has not reached this state, his work is not complete before God. In this case, an outward spiritual name will only serve as the cradle for his shortcomings. May the Lord preserve us from being satisfied with a mere spiritual name. It is most dangerous for believers to trust in a spiritual name. Those who are preaching for the Lord should be all the more careful about this matter!</P><P>Many times, due to our single-hearted work and our untiring diligence, we lead many to Christ and receive a great following of men. The "self" then creeps in! As a result, we receive a name that is living. We may become satisfied with the people we have gathered around us and may rest in this fruit and forget the Lord of life and power. Naturally, this makes the Lord unable to use us anymore, and we will end up with many shortcomings. How different the Lord was when He was on earth. In every step of His way, He tried to make men ignore Him. He could do this because He was walking with the Father. The more He went on, the brighter it became, until eventually, those following Him could not bear the light. Even those following Him were not able to bear the light. "Behold, an hour is coming, and has come, that you will be scattered each to his own place and will leave Me alone; yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me" (John 16:32). Our Lord did not try once throughout His life to use the slightest means to attract people to Himself. He was satisfied with His Father, and He believed that all that the Father gave Him would come to Him (John 6:37). In this way He went step by step until He reached His death at the cross.</P><P>Paul was the same. He was full of faith and power. He himself walked with God, but those who walked with him could not match his standard. Therefore, when he went on, the others had to be left behind. As a result, his way became more and more lonely. Towards the end he said, "All who are in Asia turned away from me" (2 Tim. 1:15). "No one was with me to support me, but all abandoned me" (4:16). Although the Lord used Paul to gain a lot of people, when he was suffering in prison, only one person went to visit him!</P><P>The more we fellowship with God, the lonelier we will become. Our responsibility is to have our works complete before God. All our works should be done in the light of God's countenance. To take this attitude will inevitably make us lonely. The result of faithfulness is to be oblivious to man's criticism. Those works that are not complete are mostly the works that have a name they are living but are dead. This is because these works are done for men and not for God.</P><P>Although the more faithful we are, the lonelier we will become, we should nevertheless walk with other saints and should seek to please them. The closer we are to Christ, the more we should have a love for all the believers, for those who have seen the meekness of Christ cannot possibly be hard towards others. When we draw near to God, surely we experience God's pleasure. Yet the more we seek for God's pleasure, the lonelier we will become. As the pathway of Christ is forever lonely, ours is the same. Although He is full of kindness and humility, and although He is so willing to listen to us and to wash our feet, in the end He was still left alone.</P><P>"Become watchful." The believers in Sardis had forgotten the coming of the Lord. This is not right, for they were not like this at the beginning. They should have renewed their faith and aspiration. This calling to watchfulness proves to us that the church in Sardis consisted of saved Christians. The Lord cannot ask the unbelievers to be watchful. Only those who have life can be watchful. If the Lord were speaking to the unbelievers, He should have asked them to repent and to believe in Him to receive eternal life. The calling for watchfulness can only be heard by the saved ones. The Lord wants them to be watchful concerning His coming. They had chosen the way of the world and were living in the world as if everything was going to be the same forever. Although there was no corruption or superstition, coldness and sleepiness were their true condition. Watchfulness, therefore, is the unique solution.</P><P>"Establish the things which remain." They have indeed received much from the Lord; however, they have not kept what they have received. Although there were things that remained, that which remained was about to die. Because the situation was bleak, stagnation and desertion became a temptation. The Lord held them responsible for recovering the original condition, for establishing those things which were about to die, and for keeping them from dying, because those things which remained were God's own works.</P><P>The word "dead" in verse one is explained here by the words "about to die." The Lord does not consider the church in Sardis a church filled with perishing ones. The Lord's word here is to a saved church. Although in Protestantism, represented by Sardis, there were many perishing ones mixed in with the others, we have to remember that Sardis was an actual church at that time. This actual church had received salvation already. We should view all seven letters in this way; there was an actual church and there is the period represented by that church. These seven churches show us how they will be judged according to what they are responsible for. This is the precursor of the judgment seat. This is not a question of grace but a principle of judgment. What is spoken of here is not the position of salvation but the condition of responsibility. Naturally, there were many nominal and unsaved ones in the churches throughout the various ages represented. However, in those seven actual churches, although there were many sins, the people there were saved ones. Even if the church was as corrupted as Thyatira, as weak as Sardis, and as cold as Laodicea, the people there were still saved. If we realize that what is covered here is not a matter of salvation but a matter of responsibility, we will see that the death mentioned in verse one does not refer to the fact that they have no spiritual life, but to the fact that their works were cold and that those who remained were dying. Under such circumstance, there is no way to strengthen them except by diligent revival.</P><P>"For I have found none of your works completed before My God." There is one pair of eyes constantly searching His churches. What the Lord is rebuking here is not what they have done but what they have not done. It is not what the Lord has seen but what the Lord has not seen. The Lord told them to establish that which is about to die. This proves that they were saved already because no dead person can strengthen one who is about to die. If the church in Sardis were dead, how could God accept their work, the work of a dead person? Since the Lord is only rebuking the believers in Sardis for what they have not done, it proves that their works were not dead works (Heb. 6:1).</P><P>From man's point of view, their works were living and were outstanding, but in God's view, they were not complete. If the standard of the believers' work is based on man's praise, approval, or disapproval, how low is this standard? According to man's view, the standard of the believers' work is diligence, zeal, labor, and advancement, but God's view is completely different. If the One who judges us is God rather than the world, what does it matter if the world loves or hates us! If our work is like that of Sardis, being incomplete in motive, power, self-denial, diligence, and purity, what use is it even if the world considers us living? On the contrary, even if the whole world considers our work dead, useless, and worthless, as long as we are complete before God, His smile will be a sun that dispels all dark clouds. All those who are satisfied with the world's praise are performing dead works before God. Our hearts should stay far away from the world's approval or disapproval. They should be concerned with God's valuation. The good pleasure of the Father is our goal. What does it matter what the world says?</P><P>In the eyes of the world, Protestantism succeeded in the work of the Reformation and is great and glorious. Even Protestantism itself considers its achievements great beyond comparison! However, what God cares for is not how it has rejected Jezebel and her teaching, but how it treats the authority and power of Christ. It is right to leave Rome, but why does one not fully listen to Christ? It is a joke and not a moral achievement to boast that one is not like Jezebel. If Jezebel is the yardstick of the believers' work, and if one thinks that as long as he is different from Jezebel he can boast of himself, then the children of Jezebel can also justify themselves (Rev. 2:23). Although today the denominations have not overstepped as much as the Roman Catholic Church has, God's question now is, "Is My Son the Head of the church?"</P><P>"I have found none of your works completed before My God." This is the excuse of Protestantism. By this one word, we see the Protestant denominations tolerating sin on the one hand and not fully following the Bible on the other hand. They think that it is impossible to be "complete." Therefore, they give up seeking to be "complete." To them, a church or an individual can never be complete. Why then should one bother to be free from all sins and to follow all the Scriptures? Because of this excuse, many sins that God condemns are settling in the denominations. This is actually the life of the denominations. It is a lowering of the standard of God. However, God never says that a church does not need to be complete just because He has not found its works completed. He cares for completion, and He judges His children according to this completion. He is willing to grant grace to the defeated ones. However, He hates those who lower His standard and sit in contentment. We would rather lift God's standard high and find ourselves unable to match it, than to lower His standard and presume that we have succeeded in it.</P><P>The Reformation was a great revival. Sardis is the condition after a great revival. If there is a revival, yet no willingness to submit to God's will and to yield to Him the proper place, the revival will not continue. No matter how much grace we have received at one time, if we are not careful, what we have will become the letter and will gradually be weakened. Self-contentment is the cause of lack. Unwatchfulness is the reason for weakening. Nothing will satisfy the Lord except completion, and nothing will satisfy the lovers of the Lord except completion. Many times we have a good beginning, but we do not have a continuation in bearing spiritual responsibility. As a result we fall short of completion. This is the danger of the church and of individuals. All those who do not advance to completion will regress to weakness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE THREE</H2><P>Verse 3:"Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and keep it and repent. If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief, and you shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you."</P><P>How vain it would be if believers would forget what Christ remembers. Here we have two things: the receiving and the hearing. First, we have the grace that they received and the position that stands in grace. Second, we have the word of God which they hear, which is the rule and guidance of their faith and work. They have received grace and have heard God's word. What God is causing us to remember is not anything that we have not received, but that which we have received. The Lord is holding His church responsible for the grace it has received and the word it has heard. God gave us this word for us to follow, and God gave us this grace to enable us to follow.</P><P>This is very relevant to Protestantism and to its many denominations. The Reformation was a great revival and a return to the original ground. Of course, it was only a partial recovery. What they have heard and received at the beginning was an open Bible as the yardstick of all faith and work. Because Protestantism has forgotten what it has heard and received, the Lord called it to draw near to the work of the Holy Spirit once more and to stir up this work which was lost from among them. The Reformation has released the Bible already and has recovered many lost truths. Although these are not complete, Protestantism is slowly forgetting even these things. For this reason the Lord calls them to remember what they have received and heard. They boasted about themselves and allowed the truth that they acquired to slowly drift into death. They did not struggle to recover what the Reformation had not recovered. Although they have not filled themselves up with sin in the way that Rome had, they were more lacking than the corrupted Roman Church in good works. They had the Bible already, yet this benefit only increased their responsibility. What the apostles commanded and what the Bible recorded are things that the church should always keep. However, they have not been the authority and the tradition of the church.</P><P>During the past few centuries, the Protestant denominations have received many revivals from the hand of the Holy Spirit. Power, freshness, zeal, fellowship, communion with the Lord, obedience to the Bible-these are the works done by the Holy Spirit during the revivals, but it is a pity that they do not last. The Lord's calling here is to remind those who were once revived and who have since gone back, of the grace and teachings they had received from the Holy Spirit. The reason the effect of the revivals did not last was not the inadequacy of the power of the Holy Spirit but the absence of an absolute heart towards the Lord and His word. If there were more absolute submission, there will surely be better results.</P><P>We should consider the first part of this verse with the last part of the previous verse. "For I have found none of your works completed before My God. Remember therefore how you have received and heard." The Lord is calling them to come back to what they have received from God before. The Lord does not consider the present church to be more modern, and that therefore every church can freely set up its own ordinances. The Lord has not called them to reform themselves. He is reminding the church of their fall from God's former, unique standard. Here the Lord has not given the church the liberty. The Lord's word, like the Lord Himself, lasts forever and is always powerful. The church can act contrary to the Bible, but the Bible will not thereby lose its authority. Those who depart from God's law will surely be judged. The principles of judgment are in the Bible. All those who want to follow the Lord must come back to the Lord's ordinances. One cannot assume that since circumstances have changed, the apostles have passed away, and the church has been corrupted, one can therefore ignore the word of Christ and can walk according to his own will. The Bible tells us that as sinners we were washed, sanctified, and justified by the Holy Spirit. The Bible also tells us that the Holy Spirit operates according to His own will in the church. Although we do not see the manifestation of tongues, miracles, and healings in some places, it does not mean that the Holy Spirit is not there. Although the manifestation of the Holy Spirit may be different at times, the fact that He is Lord in the church is immutable. God has not called us to invent some institutions better than what the Bible has revealed. His command is that we walk according to the truth once delivered to us (Jude 3).</P><P>What is mentioned here is the first step in the recovery. We should remind ourselves of the special grace that we have received before and the truth that we have heard. These two things are justification and the Bible respectively, which we received at the time of the Reformation. The persons here are judged according to the light that they have received (cf. Matt. 11:21-24). Protestantism will be judged by what it has received in the Reformation, but is it not true that justification by faith and the Bible are now overlooked by Protestantism in faith and conduct? How can it stand before the judgment seat? The Lord wants it to remember. In other words, He wants it to compare the former condition with the present situation so that it will know its lack and will keep God's commandment.</P><P>"And repent." The fact that the Lord put the calling for repentance here proves that these ones are saved. The calling to repentance does not come at the beginning of the letter. If the Lord is speaking to a sinner, he should loudly proclaim the word for repentance first, and then say something else, as He did in the old days when He preached the gospel to people. The repentance here refers to the Lord's calling for repentance of the believers. They have backslidden. As such, they have to repent. If they compare their former condition with their present situation, they should realize that they have to repent. They should change their conduct and should be more alive in their response to the things of God.</P><P>"If therefore you will not watch." Watchfulness is the most tiring and burdensome thing. To be watchful means that one has to preserve himself from sleep. Man's heart is prone to weariness and is most unwilling to be on the alert for the things happening in the world. Unless we are drawing near to Christ, and unless we feel His searching and supervising, it is difficult for us to be watchful. Even in our works, we need to be watchful. If we draw near to Christ, we will have a clear view concerning everything. However, a tendency toward generality will rob us of this view. If we consider our trials in the presence of Christ, we will see that the way of deliverance is very easy, but many times when we are in the midst of the trials, we lose this view. In trying circumstances, it is very easy for us to lose the clear view before Christ on account of sorrow and weariness. Our eyes must be single to do the will of God. The more humble we are, the simpler we will become. If we are simple enough, God will guide us through His Spirit and His word. The wise ones cannot know God through searching and studying, yet a babe can receive the wisdom of God by faith. We must be watchful and must remain in God's light so that we know where we stand. Foolishness is not God's will. It is neither God's pleasure to work in a dream. Every time we put our foot forward to take a step, we have to know if the One sitting in heaven approves of it or not.</P><P>"If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief, and you shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you." If believers are not watchful, their end will indeed be solemn! "I will come as a thief." This is the way the Lord deals with the world. To the world, "like a thief in the night, so the day of the Lord comes" (1 Thes. 5:2). But to the believers, the Lord's word was "you, brothers, are not in darkness that the day should overtake you like a thief" (v. 4).</P><P>If believers are not watchful, they will be treated like the worldly people! Positionally speaking, they are God's children, but in conduct, they are like those in the world. For this reason, they will be treated the same way as those in the world are treated when Christ comes back. Their works are not completed before God because none of them matches the grace God has bestowed. What God is saying here is that if one does not walk according to what the Lord has given him, and if he is not watchful but slumbers like the world does, he will suffer what the world will suffer. Have these ones not followed the ways of the world already? They must now be careful, lest they suffer the punishment that the world will suffer. If one enjoys the pleasure of the world, he should suffer the judgment of the world.</P><P>The Holy Spirit gives a comparison between the true believers and the worldly people in 1 Thessalonians 5. He is comparing the prepared believers with the unprepared ones. The Lord tells us how a saved believer, like the believers in Sardis, if unwatchful, will suffer loss. The unwatchful Christian will suffer what the world suffers. The Lord did not rebuke them as He rebuked Jezebel. But since they are not much different spiritually than those in the world, except for the fact that they are saved, they will suffer the judgment reserved for the world. This has nothing to do with the matter of salvation. It has to do with being delivered from the great coming world tribulation (Rev. 3:10).</P><P>What a solemn matter this is! Many believers around us today have been saved, but positionally speaking, they have joined themselves to organizations that put the Lord to shame. In works, they have forgotten what they have received and heard. In life, they sleep like the worldly people do! Now we are constantly in touch with this kind of people. When we consider the judgment in the house of God in the future, do not our hearts tremble? The day is coming fast, but we do not know how fast it will be. We cannot find anything else more solemn than this in the Bible-saved believers will suffer the same treatment as those in the world.</P><P>"I will come as a thief, and you shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you." The word "come" here is a special word. This word means that the Lord has come; He has stopped His action, because He has arrived at the destination. This means that the Lord has already come and is already in the air. His move has come to a stop there. Those who are watchful and prepared have already been raptured, but those believers who are spiritually like the ones in Sardis will not know of such a "coming" of the Lord. They will not know when the Lord will come. They may know about it later after some saints are raptured. According to the original language, there should be the word "have" before the word "come." The Lord's coming and His receiving of the watchful believers is a thing that will be known to the unprepared believers only when the event has already come to pass. The Lord has come already, yet they have missed it.</P><P>We have said that these believers in Sardis are saved ones. We must constantly be reminded of this fact because it shows us that it is possible for saved believers to be left on the earth. The Bible never mentions "the rapture of the church." A wrong kind of expression will result in a wrong kind of teaching. The Bible never tells us that every saved sinner, irrespective of his degree in life, will be raptured at the same time. According to 2 Corinthians 5:10, every believer will be raptured, irrespective of his spiritual condition. However, the Bible never tells us that their rapture will happen at the same time. On the contrary, the Bible shows us that there is at least more than one rapture. In the book of Revelation alone, the matter of rapture is mentioned seven times.</P><P>Rapture is typified by the gathering of the wheat into the barn. Before the wheat is gathered into the heavenly barn, there is the unique requirement of maturity. Because there are differences in the timing of maturity, there is the distinction between the firstfruit, the harvest, and the gleanings (Lev. 23). Of course, the unwatchful and unprepared believers cannot be harvested while they are still green. The degree of maturity determines the timing of their harvest. That wheat is left in the field longer does not mean that it is unwilling to become mature. It only means that it has to wait to become mature. Every believer will be raptured, but it will not happen at the same time.</P><P>In the prophecy the Lord gave at the Mount of Olives, He warned the believers, "If the householder had known in which watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into" (Matt. 24:43). The Lord compared Himself to a thief and the believers to a householder. What He meant is that the householder should be watchful so that a thief cannot break into his house and steal his goods undetected. The believers must be watchful in the same way if they do not want to miss the Lord Jesus' coming, in which the watchful saints in the church will be raptured undetected. As a thief comes undetected by the householder, in the same way, the Lord will come undetected by the Christians. This kind of teaching shows the Christians that they should not be content just because they consider themselves Christians and have already received eternal life. Instead, they should be watchful and prepared so that they can be raptured. The condition for being raptured is not merely to be a Christian. The condition for being raptured is to be a watchful Christian. The basis of one's rapture is not his life but his living.</P><P>If believers miss the Lord's coming, they will be left on earth to go through the great tribulation. The great tribulation was originally prepared for the world (Rev. 3:10), but if a believer lives like those in the world, he will suffer like those in the world. This is the same as with hell, which is prepared for the devil, but which a sinner who follows the devil will suffer as the devil suffers (Matt. 25:41). These believers will learn obedience through suffering. In the end, the Lord will also come to take them. This is the teaching that is most urgently needed today. Many Christians are already clear about the proof of salvation, but they think that to receive eternal life is the final thing that a person needs to do. They fail to realize that salvation is only the first step in the way of life! They think that while the world will be suffering the tribulation on earth, they will be raptured to the heavens which they have not loved very much anyway! How can this be possible? A spirit of ascension foretells a body of ascension. If the believers' heart and spirit are not in heaven, even if they are raptured, they will not enjoy the preciousness and joy of the rapture.</P><P>Now let us consider the difference between the saints and the world concerning the Lord's coming. The day that will come upon the world will be "the day of the Lord." That is another name for the great tribulation. What will come upon the believers will be the coming of the Lord. At the time God pays vengeance on the sinners remaining on earth, "the day of the Lord" will be a "sudden destruction" upon them, "and they shall by no means escape" (1 Thes. 5:2-3). But the hope of the believers is for the Savior to appear before "the day of the Lord." This "day" is recorded after the end of chapter six of this book (Rev. 6:17; 16:14). The hope of the believers is the coming of the Lord (2 Thes. 2:1) and not the day of the Lord (v. 2). However, if they are not watchful, they will lose the joy of the coming of the Lord and will suffer the tribulations of the day of the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE FOUR</H2><P>Verse 4:"But you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments, and they will walk with Me in white because they are worthy."</P><P>"A few names" means a few persons. The Lord knows every one of their names; He pays attention to every one of them. "A few names" also indicates the smallness in number. In the vast Protestant church, there were only a few persons who had not defiled their garments. In the previous churches, the errors were with a minority, but in Sardis, only a few are not in error. The Lord has many praises for Sardis. Amidst so many sins, the Lord detects all the bits of goodnesses. If there are only so few who are pure in the Protestant church, is it not ignorance for one to take the teachings of the Protestant churches as the standard of truth?</P><P>The glory of these few lies in their not having "defiled their garments." They have kept themselves "unspotted from the world" (James 1:27). The principle of Christian living is to hate "even the inner garment spotted from the flesh" (Jude 23). Although others have lost their chastity, these have not walked with the world. The church in Sardis has fallen below the level of the world. For this reason, she will be judged with the world. To keep themselves pure, they have to depart from the world. However, the world here is no longer the simple world, but a world adopted by Christians. These are the ones who have overcome the "ecclesiastical world." Of course, this is more difficult to overcome than the world itself. However, believers cannot shrink back just because it is difficult. Satan often induces the believers to mix themselves with the worldly ones. Those saints who mingle themselves with the world will not make the world holy. On the contrary, they will defile their garments. The result of being mingled with the world is to forsake the confession of the testimony of Christ, which the world can never tolerate. One who confesses Christ must be a separated one. Since he has believed in One who was rejected by the world and has looked to and testified for the One who will come to judge the world, how can he be spared from man's opposition? Separation is most crucial.</P><P>Once a believer realizes that the ground he is standing on is contrary to the Scripture, he should realize the seriousness of this fact and the immense measure to which he has fallen short of the Lord's grace. It is a pity that many who clearly know the error of the standing of their denominations have been considered leaders by others. They have not left the sins they are aware of, but on the contrary, have sought refuge in the fact that Asa and Jehoshaphat did not remove the high places. What a pity it is that God's word is twisted to accomplish Satan's goal. God's warning has been disguised to justify man's sin. Although they may be enlightened in their mind, the Lord still requires that the believers' conduct be counted worthy of His command. Of course, Satan considers the Lord's way to be a way of darkness, and the way of the world to be more of love, humility, conciliation, and order. However, the word of God has already denied this. Soon, the power of God will also deny this before the world.</P><P>"They will walk with Me in white." Since these persons have kept themselves pure on earth, they will obtain God's full pleasure before Him. They have maintained their purity in walk at the time of their responsibility. As a result, in the future at the time of reward, they will receive purity in the same nature as their present separation. Perhaps they are now being misunderstood and shamed, but they have contented themselves with the Lord's praise in private. Soon, their garments of white will be manifested before all men. Everything that pleases God, whether or not it is known to men, will not be overlooked eventually. Everything that is of God will not be lost, for everything that is of God will remain forever. "He who does the will of God abides forever" (1 John 2:17).</P><P>"Because they are worthy." This is not talking about eternal life, because eternal life is God's gift (Rom. 6:23). Everyone who will receive it will have it. There is no question of worthiness there. It is those who are already standing on the ground of grace and who have been justified by God who can receive the reward here. From the time a believer is regenerated until the end of his journey, his own conduct will determine if he is worthy for the first resurrection (Luke 20:35) or the kingdom of God (2 Thes. 1:5). Grace is the basis of everything. Without grace, there is no possibility for man to be accepted before God. But when God rewards man based on His righteousness and according to man's work, the question of "worthiness" will be determined by the believer's own work after salvation. In the future judgment of the believers' work, reward will be given fully according to the worthiness of the believers' work. A sinner cannot perish merely because he is unworthy, but a believer cannot receive the reward if he is unworthy.</P><P>Since these persons have good works, the Lord will reward them according to what they deserve. Since they have preserved their spiritual garments undefiled, when Christ reigns, they will walk with the Lord in white, a sign of their holiness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSES FIVE TO SIX</H2><P>Verses 5-6:"He who overcomes will be clothed thus, in white garments, and I shall by no means erase his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."</P><P>Although such was the condition of the church, and although there were only a few who had not defiled themselves, the Lord still has the promise for the overcomers. This promise causes our hearts to rejoice. If we have ears to hear, we will be joined to the overcomers in all the churches. To overcome at the present time may involve moving to a newer ground. It may involve separating from brothers who share the same general faith, or it may mean rejecting a great name in the record of faith and separation to Christ alone. Only the overcomers are the overcoming ones. Those who build the graves of the prophets (Matt. 23:29) are not the overcomers. Only those who are sent by the Lord to be despised, misunderstood, and persecuted by the admirers of ancient ones can be the true overcomers. God has to teach us to be independent. This independence comes from a practical and humble trust in the Lord. Even the greatest disciple of the Lord is nothing in the face of the Lord Himself. If we hope to have companionship in the matter of obedience to the Lord, I am afraid that it will be very difficult to find such companions. This way is never crowded. It is difficult to find anyone on this way who loves to be called "master." If it is sufficient to trust in the Lord alone, why should we not depart from defilement and walk with the Lord instead? If you ask for companions, your companions may later lead you to another way. Overcoming requires independence. This way of separation is not division, for we are not led by our own will but by the Spirit and the Word of God. If Christ is more lovable to us than everything, our love to the brothers will surely be full.</P><P>The overcoming in faith is not obtained in the applause of the crowd but in following the true Joseph who has left His brothers. Although God has not created the present confusion, He does allow these sins to exist so that we can be more conformed to the life of Christ when we walk in His path. He is not telling us to submit to sin but is charging us to overcome. In these few letters, the defeated believers seem to have retreated to the rear, and all the exhortations, promises, and rewards are for the encouragement of the overcomers. The Lord is now choosing those who would reign with Him. Only the overcomers are able to meet this call. Sins and trials are there only to prove who are the overcomers and who are the defeated ones, although both are saved. If there is nothing to overcome, there will be no need for overcoming, and subsequently there will be no overcomers. Overcomers are created by the circumstances. Those who desire to be overcomers, yet who want to take the common way, do not understand the meaning of warfare and the value of victory. The time is short now; the end is near. God's grace is sufficient for all the believers' needs. All those who are not willing to use this grace are destined for failure.</P><P>The Lord's promise to the overcomers in Sardis is divided into three parts: (1) "Clothed thus, in white garments." White garments are mentioned four times in this book. In chapter seven it mentions a great multitude which no one could number, who have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. This speaks of their purity. In chapter six the Lord gives a white robe to those underneath the altar. This speaks of the Lord's approval. In chapter four, we see the elders clothed in white garments. This speaks of their sinlessness. In chapter nineteen we see the bride of the Lamb clothed in white linen. The Holy Spirit gives us an interpretation there: "For the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints" (v. 8). This last passage shows us that the promise of the white garment refers to the condition in heaven in the future. The Lord promises that the result of overcoming will be manifested in heaven and will be enjoyed in heaven. All those who have faithfully separated themselves from defilements on earth will be rewarded before the Lord.</P><P>White is the color of cleanliness. The garments of the angels are white (Matt. 28:3; Mark 16:5; John 20:12; Acts 1:10). The Lord's garment on the mount of transfiguration was also white (Mark 9:3). The garment of the Ancient of Days is also white (Dan. 7:9). White robes are the garments of heaven. If believers have heavenly works on earth, they will receive this garment. They will not only be adorned by it, but will walk with Christ. This speaks of their position in the kingdom. How different is this from the condition of the unwatchful ones! These latter will be naked and will have their shame exposed to the world. The white stone in 2:17 is personal and private. The white garment here is public and seen by everyone. May we receive the private approval and the public glory.</P><P>(2) "I shall by no means erase his name out of the book of life." The book of life is an ancient book, for the names of many people since the foundation of the world are recorded in the book of life of the Lamb (13:8). Exodus 32:32-33 says: "Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin-; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. And the Lord said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book." Psalm 69:28 also says: "Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous." From these, we can see that it is possible for one's name to be erased from the book of life. Before we go on, let us remember three things: first, in the book of Revelation, there is only one book of life. According to 13:8, this book of life is in the hand of God and in His plan; no one can put his name in it. Second, if a name is to be blotted out, that name must first be recorded there. Since this book of life is "the book of life of the Lamb," no one can write his name there except the Lamb Himself. Third, since the name of this book is called "the book of life," all those whose names are there must have life. For now we will not worry if their names will be blotted out later. Suffice it to say that every name that can go into the book of life must have at least once received life.</P><P>According to the two passages we just quoted, it is possible for one's name to be removed from the book of life. Even the Scripture which we are considering now contains this meaning. Only the overcoming saints will not have their names erased from the book of life. This means that the defeated Christians will surely have their names erased. However, Revelation 20 tells us that at the judgment of the great white throne, all those whose names are not in the book of life will be cast into the lake of fire. Does this therefore mean that a saved person can still perish? This is a hard point to understand. Those who believe in the possibility of perdition for believers will hold on to this verse. Those who do not believe in the believers' perdition will try to explain this verse with many concepts. But according to the teaching of the Bible, the problem here is the same as the one in 2:11. We believe that our explanation in 2:11 is fully scriptural. Every careful reader of the Bible has to agree that on the one hand, the Lord's sheep can never perish, but on the other hand, he cannot say that a sinning believer will never be punished. Hence, this, like other passages, refers to the temporary removal of the defeated believers' names from the book of life, particularly at the time when God rewards the overcomers in the millennium. At the end of the millennium, their names will be reinstated. Hence, by the time the last judgment comes (20:15), they will still be saved. When God first put the names there, it was out of grace. Although His calling and reward are without repentance, how can God tolerate the believers' sins and act contrary to His own nature? Those who believe in the Lord Jesus will be saved forever, but when God comes to reign over the world in righteousness, some will suffer punishment for the sins they commit after they are saved.</P><P>How precious is this promise! At the present time, when believers follow the Lord, the church erases their names and considers them as evil (Luke 6:22). Although their names can be removed from man's register, the Lord promises this little flock that their names will by no means be erased from the book of life. Man can reject them, but the Lord will receive them. What a comfort this is!</P><P>(3) "And I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels." The Lord did not say that He will confess the overcomer's name before the world. Perhaps the world will not know them, yet before the Father, He will confess their names, because the Father sees everything in secret (Matt. 6:6). He will also confess their names before the Father's angels. The angels are paying attention to their conduct. They even notice when a female believer covers her head (1 Cor. 11:10). Although it seems a small thing to be separated from the sin of the Protestant church, and perhaps men would despise this, in that day, the Lord will extol the names of these believers before the Father and before the heavenly hosts. What a promise this is! The Lord will confess our names! If we are faithful, one day our Lord will call forth our humble names before the myriads of angels and before the Father! Our neglected and despised names will be in the mouth of the Lord and in the ear of the Father and His angels, as well as in the book of life. How wonderful this is! May everyone of us have an ear to hear the Lord's word to Sardis, and may none of us be lacking in the characteristics of the overcomers in Sardis.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>APPENDIX-<br>FULFILLMENT IN HISTORY</H2><P>The church in this period is the Protestant church after Luther's Reformation. The Lord's rebuke, warning, expressions, and promise have much to do with us. What we contact every day and what we live with all the time are the Protestant denominations. If we understand the Lord's intention towards the Protestant denominations as revealed in this letter, we will know how to act.</P><P>The characteristic of the various Protestant denominations is that they are living in name and dead in reality. They are prosperous in all kinds of institutions, charitable works, social aids, and educational and medical enterprises. Man easily admires their achievements, but their spiritual condition before the Lord is dead. Even their work of preaching is no exception. There are two kinds of Protestant churches: one is the state churches, like the Anglican Church in England; the other is set up freely by the people, such as the Methodists. Among both kinds of churches, life and death are mixed together.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>SUB-SECTION SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>PHILADELPHIA-<br>THE FAITHFUL LITTLE FLOCK<br>(3:7-13)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE SEVEN</H2><P>Verse 7:"And to the messenger of the church in Philadelphia write: These things says the Holy One, the true One, the One who has the key of David, the One who opens and no one will shut, and shuts and no one opens." </P><P>This period of church history is very interesting and crucial. How wonderful it is when we consider that the Lord has only praises for their situation and nothing else. In this letter the Lord does not have one word of rebuke. There are words of warning, and we should pay attention to them, but there is no rebuke at all. How good it is that such a holy and true One would show us His smiling face! Of course, this is the proper condition for Christians to have all the time. But we have to praise God that in the history of the church, although the condition of Philadelphia was not found before this time, Philadelphians already existed. When John was writing this letter, there were already people like those described here. The more adverse the condition in the world, the more the Lord praised them. No matter how much opposition there was in the environment, nothing could stop them from being the Philadelphians. Circumstances could not stop them. On the contrary, these encouraged them to become the Philadelphians. This is the condition for being a Philadelphian. If we have the spirit of the Philadelphians, all the sins in the world or in the church will only make us more Philadelphian.</P><P>Before we study this letter in detail, let us first try to understand the nature of Philadelphia. To understand Philadelphia, however, we must first remind ourselves of what Sardis represents. Sardis undoubtedly refers to the predominate state churches established after the Reformation. Among them, the power manifested in the Reformation was lost. Many people were Christianized, but they were living in name only. In reality they were dead. Although among them there were living and faithful ones who had not defiled their garments and who were worthy to be clothed in white and to walk with the Lord, those in the midst of Sardis were not able to make Sardis like them. Actually, Sardis is just the world. It is the world Christianized, but still the world. The only difference is that there are some Christians scattered among it.</P><P>In principle, Philadelphia is absolutely different from this. The principle of "brotherly love," the meaning of the word Philadelphia, is a union in life. This shows the work of the Holy Spirit in recovering the true church. Although the true church was lost in the confusion of Sardis, the Holy Spirit is uniting the Body of Christ apart from all names on the basis of brotherly love. We have heard much mentioning of the term revival. Actually, many revivals are but a fresh manifestation of the power of the Holy Spirit in God's Word for the salvation of sinners and the edification of believers. There is no return to the original ground, as we have mentioned earlier. But here, the situation in Philadelphia is a revival of the church. In Sardis we see the revival during and after the Reformation, but in Philadelphia we see a further revival. Not only are the extreme sins removed, but there is a return to the original condition of the church. The original condition of the church is one in which there is no denial of the Lord's name and there is the keeping of the word of His endurance.</P><P>The tone set by the Lord in this letter shows us that this portion of the Scripture (Rev. 3) is not talking about the church in the first centuries or in the Middle Ages. It should be the church in this age developed from the first centuries and the Middle Ages. Sardis is the beginning of the church in this age; there were no defiling sins, but there was the lack of vitality. Anyone who has any spiritual insight will see that Protestantism has not succeeded. The present situation of Protestant churches is a cause of shame for those who call themselves Protestants. Men now boast of the fact that they have freed themselves of the tyranny of the Pope, the authority of the church, the sin of worshipping the virgin, the saints, and the angels, and the heresies of the Mass and purgatory, etc. But are these all the fundamental teachings there are? A man can be delivered from all these sins and be a most proper Protestant, yet be utterly unconcerned for the love and glory of Christ and be involved in a thousand other kinds of sins. Many disputes seem to be questions of outward opinions. Actually, the inward struggle is for the covering-up of one's own faults and shortages.</P><P>One thing can be said: in no other place in the Scripture can one find more comfort to encourage those who faithfully love the Lord Jesus and His interest on earth than in this letter. This letter tells us what the Lord's eyes are set on and are appreciating during the last few pages of the church's history on earth. It is not the corruption of the Catholic Church, the ceremonies of the Protestant churches, or the lukewarmness or pride of Laodicea. There may be some remnant in Thyatira. There may be a few faithful ones in Sardis, and perhaps some in Laodicea may open the door to let the Lord in. None of these, however, will satisfy the Lord's heart. What the Lord wants is a little flock who will completely and fully honor His name and keep His word. We have to remember that Thyatira and Sardis are very ecclesiastical. They appear in the world as very organized and "orderly" organizations. Philadelphia and Laodicea are more a description of moral condition than of organization. It would be easier for us if we read on with this in mind. In Philadelphia, we see everything differently. What draws our attention first is not what the Lord has done or what He has but who He is.</P><P>"The Holy One, the true One." The Lord does not reveal Himself here in the same way that He revealed Himself to the other messengers. "The Holy One, the true One." This is not the same as the glory which He has in chapter one. It is what His faithful saints know Him by in His moral virtues during this period. Sardis was too much into the creeds, but Philadelphia longs after the Lord in whom she believes. The apostle did not say, "I know what I have believed," but "I know whom I have believed" (2 Tim. 1:12). This is the source of faith and love. Indeed the person of the Lord Jesus is more outstanding in this letter than in others. The Lord Jesus reveals Himself in this letter more than in any other letter. Before He mentions anything else, He first mentions Himself as the Holy and true One. In other letters, the Lord did not reveal His own virtues this way. Formerly, He only revealed His own magisterial nature to the churches. It is not the same here. The question here is not one of a church satisfying the demands of a judge, but a church matching the heart and nature of the Lord.</P><P>Only holiness and truthfulness are compatible with the Lord's heart. Hence, the Lord unveils Himself as the Holy and true One. What is spoken of here is what is in the Lord Himself. He tells us of what He is personally and what He expects the church to do. What He is in Himself, He will work into His church. What is covered here is the expression and demand given by the Word of God. He tells us how the Word of God is absolutely moral and faithful. He acts according to God's revelation and is faithful to God inwardly and outwardly. He works faithfully according to what He declares in Himself until the works are completed. We must not forget that this revelation of the Lord is eternal; it is given to the saints of today. Unless we match His holiness and truthfulness, we will not please Him. We must match His nature and must be compatible with the words that He declares and is about to fulfill. If we set before us the Christ who is holy and true, we will surely depart in our heart from everything corrupt and formal, for we are drawing close to One who is absolutely opposed to these things. He is the Holy One of God and does not have even a trace of defilement.</P><P>He knows no sin. Yet for us He became sin (2 Cor. 5:21), that God may be glorified in His holiness. Now He has resurrected and ascended as "the Holy One" (Acts 13:34). All along He was without sin. Yet for man's sin, He did the work of purging sin by dying the death on the cross. God is holy. Hence, when He stood in the place of the sinner, God rejected Him. But when He died, the sinner no longer bore any history before God. Man is judged in the flesh already. All those who give place to the flesh oppose God's holiness. All genuine desires for the pursuit of holiness in the believers are works of the Holy Spirit. But lately, this kind of pursuit in many ways has come short of the mind of God. Many people have made excuse with expressions such as "sanctification by faith" and "sanctification in Christ" and have tolerated many things that are contrary to the truth. Such toleration is to give place to the flesh. But God wants us to realize experientially that our old man has been judged and annihilated in the death of Christ. He wants us to see that He is "the Holy One" in resurrection and glory. We are resurrected in Him already. Now we have His Holy Spirit and have become a heavenly new man. This will deliver us from our self and will turn us away from the self as the focus, so that we will be joined with the heavenly Christ in mind and in love.</P><P>Christ is also "the true One." The church is no longer true. She has lost her significance in being a testimony of the golden lampstand. Her reality no longer matches her name. However, Christ is still true. Whatever He does, whatever office He holds, whatever name He acquires, and whatever He is, does, or says to God and to man are absolutely true and real. He is the true God, the true light, the true bread, the true vine, and the true Witness. Both as God and as man, He encompasses and expresses everything true. Whatever aspect we can ascribe to Him, He is true in that aspect. God has blessed the world in Christ. Man does not need to find anything apart from Christ. He has become our wisdom: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. There is no discrepancy between His aspiration and His reality. Our life on earth today is just the experience of all that is in Him as the reality.</P><P>The saints here are the saints who keep the word of the Lord. When God's word is honored in this way, Christ's own character will rule over man's heart. When His command becomes our mark, He Himself will control our love. When the eyes receive the light, the whole body is enlightened. God's word connects us to Christ. In this way, we have a "written Christ." Of course, the most important thing is to first receive the living Christ for salvation, then understand this Christ through the written Word. When we receive the testimony of the Holy Spirit for Christ, our heart will be closely drawn to "the Holy" and "the true" One. In this way, the Christ seen from the Word of God will gain our love, and we will no longer want to depart from the written Christ. Only by having a living relationship with the living Christ can we be preserved from deception. A holy Christ, in whom is the truth (the reality), is the best protector of our spirituality. A lifeless Christianity has no power to prevent any deception. When a church is no longer able to separate itself in a simple way, when it has no more faith to cut off help from the world, and when there is confusion everywhere, only a Christ who is holy and true can come forth to lead His people.</P><P>The apostle said to Timothy, "And that from a babe you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through the faith which is in Christ Jesus" (2 Tim. 3:15). Surely there is no knowledge better than the knowledge of Christ. This in fact is the key point in the first Epistle of John. Only this Epistle tells us that the Lord Jesus is the Holy and true One. The fathers who are in Christ "know Him who is from the beginning" (1 John 2:13). They can tell others what the true Christ is like. They know Him as "the Holy One, the true One." What we need is not strange and novel inventions, but to return to the One who was in the beginning, the Christ being revealed at the beginning. The need of this age is to return to the purity in Christ, to know what kind of Christ He is that is revealed in the Bible. What we lack is not the Christ invented by church history and by the present age, but the Christ who was there from the beginning. If our hearts are joined to the Christ recorded in the Bible, then the Christ we love now will be the Christ whom we are waiting for and the Christ who will come to take us away. Indeed there is no living Christ apart from the written Christ. The Lord has revealed His own holiness and reality (truth). No one can draw near to Him without separating himself from the sin He hates and submitting to the truth He reveals. God's word is separating. It is also edifying. To depart from all sins marks one's acceptance of God's word. True acceptance of God's word means that one walks according to the word and not according to the conscience of the majority. This is the mark of our entry into the holy of holies. Only those who are in His light can see light.</P><P>How rarely is absolute truthfulness found! A strict way is often lonely and without sympathy. When one considers the forlornness of this way, he will realize that there is no great work in this way. The temptation is to bend and loosen a little. Many have failed in this matter. No price is paid and no labor is expended in succumbing to failure. How often are we deceiving ourselves? What is the result of arguments, reasonings, research, and studies? Can one stop practicing the truth after these debates? The conscience may be bribed temporarily, but the truth will still testify to the error of a man's work. Do we have the courage to express what we see as right? Do we have the boldness to be "influenced by others" in order to arrive at the proper understanding? The mind is not the problem. The root of all problems is the conscience. The crisis in the intellect is built up mainly from an unwilling and dishonest heart. If the heart is willing, the revelation of Christ will become trustworthy (John 7:17). If the heart is not willing, there is nothing to say. Nevertheless, it is important to be true.</P><P>Holiness comes before truthfulness. Many times, truthfulness is there, but holiness is neglected. Man considers some authority to be from God and that believers should submit to it. Under such circumstances, the believers are intimidated from even taking a closer look and a better examination of the truth of the matters. The conscience may be active, but it is darkened. As a result, one follows man rather than following the Lord. However, to the Lord holiness is a guarantee of truth.</P><P>It is good for the Lord to reveal Himself this way to Philadelphia after Sardis. He manifests Himself here. When a church has turned worldly and desolate, what can renew its life and change its attitude? Nothing else will do it except the Lord's revelation of Himself. This is the nature of the Gospel of John. The Lord Jesus' person is especially prominent in this book. In the first half of the book, John revealed the Lord Himself to us. In the second half, he revealed to us the Comforter sent by the departing Lord. This book has a special place in the Word of God. The date it was written was quite late; it was written after all the other Gospels. It is especially suitable for the day of apostasy. At the beginning, it tells us that everything was dark. Even when the true light was shining, man did not know Him. This light is the life of man. No matter how desolate the world is, the Lord Himself is still the light and the life.</P><P>Although there were people in Sardis with clean works, they were not absolutely submissive to the Lord in everything. Of course, this cannot satisfy the Lord's heart. The Lord must raise up a testimony for Himself. The way to raise it up is to entrust Himself to the love of the believers. If we do not have an absolute heart for Christ, He will not be satisfied. Sin separates us from Him. But now He is revealing Himself. All who see Him will serve Him joyfully.</P><P>The characteristic of Philadelphia is that although it does not have much power, it is very close to the Lord Himself. The characteristic of the fathers in the first Epistle of John is that they "know Him who is from the beginning" (1 John 2:13). Although what Philadelphia has now is but a little power, she has not denied His name. What is revealed in this letter is Christ Himself and not a matter of power. Although the present time is similar to the time John wrote his Epistle, when the church was desolate and antichrists were everywhere, to be drawn close to Christ is the protection from all dangers. Of course, we feel and know that it is hopeless to try to recover the original power and gifts of the church. However, Philadelphia's nature is the drawing near to the Lord and the keeping of His word. Unlike what He did in Sardis, here Christ is not manifesting His power; rather, He is revealing His attributes (the Holy One) and His word (the true One). With these two things, we are well able to discern everything. Although everything around them has failed, they should still maintain their singleness and purity which they have toward Christ. This is the same as what the Epistle of John says: "We might know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true....This is the true God and eternal life" (1 John 5:20). "And you have an anointing from the Holy One" (2:20). In the days of the church's failure, the Holy One and the true One is the source of everything to them.</P><P>"The One who has the key of David, the One who opens and no one will shut, and shuts and no one opens." This is, of course, related to the revelation of Himself in chapter one as the One who has "the keys of death and of Hades." Hence, part of the meaning here is the Lord's authority to raise people from the dead. However, according to the teaching of 20:4-6, the opening of Hades is for the initiation of the kingdom. Because the Lord has the authority of resurrection, He is able to accept or reject people's entry into the kingdom. In the Bible, the first resurrection and the resurrection of the just mean the same thing as the kingdom.</P><P>This is the third title of the Lord here. It is the most wonderful and outstanding one. Only one other place in the Bible uses the expression "the key of David." In Isaiah 22 the prophet first spoke of "a day of discomfiture" in Jerusalem (v. 5, which refers to the coming great tribulation) and how destruction would come. However, the people of the city did not fast and pray because of this. On the contrary, there was "exultation and rejoicing," and the people said: "eating and drinking, for tomorrow we die!" (v. 13). This is obviously a denial of resurrection in unbelief (cf. 1 Cor. 15:32). Because this sin was serious, the Lord was in wrath, and said: "This iniquity shall by no means be covered until you die" (Isa. 22:14).</P><P>Not only were the people this way, even the rulers were the same. Hence, the prophet spoke to the key person of the government at that time: "Thus says the Lord Jehovah of hosts: / Get up, go to this steward, / To Shebna, who is over the king's house, saying, / What are you doing here and whom do you have here / That you have hewn a tomb for yourself here, / As he who has hewn a tomb on the heights, / As he who has cut out a resting place for himself in the rock? / Jehovah soon throws you far away, you mighty one, / And He grasps you firmly; / He will wind you up tightly; / Like a ball He will toss you into a wide land. / There you will die; and there the chariots of your glory / Will become the disgrace of the house of your master. / And I will drive you from your position, / And from your standing He will pull you down. / And in that day / I will call to My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, / And I will clothe him with your tunic, / And I will strengthen him with your girding sash, / And I will put your dominion into his hand; / And he will become a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem / And to the house of Judah. / And I will set the key of the house of David upon his shoulder- / When he opens, no one will shut; / When he shuts, no one will open" (vv. 15-22).</P><P>This treasurer was expecting long-lasting glory and a peaceful and noble death. That was why he spent so much time and money to hew out a sepulchre in the rock. This means that he had forgotten about resurrection. David believed in resurrection. That was why he did not build for himself a great sepulchre. He knew that it would not be his eternal habitation. Bible scholars know that God's promise to David was not fulfilled until resurrection. Since this treasurer had lost the key of hope of the house of David, which is the hope of resurrection, he was no longer qualified to hold the key of office in the house of David. God promised David: "And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee" (2 Sam. 7:16). This can only be fulfilled in resurrection. It cannot be otherwise fulfilled. This promise never had a continuous fulfillment because the house of David later forsook the throne. As such, God's promise and hope to David, like His promise to Abraham, cannot be fulfilled until resurrection.</P><P>The Lord dealt with Shebna according to his unbelief. He was to die and was to be run over; his sepulchre was to be left to another. He would lose his position, and others would take over his office to be the real keepers of the key of David. God chose Eliakim. The name Shebna means "repent now." But this call did not produce the desired effect. Now God was raising up Eliakim, which means "God will raise up." He was the son of Hilkiah. The name Hilkiah means "God's portion." Resurrection is God's reserved portion for His servants. All those who do not believe in Him will not have a portion in the "faithful things" of David (Acts 13:34).</P><P>Here in Revelation 3, the Lord Jesus considers the word of Isaiah to be referring to Him. He is the Lord of the house of David, and He holds the key to all promises. He is the one resurrected from the dead, who has "the keys of death and of Hades." The grave is not the glory of the believers. Resurrection is the glory of the believers. The gates of Hades cannot prevail against Him. Listen again to the words of the apostle: "And we announce to you the gospel of the promise made to the fathers, that God has fully fulfilled this promise to us their children in raising up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, `You are My Son; today I have begotten You.' And as to His having raised Him up from the dead, no longer to return to corruption, He spoke in this way, `I will give you the holy things of David, the faithful things....Now David, having served his own generation by the counsel of God, did indeed fall asleep and was buried with his fathers and saw corruption; but He whom God has raised did not see corruption" (Acts 13:32-37).</P><P>From this we see that the key of David is the key to open the grave. When the Lord Jesus opened the gates of Hades, no one could shut His believers inside. When He shuts the unbelievers in it, no one can open it. When He opens the abyss, countless locusts will fly out to injure men (Rev. 9). When He shuts up the abyss, Satan will be kept there for a thousand years (Rev. 20:2-3). Both powers are equally important, and the Lord Jesus has absolute possession of both. This is why He could say "to the prisoners, Come forth, / To say to those who are in darkness, Show yourselves" (Isa. 49:9). And this is why He could gather together the sinners, "like prisoners gathered in a dungeon; / And will be shut up in prison, / And after many days they will be punished" (Isa. 24:22). The Lord Jesus has absolute power over Hades; He can overcome Satan, the one who holds the authority of death.</P><P>As the One who holds the key of David, the Lord Jesus is the Lord of resurrection and the King of the kingdom to the believers. The gates of Hades open and close according to His will and His authority. Although He is not exercising this authority to rule over the world at present, He has already been made "Lord and Christ" by God (Acts 2:36). He revealed His authority in this way to comfort those overcoming believers who have slept, so that they would know that when the time arrives, He will make them share in the first resurrection, a thing in which many ordinary ones will not be able to participate (Phil. 3:11). A little later, He told the living overcoming believers that He would open a door for them also. In a moment we will see this. Although what is covered here has to do with Hades, it has lessons for us also. It seems as though He is not interfering with anything outwardly. To the unbelievers, He keeps His silence and ignores all present confusions and difficulties in the same way that He did on the boat one day when winds and waves beat fiercely against it. However, He has never given up His authority. He holds the key to all administrations, and He alone can open and close. How comforting this is! Many times it seems as if we are shut up by men of flesh. However, although our eyes may perceive things in this way, and although the ones shutting the doors may be acting according to their self will, they are but instruments in the Lord's will. We do not have to open a shut door because what is shut is of the Lord. On the other hand, if the Lord opens a door, we can be at rest knowing that no one can shut what He has opened. The Lord Himself holds the key of David. Hence, believers need not look to the world or to other believers. What a great temptation this is! Nevertheless, He has the key, and what He has is what they lack. Man can work everywhere. Jezebel, the false prophets, and all those who are living in name but dead in reality can do their own works, but the One who is holy and true is the sovereign Lord of all. The more the believers are weak, the more they need Him. They are without power and cannot open the door, but the Lord opens the door for them, and brings them into a broad and unrestricted place. The emphasis here is on the Lord. If it is right with Him, it will be right with everything else.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE EIGHT</H2><P>Verse 8:"I know your works; behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut, because you have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name."</P><P> "I know your works." This is a special word. It is different from what the Lord told the other churches. Here the Lord is not inspecting their works, but telling the suffering and weak believers that He knows their works and is satisfied with them. It is not the case with the other churches; the Lord there was examining the nature of their works. He told Sardis: "I have found none of your works completed before My God" (v. 2). Here, however, He does not have such penetrating searchings. He knows our works and is satisfied. If He requires completion from us as He has required of Sardis, will we not find it hard to meet His demand? All mixed motives, lack of faith, laziness, and self-love will cause us to bow our heads before Him. Actually no work of ours can match the grace that we received. There may be a lot of natural activities, and there may be much praise from man, but how much of God's pleasure is there generally? We have to praise the Lord! Indeed if we pay attention to the condition in the world and the church, our hearts will sink and we will forget that Christ knows everything. However, the Lord does not say that these ones have nothing. He says that they have still kept His word and have not denied His name.</P><P>"You have a little power." Here, as in other places, the Lord first mentions the commendable things. He draws attention to their having "a little power" and praises them for this. There is not much power, only a little of it. Here we do not see the power and gift of Pentecost. Here we do not have the great faith that removes mountains. "The day of small things" constitutes the last page of church history, in the same way that it did at the time of Judah. The days of Ezra can never be compared with the days of David. It is impossible to have the original condition in the latter days. It is good enough if one has the first love. Although eternal life and the power of the Holy Spirit never diminish, we are inevitably bound to the age in which we are living. Of course, we should not be affected by it. However, we are not without blemish in this age. The Lord is here telling us the condition of the faithful little flock at the end of the church age. What the Lord sees is a little power. There is no promise here of a revival to the prosperity of the apostolic age. Although there is only a little power, the Lord approves of it.</P><P>The Lord knows what to approve. Although there are no miracles and works of wonders of Pentecost, the Lord finds enough to approve of. The age of the outward filling of the power of the Holy Spirit is over. The Bible has not promised that there will be a revival of the original condition in the last days. What Philadelphia has now is only a little power. Weakness has become their mark. This must necessarily be so; because she exists at the same time as Thyatira and Sardis, she must bear the character of a remnant. The fleshly ones and those who have not been deeply perfected in the Bible will surely admire the manifestation of the power of the former days. But those who understand the way the Lord works today will realize that what the Lord approves is but a little power. Our present responsibility is to keep the Lord's word and to exalt His name. We are not here to bring in a new Pentecost. Philadelphia has nothing to boast of before the world and before the other believers. Our conduct should not be different from the character of Philadelphia. We should not seek for conspicuous works. Rather, we should be satisfied with the Lord Himself.</P><P>Although there is no manifestation of extraordinary power today, despite much imitation of Satan, the Holy Spirit is still with us. Praise God that there is not one day when the church is without the Holy Spirit. Even in the dark age of the Roman Church, the Holy Spirit was still with the church. Of course, He was not there justifying sin, nor approving of rebellion. His presence was there to vindicate the reality of the Lord's word: "The Father...will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever" (John 14:16). It is wrong to look to the Holy Spirit to come upon us. This is the hope of the Jews. If the church prays in this way, it proves that the church is not the church. Of course, we have to admit that we have too often grieved Him. Surely we should confess our sins before God, because we behave as if we have never received Him. But let us praise God, because He is not only living in us, but has joined us together to be a habitation of God. We admit that the outward form of this is already broken down, yet the fact still remains. This is like saying that a man may fall because of circumstances; nevertheless, he remains a man. The church has the Holy Spirit already. Yet she can still fall! This will cause us to humble ourselves. Many say that if we have another Pentecost and the Holy Spirit comes again from heaven, we will not fail again. However, man has had Pentecost already. This is a wrong hope. God has not called us to new gifts but to wait humbly before Him and to confess that although we are Christians, we are still rebellious. Although the Holy Spirit dwells within us, the golden calf has been erected again and again, so that there is now as much sin as there was among the Israelites. This is what the Lord wants us to realize.</P><P>The Lord may not want to bestow outward glory on a defeated church. Yet He is still dispensing the necessary grace and power to sustain personal spirituality. There is no shortage of nourishment from the life issuing from the Head to the Body on earth. For example, in the church the miraculous gifts such as tongues and healing may have decreased, but the gifts received from the Head for the edification of the members will never decrease, because "no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church" (Eph. 5:29).</P><P>Ephesians is a book that speaks specifically about the church as the Body of Christ. We see there that the function of the gifts are "for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ" (4:12). However, the book of Ephesians does not mention the miraculous gifts. In Corinthians we see the gifts of healing, tongues, interpretation of tongues, etc. In this way, we see the Bible dividing gifts into two kinds. One is the miraculous gifts, which as recorded in Corinthians are the works of miracles manifested by the church before everyone for the purpose of helping the church to testify to an unbelieving world. The other is the gift which flows out from the Head for the nourishment of His whole Body. This distinction of the gifts is clearly depicted in the Bible-1 Corinthians 14:22 is the most obvious verse. The miraculous gifts, possessed only by a few, can pass away, but the nourishing gifts will remain forever. Sometimes they come from outward testimonies. Sometimes they come directly from the grace given by the Lord. No matter how it comes, the supply from the Head can never stop. This is what we see from the church in Philadelphia. Her nature is weak and powerless. Yet she is closer than the other churches to the powerful Lord. She loves the Lord more and has a more intimate fellowship with the Lord. Even the Lord's promise to her is a close union with Himself.</P><P>Although Philadelphia is utterly weak, she is faithful. Many times there may be much power without, yet within one is weak. This is what the Holy Spirit means in 1 Corinthians 13. The believers can speak the language of the angels and the tongues of all men. They can know all mysteries and all knowledge, yet at the same time be utterly weak and powerless. It is a most dangerous thing to have more of a manifestation of outward power than an inward working and a oneness with God. The inward life must match the outward power.</P><P>We must remember that God's marvelous gifts and revelations are not the source of our strength. Miracles and works of wonder do not render people strength. They may comfort us at the time of sufferings and may testify for the word of God at the time of trials, but they will not give us the inward strength. Paul's experience is one example of this. The experiences of being caught away to the third heaven and into Paradise and of hearing unspeakable words which are not allowed for man to speak are most definitely amazing. They gave Paul some comfort at the time of trial. However, this did not afford him any inward strength. Except for the special work of God, he would have become proud. Of course this shows that the strength was not there. Still, whenever he felt that he was weak, the power of God came upon him. Our hearts are more evil than anything. Unless we are watchful, we will glorify ourselves with the gifts of God. Our temptations are not the same. This is why we need different kinds of "thorns" to preserve us. It was in this thorn-pressed condition that Paul realized his weakness. Paul had to have this feeling of weakness before he could realize where strength lay.</P><P>Hence, whether or not God gives us miraculous gifts, the greatest strength lies in the mingling of a feeling of weakness with faith. It is possible to realize one's weakness without losing one's faith. The Lord Jesus had the same feeling when He went through the sufferings: "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save Me out of this hour" (John 12:27). Suffering drew the Lord closer to the Father. How about us? When sufferings come, we are drawn to the sufferings themselves and begin to doubt God's power. Our minds are always set on the method of deliverance. They are stuck to the environment or to ourselves and are closed completely to God. But the Lord Jesus was not like this. As soon as sorrow came, He said: "Father, save Me out of this hour." If the consideration of our weaknesses does not turn us to trust in God, we are being faithless. A trust in God always brings strength. Difficulties can come, and God can allow many things to expose our weaknesses, but simple faith always advances forward. It never plans what to do ahead of time. Instead it trusts in the unfailing help of God. The real strength is a steady following of the Lord. "The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine" (1 Sam. 17:37). In the eyes of David, there was no difference between the lion, the bear, and Goliath. He was equally weak to them, and they were equally fierce to him. Yet he was equally unafraid of them, and he trusted equally in God's deliverance from them. God has delivered me once; now I "reckon" that He will deliver me again. This is faith. This is totally different from the attitude of the ones sent by Moses to spy out the land, who considered themselves as grasshoppers. They forgot to compare God with the children of Anak. Instead, they compared themselves with the children of Anak. Of course, they failed in this way. "I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me" (Phil. 4:13). This is the secret to all victories. It is useless to look to ourselves, for there is nothing in ourselves except weakness. However, if we look to the Lord, we will receive deliverance.</P><P>"You have a little power." In a situation where the general condition has corrupted, God's way is not to award those who have great strength. When the Israelites returned from Babylon, they saw God's awarding of abundant grace. However, this was no outward power. At that time there was nothing outward worth exhibiting. Even their enemies mocked them saying that foxes could tear down their walls! (Neh. 4:3). The same is true with Philadelphia. The Israelites did not have strong fortifications to withstand the Samaritans. The Lord was their wall of fire. The first thing they built was an altar to the Lord. The Lord occupied the first place in their hearts. Since the Lord was their wall, they could wait for the construction of other works to come later. Here we did not have the slaying of the firstborn by the angels, and we did not see any special calamities befalling the enemies. God did not perform any special miracles for them. Their only promise was "My Spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not" (Hag. 2:5). When one fears the enemy, all strength will be gone, but when one looks to the Lord, he will forget about the enemy.</P><P>"And have kept My word and have not denied My name." Is it true that all they had was a little power and nothing else? No. The Lord says: "And have kept My word and have not denied My name." How does the Lord know that they have a little power? Surely it is by their keeping the Lord's word and not denying His name. They have not received the gifts which the church has lost; they have not received a position, a great number in the church, or a place before men. Rather, they received strength before God. Real power lies in obedience and worship. It is precisely because the Lord's word has been despised that there is the need to keep it. It is precisely because the Lord's name has been rejected that we should not reject it. Indeed, the Lord's word has become widespread in the church. However, has man received it yet? The Lord's name is indeed known, but has it been honored? Have the believers loved it and sought after it like seeking after treasure? Are believers gathered together to pray and to read for the purpose of further understanding the Lord's word and for closer intimacy to the Lord's name? How many believers are there who honor the Lord and hold His word as truly authoritative? We need inward spiritual power before we can obey and worship the Lord in such environments. Here there is no evangelism or great revivals but the loving, serving, and extolling of Christ by a small body of people.</P><P>Christ's characteristics should be the characteristics of the church. Christ said: "Thy word have I hid in mine heart" (Psa. 119:11). This is the character of the faithful ones in the latter days. Paul told Timothy, "But know this, that in the last days difficult times will come. For men...having an outward form of godliness, though denying its power...But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse" (2 Tim. 3:1, 2, 5, 13). Yet, there is a proper way for God's remnant to take. "But you, continue in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from which ones you have learned them and that from a babe you have known the sacred writings" (vv. 14-15). When all around in the world is changing, only the Bible, God's Word, can preserve us. If we draw near and keep God's written word, we will be kept safe in perilous times. The Old Testament which Timothy studied when he was a babe plus the New Testament which he had "learned" from the apostle are our guide today. It is not a great manifestation of power or the performance of miracles that will preserve us. The most important thing is God's written word. The Lord did not say that they have power. Rather, He said that they have kept His word.</P><P>"My word." God has called us to keep Christ's own word and to draw near to Christ Himself rather than to the word of the church. If we accept the word of the church, it means that the church has the authority. But if we accept the word of Christ, it means that Christ Himself has the authority. We should judge everything by the word of Christ. Even the church should be judged by this word. At the time of the failure of the church, the Lord has not charged us to listen to the church. We have seen how in Thyatira the words of Jezebel were considered inspired and authoritative. We have also seen in Sardis how this self-claim and self-boasting has been rejected. However, although the church was not inspired, she was still teaching. Man now says that we already have an open Bible, and we praise the Lord that this indeed is the case. As a result of this, it is right that there should be much shining of the light. But what about the creeds? The Protestant creeds pay much attention to the fundamental doctrines of the gospel, but even this is man's teaching. Whatever they may say, they originate from man. Of course, at the beginning, these creeds were what those who drafted them believed in. Later, through difference of opinions, different creeds were established. After this, the dispute concerning the creeds increased. At this point, there are divisions upon divisions, sects upon sects. It has become a great shame to Protestantism.</P><P>Of course, on the one hand, the Protestant churches today no longer consider themselves the unique "catholic" church like the Roman Catholic Church does. However, on the other hand, the different Protestant creeds show that Protestantism is for sectarianism. To set up any creed outside the Bible, no matter how scriptural it may be, is to build up a wall and to shut out those with different opinions. "If you are not one with us, please go away to set up another sect." If the church of God will not accept all regenerated persons, but will add some creeds to the Bible, it is a sect already. Thank God that He has called us to keep the word of Christ. Otherwise, the simple children will be lost in the present confusion of creeds, organizations, and names. What we should keep is His word and not the church's word.</P><P>Everyone who would keep Christ's word should not be bound by anyone. His conscience can only be responsible to one master. He should follow the Lord as if he were the only Christian on earth. One's knowledge of God and His word and one's walk according to His word should be gradually increased. In the present age of apostasy, the most important thing is to take care of keeping God's word.</P><P>The word of Christ brings us closer to Christ. It will preserve us and will separate us from the deception of the end time and will cause us to walk contrary to it. The characteristic of the present time is impostoring. "But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse" (2 Tim. 3:13). "These things I have written to you concerning those who lead you astray" (1 John 2:26). What we see at the present time are but impostorings and the leading astray of people. Soon, the unique Antichrist will surely appear. However, "even now many antichrists have come" (1 John 2:18). Hence, we must not "believe" in them (Matt. 24:23). Those who "did not receive the love of the truth" will be deceived by "all power and signs and wonders of a lie" (2 Thes. 2:9-11). Therefore, we must hold fast the truth of the Bible so that we will not be deceived by those who come as impostors of messengers of light. The only guarantee is the keeping of the word of Christ. This is a personal matter, because deception comes in privately. Once we are not watchful, we will fall. The power of deception is like that which the serpent used to deceive Eve; there is always the danger of our being corrupted from the purity which is toward Christ (2 Cor. 11:3). What can save us from this danger? It is not the outward display of power in the form of miracles and works of wonders. These things are, on the contrary, mostly instruments of deception. We cannot deal with Satan with miracles and works of wonders, for we are weak to the uttermost. Our security lies in our personal adherence to the Bible of Christ and in our not denying His name.</P><P>"Kept My word." How much this word encompasses! This word includes the form as well as the detail of the Lord's commandments. The believers in Philadelphia were not keeping a line here and a line there. They did not give it up when the price became too great. Rather, they kept it "through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report" (2 Cor. 6:8). If our motive is not to obey in everything, we will obey in nothing. The Lord will not compromise with us. He will not allow us to obey Him in some things and disobey Him in other things. Unless He is Lord of all, He is Lord of nothing. We should understand what it means to keep the Lord's word. If there is any significance to the word "keep," it should at least mean an absolute obedience. We should obey what we consider to be less significant just as absolutely as what we consider to be more significant. We should not consider any of the Lord's commandments as too small but should obey the "smallest" in the same way that we obey the greatest. This is to keep the Lord's word. This is often a test to our motive. Are we willing to follow the Lord in the dark, instead of being in doubt, and to go out by His leading, not knowing where we will be going?</P><P>We have to remember that our unwillingness is often the thing that prevents us from keeping the word of Christ. Many times we are different from other saints in some things. We may think that it is a question of opinion and interpretation. Actually, the hidden reason buried beneath all this is our unwilling and unconcerned predisposition. Only those who will "to do His will" in principle will "know concerning the teaching, whether it is of God" in reality (John 7:17). Man's argument is necessarily of man. The Holy Spirit can never lead man into so many arguments. Although we see many things contrary to the word of God even among the most godly men, this is not our license to disobedience. This only tells us that man at his best is but this way and that the flesh is not to be followed. If we have been absolute in following the Lord, who can say that He has not led us to a proper and unique path? However, how many are there who are absolute in following the Lord?</P><P>We can see that many believers, up to a certain point, will proceed no further! Who can calculate their loss? Many believers try to recover this loss or to replace that which was lost by laboring for the Lord. They act as if the Bible says that to obey is not better than sacrifice, and to hearken not better than the fat of the rams (cf. 1 Sam. 15:22). There may still be the activities, but those who know God realize that the fellowship with God has stopped. What a pity that such a one can no longer be a companion. Although the feet may still be walking on the same path, when the fellowship with Christ is lost, nothing can replace it.</P><P>"If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word" (John 14:23). The meaning of keeping the word is to allow the word of God to control, rule, and sustain us. It is for us to hide God's word in our hearts and to obey it. Because the believers in Philadelphia treasured the Lord's word and submitted to and obeyed it absolutely, the Lord gained the proper place. How wonderful it is when the whole congregation keeps the word of the Lord! They keep the Lord's word because of love, and they fellowship with Him because of this keeping. This is vastly different from the church in Ephesus. In everything outward, the church in Ephesus takes precedence. It lacks love, yet it is full of works. Philadelphia is short in everything outward. It lacks works, yet it is full of love. This is the reason that the Lord has pleasure in it. The Lord desires to see the love of His children more than their works and conduct. Of course, when there is love, there should also be the "labor of love," as found among the Thessalonians. However, the Lord cares for the motive of His people rather than their works. Hence, on the one hand, we see the great works of Ephesus devalued because of her lack of love; on the other hand, we see the small works of Philadelphia commended because of her love. Only among the latter does the Lord unveil Himself as the One who co-labors with them. As such, the open door is theirs.</P><P>"And have not denied My name." The Lord's word signifies the Lord Himself. Even the Father is manifested through this word. He came to the world to reveal God. No one can do this except the only Begotten who is in the bosom of the Father. The Lord's name hints at the fact that He Himself is no longer here but has ascended into glory. There is nothing better than to consider this Lord, to consider how He has revealed God, and to consider how perfect, precious, and holy He is. Although He Himself is no longer with us, when the saints confess His name, He is here. Whatever our words and conduct may be, the most crucial question is: do they express Christ? Anything that falls short of this is a denial of His name. Our self-centered life and our preference for sectarianism are all denials of this name. If we do not deny ourselves, we will deny the Lord's name.</P><P>The necessary condition for confessing the Lord's name is that we deny ourselves. We may be as self-confident as Peter was, who considered that he would not waver in the face of death, that he would follow the Lord, and that although others may stumble, he himself would never be as weak. It is this self-trust and self-confidence that prevented him from preparing himself for the coming trial by being watchful and by praying in the garden of Gethsemane. His oversight was the result of his self-confidence. But what was the end of Peter's fall? He denied the Lord's name. We must never be too careless or too self-confident, thinking that we "can" and we are "able." We must know that we are absolutely untrustworthy. Through a self realization of our weaknesses, we must come trembling and helpless to the Lord, pray by watching, seek His face, and trust in His strength. Only then will we not deny His name. No matter how confident we are in ourselves, this confidence will be our reason for failure. If we think that we can stand firm and are stronger than others, we will surely fail. We should remove all trust in our flesh because the flesh and the Lord are incompatible with one another.</P><P>The name of Christ signifies what Christ is. It signifies His own person, work, and authority. "They shall call His name `Emmanuel' (which is translated, God with us)" (Matt. 1:23). Because He wants to bring God to us, He came to be "Jesus," "Jehovah our Savior," because our salvation must come, before God can be with us. For this reason, He also has become "Christ," the anointed One, to carry out the ministry of the Mediator, bringing us to God and bringing God to us.</P><P>At the time of the apostasy and desolation of the church, it is not a small thing to not deny the Lord's name. From the fact that the Lord was saying this in a negative way, that it was a matter of not denying His name rather than a matter of exalting His name, we know the seriousness of the apostasy at that time. It is precious enough to not deny the Lord's name negatively. They may not have done much work on the positive side, yet the Lord still commended them. In the Lord's eyes, one does not have to call down fire like Elijah did before he can be considered as great. It is great enough already when one is faithful in an unfaithful environment. God did not tell us what the remnant of seven thousand did. The Bible only says that they did not bow their knees to Baal. In a perilous age, God is not considering what His children have done for Him but what they have not done for Him. Since those surrounding them at that time were all Baal worshippers, for them not to worship Baal means that they have done everything there was to do. There are too many tares in the field today. If believers are not willing to stand for the Lord alone, they will fail along with the others. The nature of the faithful little flock today is to not be deceived and to not follow the current of the tide. Outward manifestation of power is not important. What is indispensable is to walk faithfully with God in the midst of sin. It is more necessary to have the inward power than the outward power.</P><P>The characteristic of the Philadelphian believers is that they have not denied the Lord's name. If a sinner denies the name of the Lord, he will of course perish, because a sinner can only become a child of God by believing in His name (John 1:12). By His name alone are one's sins forgiven (1 John 2:12). Only by believing in His name can we receive eternal life (1 John 5:13). "For neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved" (Acts 4:12). However, what is covered in these few letters is not a question of salvation for the sinners. It is a question of the saved ones exalting or denying the Lord's name. This is talking about things within the church. With regard to salvation, these have received the Lord's name. Yet with regard to other things, they may not have done the same.</P><P>In the church the main function of the Lord's name is to serve as the center of the believers' meeting (Matt. 18:20). The Holy Spirit considers the Lord Jesus as the unique focus. He gathers people around the Lord. This kind of meeting in the Lord's name means that the Lord is the Head, the object of worship, and the center of attraction. It means that we come before Him to worship Him, exalt Him, preach Him, praise Him, pray to Him, and consecrate everything to Him. A meeting in the Lord's name is one where God's children come directly to the Lord for worship. There is no intermediary such as a man-ordained pastor or a leader to monopolize everything. The system of having one leader means that this one alone can fellowship with God directly, and that all the others have to pass through him as the middle-man, the mediator, before they can come to God. This is a meeting in this person's name, because people come to listen to his preaching, to pray after his prayer, and to conduct themselves according to his direction. However, this is not God's way. He desires to see His people coming to His Son directly to worship Him and not to be controlled by man or to take the worship of one presiding, ordained person as the worship of the whole. He desires to see everyone being drawn to the person of His Son and having personal fellowship with Him. He has no pleasure in any kind of Judaistic worship. For this reason, in a truly scriptural meeting in which the center is the Lord's name, there surely can be no humanly assigned presiding person or an implicitly recognized or habitual presiding person. Neither should there be any assigned programs-written, verbal, or habitual. Only the Lord Himself should be the Lord in the meeting through the Holy Spirit. He arranges all the programs. He chooses the persons (plural) that He wants to use. He receives the worship from His children. Those who speak do not dominate others; they are merely chosen by the Lord to represent the mind of the congregation. Everyone has equal opportunity, and everyone can come to the Lord directly.</P><P>In the Bible we can see another important use of the Lord's name. The Lord's name sanctifies the believers unto Himself. For this reason, the disciples of the Lord are called the "Christians," which means those who belong to Christ. Christ has given us His name so that we can be distinct from the world. However, it now seems as if the Lord's name is not distinct enough anymore. Man likes to follow the Corinthians of the day in saying that "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas" (1 Cor. 1:12). The distinction in denominationalism is a denial of the Lord's name. The word "denomination" means a name. To join a denomination is to add to oneself a name. The present error of man is to add to the name "Christian" the name of a denomination or a sect. "I am a Methodist believer," or "I am a Presbyterian believer." Why should we do this? Is the name of Christ not sufficient to distinguish us? Should we have a name of a denomination before we can become distinct enough? If we think that we do not have the distinction of denominations in our hearts, why then should we be in the denominations in reality? At present, believers think that it is impossible for one not to belong to a denomination or to have another name other than the name of Christ. But the result of doing so is to deny the Lord's name. If the name of a denomination cannot include all the believers, but has on the contrary made a distinction among the believers, the retention of denominational names is division in the Body of Christ. No matter how man explains it, the fact cannot be annulled. Of course, the Holy Spirit is only presenting a despised little flock before us. We must know that the Lord's name will not allow us to choose between two evils. "Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness" (2 Tim. 2:19). There is a way that has no unrighteousness. It is characteristic of the unbelieving ones to say that no one can be perfect or that no one is without fault, but the way of unrighteousness is not a way that we have to take. This, of course, does not mean that once the saints meet around the Lord's name sins will no longer come in. Man's flesh always brings in sin. However, we look to the Lord and His Holy Spirit to preserve us and to keep us away from sin. It is bad enough to have moral sins. But sin in the church, that is, the sin of upsetting the order of the church, is even worse. The worst sin is the sin against the Lord Himself. This is the greatest of all sins (2 John 7). This is the test of our spirituality. What more can one say when the heart is not proper toward Christ? But all those who exalt His name sincerely will see that they are particularly close to the Lord Himself. It is possible for sin to invade our meeting and to test our patience. However, if we remain voluntarily in the position of weakness and dependence, we will be preserved in the purity of the Lord.</P><P>Bible readers often notice one special characteristic of the Philadelphia believers: their eyes see only Christ Himself. Although they are "Philadelphia"-brotherly love-what they love is Christ. Their relationship with Christ is most personal. Because they love Christ in this way and because they love Him so personally, they are able to become "Philadelphia."</P><P>The reason for this is simple. Everyone who loves Christ will have his heart enlarged to receive and accept the whole church of Christ. When an individual joins himself to Christ, he is joined to everyone who joins himself to Him this way. Our first responsibility is to have an uninterrupted fellowship with the Head, and then through Him, to have fellowship with all the members. If we seek first to have fellowship with the members without having fellowship with the Head, we are upsetting the proper order.</P><P>Many unions that arise as a result of reconciliation or of relinquishing different opinions are unscriptural. The union of the believers in Christ is not a so-called "union," or an association of institutions. God has shown us only one way. All attempts to set up another way as the condition for union are destined to failure. "Pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart" (2 Tim. 2:22). This is the teaching of the Bible. When two walk on the same way, naturally they are joined together. On this way, there are at least the four characteristics mentioned here. We cannot neglect any one of them for the sake of reconciliation. This way is absolutely personal. Yet it can include all those "who call on the Lord out of a pure heart." The first characteristic is righteousness. It is most important to keep God's commandment and to have pure words and conduct. Without righteousness, we cannot talk of faith. A conscience living before the Lord and a heart trusting in the Lord is indispensable to the believers' living. Only by having this can we obey His will. Only then is it time for love to be manifested. Under this atmosphere, love cannot be lost. In the end, peace will prevail over different opinions and over confusion; only then can there possibly be peace. It is rather meaningless for believers to seek peace with each other without seeking for righteousness.</P><P>This is the God-ordained way for believers to be joined together. Here we see no conditions, bylaws, ordinances, or mutually recognized regulations. It is absolutely personal. Yet this is God's arrangement for believers to be joined together. One Lord alone determines the position of everyone. Everyone who accepts this position is joined one to another. Everyone is a member in the Body, and everyone accepts the rule of the Head. There is no ground left for us to decide if we want to unite or to have separate organizations. When we obey the Lord, we will spontaneously be united. At present, however, the rule of the majority annuls the individual. For the sake of peace or for reason of gain we tolerate things that we do not agree with. At the beginning the conscience may suffer, but in the end, it even becomes very forgiving. Because this condition is too prevalent, the voice of rebuke is almost drowned out. The issue of this is rejection of Christ's word and His name. The initial feeling toward sin is now lost. If a man strives for the oneness of the Holy Spirit without the acceptance of the cross, failure is the inevitable result.</P><P>However, here [vv. 7-8] the Lord's name seems to have a deeper significance than His name ordinarily has. Here the Lord Jesus shows three things to the church: that He is (1) the Holy One, (2) the true One, and (3) the One who has the key of David. He also praises them for three things. After reading this passage carefully, we have to conclude that what the Lord reveals about Himself has much to do with what He approves. The little power that this church has is related to the Lord's holiness. The keeping of His word is related to the Lord's truthfulness, and the not denying the Lord's name is related to His having the key of David. If this is the case, we see that the Lord's name mentioned here must be related to the Lord's title as the Son of David.</P><P>This speaks of the Lord Jesus as king on earth. As the Son of David, He will ascend the throne of His ancestor David and will reign on earth for a thousand years. He will completely overcome the power of the devil and will shut him up in the abyss. His kingdom will be physical, and His boundary will be the whole world. This is the glory of the millennium. When we mention the Lord's name, we refer to His being the earthly Son of Man, the Son of David, in the same way that He is the Son of God. The Lord's name includes not just His word. However, how many today recognize the Lord Jesus as the king of the world who will defeat Satan completely? How many believers have the hope of the millennium? It seems that the Lord knows this situation ahead of time; He knows that there will be some in the church among the saints who will forget the glory of His kingship. This is why He purposely reveals His own title as the Son of David to be a test to the faithfulness of His children. Although every Christian recognizes the Lord Jesus as the Son of David, there are not too many who know the real significance of this name and who believe that He will reign on earth. This is also the point concerning Christianity that the earthly kings are particularly bothered with, if they know about this point at all. This is the good testimony that the Lord Jesus made before Pontius Pilate.</P><P>This shows us what great temptation the world will face in the future. Man will set up another king besides Christ. The most severe persecution will come upon the believers because they will refuse to accept another king besides Christ. In another place in this book, we have seen how man will set up another name besides Christ for worship-a kingly name, the name of the beast (Rev. 13:17). A faithful servant of the Lord can never accept any name, whether it be religious or political in nature, besides the name of Christ.</P><P>"Behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut" (Rev. 3:8). This is the first promise of the Lord. It is the reward for their faithfulness. Many say that if they do not accept the name of the world, the denominations, and the sects, they will have no place to work. Moreover, men will purposely close their doors to them! According to fleshly eyes, this is surely a problem. However, the Lord considers His name to be precious above everything else. Those who will not deny the Lord's name because of the world or the denominations will be given by the Lord an opened door which no one can shut. How fitting this is! How comforting this sounds! Those who uphold the denominations can do their best to shut the doors, but the Lord opens the doors, and when He opens, no one can shut them.</P><P>The way the Lord is leading us to take is not a way of "uselessness." The door here, according to the scriptural application, refers to our testimony and opportunity for work for the Lord. The apostle Paul mentioned this three times (1 Cor. 16:9; 2 Cor. 2:12; Col. 4:3). All those who walk with Christ will see that on the one hand, they will be rejected, but on the other hand, men will know their Lord in their hearts. These two things are not contradictory. The history of the gospel everywhere proves this to us.</P><P>Actually, what is needed is faith. Judging by results is often wrong. If we need the success of a work to prove the propriety of it, we are walking by doubt and not living by faith. Because man's feelings tend to doubt about his own future, the Lord assures one's correctness by His word. One only needs to ask if he has the characteristics of Philadelphia. If he has, he can be at rest, for the door is already opened. Our eyes are not set on the opened door but on our Leader and the way we take. If success becomes the measurement of our work, we will be deceived. The greatest success can only be determined in the future, not the present. The standard is eternity and not the temporal age. If believers take success as the standard, they may not be able to hear the Lord's voice here. The temptation of success may be the biggest trap the enemy has set for the servants of Christ. Many times, success determines the direction of a person's work more than the word of God. This may continue until the direction actually becomes contrary to God's word. Even the success that comes through true obedience may result in excessive boasting, overthrowing one's spiritual serenity. But opposition causes believers to learn patience! From this, we can see that it is God's good will that He gives to His servants little success!</P><P>How wonderful it would be if we did not see the door opened by the Lord, but saw only the Lord who opens doors. If a place is in turmoil and storms are breaking out everywhere so that the gospel cannot be preached, it is the Lord's business. If the places in which we desire to see the gospel preached are closed, we have to realize that it is the Lord's hand. If we look to Him, we will not be discouraged or grow weary. If we see the Lord opening up a door before us, we can ignore the outward circumstances and can continue to work with boldness and assurance. But if this is not the case, even if we have the protection of the government or the goodwill of the people, we probably will not be able to advance too much.</P><P>Of course, we have to wait for the Lord to open the door. At first the Lord forbade Paul to preach in Asia, but three years later, we see Paul assembled a church there, and the whole of Asia heard the word of the Lord. We should trust in the Lord with faith. Patience is indispensable in the Lord's work. Our faith must be tested. Many times, the Lord allows adverse circumstances to come upon us so that we will know that apart from Him we can do nothing. It is only when we realize our weakness that the Lord gives us the strength. First He gives us the faith. Then He gives the strength to confirm the faith that He gave. "Which no one can shut." How comforting this is! The door that Christ opens, no one can shut, not even the world, the devil, or the evil spirits. Although we have no strength even to pry open the door, the door is opened for us. The whole church is weak, but a small faith will accomplish what great powers are not able to accomplish.</P><P>Christ has all power. Everything is in His hand. The "doorkeeper" will only open the door to Him (John 10:3). Once the Lord Jesus unveils Himself, nothing can shut up His testimony. All the powers of the world, the Pharisees, the scribes, the priests, the elders, the rulers, Pilate, and Herod cannot stop one sheep of Christ from hearing His voice. This was the case then; it is the same today. Whom do we fear will shut the door? The Lord's word says that no one can shut it.</P><P>How similar is the condition of Philadelphia to the condition when Christ was on earth! Everyone was scheming to shut the door and to oppose Christ. Like Philadelphia, Christ dwelt in a system which was once established by God but had since become a total failure. At the time of Christ, the ark of the covenant was gone, and the Urim, the Thummin, and the Shekinah glory of the temple were also gone. All that had expressed God's power and testimony were gone. God did not have a throne in Jerusalem. On the contrary, it was a Gentile power that was reigning. The Israelites were chastised by God through their sins. In spite of this, Haggai told us that the Spirit of the Lord was still among them. That is why we still see Anna and Simeon and the many in Jerusalem who looked to the redemption of Israel. These were the remnant of the day, the faithful little flock. When the Lord Jesus came, the world rejected Him. Still, do we see all the doors closed? No. On the contrary, the doorkeeper opened the door to Him.</P><P>Who was ever rejected like Christ was? Who has ever faced more severe opposition than Christ did, who in spite of this, strove on humbly and faithfully? Christ was willing to relinquish everything in this world. He was willing to be considered the dust of the earth. Yet not one lost sheep of the house of Israel missed the voice of his Good Shepherd. His eyes were able to search out everyone, whether one was a publican, a sinner, a harlot, a Nicodemus, or a Samaritan woman. He is now putting those who have a little power in the place of His former humility. The doorkeeper will have to open the door to them, in the same way that they have to open to Him.</P><P>We have said much about the door, but according to this book, the door seems to signify more than the above. Let us consider a little more carefully. If we study this letter carefully, we will see the importance of the prophetic nature of this letter. All the promises to the overcomers are prophecies. The preservation from the trials and the Jews falling prostrate refer to the rapture and the kingdom. The initial meaning of the key in verse 7 is resurrection. Hence, it is natural that verse 8 should also be prophetic in nature. If we read carefully, we will find out that this indeed is the case. We are not overturning what we have just said. We are here only considering the deeper significance of the matter. We have seen the meaning of the door from other books. Now we want to consider the deeper significance of the door from this book.</P><P>If we take the principle of interpreting the Scripture with the Scripture, and especially if we take the attitude of interpreting this book with this book, we will see that the opening of the door here must be related to the door in 4:1. "After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here" (4:1). Hence, the opening of the door in this book signifies nothing other than the rapture into heaven.</P><P>The two doors here (vv. 7-8) bring both the living as well as the dead believers fully into glory. First the Lord opens the door of Hades so that the dead believers may be able to return to earth. Then the Lord opens the door of heaven so that the living and the dead believers may ascend from earth. Although many times the reward of faithful work is more opportunities for working for the Lord, the door here is not given to us at the time we work, but is rewarded to us after we work and after the work is fully completed. This refers to nothing other than the entry into the heavenly door of special glory. The saints in Philadelphia manifested a little power for the Lord Jesus. Now the Lord Jesus is manifesting a great power for them in opening up the door of heaven.</P><P>No one can shut this door. Who can shut the door of heaven? Christ has opened it. Who can now shut it? We know that chapter twelve of this book records that when the man-child is about to be raptured to heaven, the old serpent, the red dragon Satan, will try to devour him in wrath and stop him from ascending to the throne. However, Satan's plan will completely fail. Christ has opened the door for them. Although Satan tries to shut this door, he will not succeed. Thank God. Though the world restricts us, opposes us, resists us, and persecutes us, it cannot cut off our way to heaven!</P><P>Now we come to a most crucial point, which is the biblical qualification or the condition for one to be raptured. Will the whole body of the believers be raptured, or will only a part be raptured? We can receive an accurate answer from this letter. We have mentioned more than once that the last four churches in chapters two and three are churches that will remain simultaneously until the Lord comes back. These four churches are but types of the four different conditions the churches will be in before the Lord comes back. We have also mentioned repeatedly that there are two ways to look at the seven churches in these two chapters. One way is to consider these seven churches as actual churches of the day to which the apostle John was commissioned by the Lord to send these letters (1:11). The other way is to consider them as types of the condition of the church throughout the church age. We must differentiate between the churches themselves and the churches of the ages they typify. For example, in itself, the church in Thyatira was composed of the actual believers living in Thyatira at the time. As such, those in it were saved ones and had life. However, the Roman Catholic Church that it typifies is not necessarily the same. We know that there are many perishing ones in the Roman Catholic Church! The same is true of Laodicea. Many consider the members in Laodicea as those who are not saved, but this is absolutely wrong. Laodicea was not a fictitious church on the earth. John saw altogether seven heavenly lampstands; Laodicea was one of them. The Lord clearly recognized Laodicea as a church, a called-out congregation of saved ones. The star of the messenger of Laodicea was in the Lord's hand in the same way the other messengers were. The Lord did not preach the gospel to them for they were all saved. The Lord commanded them also to hear what the Holy Spirit was saying to the churches because they were a real church. This refers to the actual condition of Laodicea in the apostolic age. But the condition of the churches in the age typified by Laodicea is different. In the present-day Laodicean churches, there are mixed multitudes who are not saved! The differentiation between the seven churches themselves and that which they typify is crucial to the understanding of these seven letters.</P><P>According to what we have said, the believers in these seven churches were all saved and regenerated, and they all had life. But the strange thing is that the Lord's promise of rapturing the saints from the tribulation upon earth was given to Philadelphia only. Although typologically speaking, there are saved believers in Thyatira, Sardis, and Laodicea, just as there are those in Philadelphia, the former did not receive this promise. By this point, we realize that unless a believer reaches the standard of Philadelphia, he will not be raptured. The first rapture which delivers one from the tribulations upon the earth is not a common one, but a special one. A common believer cannot participate in this rapture; only a special group who have received grace can enjoy this. Of course, all the believers will be raptured, but the Bible tells us that their times of rapture are not the same.</P><P>Unless believers possess the nature and qualifications of the Philadelphian believers, they will not be taken away at the first special rapture. These are the Philadelphians, the ones with the brotherly love. This is their mutual attitude as members in the Body of Christ. When Peter mentioned many necessary virtues for a believer in his second Epistle, he added to everything "Philadelphia"-brotherly love. Following that, he told us that this will supply one with a rich entrance into the Lord's kingdom (2 Pet. 1:5-11). Hence, from its name, we can see that these have already entered the perfection in Christ in experience. This is what the Lord requires of His harvest.</P><P>We have seen the works of the Philadelphians. The Lord does not freely give to them this great promise of the rapture without condition. The Lord's promise is based on their former faithfulness. "Behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut, because you have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name." The condition for rapture is to manifest spiritual power for the Lord, to keep His word, and to exalt His name. If we walk according to our own will every day and do not keep the Lord's word, we are dreaming if we hope to have the right of rapture. It is important to exalt the Lord's name and to draw close to the Lord Himself. We need a deeper death to ourselves so that we can set aside our own confused thoughts and keep the Lord's word which opposes our natural preferences. We should have a deeper death toward the world so that we can forsake everything and can have an uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord Himself. The Lord cannot take us to a heaven to which we have no pleasure in going. He cannot drag us to a presence in which we have no joy in remaining. These things must first have their basis on earth before they will have their consummation in heaven. It is vain for us to talk about the Lord Jesus' coming every day. What is needed is the adequate preparation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE NINE</H2><P>Verse 9:"Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, those who call themselves Jews and are not, but lie-behold, I will cause them to come and fall prostrate before your feet and to know that I have loved you." </P><P>This is the second reward. The Jews had rejected the Son of David, their Messiah, the hope of their fathers, and had completely lost their standing as Jews. Only those who are willing to receive the humble Jesus are the Jews. Otherwise, a man may call himself the descendant of Abraham after the flesh, yet in reality he is of the devil, the father of liars (John 8:44). God had already destroyed their temple and chased them out of their land because of their sin. Now they had no more priests and sacrifices, and what was left was but the worship in the synagogue. However, such a synagogue with its worship was not set up by Jehovah. It was of Satan, for it did not befriend Christ. Rather, it was opposed to Him. In the present age, God has shut the door in the face of the children of Israel. He no longer recognizes them as His people. They may boast that the door is still open to them, but actually this is only their "lie."</P><P>The fact that they did not recognize the Lord Jesus as the Son of David proves that those who are Jews in the flesh are not necessarily Jews. Abraham was the first man to receive Christ. Unless a man does what Abraham did, he cannot be counted as the descendant of Abraham. He is but the descendant of Saul, who would not submit to the God-anointed David. God did not recognize their meeting and considered them but the synagogue of Satan. In the other churches, these ones blasphemed and persecuted, but here, the believers were not in their hands. The Lord promised to make these false Jews to fall prostrate before the feet of His approved Christians and to confess that the Lord has loved them. Such a nation ought to have God's highest promises. Yet it now lies prostrate beneath those higher than it was! Before, they were indeed higher than the Gentiles. The last, however, has become the first.</P><P>This promise will be fulfilled at the time of resurrection. At the present time, the love of God is only working in His children secretly, but when the sons of God appear, this love will be manifested. Concerning the Christ of that day, the Bible says, "In the name of Jesus every knee should bow" (Phil. 2:10). But part of the splendor of the King of kings will be reflected in His subject-servants. Although the Jews still mockingly deny the Lord Jesus as the Messiah, the Son of David, and consider those who follow Christ as those following an impostor, the Lord Jesus will soon reign in the kingdom with His faithful people and will rule over the whole world on the throne. At that time the Jews will come to recognize them as the highest and truest administrators on earth.</P><P>How wonderful this will be! The watchful saints will not taste death but will be raptured! Even those Jews who are now mocking the Christians will come to recognize the marvel of this fact! In the Old Testament the special grace for those saints whom God loved greatly was to be spared death and to be raptured. Yet, there were only two persons, Enoch and Elijah. What a marvel it will be to the Jews in the future when they see the disciples of the One whom they consider a mad and cursed impostor being taken into glory and being spared from tasting death! If the Jews recognize the high privilege of Enoch and Elijah now, how can they not confess the privilege of these saints then?</P><P>The story of Shimei in the Old Testament is a wonderful type of what we are speaking of here. At the time Absalom rebelled, David ran away. Shimei cursed him and rebuked him, throwing stones and dust at him. David did not become angry; he suffered this reviling. When the day of suffering was over, David returned to Jerusalem in great power and glory. Shimei then came before David's feet and confessed his sin. "And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan; and said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart. For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king" (2 Sam. 19:18-20). If the signs in Matthew 24:30 refer to the rapture of the believers, then the Jews who saw the signs, though refusing to recognize God's grace to the Christians then, will surely recognize this fact at that time.</P><P>"And to know that I have loved you." It is strange that in such a book of severe righteousness, there appears the word "love"! In the midst of Christ's judgment on the church, He unveils His love! What does a judge have to do with love? How can a judge speak of his own love? But this word is completely compatible with this letter, inasmuch as it is completely compatible with the other letters. In the original language both the "I" and the "you" are emphatic. The "I" is a special "I," and the "you" is a special "you." Here is a patch of green in the wilderness. These persons are being shut out of the kingdom which they consider theirs. They will see another group of priests and kings raised up by God, whom the nation of Israel has never seen before. The Lord's promise here is not to all the genuine Christians but to those who are a special testimony. The "you," the special "you," the "you" who are the Philadelphians, the "you" who keep His word and exalt His name, are the ones whom He loves. This love is no ordinary love. At the time of judgment, the only thing that will please the Lord and the only thing that He will love will be a true Philadelphian nature. What a joy to consider that we will be those who cheer the Lord's heart!</P><P>In addition to the literal meaning of this verse, there is a teaching here suitable for this age. These Jews were the Judaistic believers in the church. The principle of the synagogue of Satan is a return to Judaism; it is to put man back under the law and to recover the many holy ceremonies and offices compatible with the earthly religion, Judaism. Their religion was built upon ceremonies rather than upon Christ. They were controlled by human traditions and were under the organization of the denominations more than under God's word. They brought in a counterfeit denomination to inherit a God-ordained religion. They were not the Jews, yet they called themselves the Jews. All their offices, uniforms, ceremonies, ordinances, and temple were according to the old Jewish tradition. They boasted in the flesh. On the one hand, they received authority from tradition. On the other hand, they executed this authority through some formalities. They replaced a simple and open work, a common priesthood, free grace, full salvation, and God's word with ceremonies, offices, laws, and creeds. We can say that these Jews are the Roman Catholic Church. We can also say that they are the Protestant church. There is not much difference nominally. The important thing is the inward reality and the spirit.</P><P>Of course, Roman Catholicism is more seriously affected by Judaism, but the spirit of Judaism is prevailing everywhere. Everywhere in Protestantism one can see its influence. Every revival and every split from a Protestant denomination unavoidably carries over the influence of the denomination out from which it came. A place of preaching eventually becomes a chapel, and the preacher becomes part of a priesthood. The believers unconsciously become the pew members of this new church. Unity among Christians eventually turns into denominational affiliations, and the truth that God has specially used becomes a creed that is to be confessed by all. What the conscience once condemned is now ignored unconsciously through the association of what pleases the flesh. They still call themselves God's covenanted people as if no one else is such. What charter or constitution of any denomination is there that does not demonstrate this spirit? It is as if there is no church other than their own group. To leave them is to leave "the church"! Yet it says here that what they say are lies!</P><P>Under such circumstances, those who suffer the most are the Philadelphian believers. They have no name other than Christ. They have no creeds or ordinances other than the word of God. They are often despised and are considered lowly and insignificant. As the disciples of Christ were despised and mocked before the great organization of Judaism, in the same way the Philadelphian believers now are looked down upon by the various, great, Judaistic Protestant denominations. This verse links Philadelphia with Smyrna. Among the seven churches, only these two spiritual churches have such temptation and trial. The sin of Pergamos and Thyatira are not enough to shake them here. As a result the enemy uses a more subtle scheme. However, they have not only identified his devious harm but have opposed him.</P><P>Satan's way here is to cause the desolate church to be further degraded. The Judaism that God had once established and which He has now rejected has become the best weapon of the enemy. In Philadelphia we see the believers seeking Christ afresh, the word of God being preached again and being honored anew. As a result, Satan renews his old strategy. This is what the Bible shows us. Although this is something that happens outside Philadelphia, God calls the Philadelphian saints to deal with it. Although many believers have left the influence of the denominations, the same leaven is still working there. Although the clergy-laity system in the denominations, with its replacement of the conscience of the individual by the majority, has been overturned by many believers, we still see the principle of Judaism affecting man's thought and conduct. Actually, man will never change. Any work of man apart from God's grace is a realization of the teaching of Judaism. Unless believers are watchful, there is always the possibility for them to fall into the spirit or work of denominationalism.</P><P>Here we see the difference between a personal, faithful walk with God and the following of an established organization. In an organization there are many things that the flesh can boast of. There are many formalities and plans to recover that which once was the outward fa&#231;ade of God's people. But those in the organizations do not understand what God is establishing anew today. This is the test to those who follow the Lord. Although these ones have not rejected God's word-neither have the Jews-their works are not governed by God's word either. The Jews accepted the Bible, yet they rejected Christ and even killed Him. The disciples of Christ will receive the same kind of treatment. "They will put you out of the synagogues," thinking that they are serving God. "An hour is coming for every one who kills you to think that he is offering service to God" (John 16:2). The old truths have been around for a long time and have been properly accredited. As such they do not test man's heart that much. Those who receive them will, on the contrary, be respected. If by doing something we win man's approval, our heart will not be tested, and there will be no need for the exercise of faith. We can be assured that this thing must not be from God. Although this may still be the truth, there is no need for the exercise of faith. This is the work of the Jewish synagogue. These ones have rejected the word of Christ and His name, because they do not have Christ in their hearts. It is true that the Jews were indeed the people of God, but now they are trampling underfoot the Son of God. What they love is the truth in their mind. The character of Christ is too much of a test for them. As a result they reject Him. The question now is not what God has done in the past, but how we should contact Christ today. The unique need today is to serve Christ faithfully.</P><P>"I will cause them to come and fall prostrate before your feet and to know that I have loved you." God allows these things to come upon His people to test them. Yet He promises the real Philadelphians the ultimate victory. Their enemies will confess their defeat and will see that the Lord has loved them. Although today is the time of despising for them, one day the Lord will spread a table for them before their enemies. In that day their enemies will acknowledge that the ones they despise are the ones whom the Lord has loved. God has not acknowledged these orthodox religionists as His own people. What they will receive will be a mere knowledge, a knowledge that the Lord has loved the despised remnants. Other than this, there will be nothing else.</P><P>Hence, we have to be careful and should consider if we are true Philadelphian believers. Of course, we will have to be tested in many ways, but the Lord's word here is enough to comfort our hearts. Our duty is not to argue about what is pleasing to the Lord. If you know it, just go and do it. Why is there the need for so many arguments? In that day, it will become manifest where Christ's heart is today. We should know how to be content and how to trust in the love of Christ quietly. Although those who confess with their mouth that they know God while denying Him in their walk do not approve of us now, we should be satisfied. This is the place for our hearts to be tested. You can find here the orthodox sects, the well-known brands of denominations, and companions that will make you happy and rejoice. But you must remember that to do so requires that you drop one thing-the love of Christ. If we are content with the love of Christ today, we will see sunshine above the dark clouds.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE TEN</H2><P>Verse 10:"Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth."</P><P>This is the third promise, but its blessing is in no way less than the other promises. It refers again to the rapture. "Because you have kept the word of My endurance." The word of endurance here means two things: (1) the word of Christ's long endurance in waiting for His own glorification, and (2) the word of the Christian's endurance in waiting for His coming. The two Epistles to the Thessalonians particularly cover the matter of the Lord's coming. We see the word "endurance" used in two ways in these two books. The "endurance of Christ" in 2 Thessalonians 3:5 refers to the first meaning as mentioned earlier. In the present age of grace, Christ is waiting with endurance for the day for Him to receive the power. The "endurance of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ" in 1 Thessalonians 1:3 refers to the second meaning. It is what the Christians hold in hoping for the Lord Jesus' return.</P><P>Formerly the Lord only said, "You...have kept My word" (Rev. 3:8), but now He elaborates to say, "You have kept the word of My endurance." It is not an ordinary word, but the word of endurance. It is not an ordinary kind of endurance, but an endurance that has to do with the word of Christ. The Father had said to the Son: "Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool" (Psa. 110:1). For this reason He said, "But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but the Father only" (Matt. 24:36). At present He is taking the attitude of waiting for the Father's work. If He is willing to do something, surely He can lay hold of the iron scepter and crush all opposition. However, He is waiting for God to fulfill His plan for His people. The Lord Jesus is waiting in order that more grace can be dispensed to the world and that more souls can be gained for Him. Christ's endurance and His power stand on equal ground. He wants to rule, yet His days of ruling have not yet come. He is willing to wait. The words "the word of My endurance" speak of Christ's rejection in this age. From the day of His ascension to the time He will appear again is the period of Christ's endurance.</P><P>Because Christ endures in this way, there is a "word of endurance" for the saints to keep. He is now waiting for His kingdom; He is also calling His believers to wait and to endure with Him. While the world rejects His rightful authority, He is waiting for another day when He will assume His position. For this reason, His saints should join with Him in His rejection on earth. Since He has been despised and rejected by man, we should not seek to reign among men! We should disassociate ourselves from the politics of the world and should wait exclusively for the Lord who will replace the present world government with His own power and kingdom. We should submit ourselves to the God-appointed authorities. However, we must not seek to reign in the place where Christ is rejected. Neither can we help Christianity secure honor in this world. We are the dust-ridden companions of Christ and should only hope to bear His reproach in this present age. The position that Christians take today must be the same position that Christ took when He was on earth. If we go beyond this, it means that there are different natures between Christ and the Christians. If we do not understand this, we will inevitably be anxious in the present sinful and confused age. Since we know that our Lord is enduring all kinds of incessant opposition, why do we worry about it? This kind of thought is the most noble thought for our spiritual life, for it joins us to a deeper union with Christ and a more intimate fellowship with Him. How wonderful it is to think that we are standing on the same ground as He is! How our heart rejoices!</P><P>Christ promises His believers that they would share with Him in His future glory. Yet to share with Him in one position means that we share with Him in all positions. If we are joined to His power, we must also be joined to the word of His endurance. Those who will be glorified with Him must first suffer shame with Him. We cannot hope to have one without having the other. Even if we put the motive of being glorified aside, is it not unfaithfulness if we shrink from suffering shame for Him in the world? Alas, Christians have tried too much to save their faces! Why is there the need for so much self-respect? How should our heart feel when we consider the smiting of His face and the spitting at His cheek? May we send out more welcoming invitations for shame and ridicule!</P><P>Although we do not gain any sympathy from the world or the nominal church, does not the word "I have loved you" satisfy our heart? If the love of Christ is the guide to our walk, surely we would be willing to stand on the ground that Christ is on. Is there any lover who does not want to be where his loved one is? If we cherish Christ in our heart, we will keep the word of His endurance, because this is where He is at present. Now is the time of trial, separation, cleansing, and sifting. For this reason we should wait. His attitude must be our attitude. Since He is waiting, we should also be waiting. Since we are already satisfied with His present love, we should therefore wait to acquire with Him, rather than gain anything ahead of Him. Where there is love, there is the sharing of things between the ones loved. If the love of Christ has not satisfied our hearts, of course, we will seek for man's honor apart from Him. But who can say if this is now the case?</P><P>This union with Christ is the proper position of the church. The Lord does not want to see us falling from this position. May He cause us always to realize that we are forever joined to Him this way. Otherwise, His heart will not be happy, and our heart will not be satisfied.</P><P>"The hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth." What hour will that be? The Bible is not silent concerning this hour. The Old Testament prophets, the Lord Jesus Himself, and the apostle Paul all prophesied about this hour. Jeremiah said concerning this day, "Alas! For that day is great, / And there is none like it; / And it is a time of distress for Jacob" (Jer. 30:7). At that time, God said, "I will make a full end of all the nations to which I have scattered you; / But I will not make a full end of you" (v. 11). Daniel also spoke of this time: "And there will be a time of distress, such as never occurred since there came to be a nation until that time" (Dan. 12:1). "The day of the Lord" as prophesied by the Old Testament prophets mainly refers to this day. The Lord Jesus also spoke of this day. He said that in that day, "Nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pangs" (Matt. 24:7-8). He said that when that day arrives, "there will be great tribulation, such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor shall by any means ever occur" (Matt. 24:21). Paul also spoke of this time: "When they say, Peace and security, then sudden destruction comes upon them, just as birth pangs to a woman with child; and they shall by no means escape" (1 Thes. 5:3). Events during this time will initially center around Judea (Matt. 24), but will eventually spread all over the world (Rev. 7:14). This is why it says here: "The hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth."</P><P>This great trial will only be an "hour" in the "great and dreadful day" (Mal. 4:5). In other words, it will only be for a short time. This short time will last for only three and a half years. When the Lord Jesus appears in glory, this hour will be over.</P><P>The world, the flesh, and the trials of Satan are fierce enough now. Will they become more fierce in the future? Indeed, when that time comes, trials which the whole world has never experienced will all come. At the beginning of this time, Satan will be cast out of heaven. He knows that his time is short, and he will be in great wrath, tormenting those in the world. He will hand over his authority and power to his minister, who will set up a throne on earth. His minister will assume to be the Messiah and will blaspheme God on the one hand and cause men to worship him on the other hand. All worldly and satanic powers will come to his support. He will be sustained by both human as well as demonic strength. All the perishing ones will be zealous for him. His false prophets will raise up many idolatrous things. Everyone will have to be sealed by him, without which seal no one will be able to buy and sell. At that time, the false Christ will come "according to Satan's operation in all power and signs and wonders of a lie" (2 Thes. 2:9). The atmosphere, environment, laws, and punishments then will all be geared toward the worshipping of Antichrist and the receiving of his seal. Those who will not worship will die, and those who will not receive the seal will also die. But then, to worship means eternal perdition, and to be sealed means to perish eternally. Hence, "here is the endurance and the faith of the saints" (Rev. 13:10). Because of the ferocity of Satan and the sinfulness of the world, God's wrath will roll continuously from heaven (see Rev. 13).</P><P>How great will the influence of this trial be? It will come upon "the whole inhabited earth"! Not only will the Jews and the Gentiles suffer, even the whole inhabited earth will fall under Satan's snare. Despite the fact that there will be severe calamities befalling those inhabitants around the Mediterranean Sea, the area where the Roman Empire stood and where the kingdom of Antichrist will be, the power of Satan on that day will reach all inhabited lands. "And permission was given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them; and authority was given to him over every tribe and people and tongue and nation. And all those dwelling on the earth will worship him, every one whose name is not written in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world" (Rev. 13:7-8). In that day, no nation in the world will escape his power.</P><P>What then is the purpose of this shocking trial? "To try them who dwell on the earth"! Those who dwell on the earth think that the world will become better each day and that it will even be turned into the kingdom of God. They boast and brag about their progress. Even the church considers itself highly and thinks that it has become more advanced than before. It links itself with the worldly politicians and social reformers and tries to reform the world cursed under sin, making the latter more comfortable for the sinner to dwell in forever. They will learn in their suffering that nothing is trustworthy. Everything that they trust in and love will be overturned. All beauty and ideals will be tested. The real condition of men's heart toward God and toward each other will be exposed. All corruption, bitterness, and hypocrisy will be manifested. The world will be operated on according to the Lord Jesus and His truth. The righteousness of the Jew will be but dust before Him. The justice of the Gentiles will become mere terminology before His judgment. The world, whether the Jewish part, the Gentile part, or the church, will declare its true condition before Antichrist. God's goal is to expose man's true condition (Luke 2:34-35). His truth and Satan's lies will be presented before men at the same time. At that time, man will see that he prefers the deception of Satan to God and His Christ. The excuses of today are only disguises.</P><P>Those who are tried are all those "who dwell on the earth." Their hearts are with their bodies. Their homes, fame, position, and wealth are all in this world. On that day, the great trial will show how great their foolishness is. God has no intention to ill-treat His own people. God's purpose is not for His people to be judged with the world (1 Cor. 11:32). However, because the believers mix themselves with the worldly ones and participate in their sins, they are involved and affected when the worldly ones are tested. Since the believers have fellowship with them in heart, it is inevitable that they suffer with them in body. The scriptural teaching is that those who mingle with the world suffer the punishment of the world. We should be so separated from the world that we are not conformed to the world (Rom. 12:2). Of course, eternal life is guaranteed. However, the three and a half years of trial on earth is not something that all regenerated ones will be able to avoid.</P><P>Now is the time to preach the gospel. The goal of the gospel is to gain people from the world for Christ. The thoughts, feelings, desires, and cravings of the saints must be upward toward the glory above. If they are already standing on the ground of Christ's endurance, they have already forsaken the world and will need no more sifting from the world. If they still reserve a place for the world, they will surely be tried together with those who dwell on the earth. We should know that we belong to heaven. We are heavenly people on earth. If we are not this way, we will be tried by the earthly men in order that we may be delivered from the earthly things. This is God's way of grace in bringing us closer to Himself. Since we are Christians, our job is no longer that of living on earth and seeking the earthly matters. A sojourning and pilgriming attitude should always be manifested in our daily living. Those sojourners who are so happy to be away from home will not want to return until they have become desolate in their exile. "Keep you out of the hour of trial." What a precious promise this is!</P><P>Soon the whole world will be tried, but the Lord will preserve a special group of people from this trial. To whom is this promise given? Will the whole church of God be spared from this great tribulation? No. The Lord has clearly shown us the qualifications of this group of people. It will not be for all the believers; only part of the believers will be preserved by the Lord. Those believers who possess the nature of Philadelphia will be preserved. Those who keep the Lord's word of endurance, that is, those who keep the word of His second coming and those who hope to be raptured will receive the things promised here. What is required here is not just faith, but the works after faith. Before the Lord will preserve, we must first keep. Such a promise is conditional.</P><P>The acknowledgment of the Lord Jesus as the Son of David is intimately related to the keeping of the Lord's word of endurance. Both speak of the glory of the millennium and the corresponding necessary preparation and watchfulness of the individual believers. Those who believe in one will have the other. The former is a testimony of the believers toward the Jews. As such it is linked to a promise of glory in the eyes of the Jews. The latter is a testimony of the believers in the world. As such it is linked to a promise of being spared from a trial which is designed for the world. Not all the believers will be preserved this way. Only those who keep the Lord's word of endurance will be preserved. All those whose character, nature, and conduct fall short of those of the messenger of Philadelphia will be disqualified. The Lord's word here tells us that all those who have not kept the crucial word of the Lord's coming and of His endurance, though they are still believers, will face the trial because of this little, nonetheless serious, failure. All those who are not willing to exalt the Lord's name as the King will see the door in heaven temporarily shut to them. How solemn this is! May we be properly affected! If we do not suffer at the hands of the world, we will suffer together with the world in the future. If we are tried by the world now through our faithfulness in our living and our testimony, we will be preserved from the judgment that will come upon those in the world in the future. However, this will not be the case with all regenerated Christians. Hence, some will have to experience trials, for this promise will not include them.</P><P>Here we see that Sardis and Philadelphia typify two kinds of believers. Both are saved, for both are golden lampstands before the Lord. An unsaved church cannot have a representation of a golden lampstand in the heavenly tabernacle. However, because of the difference in their conduct, they will receive different treatment at the coming of the Lord. Sardis typifies the unwatchful believers. The Lord will come upon them like a thief in the night. At a time when they do not know, the Lord will have already come and will have taken some believers away, while they will be left behind. Philadelphia is a type of the watchful believers. They will be raptured away before the hour of trial comes. As Sardis needs the trials to purify it from worldliness, Philadelphia needs the rapture to preserve its safety. The lukewarm Laodicea is probably the condition of the church in the world after Philadelphia. Yet the Lord is still calling the overcomers there.</P><P>The rapture is the unique way for the Lord to preserve His faithful people. Death can also spare one from trial, but death is not God's way of preserving man, because the final result of trial is also death. Neither will God prepare any place on earth to hide the saints because this trial will come upon "the whole inhabited earth." Surely there is no place that can be spared from this trial. The city of Philadelphia will not be spared from the attack of Antichrist. On the contrary, Philadelphia was one city in Asia, and Asia was a province in the Roman Empire. In the future the Roman Empire will be the kingdom of Antichrist. This trial will "try them who dwell on the earth." Hence, those who inherit this promise must be delivered from this "earth." They must be delivered from both the hour and the place. They will be raptured to heaven, just as God has revealed in other portions of the Scripture. This kind of rapture must occur before the appearance of the "man of sin."</P><P>What is covered here can best be proven by chapter twelve. There we see that whatever the intention of the enemy is, the man-child, the overcoming saints, will be safely raptured to the throne of God. Satan wants to shut the door, but he cannot do it. He wants to devour the man-child as soon as it is born, but he cannot do it. In the end, all he will be able to do is "to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, which tabernacle in heaven" (Rev. 13:6). The saints have kept the Lord's word of endurance already. They are spared from the trial. Yet the defeated ones will still suffer on earth at the hand of Satan and his ministers (Rev. 12:17; 13:7). They should allow the enemy to persecute them without any resistance. At that time they will realize that the world is not at all lovable anymore!</P><P>Hence, the teaching here is fully compatible with that in Luke 21:36. "But be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man." The things which are about to take place are the things happening in the great tribulation as mentioned previously. The way to escape is to stand before the Son of Man. This is the rapture, for without the rapture there is no other way for us to be able to stand before the Son of Man. The qualification to escape is to be watchful and to beseech at every time. The words here were spoken to the disciples. In the Lord's consideration, the condition for one's escape from tribulation is not being a disciple, but how to be a disciple. Watchfulness and beseeching are the necessary conditions for rapture. All the responsibility is now upon us. It is up to us to choose what we want and what we reject.</P><P>This kind of rapture is not a blessing for the Jews. When the time comes, God will say to them: "Come, my people, enter your rooms, / And shut your doors behind you; / Hide for a short moment / Until the indignation has passed" (Isa. 26:20). This is their way of salvation. However, this does not mean that they will have no sufferings, for Revelation 12, a corresponding passage, tells us that they, the woman in Revelation 12, escape to the "wilderness," an uninhabited place. However, the dragon is still chasing behind. Daniel said: "At that time your people, every one found written in the book, will be delivered" (12:1). However, those who keep the Lord's word of endurance will not only be "delivered" during the great tribulation, but will be kept out of the trial altogether. At that time, the godly remnants among the Jews will be "chosen" of God in "the furnace of affliction" (Isa. 48:10). They will be saved through "the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory" (Matt. 24:30). However, the overcoming believers will be raptured before the start of the great tribulation.</P><P>The blessing we will receive will be like that of Abraham. We will not be like Lot. We do not have to escape to Zoar. We will be totally out of the trials. We believe that we will not only be saved, but will fully be kept out of it. Our hope is the hope of Enoch and not the experience of Noah. We will be raptured before the flood comes. We do not want to pass through the flood safely. The Lord's promise to His faithful believers is to preserve them and to keep them completely away from the place and hour of trial. However, unless the believers have the spiritual condition of Abraham and Enoch, they will not have a part in this blessed preservation. Our separation from the world must be so deep that the world can no longer be counted worthy as our dwelling. Our walk with God must be so intimate that there cannot be a moment when we are separated from Him, so that He can take us away from the world and we can be with Him forever.</P><P>Brothers, the midnight call has sounded. The words, "Behold, the bridegroom! Go forth to meet him!" have sounded in your ears. May I ask if you have gone forth yet? It is not enough to hear and to believe in this call. The most important step is to go forth. Have you left behind everything that is not in harmony with the Lord? Have you forsaken everything for the Lord? Are you ready to face Him yet? If you are, there will be nothing for you to be afraid of. Actually, everything that man wants to preserve is worthless. Our greatest benefit comes when we give up everything to meet Him. Our greatest joy lies in taking His way of suffering. Such a thought should be impressed upon our heart. It is not enough for us to have oil in the lamp. For we ourselves to be saved does not include everything. The pleasure of His heart is the duty of the saints. May the Lord deliver us from selfish feelings. He has saved us for the purpose that we would think of Him. He wants us to go forth and to meet Him, that is, to consider His coming to be more important than anything else. Is this our attitude? Oh, that we would have greater love for the rejected Lord! Oh, that we would have a stronger inclination to please Him!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE ELEVEN</H2><P>Verse 11:"I come quickly; hold fast what you have that no one take your crown." </P><P>This word is both a consolation as well as a warning. It is a warning, yet at the same time it consoles. The Lord has promised what He can promise. The believers have done what they can do. Now the danger is drawing back and losing the Lord's promise because of drawing back. This drawing back may be caused by the weariness and disappointment of prolonged days in the battlefield. Hence, a warning becomes necessary. It causes the believers to be aware of the danger ahead. A consolation is also necessary. It gives the believers encouragement from the Lord and enables them to continue on.</P><P>"I come quickly." This word tells us the way the saints will escape the trial of the great and dreadful day. The apostle presented the rapture of the believers and the "parousia" of the Lord Jesus as the way to escape the storm and waves of the enemy (2 Thes. 2:1).</P><P>Behold how the Lord encourages and comforts His believers: "I come quickly!" He seems to be saying, "Go on! The time will not be long! You should patiently stand by Me and bear your cross. Soon you will receive My glory. I come quickly!" All around Philadelphia was sin. Jezebel, Sardis, and Laodicea were on her left and right. The world was pressing upon her from without. Under such circumstances it requires special strength to follow the Lord closely. Under such an atmosphere man tends to ask, "Is it possible to exalt Christ and to obey the truth?" The Lord said these words as an answer to such questions. He knows the danger of the battlefield. He knows their sufferings. He knows that in the world they have exhausted themselves in heart and body for His sake. He knows how they have suffered hunger, coldness, pain, misunderstandings, and oppositions for His sake. Their toil, weariness, self-denial, poverty, sleeplessness, and heartaches are all noticed by Him. He knows what it is like to live in the battlefield. For these reasons, He is comforting them, encouraging them, exhorting them, telling them that the time is short, that it is now the last five minutes, that He will come quickly, and that everything will be over. As a crowd by the seashore cheers a rescue boat that is at work in a rough sea, assuring it that with a little more strength rest will come, in the same way the Lord is encouraging His people.</P><P>Since the time the Lord spoke this word, many years have passed. Are the believers doubting His promise? If they doubt it, they do not understand the language of love. This is the tone of love. In His heart, His coming is always one that comes "quickly." He wants His believers to think in their heart that His coming is quick. Those who know love will understand the tone here. The days of grace and of endurance are becoming fewer and fewer, and the presence of Christ and His glory are faintly visible already. Formerly the delay was reckoned by centuries; now it should be reckoned by years. Soon the yearly reckoning will become the monthly reckoning, and the monthly reckoning will become the daily reckoning, and the daily reckoning will become the hourly reckoning. The voice of "I come quickly" is coming closer and closer every day. The hearts of the believers should be happier day after day. The day of our rapture is drawing closer every day. How we wish that it were today! How wonderful that would be! Brothers, the things of the world are quickly passing away! What do the present sufferings matter? The glory is before us! It is already now the fourth hour. In a few minutes, the morning star will arise. Endure the sufferings a little longer, for this is the last mile. Henceforth, the legs will no longer be sore! Oh, what a thought this is!</P><P>The Lord is here reminding us to think of Him. He is not speaking to His people about the hour of His coming. He only wants them to understand that His coming is quick. He is the One who will come quickly. What we want is not just the understanding of prophecies. It is helpful to study prophecies, but we have to draw near to the Lord, see the Lord, and be with the Lord. It is because we love Him that we desire to see Him. It is not heaven and its glory that is attracting us, but the excellent Lord Himself who is attracting us to long after Himself and His presence. Oh, how our heart rejoices when we think of the time when we will sit with Him, be like Him, hear Him, behold Him, touch Him, and belong to Him forever. In reading Revelation, our heart should never remain in Revelation. The goal of this book is to reveal Him through its writing (1:1). After He has brought His servants through all the prophecies, He will say, "I Jesus" (22:16). It is not the many things that will happen in the future that will cause our hearts to rejoice. We can only be at rest in Him. He causes us to remember Him in all circumstances.</P><P>This word of soon return is most comforting to His saints! But how many will be comforted? A difference in spirituality causes us to have different attitudes toward the Lord's second coming. The believers' attitude towards the Lord's coming is an indicator of their level of spirituality. How many among today's believers are comforted by the Lord's coming? The unbelieving sinners will be afraid of His coming (Rev. 6:15-16). The mocking ones will think that the Lord will not come (2 Pet. 3:3-4). But what a pity that many among the believers will think that the Lord "delays" (Matt. 24:48). Some will be "put to shame" (1 John 2:28) at the Lord's coming. But those who have no barrier with the Lord have their heart turned to heaven already. They are completely lost in the Lord already. Hence, although they realize that the Lord's coming will leave some worldly ones on earth to suffer and that He will come to judge the believers, they are not afraid. On the contrary they "await" (1 Thes. 1:10), "have loved" (2 Tim. 4:8), and are "awaiting the blessed hope" (Titus 2:13) of the Lord's descent. These words speak of the believers' spiritual condition. Those who truly love the Lord will not "be troubled" (John 14:1) by the Lord's soon coming (14:3), but those who love the world will be confused and will suffer at heart when they think of the Lord's coming. The apostle told us that the Lord's coming and His rapture are something with which the believers may "comfort one another" (1 Thes. 4:18). Oh, what a consolation! His coming will terminate everything we have in the world and will begin everything we will have in heaven. Oh, glorious moment! The believers in Sardis will become more sorrowful at the Lord's soon coming because they are similar to the worldly ones in too many things. However, you Philadelphians should hear the Lord's encouraging and comforting word to you.</P><P>"Hold fast what you have." What do they have? They have the brotherly love, the little power, the keeping of the Lord's word, the not denying of His name, and the exalting of the Lord's word of endurance now and of His coming kingship in the future. These are the things that they have to hold fast. The Lord has not told them to add anything or to seek for anything. What they have is enough already. The Lord's word, His name, and His endurance are all here. We cannot hold fast what we do not have. Only after we have experienced the power of the Lord's word, the victory in the Lord's name, and the endurance of the Lord's cross can we continue to hold fast.</P><P>The Lord does not call them to repentance as He did with the other churches. Neither does He ask them to return as if they have veered off from the proper track of God's will. He is not merely saying that their way is right and that they should go on. The question now is not whether or not what we preach, believe in, and live out is the truth. This question has long been settled. The question now is how our end will be. We should hold fast to what we have. Although those around us have one by one forsaken the Lord's word of endurance and His word of overcoming Satan fully in the future, we should still hold fast to this word. Although the Lord's word and His name separates us from others and leads us to sufferings, we should still hold fast. We should hold fast what we have before the world, before the devil, and before the saints.</P><P>"That no one take your crown." What is the meaning of a crown? A crown is worn by a king. Hence, the crown is a symbol of kingship. It does not say here if the crown is "glorious," "of life," or "righteous." But this crown, like all other crowns, is given only to those who have fulfilled the requirements. The "crown" is not the same as eternal life; it does not refer to salvation. It is sure that no one can take away our salvation, but a crown is something added to the common salvation. Not all believers will have the crown. The glory in the future will be divided into ranks. Some will receive only one crown. Some will receive more than one. Some will not receive any because they failed in their conduct. All those who believe in the Lord Jesus will have eternal life, but only those who suffer for the Lord will receive a crown. Here it seems to tell us that there is a definite number of crowns. If we lose the one we have gained, it will be transferred to another one. This is the meaning of the parable of taking one talent and giving it to the ten-talented one. God has reserved a crown as a reward for us for every place that He has put us in and every testimony that He wants us to bear. But due to slothfulness, self-pity, self-love, or self-will, we may lose our crown. When that happens, God will give our crown to those after His heart.</P><P>"Hold fast what you have that no one take your crown." The messenger in Philadelphia did receive his crown eventually. He has already received a crown from the Lord based on what he already has. We do not have to wait until the judgment seat to know if we have a crown. Our own life and work today will tell us if we have it or not. The apostle Paul strove and ran at the beginning with the hope of receiving such a crown (1 Cor. 9:24-27). At the end of his race, he knew that he had already received "the crown of righteousness" (2 Tim. 4:8). The messenger here also knows that he has already received a crown while he is still on the earth.</P><P>But it is one thing to have the crown. It is another thing to preserve it. The glory we have received now can be lost through future failures. The condition for being rewarded is to be continuously progressing. The method by which we received is the same method by which we preserve. Only by holding fast to what we have can we maintain our crown. The believers should know that it is possible for them to lose what they have. As such, it is possible for them to lose their crown. To lose the truth once held fast is to have the believers' nature changed. As a result of this, the reward is lost. "Look to yourselves that you do not lose the things which we wrought, but that you may receive a full reward" (2 John 8).</P><P>Now is the time when everything is drifting. On the one hand, there are revivals, but on the other hand, there are degradations. Although the Holy Spirit has worked in power, and although man has received the truth with joy, there is still the ebbing after the rising of the tide. The backward trend of Laodicea can be seen everywhere. Difficulties and sufferings have caused many revived ones to fall back to their original position. Once a believer no longer holds fast to his Philadelphian nature, he will immediately become the comrade of Laodicea. Many crowns have been lost. If the Lord delays, many more crowns will be lost. Unless the believers prepare oil in their vessels in addition to having it in their lamps, they will soon see their lamps going out. It is a joy to follow the Lord in season; there is no hardship involved. However, when we are carried to where we "do not wish to go" (John 21:18), and we still maintain our heart for the Lord, then we will have a surplus supply. Now is the time for the believers to be sifted. God is using our environment to approve those who are worthy to be glorified together with His Son. God wants to make manifest His Son's "three hundred of Gideon." Whether or not one will be chosen is completely his own choice. God's arrangements and trials only show the kind of people we are. But those who hold fast will see the hand of Christ holding their hands and His arms surrounding them. From now on, all the responsibility is on us. The crown has already been given to us. If we are not faithful, it will be taken away. How solemn this is!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE TWELVE</H2><P>Verse 12:"He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name." </P><P>"He who overcomes." Does one still need to overcome in Philadelphia? What does this overcoming mean? What are they to overcome? We know that in these few letters, all the overcoming refers to the overcoming of things within the church. In Ephesus it was the failure of the first love. In Pergamos it was the living in the world. In Thyatira it was the teaching and work of Jezebel. In Sardis it was the infection of deadness and coldness. In Laodicea it was the lukewarmness. Smyrna was, of course, slightly different. There the believers did not have to overcome the sin within the church; they only needed to overcome the persecutions of death from without. But Philadelphia is fully approved by the Lord. It does not have as severe a persecution as Smyrna had. What then does it have to overcome? If everything it has is commended by the Lord, what more does it have to overcome?</P><P>We know that this letter has no words of rebuke; there are only words of praise. Still, there are words of warning. This warning speaks of danger. Before we see the Lord, danger is unavoidable. When we see the danger, we will know the things that they have to overcome. The danger is the losing of one's Philadelphian nature. This danger is real and urgent; it demands the greatest attention from the believers because all their blessing hangs on this line. This is the danger here. They do not have to oppose any sin; they do not have to do any more work. Their overcoming lies in their holding fast.</P><P>Hence, even in Philadelphia, there are still overcomers. No matter what a church's nature is, the matter of overcoming is still a personal thing. Overcoming requires individual power and spiritual love. It is, of course, a wonderful thing to meet and to fellowship with those saints who have a true Philadelphian nature. But we have to remember that this is an individual matter. No matter how spiritual and perfect the man with whom we have fellowship is, we can only please the Lord and receive His reward based on our being overcomers ourselves. To be together with spiritual saints will not make us spiritual persons. It is only when individual overcomers link together that we have a true Philadelphia. Philadelphia is the church of the overcomers, but only those who continue to be Philadelphians can be the true overcomers. This is the teaching given here.</P><P>Philadelphia speaks of the work of the Holy Spirit in saving the believers from the world. Of course, human organizations and associations, due to the fact that they exalt man's name rather than the teaching of the Lord's word, are also excluded. When believers receive the Lord's word as the standard of their living, God's word penetrates the believers' life and causes all that is natural and of the self to fall before God. When the Lord's name is exalted, it becomes the captain to lead us to victory over the enemy. By the Lord's word and His name, the believers will overcome those of the synagogue of Satan. They will meet around the Lord's name. They will keep His word of endurance and will be willing to be despised together with the Lord in this world. They will endure through the Lord's endurance. At the same time, their brothers who accompany them on the way will bear the Lord's ordained love. This is the true nature of the church. It is a general description of Philadelphia.</P><P>But herein also lies the danger. Many times, the distinction is clear at the beginning. The spiritual power is great, all the works are simple, and Christ is the Head of everything. Soon after, however, a new organization comes in, and one will not be holding fast to the initial Philadelphian nature but will instead be holding fast to one's organization. This is the cause of the loss of freshness. This is true both in the case of a church as well as in the case of an individual's history. The only warning that the Lord gives us is to hold fast. We should not follow the conduct of the past defeated ones. Although the present environment is harsher and the temptations greater, they will make our victories more glorious.</P><P>"He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore." Here the Lord Jesus mentions "My God" four times. In this book, He maintains this relationship with God. This expression means that He is standing in the position of an anointed and glorified Man. It means that "God is the head of Christ" (1 Cor. 11:3). However, it means more than that. The expression "My God" also speaks of His union with us. In His resurrection, when He put His brothers on the same standing that He is on, He said: "I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God" (John 20:17). The apostle quotes the Lord's word: "I will trust in Him" as a proof that "He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers" (Heb. 2:11). Hence, when Paul tried to make the believers understand the power that raised them up together with Christ, he called upon "the God of our Lord Jesus Christ" (Eph. 1:17). The emphasis of "My God" here shows that the Lord Himself is the glorified Man, and that He is the Man who is joined to those who believe in Him.</P><P>God promised David that his son would build Jehovah a temple. In a simple sense, this was fulfilled in Solomon. But strictly speaking, the complete fulfillment of this will be accomplished by the Lord Jesus in the future. The apostle considered that one part of this promise of God (2 Sam. 7:14) refers to the Lord Jesus (Heb. 1:5). That being the case, it is apparent that the entire context refers also to the Lord Jesus. When Solomon built the temple, there were two pillars. One was called Jachin, and the other was called Boaz (1 Kings 7:15, 21). They served as the most wonderful and powerful decorations of the temple of that day. But when the One greater than Solomon builds the better temple in the future, the overcomers will be the more splendid pillars there. Jachin, meaning "He will build," and Boaz, meaning "with strength within," will both have their fulfillment in the overcomers at the time of the resurrection. A pillar is used firstly for supporting a house and secondly for decoration and for beauty. The Philadelphian believers were weak, but now the Lord has made them the most powerful ones. They were formerly despised, but now the Lord has made them glorious and desirable. How difficult it is to be content with weakness! What suffering it is to humble oneself willingly! But if we are content with the Lord's love and His promise today, we will see the Lord uplift us in the future.</P><P>"And he shall by no means go out anymore." Although for Christ's sake we are standing outside the strong and orderly crowd today, in that day, we will forever be pillars in the temple of God and will go no more out. Although the world can chase us out of the synagogue of Satan, which can mean both physically as well as spiritually driven, in the future God will put us in His temple forever. All the pillars of the earthly temple of old were first stripped of their outward gold by the enemies. They were then removed from their foundations and were then smashed to pieces and taken to Babylon (2 Kings 18:16; 25:13-14). But the Lord said that the pillars in the future temple will not suffer this anymore; they will remain there forever and will not go out anymore. God's reward to us in the future has no revocation. Our present sure work will gain us the future sure reward. If we "hold fast," God will cause us to not "go out anymore." The nature of our reward in the future depends on the nature of our work today. How solemn this is! "He shall by no means go out anymore." Today one can go out again because there are many who will not "hold fast." If believers would turn and would hold fast to the end, they will "by no means go out anymore"!</P><P>It is worth noticing that here the Lord does not speak of the throne, but the temple. We would usually think that reward is related to the throne. Indeed, this is what the next letter tells us. But why does the Lord speak of the temple here? The throne is a symbol of power, but the temple symbolizes something else. The temple is the place of worship; there God is exalted. The Philadelphian believers seem to understand the matter of worship more than any others. As a result, the Lord gives to them this special place. We have seen that no other church desires the Lord's nature, person, and virtues as much as she does. This is the prerequisite to worship. This is what attracts our heart. Worship is not just a matter of thanking God. Cravings, love, exaltation, marveling, and enjoyment are all integral parts of worship. Worship is not just gratitude for the grace given by God; it is gratitude for the God who gives grace. Worship is often related to God Himself. Worship is not singing hymns, praying, or giving thanks, although these may be expressions of worship. Worship is an attitude of honest exaltation of God in spirit for His being God. However, the accomplishment of the Lord's blood and His leading in drawing us to God often initiate us to the way of worship.</P><P>Quite often there are engravings on pillars. They are for the commemoration of accomplishments and the spreading of fame. For this same reason Christ is engraving three names on the pillars of the temple of His God:</P><P>(1) "The name of My God." When the Lord Jesus came, He revealed to us the name of God: "the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit." Since the saints have not rejected the Lord's name, He is now writing upon them the name of God. The God whom they love and serve will forever become a mark on them. As the high priest of old bore the mark of "holiness to the Lord," in the future the overcoming saints will also bear a mark. In the future, the name of God will be upon the believers and will be manifested before everyone.</P><P>Although the Lord Jesus is speaking here to His own servants, He never forgets His own position as a Servant of the Father. Hence, He calls their God His God. This is especially wonderful because He is speaking here in the qualification of the Son of David inheriting the kingdom. Antichrist will come in his own name and will blaspheme the true God. The Lord Jesus, however, respectfully acknowledges the name of His Father and considers Himself as merely His servant. Still, God appoints Him king.</P><P>(2) "The name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God." Portions like this should be interpreted literally. In chapter twenty-one we shall see that in the future God will actually bring down a real New Jerusalem from heaven. Our city is like Christ, one that is hidden in God. In the millennium, it will be manifested in full glory and beauty. The New Jerusalem is an actual city. Hence, it does not refer to the church. The overcomers will have the Lord writing the name of this famous city upon them; one will be able to read from these believers the glory and beauty of this city. Since they are sojourners and pilgrims on earth today, they will taste of the eternal home in the future. This is the proper resting place for the heart of the believers. However, the glorious practice in the future must first be manifested in the present shadow. This is why the Bible says that we have come to the heavenly Jerusalem already (Heb. 12:22). To have this, we must forever turn our back toward the corrupted Babylon and face Canaan.</P><P>(3) "My new name." In this book there are many new things: the New Jerusalem, the new heaven, and the new earth. Everything is made new. The Lord's new name is related to these new things. The Lord's name here is new. It is not just the former old name of Messiah. He will receive a better title than "the Son of David."</P><P>In the victorious cities in the old days, there were many memorial poles, which were actually pillars. On them were engraved the names of the victors. Here we see that the name of the God who has sent the overcomers out to war, the name of the city for which they go to war, and the name of the Commander of their war are engraved on the overcomers.</P><P>Here we also see the place the overcomers will be brought to in the future. During the trial, the old Jerusalem will become the headquarters of the enemy. Its temple will be occupied by Antichrist. But the heavenly city and the temple will be beyond the touch of the enemy. That will be the place where the overcomers will go.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE THIRTEEN</H2><P>Verse 13:"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."</P><P>Because this teaching is so crucial and solemn, all those who have ears should hear what Christ says in this and what the Holy Spirit says through this. We should never despise this word, for it is not the word of man. Since there is such a solemn teaching set before us, we should ask God to circumcise our ears so that we may hear. We should also have a circumcised heart to keep this word. The future rapture and glorification all depend on our present conduct. Oh, what a responsibility this is!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>APPENDIX-<br>FULFILLMENT IN HISTORY</H2><P>Of course I cannot surmise what the fulfillment of this church will be. In the present age of church degradation, it is an unhealthy act to assume oneself to be a Philadelphian. It is better to commit this into the hand of the One who knows our works. As long as we know that in church history there is such a time of Philadelphia after Sardis, we should pursue to have such a condition for the church. The most important thing for the saints to do is not to remain in Sardis if the Lord so leads them to go on to Philadelphia. If they do not go on, they will enter the stage of Laodicea.</P><P>Nevertheless, we can say a few words here. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, about a hundred years ago, God began a work in England. Gradually, this work spread to the whole earth. It led believers to leave everything man-made and to cleave to the Lord's word and exalt the Lord's name. The truth concerning the glorious coming of the Lord Jesus was recovered through them. This could have been the fulfillment of Philadelphia. At present, it pleases the Lord to open the eyes of some in China. We do not know what will happen in the future, but we know that it is indispensable to follow the Lord faithfully.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>SUB-SECTION SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>LAODICEA-THE APOSTATE CHURCH</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE> (3:14-22)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE FOURTEEN</H2><P>Verse 14: "And to the messenger of the church in Laodicea write: These things says the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the beginning of the creation of God."</P><P>Everything that God has entrusted to man and which man is responsible for has completely failed. Adam in paradise, Noah on the new earth, and the Israelites under the law have all failed one after the other. The church is no exception. The condition of Laodicea is a proof of this. Although Laodicea was an actual church at that time, of which we will speak in a moment, it also represents the condition of the whole church of God at the end of this age. At that time it will already be rejected by the Lord.</P><P>We have previously noted the difference between the things of Sardis and before Sardis. Although there is a remnant in Thyatira, Thyatira itself is full of sins, defilements, and corruptions. It hates God's truth and His holiness, and false prophets exercise authority over it. Sardis, however, is the opposite of this. Outwardly it is full of life; in name it is flawless. Yet the atmosphere of stifling death is prevalent everywhere, despite a few there who have not defiled their garments.</P><P>Not only are Sardis and Thyatira contrary to each other, but Philadelphia and Laodicea are also different from one another. If there are two churches that are diametrically different one from the other, it has to be these last two churches. This is a most natural consequence of the special work of God's Holy Spirit: all those who are willing to receive the teaching of the Lord's word and the authority of the Lord's name will become more lovable, and all those who reject them will become more condemnable.</P><P>In Philadelphia we see a bright picture. Although it is weak, there is no barrier between it and the Lord. It is fully for the Lord. This is different from the Laodicean believers, who, though pretending to be God's people outwardly, have no place in their heart for Christ inwardly. The condition in Laodicea is indeed dark. When a church reaches this stage, it is no longer worthy to be a testimony for the Lord. Its end is disqualification from its position of testimony. This, of course, does not mean eternal perdition.</P><P>This is the last word of the Lord to the church. The church throughout the ages began with the forsaking of the first love and ends with being spewed from the Lord's mouth. The most surprising thing is that this letter occurs after Philadelphia. There we saw that the believers had a real revival, God's word and His Spirit had done marvelous works, and the believers' hearts had truly turned to Christ. However, here we again see degradation and retrogression. The most unfortunate thing is that upon careful examination, we find all the corruption here comes from the failure in Philadelphia. Laodicea is but the issue of Philadelphia! The blessing there has laid the hidden line of condemnation here.</P><P>Church history as revealed to us by these few churches not only shows us a sequential order of the events of the churches throughout the ages, but it also shows us their cause and effect relationship. Protestantism comes out of Roman Catholicism, and Philadelphia comes out of Protestantism. Yet there is no recombination of these churches. What has come out of the former remains separate from it, and what remains behind continues to exist as it is. The Roman Catholic Church continues to exist apart from Protestantism. Philadelphia is only in the nature of a remnant, yet the Protestantism from which it has separated itself continues to exist. We have also seen that the Lord reveals His coming to these three churches, proving that these three will all remain until the Lord's coming again. This proves that all three will exist separately and will not be combined together. Hence, Sardis, which came out of Thyatira, will remain simultaneously with the latter until the end. Philadelphia came out of Sardis, but it will also remain simultaneously with Sardis. Since these three churches rose up one after the other, yet exist simultaneously, we can say that Laodicea must be likewise. It comes out of Philadelphia and will remain as the other three churches will until the Lord comes back.</P><P>There are some further concrete evidences. If what Sardis has is absolute coldness and what Philadelphia has is unlimited zeal, while what Laodicea has is lukewarmness, we can detect from these three the cause and effect relationship. It is for this reason that the coldness of Sardis is never matched by the lukewarmness of Laodicea. This is the only fruit that remains after God's work in grace.</P><P>Therefore, as Thyatira was the totality of the failures of the ancient church, that is, the Catholic Church, in the same way Laodicea is a complete picture of the failure of the present church, that is, the Protestant churches. This is the second total failure of the nominal church. Yet this failure happens after the recovery of an open Bible and the many blessings of revivals from God! The ultimate point of God's endurance is reached. Now He will judge all of man's failures and will build up His own work.</P><P>There is a special meaning to the word "Laodicea." The name of this church, like all the other churches, is very significant. This word is composed of two words in the original language. "Lao" means people, and "dicea" means three things according to the dictionary: (1) tradition and habits, (2) a right, and (3) a demand, a verdict, or a vengeance. From this we derive three meanings to this word: the tradition of the people, the right of the people, and the decision of the people. These three things are linked together and are practically related one to the other.</P><P>The word "people" is the most common word in modern politics. Yet we have to realize that "the people" here refers to the people in the church. From its name, we see that Laodicea is a church of people's ruling. Here we see the believers rising up for independence and self-rule. They oppose the authority of their spiritual leaders. They consider the church to be the church of the members and that everything should be according to the common will of the members. In this way, the ancient church has followed the most modern trend. They choose their pastors like they choose their lawyers and doctors. They think that since they contribute the money, they should therefore make the choice. They should receive according to their contribution of money. Although they may not admit that they have itching ears, it is nevertheless a fact that they "heap up to themselves teachers" (2 Tim. 4:3). In any case, the ear is always their counselor. This is inevitable because it is always the speakings, whether soothing or offensive to the ear, that decide the employment or unemployment of a person.</P><P>Even when they are pastors, they are standing only on the ground of hired workers. In the Presbyterian Church, there are the elected elders as the decision makers of the church. This is a democratic institution. In the Episcopal Churches there are also the elected directors who oversee all the affairs of the church. The pastor is only a moral counselor. In the Congregational Churches this is even more truly the case. The Congregational Church has the members as the basic unit. Its very name implies this. The present day churches are truly democratic churches. The minority has to submit to the majority. The solution to all problems is to win enough votes and to gain enough hands. Anything that is agreed upon by all, whatever this thing may be, can be executed. Anything that is vetoed, whatever it may be, has to be stopped. The quantity is emphasized, and the quality is neglected. The most pitiful thing is that the condition of the church, even at its best, is such that the spiritual ones are always in the minority. Under such a circumstance, how can one hope to see a flourishing situation? Many churches are in fact worse than this. Is this not a pitiful condition? Of course there is always the possibility for the few spiritual ones to affect the whole. At a time when public right is highly developed, however, the spiritual ones in the church have become to many the most useless ones. It is possible to ask them to pray, but one cannot ask them to be in charge of anything.</P><P>The system of Roman Catholicism is, of course, most autocratic. Everyone from the Pope at the top to the priests are all authoritative. The common believers do not have the right even to come to God directly. These are the middle-men between God and men. They go to God for the common believers and go to the common believers in the authority of God. This, of course, was overturned by the Reformation. Now the Bible is open, and man is to listen to the Bible and not to the priests or the Pope. At the beginning of Christianity the Bible was propagated through hand-written copies which were few in number. Not many people received a copy of it. After the Reformation God brought in the invention of the printing press at the right time, and the Bible became the most common book. There is now the possibility for everyone to have a copy of the Holy Book. The believers can still be ignorant of the Bible. Yet if they are ignorant now, it is because they have chosen to be so instead of being forced to be so. Having the Bible is, of course, the greatest blessing. But then, the responsibility that comes with it is also very great.</P><P>Although the Bible has been released, and Protestantism has upheld the liberty of the believers, the overwhelming number of fleshly ones and their reluctance to bear responsibility before the Lord causes the so-called "clergy-laity system" to come into being in Protestantism. It becomes a different form of the Roman priesthood. The believers are willing to blindly follow their blind leaders. We have said much about this before and will not repeat it here again.</P><P>Sardis is the product of the reformation of Thyatira, and Philadelphia is the product of the reformation of Sardis. Protestantism initiated a reformation from Roman Catholicism, and Philadelphia initiated a reformation from Protestantism. Outwardly Protestantism and Roman Catholicism are very different. Actually they are more or less the same; both are dead. Protestantism only took the authority away from the Roman Pope and gave it to another group of people. The authority was never returned to Christ. The authority that was in the hand of the Pope has now been transferred into the hands of the kings (for the state churches) and the hands of the many founders of denominations (for the many independent denominations). Man's creeds, ordinances, and constitutions have replaced what was once the will of the Pope. The Bible is supposedly released, yet man's theology, tradition, and creeds have still silenced it and shut it up. Of course, Protestantism will never admit to this fact, but the fact is there. How can one deny it? If Sardis had indeed reached the proper standard, we would not have seen Philadelphia being raised up in Revelation. It is because Sardis has taken the authority for church administration from the hand of one group of church officers and given it to another group of church officers that the Holy Spirit raises up Philadelphia. Who can doubt that Philadelphia is the result of the work of the Holy Spirit? Philadelphia typifies a total submission to Christ and a recognition that the Lord's word and His name have the highest authority and that they should be honored by the believers.</P><P>If we are thoughtless and if we do not have much experience or any spiritual discernment, we will not understand why Laodicea, the church of the human opinion, would come about after the great revival of Philadelphia and how it could have come about in the midst of Philadelphia. Yet this is actually the most natural and sure result. Philadelphia came out of Sardis, and Laodicea came out of Philadelphia. Philadelphia is one step more advanced than Sardis, but when Philadelphia regresses, it does not become Sardis again nor return to the position at Sardis. Instead, it becomes something new-Laodicea!</P><P>Laodicea is one step backward from Philadelphia. The degraded Philadelphia is Laodicea. Philadelphia opens the way for Laodicea to come in. In Thyatira there was naturally the ruling of the Pope. In Sardis there was naturally the ruling of the clergy system. In Philadelphia these things have naturally been overturned. The nature of Philadelphia is to draw near to Christ, to honor Christ, and to suffer for Christ. The Lord's warning, however, is that every Philadelphian believer has to hold fast to what he has. Not everyone begins as a Philadelphian, and not everyone remains as one forever. If a man loses what he has, he will no longer be a Philadelphian. It does not mean that those who stay with the Philadelphian believers will forever preserve their Philadelphian nature. In the end only the overcomers are the true Philadelphians. All others will be disqualified and will degrade to become the Laodiceans.</P><P>Those who keep the Lord's word, the Lord's name, and the Lord's endurance will always remain Philadelphian believers, but those who drift along with the tide will inevitably become the Laodicean believers. If a man does not take up the yoke of Christ, his own will becomes more rebellious than before. Among those in Thyatira, there were many who submitted to Jezebel and there were also many false prophets. In Sardis there was still the submission to the clergymen. But those who have been taught the teaching of Philadelphia will know that neither the Pope nor the clergy can deserve our submission. What we should submit to are Christ and His word. If such a one becomes fallen, he will not only reject the Lord's word, but will at the same time become disgusted with Jezebel and the clergy system. The end of such a one is to walk according to his own will and his lust. This is Laodicea. When these believers come together, immediately we see a church of the Laodiceans.</P><P>Of course, we like to hear words about the equality of the believers, and of course, it is right to reject the special privileges of the clergy system. But does it mean that no one then will be allowed to do anything that God has not laid down? The laity can annul the authority of the clergy, but by so doing, the authority has not yet returned to its owner. Only Christ is the Lord, and only He should have the authority. The authority does not belong to the clergymen nor to the laity or the people. "A minister of the gospel," by definition, should indeed be a servant. However, he should not be the servant of man but should be the servant of Christ. Is this not the point that the apostle tried unceasingly to prove? Who can control another's servant? Who dares to be a servant, yet at the same time controls the other servants of his master? Unless a person is in the position of a master, he should not dare to do this. Not only are the servants Christ's, even the whole church is Christ's. He alone has the right to arrange its internal administration, setup, organization, and order. He is the Head. All others are only the members. Is it not rebellion if one member, or a few members, even all the members rise up to control the Body and to consider themselves to be without a Head or to have no need of a Head? Yet, this is the picture of Laodicea-the servants controlling the servants, and the members controlling the Body.</P><P>Although the opinion and the right of the people in Laodicea are something that fit in with the current of the age, Christ is shut out of Laodicea in the same way that He was shut out of Thyatira and Sardis. The question is not whether power rests with the minority or with the majority. It is useless to transfer power from one group of people to another. Christ must have His rightful and proper position. If we have left Thyatira or Sardis, yet are not in Philadelphia, we will be in Laodicea. If Christ has the rightful place, then all servants have to be His servants. If Christ has the rightful place, then all the people have to be His people. Philadelphia and Laodicea are the same with respect to the opposition against the domination of the clergy system. The only difference is that Philadelphia was zealous for the Lord, while Laodicea was fighting for its own right. There is only a thin line between Laodicea and Philadelphia. One submits to the Lord; the other submits to the self. Everything that does not submit fully to Christ is Laodicea. Laodicea is a walk that does not submit to the Lord's word but rather subjects itself to self-will. If man does not have the right to rule over us, does this mean then that we have complete freedom to do whatever we want? Any insubordination to the will of man, unless for the sake of submitting to Christ, is a form of lawlessness. If we are not absolute for the Lord, yet we attack human traditions, organizations, and methods, such attacks are surely of the flesh. Many believers are naturally against oldness; they are inclined toward the extraordinary. If such believers rise up to oppose human authority, we have to be careful for fear that the motive and power of their work are more of the flesh than of the spirit. It does not mean that everyone who speaks the same language as Philadelphia is Philadelphia. Only those whose hearts have been taught by God, who know the Lord's authority, and who are willing to be obedient can be counted as Philadelphia. One must not submit only because in that particular instance the matter suits his taste. We do not know how much of the flesh is hidden within the matter of submission to God! This is not a question of our outward conduct. The main thing is whether or not the believers' hearts are taught by God, and whether or not they realize that one should obey the Lord and His word. There is no ground left here for the natural affection. It is not a matter of how we feel, but a matter of what the Lord has said. In everything, the only thing that matters is what the Lord has said. The warning to Laodicea is not concerning a position but a spirit. Although many have absolutely nothing to do with Thyatira and Sardis positionally, although they are like Philadelphia in tone and voice, and although they may even be meeting with Philadelphia, they can still be Laodicean believers. Everything that is done according to man's will, whose spirit is not subject to the authority of the Lord's word, is Laodicea. What do we see today all around us? All we see is but human opinion and human authority. Those teachings in the Bible which believers consider suitable and compatible with their taste are practiced. Otherwise, no matter how severe the commandment of the Lord is, they will either explain it away, delay it again and again, or ignore it altogether. The lack among believers today is not of more biblical knowledge. If they can keep what they already know, that is already excellent enough. What is needed now is for the heart to be taught of God and to know that one has the responsibility to keep God's commandments, that is, to keep all that is recorded in the Holy Book. If there is not such a heart, it will be useless even if one were to leave everything behind and walk in and out with the church in Philadelphia. If the believer's heart is right before the Lord, even if he does not know many things, God can teach him. The most heartbreaking thing is that God's children today do not regard God's word as God's word. As such, they do not keep God's word as it ought to be kept by man. If believers do not have an honest and respectful heart to obey God's word, what use is it for them to proclaim with their mouth that they are serving God?</P><P>At present we see human opinion everywhere. How few would submit to God and His Bible absolutely! The Laodicean atmosphere has pervaded the church and individuals. What man now asks is not what God's will is or what God's word says, but what the opinion of others is. They ask for the opinion of such and such a person that they respect, or they consult their own opinion. God's authority is cast behind the believers' back. There is no longer a use for God's Word except to take one or two verses from it as topics and subjects. All these are of the self-will! They are most detested by God. Man's natural opinions, no matter how good they are, are opposed to God. God's goal is that everyone who belongs to Him would fully deny themselves in everything and would daily echo the Lord's words: "I have come down from heaven not to do My own will but the will of Him who sent Me" (John 6:38). Everything that issues from us will not please God. God only approves His own will. Only those who have a heart to carry out God's will absolutely are the Philadelphians. Otherwise, if one turns the freedom of the Philadelphians into an occasion for the flesh, of which the self-will is, the word "Laodicea" will be plainly written on his face.</P><P>Now the great Laodicea, although preaching a divine Christ, is becoming more and more worldly and humanistic day by day and is becoming more and more manifest before our eyes. How should we deal with this? Perhaps we ourselves have already become a part of Laodicea. Perhaps we have never acknowledged the authority of Christ, having received Him as Savior only, without also receiving Him as the Lord. How much we need to be taught! This is the most crucial matter, for there are Laodicean churches, and there are Laodicean individuals. There are spiritual Laodiceas, and there are practical Laodiceas. Are we willing to open up our hearts honestly to receive the Lord's rebuke here? If we boast that we have received the truth but have not received the separating power of this truth, we are indeed foolish. If we have not heard the Lord's rebuke through the grace of God, at least we can learn from this letter the way to deal with the present-day Laodicean attitude. Here we see the Lord's motive and His word. These can serve as our example. We will never be wrong if we follow Him. His letter to Laodicea in that day is sent to all Laodiceans throughout the centuries. We should say what He has said. We should write down what He has written down. His attitude should be our attitude.</P><P>"[1] The Amen, [2] the faithful and true Witness, [3] the beginning of the creation of God." Here the Lord Jesus reveals Himself to the messenger in Laodicea. The name revealed by the Lord Jesus here is unlike the one in John's vision in chapter one. It seems to indicate that as the church slid further and further downward from its beginning, He withdrew further and further from His original fellowship with the church. Here the Lord again unveils His own virtues. What the Lord reveals in the last three churches are things not revealed in the first vision. He is revealing His own position in relation to the need of the church. All these characteristics show how the church ought to testify for God in the world. Yet it has failed. As a result, the Lord Jesus came in and demonstrated that in everything in which the church has failed, He has overcome. God must secure His glory. He delights to see that His people accomplish His commission. Yet if they fail, He will declare His own name.</P><P>Here the Lord did not say that He is holding the key of David to supply their need. Nor did He reveal Himself in order that they would love Him. Neither did He reveal Himself as the holy and true One with the purpose that they would worship Him. The atmosphere has changed here. His revelation here is not so warm and intimate. He is merely revealing a little of His own nature, of how He had once worked for God, and how He will be the Head of all things. This will not fail. In everything they have failed. He reveals Himself in this way as if to tell them that in none of these things they are up to His standard. Now He will reveal to them what they should do. The Lord is now saying that He will do what the church ought to have done.</P><P>(1) He is "the Amen." The apostle said, "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you through us, through me and Silvanus and Timothy, did not become yes and no, but our word has become yes in Him. For as many promises of God as there are, in Him is the Yes; therefore also through Him is the Amen to God, for glory through us to God" (2 Cor. 1:19-20). Hence, whether it be Christ or His word, they are both real and are both immovable and unshakable. He is always the Yes. Whatever He has said is trustworthy. All the promises of God are approved in Christ. The guarantor of all the promises is Christ. Why do we know that the promises of God will not fail? How do we know that what God has said will surely be carried out? How do we know that these promises will be accomplished in us? For the sake of our faith, God has given us Christ. Christ affirms all of God's promises. The person of Christ is the pledge of God. "He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not also with Him freely give us all things?" (Rom. 8:32). The fact that God has given us Christ proves that all of His promises are real. Is there anyone who would give us the greatest and the dearest thing but would still withhold the lesser things from us? Since we have Christ, we can believe in and claim all of God's promises. When we have Christ, we can say that we have received all of God's promises. If this is the case, it would be our mistake to hesitate or to be discouraged from claiming God's promises. If we do not have Christ, it is excusable for us to doubt. But now that we have Christ, it will be our sin if we still do not have faith. Hence, from now on, we can definitely believe that God does want to accomplish all His promises in us. We can also believe that Christ is praying for these promises to be accomplished.</P><P>God's word has been affirmed through Christ. How do we know that the Bible is true? It is through Christ. As long as we have one word from God, we can be eternally at rest because God's word is sure. It issues from His unlimited love and will never forsake us. It is for this reason that we believe the Bible to be inspired word for word. If we do not believe in this, it means that we do not believe in Christ as "the Amen," the One who affirms God's word. He Himself has told us that "the Scripture cannot be broken" (John 10:35). If the Lord Jesus were speaking to us here about a profound doctrine, we might merely consider that such profound doctrines in the Bible are great. Of course, it is not right even to think of them in this way. When the Lord said here, however, that the Scripture cannot be broken, He was not referring to any profound doctrine. Rather, He was talking about some title which, humanly speaking, has the least significance. "If He said they were gods, to whom the word of God came." There is a double significance here. It shows every Bible reader that the Bible is God-inspired and that the titles ascribed by the writers of the Bible to certain people are without any mistake. Man may doubt God's word, but Christ affirms God's word.</P><P>The title "Amen" here means that Christ is the One who accomplishes and affirms every thought and purpose of God. He is God's last word. There is nothing more advanced or progressive than Christ. All the fullness dwells in Him. We can find everything there is to find in Christ. He is the basis of everything to the believers. The failure of Laodicea arises when it tries to look for something apart from Christ. This becomes the manifestation of their self-will. Our riches and work can only be found in Him. God puts us into a life-union with Christ. He has placed us in a position of absolute dependence so that we have to walk by Christ in everything. He is the end to God's word. Only by abiding in Him and doing what He commands will we see the word of God manifested in us. We have to remember that the book of Colossians was also written to the Laodiceans. All the sins and sources of heresies arose when they did things "not according to Christ" (Col. 2:8). The believers must reach the point where everything they do is according to Christ. Whether or not a thing is good, there must not be any independent action apart from Christ. This will keep one from the mistake of Laodicea. "Christ is all" (Col. 3:11). Hence, all apostasies and all failures come about when one departs from Christ. If believers do gain something apart from Christ, they are doing good apart from the power of Christ and are leaving ground for the work of the enemy. All those who want to add anything apart from or after the Amen will lose the Amen.</P><P>The meaning of Amen is "true and absolutely sure." Isaiah 7:9 in the original language puts it well: "If ye will not amen, surely ye shall not have the amen." This means that if they do not agree with His promises, they will not receive His praise. The duty of the church on earth is to affirm God's promises. Through the faith of the church the promises will be fulfilled. Through the oneness of the church the promises will be established. Through the work of the church God's promises to the church and His punishments on the world will be proved to be real. However, because the church has forgotten its heavenly calling and has called the place where the Lord was killed its home, it has denied God's promises. If God's promises are indeed glorious, why would one still be seeking after the world? If the world is to be judged and all that is not God's will pass away, why would one strive the same way as all the others do? This is what men will say. The conduct of the church shows whether it is one with God. The church may not have borne a heavenly testimony through the Holy Spirit, but God cannot be without a testimony. Hence, Christ reveals Himself as the Amen.</P><P>(2) He is also "the faithful and true Witness." He reveals Himself in this way to show the vast difference between Himself and the church. The church has failed. Actually the church has had nothing except failures. Because the church has become unfaithful and unchaste, He is now rejecting its stand as a testimony. The church should have been a golden lampstand, shining and testifying for God. It should be manifested to be "a letter of Christ" (2 Cor. 3:3). But since it has considered itself rich, it can no longer be a testimony for the Lord who has nowhere to lay His head. Yet His people's lack does not equal His lack. "If we are faithless, He remains faithful" (2 Tim. 2:13). Soon He will arise and will bring in the day the world looks for. In that day everything will be made manifest. Even His faithfulness will be clearly revealed.</P><P>Now is the time to bear the testimony, but all the testimony of God is in Christ. This resurrected and glorified Man is the faithful and true Witness. His presence in heaven today is a testimony to His death on earth before. His death testifies that the fleshly man is fully corrupt and that God has no other way to deal with him except by judgment. His death also testifies to the great love of God. Now a man has ascended to heaven. According to God's purpose before the foundation of the world, this man has now secured God's pleasure before Him. God's thought and grace toward man are all expressed in this ascended and glorified Man. This is the Witness of God's mind and motive. God wants us to leave the corrupted and condemned place of Adam and to come to the accepted and blessed place of the glorified Man. All true witnesses, whether as a church or as individuals, must testify to what and how He is. The church ought to continue the work of Christ and be a witness on earth. However, it has utterly failed, while Christ has remained faithful. The witness of Christ will draw man's heart once more near to Him and to everything that God treasures. All those who will not be witnesses will be spewed out of His mouth.</P><P>Christ shows in this letter how He is the faithful and true Witness. What a self-flattery it is that Laodicea considers itself beyond comparison! But Christ considers it as most pitiful. How different are the two views! The Lord first shows the kind of Witness He is so that they may realize that all His coming rebukes are true!</P><P>(3) He is also "the beginning of the creation of God." He is the cause of all creation. John has already mentioned this aspect of the Lord Jesus more than once (John 1:1-3). This is, of course, related to the Lord's word in other passages: "I am the Alpha and the Omega...He who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty" (Rev. 1:8); "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End" (22:13). We have mentioned before that these titles indicate that the Lord Jesus is God.</P><P>These titles are also linked to Proverbs 8. There the Lord Jesus is called Wisdom, the Wisdom of God. "The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was" (vv. 22-23). Here it says that the Lord Jesus is the beginning of Jehovah's creation. It means the same as what is said in Revelation. However, this does not mean that the Lord Jesus did not participate in the creation of the world itself because He existed even before all creation.</P><P>There is also a similar passage in Colossians: "Who is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation" (1:15). Does this mean that the Lord Jesus is also a creature, but first among the other creatures? No, because following this it says, "Because in Him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him. And He is before all things, and all things cohere in Him; and He is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things" (vv. 16-18). Here we see the Lord Jesus as the beginning of God's creation and its relationship to Him as Head of the church. Laodicea gave Him no place, but the Bible shows us that the Lord Jesus should "have the first place in all things." We feel that the Lord Jesus is making a special linkage here. In the book of Colossians, Laodicea is mentioned four times. The Holy Spirit even charged the Laodiceans to read this Epistle.</P><P>When a believer realizes that the Lord Jesus is "the beginning of the creation of God," his life and view will be changed. Adam was the first man and the beginning of the first creation. But he failed, and everyone in him, who possesses his nature, also fell with him. The cross judges everything that is of Adam. This is the result of the first creation. We are speaking here of the accomplishment of this matter. Strictly speaking, Adam's life was already judged in Eden. There, Christ was already the beginning of the new creation. Actually, after the cross, there are still many people who have not rejected their Adamic life and are still living in the old creation. At the same time, even before the actual occurrence of the cross, there were those who had entered the new creation through believing in the accomplishment of the cross. Of course, the actual event occurred at the cross, even though the matter of crucifixion had been ordained before the foundation of the world. On the cross God terminated Adam, judged him, and rejected him and caused the second man, who is the Lord from heaven, to forever replace him. Christ has not come to mend that which is broken. Rather, He is the beginning of what God has done and will do. As soon as Christ was born, He was the second Man. But before He died and resurrected, He could not yet be the Head of the new life, nor the Head of the Body His church. The old creation was damaged by sin and is now over. Its history is about to be finished. Its judgment and its verdict were pronounced on the cross long ago. Christ's resurrection from the dead is the real beginning of all those who are God's. This was foreordained according to God's plan. The old creation was used merely to prepare the way. In man's eyes, Adam was the beginning of God's creation, but in God's eyes, the resurrected Christ is the beginning of creation.</P><P>This is the most crucial phase in God's redemption in this age. We can say that this is the foundation. God's goal is not to improve the old creation or to advance it. God has completely rejected the old creation. God would not recognize that the old creation should even exist. In saying that the Lord Jesus is "the beginning of the creation of God," He is discrediting even the old creation of Adam. He considers the Lord Jesus as the beginning and Adam as nothing. His goal now is nothing other than the total removal of everything in the old creation. He is building everything of the new creation. When a man is joined by faith to the Lord Jesus in His death and resurrection, He grants such a one a new life. This new life includes all the nature, instinct, and majesty of God's new creation. This new creation even includes all God's work. In a more confined context, this new life is the regenerated life in man. This life includes all the functions of God's creature. It is what 2 Corinthians 5:17 describes as "anyone...in Christ," that is, anyone who is related to Christ in life. "He is a new creation" because a new man has already been installed into him. "The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new." God no longer cares for the old things. Neither does He want the believers to care for them. His goal is now the new man.</P><P>This is our position. On the day that we are regenerated and receive a new life, God considers us as completely new. However, this has to be worked out in practice. Experientially speaking, at that time the believers have only received a new life. Much or even all the old creation may still remain. God now expects His believers to work together with the Holy Spirit and to put to death through the accomplishment of the cross everything that is of the old creation. He desires to see every one of us die with the Lord Jesus and lose our old creation through death so that we can allow the new creation to grow and fill up everything in the newness of resurrection. By the time the Lord Jesus comes, we will be delivered from the body of the old creation and will receive a new one. At that time the work of redemption will have been completed.</P><P>In taking the Lord Jesus as the beginning of the creation of God, God has rejected everything of the Adamic creation. If we are still ignorant of this and are still trying to accomplish God's holy demands with our mind, emotion, and will of the old creation, or if we think that we still have any strength to do God's will or have any intention to please God, and if we still do not realize our utter corruption and see that our only place is the place of death where we will fully trust in the Lord, we still do not understand what the Christian life means. If we know that Christ is the beginning of the creation of God, we will realize that nothing is according to the will of God unless it is initiated by Christ. What we initiate is not God's creation nor God's work. The world has never done anything to initiate man's qualification as a man. Anything that we initiate is of the old creation. Furthermore, since Christ is the beginning of the creation of God, all those who follow Him must bear this nature of Christ as well. Hence, everything that does not bear the nature of Christ will not survive in God's creation.</P><P>However, if Christ was outside Laodicea, how could Laodicea find its riches in Christ? Yet they said that they were wealthy and had become rich and had need of nothing. This was what they counted as gain. It is a pity that they did not count them as loss for Christ's sake. They had not learned what was of the old creation, which needed to be rejected, and what was of the new creation, which needed to be developed. They had forgotten that Christ is the beginning of the creation of God and that they should have continued in Christ. Instead, they had accumulated from themselves many things of the old creation apart from Christ. That is why the Lord spoke such a name to them. They should have manifested the power of the new creation through the Holy Spirit and should have considered everything to be of God. Yet they considered themselves too highly and aligned themselves with the world. At such a time, if we would lift up our faces toward the heavens and would see that although everything is lost from our hands and although we are put to remorse and shame, God will be satisfied in Christ. Is this not a consolation to us?</P><P>The believers have very seriously misapplied the truth of God. God's purpose for giving the law was "that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may fall under the judgment of God" (Rom. 3:19). How did the people of God apply the law? They tried to be justified by the law and establish their own righteousness by the law. Is it not the same with those under grace? God's verdict is that there is no goodness in the flesh and that the flesh cannot please Him. For this reason He points out to us the importance of regeneration and the new creation. But what do the believers do? They hope that by taking in the new life they can heal their flesh: "Before we received the new life, our flesh might have been corrupted, but now that we have the new life, perhaps the flesh can learn from it and can improve itself." Although the believers may not say this, this is what they practice. If believers would accept God's verdict, how could they depend on the flesh, utilize the flesh, or expect the flesh to gradually change? One thing, however, is sure: God only recognizes the new creation. He sees no other place for the old creation except death. The truth of the new creation also means to us that this world is under the judgment of God. Yet in their nature, the believers always love to mend. What God wants is a world of the new creation, but what man wants is an improved world. Man's thought is always different from the goal of the Holy Spirit. We can see with our eyes the work of the Holy Spirit in many places at the present time. Yet what He is doing is to "rescue us out of the present evil age" (Gal. 1:4). Man's ideal is to have a kingdom of heaven realized, a utopian society, and a Christianized world, but the result of such a work is a secularization of Christianity.</P><P>Hence, we must be careful. We should not think that we know this truth already. The question is whether or not we have experienced this truth and have practiced it. How can we say on the one hand that we are a new creation, while on the other hand hold on to "the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the vainglory of life" of the old creation (1 John 2:16)? How can we act independently without first waiting for the order of Christ, the Head of the new creation? How can we walk according to our own strength? As much as we have followed ourselves, to that extent we are Laodicea.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSES FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN</H2><P>Verses 15-16: "I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot. So, because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am about to spew you out of My mouth."</P><P>"I know your works." As the Lord has spoken to the other churches, in the same way He is now speaking to Laodicea. This is the proof. Actually it is the only proof. Our works are only a manifestation of the real condition. To know the condition of an individual or a church, all we have to do is to consider the works. Of course, this does not mean that we are able to discern, for we do not know the private secrets between our brothers and the Lord. It is wrong for one to criticize. But the Lord knows all our works. As such He knows the real situation. Now He is proving the real condition of Laodicea by its works.</P><P>"You are neither cold nor hot." They are not in one of the two categories; they are sitting exactly in between them. A corpse is cold, and a living person is hot. These ones are not cold. Hence, they are not dead in sin; they have been enlivened by the life of God. However, they are not hot either. They have departed from the first love. Their condition is somewhat abnormal. They are living, yet they have "caught a cold." The world is a freezing cold enclave, and the air there is forever wintry. When they take the risk to take their place there, it is inevitable that they will catch a cold. If believers hope that the world will not try them like a furnace, they have to expect the world to freeze them like an ice house. Under such circumstances, all light and heat will naturally and gradually be put out. If the humanity and glory of Christ is enough to stir up our first love, surely it can rekindle our love for Him. Many times our faith is only the totality of a few dozen doctrines; it is not a living person. When that happens, our heart becomes cold. This is the condition of the Laodiceans' past and present. The root of the illness is an indifference toward Christ. No matter how scriptural and interesting a doctrine is, it will not make a man burning. Only by drawing near to Christ and consecrating one's whole heart to Him will there be the burning of love. What we believe in is not some doctrines, but Christ. He is living and is a person. All those who have received Him should have a personal fellowship with Him and a personal affection for Him. But what a pity that although many have believed in the doctrine of redemption and substitution, they have never contacted Christ! Even for one who has truly received Him, if he does not preserve his heart to be absolute for Christ, he will see himself more like Laodicea day by day. The heart is the root of all problems. If the heart is not for Christ, everything will be in vain. The heart must be hot for Christ. Only this will please the Lord. We can be very well-versed in the Bible. We can work with vigor. We can be upright outwardly. Yet at the same time we can be without the affection and love that the Lord is after. Spiritual knowledge is precious. But how many believers have a heart for pursuing spiritual knowledge, yet have no heart for pursuing Christ Himself? The Lord is very unhappy about believers of this kind, who seem to be hot but are not hot, and who seem to be cold but are not cold.</P><P>This is the way of man's compromise. It is not a peril that comes from ignorance but the result of hearing and understanding the truth and then tossing back and forth between taking and opposing it. People of this kind do not like the truth for they know that if they truly obey it, their sacrifice and price will be too great! The flesh will no longer have its place. The world will have to go completely. Unintentional ignorance should be tolerated by us, but a reluctance to keep the truth is another matter. It is what the Lord hates the most.</P><P>This attitude of both obeying and rejecting is not something that an honest believer has. Only those who have heard the truth but who are afraid of the cross are like this. God's truth invariably is a test to man's heart. It always opposes the existence of the flesh. It is not a matter of learning something in a detached way. The truth will test us and will destroy all fleshly intentions. If a sheep is not sick, not only will it be able to identify the voices of strangers, but it will be able to hear the voice of the shepherd. But those sheep who are lost and who have followed others will be confused and will not be able to distinguish the familiar voices. The reason Laodicea had fallen into this state is that it had rejected the testimony of the church before it. The rejection of the special truth of Philadelphia will cause one to be Laodicea. There the Lord revealed Himself and told everyone who had a heart for Him that if they would consider His name to be above every name on earth, He would give to them a new name in glory. All spiritual love and all the work that the Lord has wrought in us will shine more glorious in heaven. The Lord was encouraging them to do their best to suffer for Him and to fully obey His word. However, Laodicea was lukewarm. Since it was not completely cold, the Lord exhorted it. They were really not honest, but the Lord would not allow them to remain the same. Either they had to repent, or they would be rejected. The Lord indeed hates to see one being filled with the truth yet not being moved by it a bit. As long as their heart would be a little bit honest, although they might not know anything, they would still be able to enjoy all the love and grace of the Lord. The anointing mentioned in 1 John 2, which comes from the Holy One and which teaches men all things, is not given to the "fathers" but to the "little children" (1 John 2:28). As long as we are honest with Christ, we will surely know what is not of Christ. Hence, even the youngest saint who has a pure heart will be able to differentiate between right and wrong. On the contrary, the old theologians will be lost in endless genealogies. What the Lord desires the most is the youthful, "honeymoon" heart. What power there is and what freshness one feels in such a heart! The Lord condemns the mind that is filled with frigid doctrines but has no fellowship with Christ. The only thing to fear in the house of God is too many older sons (Luke 15:25). There is no fear of the return of more prodigals.</P><P>"I wish that you were cold or hot." The most difficult kind of people to deal with are those who do not love the Lord aggressively nor oppose the Lord vigorously. If they are burning in spirit, the Lord will gladly call them His friends. If they are cold, the Lord will leave them in their worldly condition. But now they are standing in a neutral position. How should one deal with them? How should they be ranked? The Lord cannot call them real friends because of their coldness. Yet their hotness makes it impossible for the Lord to call them enemies. Those who have fallen down to zero like Sardis can have the warning of the Lord's coming, and those who have reached the boiling point like Philadelphia can also be comforted by the Lord's coming. Yet, how shall one deal with the lukewarm ones?</P><P>"Because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold." Such people are most easily satisfied. "As long as I can go to heaven, I will be satisfied!" Such ones live for two worlds. Before they go to heaven, they like to strive as much as they can to gain what this world offers them. However, they do not want to leave the church. The teaching of sanctification is too strict, and the work of self-denial is too difficult. They like to practice any teaching in the Bible that does not come into conflict with their interest, but if it does, they say, "One will not perish even if he does not keep it. So what is the problem if one does not do it?" When there are some misunderstandings, they will stop coming to the meetings; they will not come to break the bread and will not help in the gospel preaching. They are not zealous for the word and are not jealous for God's glory. As long as they can feel comfortable, everything else can get by easily. Of course, such ones will not have a testimony in the world. On the contrary, the world will see in them that there is no joy in being in Christ. The world will conclude that such a loose religion does not mean much!</P><P>"I am about to spew you out of My mouth." Lukewarm water makes a person vomit. As a person dislikes lukewarm water, in the same way the Lord Jesus hates the taste of Laodicea. The real condition of Laodicea has been exposed by the Lord. Its real condition makes the Lord vomit. This is why He said that He would spew it out. He did not say when He will do this, but since He has said it, it will not fail. Here it does not say that He will spew them out only if they remain lukewarm. Their former conduct was enough to condemn them. This rejection is unconditional. In no other place in the Bible do we find harsher expressions than here. The reason for this is that grace has already worked and has done what it could do. However, it still has not become Philadelphia. On the contrary, it became Laodicea. As such, judgment becomes the inevitable end. He would rather see the coldness of Sardis-"I wish that you were cold"-or the sin of Jezebel-"I wish you were cold." But He hates a heartless lip service, one which takes worship as a term only, which in reality is an entertainment of the flesh. He hates to see a brain full of all kinds of profound doctrines but a heart which is cold towards Himself. Do we see it the same way? To us, perhaps the defilement of Roman Catholicism and the corruption of Protestantism are more evil. Have we ever thought that lukewarmness could be the most evil of all? This is exactly what the Lord hates the most, and there is no one in the world more wise than He is.</P><P>What is the meaning of being spewed out by the Lord? Before we speak about this expression, we want to turn the readers' attention again to the nature of these seven letters. We mention this repeatedly because we have to remember this point before we can understand these letters. The seven churches to whom these seven letters were addressed were seven actual local churches during the time in which John lived. They were meetings of the believers and were churches of that day. They had their golden lampstands before the Lord. Hence, they were all saved ones with life in them. These seven letters were sent to saved ones. Hence, everyone who is saved in later generations and who is met with the same conditions as those seen by the seven churches of that day will see these seven letters having an effect on him. These letters will be for him. Therefore, the letter to the Ephesians at that time is a letter to all the Ephesians throughout the ages. This means that as the first letter was sent to those who had left their first love in those days, it is sent to all those who have left their first love throughout the ages. What is covered here is a nature.</P><P>Another way to look at it is that these seven letters typify the condition of the churches throughout the ages. For example, Thyatira typifies the Roman Catholic Church, and Sardis typifies the Protestant churches. If we see these seven letters from this point of view, we cannot say that all the recipients are saved ones, because what the church in any one age includes is a wide spectrum. For example, the Roman Catholic Church typified by Thyatira spans more than one thousand years and encompasses almost all lands. Under such circumstances, there are surely countless numbers of sinners and worldly ones mixed in with the church. Hence, when we consider Thyatira as a local church, we have to say that they are all saved ones who have fallen into defilement. But when we consider Thyatira as a church of an age, we have to say that it is mixed. We can see this most clearly from Sardis. If it refers to a local church, the "death" mentioned by the Lord would refer to its coldness, which means that its work was without any vitality. But if it refers to a church of an age, then the death there would refer to the spiritual life. This means that it has a name only but has no reality and that it has never been regenerated. In expounding these seven letters, we have to present these two aspects simultaneously. The readers should not confuse the two.</P><P>For the church in Laodicea that is presented before us now, there are also these two aspects. If we consider it as a letter to a local church, then we should say that this letter is for the saved believers who boast of their spiritual knowledge but who do not have a single heart for Christ. But if we consider Laodicea to be a type of the church of an age, then we have to say that it is for those present-day lukewarm churches composed of both saved ones and perishing ones. Hence, there are two meanings to the Lord's words, "I am about to spew you out of My mouth." It means one thing to the saved believers, and it means another thing to the nominal churches.</P><P>In the last letter, we have briefly mentioned the proofs of the local church in Laodicea being a congregation of saved believers. However, because of the prejudice of many who have always considered the church in Laodicea as composed of the perishing ones, we will repeat these proofs here. We cannot assume that the Laodiceans are unrepentant and hypocritical ones just because the Lord is not pleased with them. Laodicea was an actual place, and the church in Laodicea was an actual church. Paul already wrote a letter to them (Col. 4:16). Now the Lord charged John to write another letter to them (Rev. 1:11). These seven churches are a complete representation of the churches. Hence, every one of these seven churches is important and must be living. This is why all seven churches were summoned to hear "what the Spirit says to the churches." The churches to whom the Lord addressed these letters were all churches of the believers. Hence, the people there were all saved ones. There was no benefit at the time of the apostles in being a false Christian; the gain was not worth the loss. John saw the lampstand of Laodicea in the Holy of Holies (Rev. 1:11-12). If Laodicea was only a nominal Christian organization, the Lord Jesus would not have recognized it as a lampstand in heaven. Once a church becomes false, its lampstand in heaven is removed. In considering the Lord's word to Ephesus, we know that when a church remains a church, its lampstand remains in the Holy of Holies. In all these seven churches the Lord recognized their works. This means that they all have the foundation of faith and salvation. We do not see the Lord preaching the gospel to any one of these churches. Hence, the church in Laodicea, like all the other churches, must be a gathering of the saints; they must have faith already and must have works also. The only thing is that their works were not good.</P><P>Moreover, its messenger was also recognized by the Lord. This makes it impossible for such a one to be a wolf coming in sheep's clothing. If this messenger had been an unsaved one, the Lord could not have acknowledged him. Not only was this one not excommunicated by the Lord, but he was not rebuked at all. This, of course, refers to his work as a messenger. A stronger proof is that this messenger in Laodicea was one of the seven stars in the right hand of the Lord; he also shone in spiritual darkness. From this we can see the soberness of this word! There is the possibility that a saved Christian can be spewed out of the Lord's mouth! Our sin will not annul our regeneration. It will not make the church no more a church. However, the Lord has a way to deal with people. This is a letter by the Lord to one who has become apostate.</P><P>The spewing here does not refer to eternal perdition. It only shows the Lord's displeasure with the testimony of such ones after they had believed. For this reason He was going to reject them and stop them from being a testimony. The believers should have been in the Lord Jesus' "mouth"! In the same way that the believers long after the Lord, the Lord longs after the believers. He longs to have His dry tongue wet by the love and holiness of His believers. He longs to see "the travail of His soul...and He will be satisfied" (Isa. 53:11). But the believers were like lukewarm water; they had become repugnant to the Lord's taste. As a result, the Lord had to spew them out of His mouth. Is this something that He wants to do? Is His heart not zealously in love with all those who are His? Yet they have forced Him to act this way.</P><P>This spewing will happen at the great trial in the future. It will also have an effect in the millennium. This church is the last church. It is the church that is closest to the Lord's coming. It seems fitting that if the Lord Jesus were to speak to any church about His coming, He should have spoken to this church. But here the Lord did not mention one word about His coming. Is this not strange? There is a reason for the Lord's not doing this. The teaching of His second coming was already a known fact among them. They might even have already preached this! To Thyatira, He linked His coming to the kingdom and told them that His coming would bring them authority and would make them reign with Him. This will be given to those who refuse to reign on earth today. To Sardis, His coming was issued as a warning, because certain ones will be left on earth to go through the great trial. To Philadelphia His coming was a consolation, for they will be raptured and will be delivered from trial to receive a crown. However, He did not speak to Laodicea concerning this matter. In Philadelphia the teaching concerning the Lord's coming is concluded.</P><P>The history of Laodicea is that it had first come out of Thyatira to become Sardis, then had come out of Sardis to become Philadelphia, and finally degenerated from Philadelphia to Laodicea. It had heard the warning concerning being left on the earth to pass through the tribulation. It had also heard the promise of rapture to heaven and deliverance from trial. What more could now be done? The thing to do now is to spew it out, take away its protection, cast it aside on earth, and leave it behind to suffer the sufferings that the world will suffer. It has heard of the power and glory of the kingdom. It has also heard of the danger of the crown's being taken away. It has no desire for it, nor does it seek after it. On the contrary, it has filled its heart with the world. What more can be done? There is no other way now except to spew it out and shut it out of the kingdom into which it has no desire to enter. The pity of Laodicea lies in the fact that the Holy Spirit has worked, grace has worked, and the truth has worked. Yet none of these was able to make it hot. As a result, there is nothing more that can be done except to wait for judgment. The heart of Laodicea is a heart that can no longer be moved. If it were only a matter of not being moved, it still would not be that serious. What it did now was to boast of the work of the Holy Spirit, grace, and truth among it, while not being moved by them a bit. This is indeed pitiful as well as evil!</P><P>Once grace is over, judgment comes. Hence, to Laodicea, there was no mention of the Lord's coming. Of course, there is no doubt that He will come, but the matter was not mentioned to them. What was brought up was another matter. Here the Lord Jesus manifested His light and His nature; He brought up His coming judgment. He will judge them. Judgment is sure; only it is not yet realized. He said, "I am about...," yet this word will be delayed in its fulfillment until the great tribulation and the millennium. "I am about to spew you out of My mouth." The Lord was pointing out here the result of the untasteful salt in His teaching on the mount: "You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt has become tasteless, with what shall it be salted? It is no longer good for anything except to be cast out and trampled underfoot by men" (Matt. 5:13). The tasteless Christian will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles together with the city of Jerusalem at the time of the great tribulation.</P><P>Still, we have said that this word does not refer only to the saved Laodiceans. It also refers to the last group of people in the church age. These are neither so cold as to give up all outward appearance, nor are they so hot as to genuinely love the Lord and to love each other with a pure heart. Here we see an empty fa&#231;ade in unity yet an absolute coldness towards Christ. Nor do we see anything of spiritual worth here. They have replaced fellowship with Christ by humanitarianism and have replaced spiritual regeneration by charitable works. They are very broad for they consider all religious beliefs to be good. Of course, by so doing, there is no more a hatred for sin, nor is there a love for Christ. Yet they will not oppose Christ; they prefer to remain in the church, and they acknowledge the church as an institution. They still want to retain the name of a Christian. There is no spiritual power; there is no love of Christ. There is, of course, no suffering for Him. The best among these are believers who are full of outward activities but who have no heart of fellowship with Christ. The worst among these are the present-day, self-styled, modernistic theologians. There are many different kinds of people among the present-day Laodiceans. They include some who are orthodox in their faith and some whose thinking is wild. Everything that has lost its heart for Christ is Laodicea. The last part of church history is characterized by lukewarmness.</P><P>The meaning of spewing for the present-day nominal church is an eternal rejection by the Lord. He will no longer allow it to be a testimony. God has rejected all testimonies and authorities He previously established. The church is supposed to be the last one. Yet this one is met with the same end as the other ones. In the beginning God appointed the gods to rule over the world. Yet sin was found among them. Therefore God rejected them. What about the Israelites? Although they were temporarily cleansed, they brought seven other demons into their midst. As a result, God also rejected them. What about the Gentiles? From the time of the golden image of Nebuchadnezzar to the blaspheming of Antichrist, when was there a time when they have not rebelled against God? Hence, they are also awaiting their judgment. As for the church, it is hard to believe that its end will be the same as the others. Yet Laodicea is the last section, and here the Lord's verdict is that it will be spewed out of His mouth. Of course, God's judgment will only be executed at the fullness of iniquities (Gen. 15:16). At the present time God will not pull out the tares. But when we lift up our heads to see the field, we know that sin is increasing day by day. Before Christ will come to establish His kingdom of righteousness, we will see the nation of Israel, the Gentiles, the church, and all the powers of the demons joining together as one cord of sin; they will all be judged. The nominal church will not escape this judgment. On the contrary, it will become one of the main culprits in this judgment. In reading the book of Jude and the Epistles to Timothy, we see that God's coming terrible judgment is for the nominal, old church. It is this nominal church that will precipitate God's wrath. How solemn is this thought! Not only will the Israelites and the beast suffer punishment, even the church will suffer the same!</P><P>This is certain, because God Himself has said so. The worst Laodiceans, of which there are many kinds, are those who remain Christians outwardly, but who totally overturn all fundamental beliefs of the saints. These are the antichrists spoken of in 1 John. Of course, a great Antichrist will come in the future, but these smaller antichrists will come from the nominal churches. Antichrist can only come out of places where Christ has been proclaimed, for if men have never known Christ, how can they know that there are antichrists? The antichrists are manifested in the lies they speak after hearing the truth. All present-day apostasies, unbeliefs, and denials of the fundamental doctrines of Christianity will be judged by the Lord. The last rejection of God will not be a political one but a religious one. May God open the eyes of His children, so that they would know the situation of the end times and would not harbor vain hopes, but would be watchful in preparation. The power for the recovery of the church no longer exists now. The tares are now ripe for the furnace. Why then is the wheat still so green and tender and unprepared for the heavenly barn? Each day we live on earth, may we perform our duty in opposing sin. May we oppose it by prayer and by the power of the Spirit, and may we strive to save the perishing ones. At the same time, may we hold fast to what we have in Christ. I do not know of another hour more solemn than this. Be watchful, O saints of God!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE SEVENTEEN</H2><P>Verse 17: "Because you say, I am wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing, and do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked."</P><P>"You say." This is the Laodicea in the eyes of Laodicea. Among all the seven churches, no one has a higher self-esteem than Laodicea. Self-pride and coldness are two twin sisters. When the heart is cold towards the Lord, boastings of men often develop. Much boasting causes one to be obsessed with oneself and fills the mind with grand imaginations about oneself. The result is more boasting. What a dreadful thing it is to see such boasting in the face of judgment! Those who walk humbly will walk steadily, but those with a haughty heart are about to fall. If we do not have the thought that we are stronger than others and are not self-satisfied with our own progress, we are not yet in the realm of Laodicea. Once the self is raised, promoted, or glorified, the boastful voice of Laodicea is already silently heard. How different are the opinions of these ones from those of the Lord Jesus! We have to be careful, for our own estimate of ourselves may not be that reliable. Many times we forget to see the light in the light of the Lord, which results in inaccurate self-estimation. What is the use of self-examination for a person whose nature is as corrupt as ours is? The less we have anything to do with ourselves, the less we will be deceived. If we hope for the self to inform us of its true condition, we are in reality conferring with a thief. Nothing in the whole world is more unreliable than our self. Indeed man's heart, and specifically my heart, is more wicked than all things. If we really want to advance spiritually and to understand the true nature of ourselves, there is no other way but to ask the Spirit of the Lord to reveal Himself to us. If we listen to our own deception, we will soon become a Laodicean. Only those who are willing to be deceived and who are satisfied by the outward appearance of Laodicea will listen to what the self says about itself. How difficult it is to hear the speaking of the Holy Spirit! We may not be able to hear anything from our self other than our corruption. "I am wealthy and have become rich." What riches is this referring to? Does this refer to spiritual or material riches? According to the book of Revelation, one can only interpret something spiritually when it cannot be interpreted literally. Of course, behind the literal meaning, there is often a spiritual meaning. Here it refers firstly to material riches, but at the same time it also refers to spiritual riches.</P><P>The above two expressions are slightly different in meaning. To say "I am wealthy" refers to its being rich originally, and to say "I have become rich" refers to its increasing its riches later. These expressions tell us how it has labored and has succeeded, how it seeks for riches and has found them.</P><P>Here we also see the hidden reason behind the church's coldness. The Lord Jesus told us that we cannot serve God and at the same time serve mammon. These two lords are completely opposite one to another. Their commands and demands are also absolutely different. If you listen to one, you are offending the other. A heart cannot faithfully serve two opposite characters simultaneously. No matter how much believers try to pull things together, they can only choose to be the servant of one of the two. However, Laodicea does not believe in this truth. As a result, it acts ambivalently and puts itself into great jeopardy. The closer it is to mammon, the farther its heart is from Christ. "But those who intend to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge men into destruction and ruin. For the love of money is a root of all evils, because of which some, aspiring after money, have been led away from the faith and pierced themselves through with many pains. But you, O man of God, flee these things" (1 Tim. 6:9-11). Riches are a blessing that belong to the age of the law. Now, however, the Lord Jesus says, "Woe to you who are rich" (Luke 6:24; Matt. 19:23-24).</P><P>It is true that God wants the believers to be rich now, but with what kind of riches? According to the word of promise (2 Cor. 8:9), God has absolutely no intention for believers to be rich in this age. If our Lord was poor to the uttermost on earth, I do not see how those who would love Him faithfully and who would follow Him could have the right to be rich in this world. Where our money is, there our heart is also. There is no such thing as accumulating riches on earth while setting the heart on heaven. Strictly speaking, no rich believer follows the Lord faithfully. All rich believers, without exception, are worldly Christians. It does not matter how much alive he is outwardly. If he is really spiritual, he will surely give up everything to follow the Lord. We should never be deceived to think that the condition for being the Lord's disciple is easier for the flesh today than when the Lord Jesus was on earth. As the disciples of that day were to give up everything to follow the Lord, we should do the same. While the Lord allows us to remain on earth, He does not want us to consider anything to be ours. Does this then mean that the poor believers are more spiritual and more perfect than the rich believers? No. The apostle did not say that rich men will fall into a snare, but "those who intend to be rich." Many poor believers are not rich, yet they resolve to be rich. Although they are not rich yet, they think about being rich. This is to serve mammon. This is why the Lord Jesus said, "Blessed are the poor in spirit" (Matt. 5:3). Not only should we be poor in outward material things, but we should always have an attitude that we are poor in spirit and in heart. If our spirits are poor, it will be impossible for us to be rich in material things.</P><P>What a pity that there are too many rich Christians today! They have never realized how much their riches have damaged their spiritual testimony and life. There are too many believers today who want to become rich! Even those who are so-called "living by faith" are not free from this kind of thought. The world can come in different wrappings, but the principle is the same. All those who want to gain something more, who want to have something more for themselves, are servants of mammon. If a believer's heart is not weaned from the world, he will always be found in the world. Some may possess a world that looks and sounds better than others. Let me declare the Lord's will today: the Lord does not want you to be rich in this world.</P><P>"And have need of nothing"! Their boasting is stronger and stronger! How serious is this kind of self-contentment! "Is it wrong to be self-contented?" For those who are poor for the Lord, self-contentment is something the Lord is pleased with. But the Lord is not pleased with the self-contentment of the rich ones, nor is He pleased with the seeking that comes from discontentment. What the Lord wants is for a man to be discontented for his lack of riches before God and his poverty before men. The rich ones should long to be poor! Is Laodicea that easily satisfied? If not, why is it so self-contented here? Indeed, it has received too much, so much so that it has to declare, "I have need of nothing." For it to say such a word, how many riches does it need to have? Yet how base is such a believer's heart, who is satisfied only with the world and its riches! How easily it is filled and satisfied! What is the meaning of having need of nothing? "I only want to enjoy the world. If I can live forever on earth, I will be satisfied. What I have now is heaven already. What other heaven do I want? I have lack of nothing. Everything is now mine. I have everything there is in this world. What else can satisfy my heart?" The resurrection of the righteous, the coming of Christ, and the glory of the kingdom are all forgotten. As such they are no longer objects of pursuit. These persons are the two and a half tribes of Israelites on the east side of Jordan. Indeed, the riches of money will bring a believer to the position of Laodicea, but is this self-uplifting restricted to money only? The Laodicean attitude is manifested in almost everything. Every time we read a report of a denomination, a mission, or a certain organization, we can see the special manifestation of the spirit of Laodicea. It seems as if the word "Laodicea" is written all over them. Even those who are more spiritual are merely saying, "God, I thank You that I am not like the rest of men-extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector" (Luke 18:11).</P><P>How numerous are the nominal Christians! How frequent are the fundraisings! How grand are the buildings! How much the order of the meetings fits the mentality of ordinary men! How successful are the charitable works, the medical works, and the educational works! How qualified, learned, and knowledgeable are the pastors and the preachers! They are so profound and knowledgeable that they can even tell which part of the Scripture is inspired and which part is not! Indeed, if one is to pick up his pen and write about any kind of work or the condition of any worker before the Lord, there is supposedly always so much to write about! Yet this is the Laodicea that the Lord condemns.</P><P>We have said before that there are many kinds of Laodiceas. The principle of Laodicea is very simple: to consider oneself as the center, to think highly of oneself, and to be self-satisfied and self-contented. In one word, Laodicea is just "self." But in the church of the age of Laodicea, there are saved and overcoming ones, there are saved and defeated ones, there are unsaved and unregenerated ones, and there are unbelievers. Needless to say, the overcoming ones are free from the spirit of Laodicea, but other than the overcomers, all the others are under the direction of the self. However, because of the difference in their personal condition, they are different in their Laodicean conduct. This is why we say that there are many kinds of Laodiceas.</P><P>We thank God that many believers have been taught personally by God of the importance of holiness and perfection and are seeking after these things earnestly. However, even among these dear brothers, one can find the conduct of Laodicea. Brothers, I am not discouraging people from pursuing after perfection. This is indeed what we also teach. But I would remind the brothers not to be affected by Laodicea. It is a wonderful desire to be seeking and to preach to others. But why is there the need to bring in the "I"? "I have obtained it. I became perfected on such and such a date. After such and such a meeting, I have received such and such certain experience. Now I am perfected. My sinful nature is eradicated. The root of sin has been uprooted from my heart. I have a clean heart already." Why bring in this "I"? It is true that we can testify, but the strange thing is that no one at the time of the apostles testified of their sanctification. If one needs to talk about his experience, it is better to wait "fourteen years" (2 Cor. 12:2) before he relates his wonderful experience! Actually, if one truly is sanctified experientially, those around him will certainly have detected it. If one thinks that he must say this before he can be ranked among the better believers, Laodicea has already crept in. Moreover, if those around you do not see anything special about you, will they not despise the teaching of sanctification because of this?</P><P>It is true that believers should be perfect, but unless we take the conduct and life of Christ as the standard of perfection, we are lowering the standard of sanctification. And if we think that we are comparable to Christ now and are not ashamed in our heart or blush in our face to say this, we are already either excessively pharisaical or have become champions of self-boasting! When we uplift ourselves in this way, it is natural for us to call sin and lust by other names when we fail. If a man thinks that he has reached "sinless perfection," he will have to call lust a temptation and sin a weakness whenever he falls! But this kind of covering-up, self-forgiving, and changing of names does not remove the fact. Why argue over a term? You may say that this is weakness, but I say that this is sin, while in reality we all recognize the existence of such a thing, whatever you may call it. Hence, we must not go to the extreme and must not place ourselves in an improper position. </P><P>Moreover, this kind of subconscious self-boasting is very harmful to our spiritual life. This causes us to become overly concerned with ourselves. It causes us to think of ourselves, express ourselves, and be conscious of ourselves. Many times, it may be "no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" (Gal. 2:20) in word only. In reality, it is a fully self-conscious, self-admiring, self-marveling, self-loving, glorified, and transformed "I" that is reigning there. We have to realize that in spiritual life the thing to avoid the most is to think of ourselves and to linger around ourselves. When our physical life is healthy, it is not conscious of itself. If a man thinks about his heartbeat and his breathing, it does not help him. On the contrary, it will hurt him. Only those who are sick feel that they are better today than yesterday. Hence, if this Laodicean self-conscious holiness is not removed, all that it will give to man is a low, fallen, and sick Christian life. This kind of Laodicean self-satisfaction is really far from the mark.</P><P>At the same time, we see that those Laodiceans whose eyes are strictly set on material things are boasting of their new inventions. I do not say that these are the believers. To these ones, everything is man-made. Even Christianity is but an advanced notion of man concerning God. They worship man and boast of the greatness of man. In reality they are worshipping themselves. They receive everything that comes from man but will not receive anything from Christ except His name. What they have and what they emphasize are the false and human things. They boast not only in their material riches and the culture of the twentieth century but are most proud of their wisdom, knowledge, and the abundance of their education. At the same time, they think that they have a more perfect explanation of Christianity than others do. These liberal idealists boast of their scientific knowledge; they think that their judgments are right. Of course, we know that both archaeology and other sciences have refuted these groundless critics. They try their best to overturn the fundamental doctrines of Christianity. They want to change Christianity from a religion to a social philosophy or a moral system. They regard all supernatural things as unbelievable because science considers them impossible. They think that man is almighty. The human life that Christ has forever condemned on the cross is considered by them as potentially strong. If it is developed, it will become like Christ. Their errors and blasphemies are so numerous that it wears me out to enumerate them. But what is the conclusion of their teachings? They say that their intellect, their mind, and their mental power will guide them to determine what is God's word, what really happened thousands of years ago, and what will happened in eternity future. They can tell the past and the future. They can tell how the world will evolve. They boast forever of the superabundant riches of modern man and of the science, philosophies, and cultures of the twentieth century. All these are things that they speak of. They indeed "have need of nothing"!</P><P>Whichever kind of Laodicean one may be, the principle is the uplifting of oneself. This is the sin of Adam and is also the sin of all men throughout the ages. Hence, everyone who truly wants to be the Lord's disciple must deny himself and must bear the cross, so that the self that has been denied will never come back and that he may follow the Lord single-heartedly. Laodicea is the totality of self-exaltation throughout the ages. This is one of the greatest signs of the end time. The world will be like this. So will the nominal church. Such things happen because the spirit of the antichrist has been stirred up.</P><P>There are two characteristics of Laodicea: supposing oneself to be rich and being lukewarm towards Christ. They have heard many truths; this is why they think that they are rich (spiritually speaking). They pay much attention to the mental understanding of truth. This kind of outward knowledge of God is a catalyst for the coming of the end time. God will judge everything that bears His name in vain. All that these ones strive for is what the world now admires and commends. However, they are not worth anything. If the flesh is being worshipped in the church, that which is spiritual and godly will not be able to stand. Never think that there are no good ones within this church. What the Lord is dealing with here is not individuals, but the church, although individuals may be taught through this. The Lord said that He will spew this church out of His mouth. If one has Laodicea in his motive, it is difficult to avoid the spirit of Laodicea when the majority is turned toward it. Vainglory is often the chief instigator of Laodicea. The love of fame will often lead one to Laodicea. God's children must answer before the Lord if they are what Laodicea typifies. Are they living for Christ, or are they only utilizing Christ's name?</P><P>"And do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked." "And do not know!" What a contrast between their self-esteem and Christ's evaluation! Christ knows their mind. This exhibition of their real condition seems to be harsh. Yet it is most necessary, for the root of sin here is self-boasting. There is no foolishness more serious than the foolishness of self-ignorance. Only a jolting, thunderous revelation of this fact will awaken Laodicea from its comfortable dreams. The overcomers are often preserved through preaching the words that no one welcomes. Hence, what Laodicea needs is the two-edged sword. The Lord's word here is not the declaration of a detective, but the diagnosis of a doctor. Of course, if these ones do not take heed to this word, they will suffer the verdict of a judge and the punishment of an executor.</P><P>Laodicea's condition is more pitiful than others in that it does not know itself. Those who do not know themselves will surely boast. We cannot find one person who knows himself and uplifts himself as Laodicea did. When believers have learned to realize their own corruption, they feel ashamed of themselves and loathe and hate themselves. They only worry that the self is not yet fully removed and has not yet completely died. They do not dare to put themselves in an exalted position anymore. Only those who do not know shame would glory in their own shame. Why have they fallen to such a condition? It is because they do not receive the testimony of God. God's word always causes man to feel empty; it always humbles a man. The work of the Holy Spirit often causes man to realize the corruption and hopelessness of his flesh and leads man to the cross and to judge and reject himself.</P><P>"And do not know that you are wretched." The word "you" in the original language is emphatic. It is you, the self-contented you, who is wretched. Why is this so? It is because all that it is saying is about itself. It never mentions anything about Christ or what He has done for it. For this reason, it is most wretched. Often we think that a man is wretched only when he feels his wretchedness in a wretched environment. But here, they do not feel wretched about themselves at all. Others have to come to tell them this. The reason for this is that their spiritual senses are close to being dead. What is this wretchedness? First, it is their spiritual humiliation; they are no longer able to have spiritual joy. Second, they will lose the glory and will be in outer darkness in the millennium. There they will see that they are outside the kingdom. At that time, they will realize their wretchedness.</P><P>"Miserable." Laodicea thinks that its condition is admirable and enviable. Yet the Lord told it that it is pitiful. They are pitiful because first they do not have Christ, and second they think that what they have is plentiful.</P><P>The words "poor and blind and naked" form another phrase. Hence, Laodicea boasts of itself in three things, and the Lord considers it as having three shortages.</P><P>They are "poor." This of course does not mean worldly poverty. Materially speaking, they are indeed rich. Others consider it this way, and they consider it this way also. Yet they have nothing of being "rich toward God" (Luke 12:21). Although they are rich, they have not put what they have to the Lord's use. They have not made with the mammon of unrighteousness friends who will receive them into the eternal tabernacle. They spend more on themselves and on their children than on the Lord. Hence, they are poor before the Lord.</P><P>If a church is full of worldly blessings and considers itself to be rich spiritually and materially, it must in reality be poor spiritually. Every time we see a person boasting of his riches in God, it proves to us that such a one is poor. Riches can only be found in the Lord Jesus. When the church says, "I am wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing," it is boasting of its own riches. It considers itself rather than Christ the haven of grace. If this is not spiritual poverty, what is it? Whenever our eyes are turned away from Christ to the church, we become poor spiritually. No matter how much we draw near to Him outwardly, as soon as we set our eyes on it instead of on the Lord, we are insulting Him. This is the same as setting our eyes on ourselves.</P><P>Philadelphia has not yet received everything that Christ has given to it. They only have a little power. Although that church thought that it was poor, the Lord was pleased with it. "I have loved you" (Rev. 3:9). But when a church has "become rich" and has glorified itself, the Lord is not pleased. On the contrary, He will spew it out of His mouth. Wherever we see a place having a little power and keeping the Lord's word and not denying His name, we can rejoice because the Lord will soon return for them. To confess one's poverty and weakness is not to doubt Christ. It is only when we realize our own emptiness that we will depend on Him for strength. If we see a place considering itself rich and full, we can say that Laodicea is there already and that the Lord is about to spew it out of His mouth.</P><P>Laodicea is also "blind." Of course, this refers to spiritual blindness. The Lord cannot be rebuking them for physical blindness. If one is indeed physically blind, such a world-loving believer as those in Laodicea will never say that he has "need of nothing"! The worldly riches and prosperity have blurred their spiritual vision. On the one hand, these do not know the mind of Christ. On the other hand, they do not understand themselves. As such they are blind. Those who concentrate on themselves will in the end see nothing of themselves. Those who concentrate on Christ will see Christ and will also see themselves. Once the eyes become blind, a person is not able to see any of God's work in this end time. To the heart of such a believer, the signs of the times are a novel idea. It is always the self-righteous Pharisees who "know how to discern" the face of the sky, but "cannot discern the signs of the times" (Matt. 16:3).</P><P>Immediately after the Lord Jesus taught the disciples about not storing up treasures on the earth, He told them that if the eye is single, the whole body will be full of light (Matt. 6:19, 22). The reason for this is that treasures blind one's spiritual sight.</P><P>These are also "naked." Those who boast in their clothing often boast in their money-pockets as well. To care much for one's apparel is to seek for acclamation from the world. When the world loses its grip on the heart, the dress will lose its color to the wearer. Laodicea is famous for its woolen goods. Although its apparel is fine in quality and its dyes bright, before God it is naked. They spend everything on themselves and do not give their clothes to the poor. Their selfish way of spending expresses their own spiritual nakedness. They have no good deeds. Such shame will one day be manifested. When they stand before Christ they will be surprised. Those who are ignorant of themselves will no longer be ignorant of themselves in that day.</P><P>It is true that the Lord Jesus is our righteousness. His righteousness will cover up all our shame and will enable us to stand perfect before God, even as He is perfect. "He has clothed Me with the garments of salvation, / He has wrapped Me with the robe of righteousness" (Isa. 61:10). We the prodigals have received the Lord Jesus as our "best robe" (Luke 15:22) and are able to settle peacefully in the Father's house. This speaks of our salvation. All those who have received the Lord Jesus as their Savior are no longer naked.</P><P>However, we have to pay attention to another aspect. Before God, we are freely justified through His grace and by our faith. No matter how our work is, our position will not be changed. This is as far as God's side is concerned. As far as Christ is concerned, it is another matter. Christ is our robe of righteousness before God. By Him, we can forever be saved from nakedness before God. This matter is settled and can never be overturned. But whether or not we are naked before Christ depends on our work after we have believed. Of course, this work does not refer to what the believers do in the flesh but what they do in the new man by the power of the Holy Spirit. Saints are saved from their nakedness before Christ through their own righteous acts (Rev. 19:8). God's relationship with us begins with the eternal kingdom. The time of trial and of the millennial kingdom is the time for the Lord Jesus to execute His righteousness. If saints do not have their own righteousness in the new creation, they will be put to shame at the day of Christ. Laodicea is covered before God, but it is naked before Christ. For this reason, concerning the Lord's rapture and His reigning, He will deal with us in righteousness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE EIGHTEEN</H2><P>Verse 18: "I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined by fire that you may be rich, and white garments that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested, and eyesalve to anoint your eyes that you may see."</P><P>"I counsel you." Although the condition is so bad, Christ still thinks that there is the possibility of rescue. Corporately speaking, to be spewed out is the inevitable outcome, but here the Lord is exhorting individuals and hoping for the individuals to turn to Him. It is not a rebuke, a scorning, or an excommunication, but a counseling. The Lord Jesus can command them, but He would rather counsel them and deal with them in grace. He is counseling them for their own good. If they are willing to hear their Lord's word, their condition will not be hopeless. Such counseling for such believers under such circumstance makes us marvel at the Lord's endurance and gentleness. If He deals with us in this way, should we not deal with our brothers in the same way, even though they may have fallen into a Laodicean stubbornness?</P><P>"To buy from Me." An outward Christ cannot heal inward disease. It is not how much one boasts about, but how much one has received from Him. These persons have almost forsaken Christ completely. Now the Lord wants them to know that He is the source of their revival. Although they are saved, they have not looked to Christ for this source. Hence, they have none of this matter. If they are willing to seek Christ afresh, their flesh and the world will lose their power.</P><P>"To buy from Me." Since they are so rich, the Lord no longer says to them that He will give freely. Strictly speaking, no believer can receive these things without a price. What is to "buy"? To buy is to exchange something for a price. Salvation is free; it is the gift of God and is bought without silver or gold (Isa. 55:1). This means that we do not have to pay a ransom. The Lord is not speaking here to the sinners or the unsaved ones. (Of course, for the church in the age typified by Laodicea, the Lord can be counseling the nominal believers also.) Here the Lord is speaking to those who are His. They should pay the price to buy what the Lord will give to them. Those who shop must buy. All who will not pay a price will not receive. All those who will not relinquish what they treasure today will not receive anything. The Lord will not give anything freely; He wants to exchange. Only if you give to the Lord what you have will He give to you what He has. Oh Laodicean believers, never think that you can preserve your Laodicean riches while receiving freely from the Lord the things mentioned here. If you do, you will become more Laodicean. If believers will not hand over all their Laodicean riches to Christ, He will not give to them what He promises here.</P><P>What they should buy are three things. First is "gold refined by fire." If they are willing to buy the gold of Christ, they will be turned immediately from poverty to riches. If they are willing to exchange their riches with the Lord, they will lose the deceitful mammon and will gain the real thing. What they have is, of course, merely money produced by their self-righteous filthy garments, which cannot withstand fire. Only the Lord has the gold refined by fire. If they are willing to give up their riches before men, they will be rich before God (Luke 12:33).</P><P>What is the significance of "gold refined by fire" here? Gold in the Bible symbolizes God's holiness, but here it does not mention gold only, but "gold refined by fire." Hence, it must mean something else. Gold refined by fire means a faith that has been proved. "So that the proving of your faith, much more precious than of gold which perishes though it is proved by fire, may be found unto praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ" (1 Pet. 1:7). For this reason James told us, "Did not God choose the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which He promised to those who love Him?" (James 2:5). Only those who are truly poor in the world will be rich in faith, for only they can possibly be proved and can demonstrate the riches of their faith through this proving.</P><P>The faith spoken of here is not the initial faith with which we believe in the Lord; Laodicea has that faith already. The faith spoken of here is the faith with which the believers suffer for the Lord. This is what the Lord Jesus was referring to when He spoke of gold refined by fire. The Lord desires to see His people give up everything practically to follow Him and to suffer for Him. The Lord desires to see His people lose their scum in the furnace of suffering and shine and sparkle in the day of His appearing. The Laodicean believers should not have any hope for rapture or reigning. But if some among them would forsake everything to suffer for the Lord, so that their faith would become rich through their trials and they would turn from backsliding, the Lord will make them regain their lost rapture (with reference to Peter's word) and kingdom (with reference to James' word). May we have more faith to go through the sufferings!</P><P>"And white garments that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested." This is the second thing that they should buy. This, of course, refers to the goodness and righteousness of the saints' conduct. These white garments are not the righteousness of the Lord Jesus, because the Laodicean believers have that already. The white garments here refer to the righteousness practiced by the believers in their living after they have believed in the Lord and received God's righteousness. This is clearly pointed out to us by the Holy Spirit. Revelation 19:8 says, "And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints." The righteousness of the worldly people and the righteousness of the believers are two different things. The righteousness lived out by the believers is based on the righteousness they received from God, while the worldly people are practicing something merely according to the power of the flesh. This fact is related to the last point covered. Although they have put on the righteousness of the Lord Jesus, their faith is still not too living. This is why the Lord first counsels them to buy the living faith, to remove all filth, and to labor with love. They are still naked and shameful spiritually because they lack the practice. They are the fruitless trees. This is why the Lord charges them to draw near to Him, so that they may have good works through His grace and bear fruit of justification by faith.</P><P>Our garment is our outward appearance before men. We must differentiate between the righteousness of Christ and the righteousness of the saints. However, we must not separate the two. Christ as our robe of righteousness is a matter of our appearance before God. The righteous works of the saints are the righteousnesses practiced by the saints after they have believed and been justified. They are the white garments of the saints manifested before men and at the judgment seat of Christ. If saints have only believed and been justified, but have not practiced righteousness, they may not need to feel ashamed before the Father. But will the world say that they are good men just because they have believed in Christ? Will the judgment seat which bases its judgment on works consider such ones a glory to the Lord? As soon as a believer is void of white garments, the world will know about it, and Christ will also judge it. A believer who does not have the white garment is a believer who is naked before the world and Christ; he is a deeply shameful person. Among the present so-called believers, there are two kinds of errors. The first is to try desperately to perform righteousness and think that goodness before men means righteousness before God. The second is to consider justification before God as all that counts and that nothing else matters. Those who look to their own work and who do not trust in the righteousness of the Lord Jesus will not be saved. However, those who trust in the righteousness of the Lord Jesus but have no practical righteousness will not be rewarded. But then, one should also be careful about the practical righteousness that comes after justification. These are white garments; they are not the work of the flesh. White is the color of light, and light is the nature of God. Hence, the white garments are works that bear God's nature. Leviticus must come before Numbers. All those who have not seen God's holiness in the Holy of Holies cannot walk with God in the world.</P><P>The result of having the white garments is to have the shame covered. This means that there is no more shame. When Christ comes again, many will be ashamed before His seat (1 John 2:28). These are the ones who had much strength and many opportunities to practice righteousness.</P><P>"And eyesalve to anoint your eyes that you may see." This is the third thing that these ones should buy with a price. What they lack is spiritual sight. Otherwise, they would not have become so self-contented. They need a self-realization. Everyone who knows himself realizes that in his flesh there is no goodness dwelling. Only those who do not understand the corruptness and hopelessness of the nature they received from Adam think that they "have need of nothing." If the heart is satisfied with the old creation, it must surely have grown fat! These need the spiritual sight to know the holiness of the Lord. They have never realized how holy God is and how unapproachable, untouchable, and unimaginable is His holiness. That is why they are satisfied with what they have. They are also lacking in the revelation concerning the Lord's coming and His kingdom. If they were not lacking in this, they would not have accumulated riches and would not have boasted of these riches, which bar them from the kingdom. They must yet see how they are in the position of the creature and how they must trust in the Creator for all gifts. If the messengers in heaven have to trust in this way, how much more do we the sinners have to do the same? If we realize the position of God and of man, what other thoughts can we hold except to beg for grace and receive grace?</P><P>These are the ancient Pharisees! "But now that you say, We see; your sin remains" (John 9:41). Those who know that they are blind will receive healing from Christ. As He opened man's physical eyes with the clay and the spittle, in the same way He will now heal man's spiritual blindness with eyesalve. But why would those who say that they are not sick look for the physician? Once their eyes are opened, they will have the self-realization. This will save them from being astonished by their own blindness when enlightened by the flaming eyes at the judgment seat in that day.</P><P>One famous writer once said, "The most precious spikenard eyesalves come from Laodicea, the champion of all cities in Asia." However, the Lord told them to buy eyesalve from Him. The Lord sent Ananias to Saul so that he could receive his sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit (Acts 9:17). From that time on, Saul was to have a new sight, a sight of the Holy Spirit to discern all things. The talent, mind, and ability of Laodicea were all great, but it did not give any ground to the Holy Spirit. Apart from the Holy Spirit there is no spiritual sight. John told the little ones in the house of God, "And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know....And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him" (1 John 2:20, 27). The Holy Spirit is the anointing, the eyesalve. Unless we humble ourselves before the Holy Spirit and allow Him to reveal ourselves and God's coming glory to us, we will not be able to know. Wisdom and prudence are useless here.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE NINETEEN</H2><P>Verse 19: "As many as I love I rebuke and discipline; be zealous therefore and repent."</P><P>Laodicea is what the Lord "loves." Can we be the same? Can we ourselves be cleansed from all Laodicean sins yet still love all the Laodicean believers? Here the Lord reveals His heart. The original meaning of the word "love" means to treasure, to love intimately. It is very interesting that out of seven letters the Lord told only two churches that He loves them-one is Philadelphia, the best; the other is Laodicea, the worst. He told it to Philadelphia, so that they would not backslide, and to Laodicea, so that they would not be discouraged. Since the love of Christ has not forsaken Laodicea, neither should we. Quite often, we run the risk of being too much. Before the heart is taught by the Lord, we are the Laodiceans, but after we fully submit to the Lord, we not only drop all the Laodicean conduct but also hate the Laodicean brothers. We should realize that any "holier than thou" attitude is just the attitude of Laodicea! If the Lord thinks that He should still love Laodicea, we should also think the same way. Yet how hard this is! In the eyes of Christ, the attitude and the conduct of Laodicea are so worldly they make Him vomit. If we have the same heart as the Lord, we would have the same feeling as the Lord. If a believer stays in the world and boasts of his worldly riches, even Christ cannot restrain Himself from spewing him out. He will in fact have a stronger feeling than others would have! Yet His admonition, exhortation, rebuking, warning, and lastly, His love are still not cut off from them. Although they made Him sad, forsook Him, put Him to shame, made Him vomit, and shut Him outside the door, He still loves them. Indeed, love can do the job where nothing else can. The issue of love is not kindness but strength-the strength to remain unchanged in the face of rejection and negligence. The issue of love is its purity and its self-denial. Here the Lord Jesus reveals to us what love is. Here we learn much about the condition of Laodicea, but even the more we learn about Christ!</P><P>Such love of the Lord for Laodicea is sufficient proof that Laodicea is not the unsaved ones or the hypocrites. He cannot "love" an unsaved one so much.</P><P>"As many as I love I rebuke and discipline." The Lord Jesus warned them in this way to show them that their destiny is not so pleasant, so that they would not continue pushing forward in an ever bolder way. Although the Lord's advice is very strict, it issues out of love. He is waking them up from their dreams with His sharp words. If words do not work, He will use His hands; first the "rebuking," then the "disciplining." His love is so great that He was willing to rebuke and to chasten. The rebuking and chastening of the worldly people is often motivated by hatred. Many times they do not care for the truth. But our Lord does this with a loving heart. "For whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives....But if you are without discipline...then you are illegitimate and not sons" (Heb. 12:6, 8). On the one hand, discipline shows the love of the Lord; on the other hand, it shows the position of the believers. Those whom the Lord disciplines are the ones He loves, and they belong to the Lord. Hence, the Laodiceans were believers, not perishing ones (cf. 1 Cor. 11:32, 2 Sam. 7:14).</P><P>The second "I" is emphasized in the original text. This means that the Lord's love is different from man's love. Often man will cover, eradicate, and deny his beloved one's fault. Such a one becomes full of sin and beyond hope of healing. This was the way David dealt with Absalom and Adonijah. Their response was rebellion! The Lord's love is not blind. He wants to remove sins with grace. He does not like to discipline, but if His people do not listen to His calling and warning, He will not let them commit sins without rebuking or disciplining them because He loves them so much.</P><P>"Be zealous therefore and repent." The disciplining rod has been raised; only zeal and repentance will prevent its striking.</P><P>"Be zealous." Their love should be burning. Of course, this is not something that man can do with his natural ability, but if they recall the truth that stirred up their first love, their zeal will be stirred up again.</P><P>"And repent." They should see and confess the shortages the Lord told them of and seek for healing according to the Lord's instruction. The heart that loves the world chokes the heart that loves the Lord. The thorn chokes the growth of the good seed. These ones should remove everything that freezes their hearts and should repossess the past truth and rekindle their zeal through drawing near to God, musing, praying, and reading the Bible. They should purge out the invading lusts and should give room to the good seed.</P><P>The Lord is dealing with His people here. Many times He puts before them things that humiliate them. He does not ask them to do anything new; He only asks them to "repent." He is not asking them to receive any new wonderful ability that they may be able to "fly high" later. He asks them only to realize and confess that they have failed. But how hard it is for the self-contented heart to take this! The Lord's words never please man's flesh! The Lord did not want His people to do anything for Him. He only wants them to understand themselves, so that they would stand one with Him. To suffer for the Lord is much better than to work much for Him. Paul said, "What shall I do, Lord?" (Acts 22:10). The Lord said, "I will show him how many things he must suffer on behalf of My name" (Acts 9:16). This is what the Lord treasures. It is not to suffer for yourself but to suffer for the Lord. To have "kept the word of My endurance" (Rev. 3:10) is much better than to "have need of nothing." "If we endure, we will also reign with Him" (2 Tim. 2:12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE TWENTY</H2><P>"Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me" (v. 20).</P><P>"Behold, I stand at the door and knock." This is what the Lord says to the entire church in Laodicea. Regardless of whether it is the actual Laodicea of that day or the Laodicea of this age, all should listen to what the Lord says here. When the Lord says, "Behold," He is trying to get their attention. He is telling them that the situation now is a little bit strange. Why? "I stand at the door and knock." Why is He standing outside? Because there is no room for Him inside the door. Why is He knocking? Because the door is tightly closed. Christ is shut outside the door of Laodicea! He has not shut out Laodicea; it is Laodicea that has shut Him outside the door. This is a corporate matter, not an individual matter. The individual believers in Laodicea have received the Lord as the Savior, yet because of their self-contentment, in their walk they, as a corporate whole, have shut Him outside. There is no room for Christ to stand in their corporate organization, deeds, and ways. This is not a call for the world to repent but the Lord's speaking to His own church.</P><P>We should know that now the Lord is outside of the church organization, or the organized church. Once the opinion of the majority becomes the direction, the Lord has no more room except outside the door. No matter how much the believers act and work, if they deny the name of the Lord and do not keep His word, Christ will have no room to stand among them. This is not a matter of salvation. Salvation has never been mentioned in these seven letters. What is covered here is the matter of the corporate conduct of the church. We must differentiate the presence of the Lord with the individual from the presence of the Lord with a corporate entity. Every saved sinner has the presence of the Lord individually. But when a group of saved ones gather together, if they do things not according to the Lord's command, the Lord's presence, although felt individually, will not be with them corporately. There is no other prerequisite for having the presence of the Lord with an individual, other than being saved. However, regarding the corporate presence of the Lord, the prerequisite is the gathering together into the Lord's name (Matt. 18:20). Laodicea is so full of self-opinion that they cannot fully submit to the Lord. That is why we see the Lord outside their door. Here is a question: Since the Lord is outside the church in Laodicea, why should those of us who are willing to follow the Lord stay inside the church in Laodicea? Should we stand with the Lord outside the door? Everyone who is willing to obey the Lord should know how to reply.</P><P>The church should be the habitation of God on earth in Spirit, but because of the abnormal condition of this church, the Lord is forced to stand outside the door. The judgment is not yet executed, and the Lord has not yet spewed them out. However, He is already standing outside the door of the church. The same was true when He was on earth. After He had judged the Judaistic temple, He said, "Behold, your house is left to you desolate." "Jesus came out" (Matt. 23:38; 24:1). Similarly, the church in Laodicea has become a house of man and not of God. It is no longer the testimony of Christ but has become a manifestation of the importance and sufficiency of man. The Lord's heart is grieved. Yet He cannot tolerate seeing the degradation of their morality and the saturation by the world while advertising His name in public. For this reason He has forever withdrawn Himself from the nominal church. Here we see the same condition as it was the day the glory of the Lord left the holy temple (Ezek. 10-11). Please note that this is the way the Lord deals with the church in Laodicea of this age. If every individual church of this age is not completely consecrated to the Lord and does not give the Lord the headship over everything, they will be dealt with in the same way: the Lord will stand outside. Even for those who are not part of the organized church, if they fall into human opinion, the Lord's presence will also be withheld, and the gathering of the saints there can no longer be considered as a meeting into His name. Now the Lord is standing outside the door. Because of love and mercy, He cannot rest outside the door or sit down there; He is standing and waiting. He is willing to suffer the tiredness from standing, hoping that some will receive Him as their Lord and King and will consecrate their whole being for Him to reign. He stands at the door and knocks. He uses thousands of ways to knock. He admonishes, warns, exhorts, rebukes, and chastens with a hope that those who have an ear would hear and those who have a heart would open the door. He does not want those who are His to live in the place where He is not. His knockings are not only once or twice. He is standing there and knocking. He has knocked and He will continue to knock. Before He raptures the Philadelphian believers, He will keep on knocking with a hope that some of the Laodicean believers will become Philadelphian. There is still the chance for every believer in Laodicea to hear the Lord's knocking, but I am afraid that this knocking will not last too long. At any rate, the Lord today is still concerned about His rebellious children, and He is still waiting very patiently.</P><P>The Lord wants the believers to pay attention to Him. He wants them to receive Him. He had warned them ahead of time about their destination-judgment and condemnation. However, before the judgment comes, He would like to give grace. It should be His rebellious children who come to seek after Him, but since they are indifferent, the Lord has to come to stir up their zeal. He knocks at the door instead of breaking it. To those who do not want Him, He rather stands at the door and waits. He wants the heart of the householder inside the door. The Lord's condition here is like that in the Song of Songs, chapter five. There the bride said, "I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night" (5:2). This is the suffering of standing outside the door. He was imploring for a willing heart to open the door. We should not be like the slothful bride, opening the door when it is already too late.</P><P>However, the Lord's knocking here is only for individuals. The church has been forsaken by Him. Now it is no more the church opening the door. "If anyone hears My voice and opens the door." He is outside knocking at the door. If there is a heart inside the door that is not engrossed by the surrounding people and will open its door, that heart shall be blessed. However, this is an individual matter. Although the Lord cannot do what He wants to do, He can always do what He can do. Even though He is forsaken by the group as a whole, He knocks on every individual door. Although the majority has not allowed Him to be the Head over everything, He comes to seek out individuals. Although the door of the church cannot be open, the door of the individuals may be opened. "If anyone." The corporate whole had rejected Him according to their self-will, but He is not despairing. "If anyone"-perhaps there will be one or two. The Lord is seeking out individuals in Laodicea. We should not wishfully expect that the whole of Laodicea will be revived. This is impossible. However, there may be some individuals who are willing to turn to the Lord.</P><P>"My sheep hear My voice," but many of the sheep have lost their sheep nature. Hence, there are not many who can hear the voice. There are too many voices: the voice of their own opinion, the voice of the world, and the voice of the majority. There is no time to hear the Lord's voice. Even if they hear the voice, they still have to open the door. The bride heard the voice already but because of her laziness, she did not open the door. Is there not anyone who hears the Lord's voice today? What a pity that many have indeed heard it and have realized that they should allow Christ to be their life and that they should fully submit to Him, but because of the holding back of their companions, they do not act according to the Lord's will in their daily living and matters related to the church's stand.</P><P>But there is another meaning to "stand at the door and knock." It is related to the second coming of the Lord Jesus. Here the Lord's second coming is closer than that mentioned in any other letter. Not only is He coming, He is also standing at the door. It seems that He is standing at the door and trying hard to wake up His half-asleep bride. Yet those who are His still do not realize that He is at the door. The lord of the evil servant "will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know" (Luke 12:46).</P><P>If anyone sincerely opens the door, he will be blessed. The Lord said, "I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me." Of course, this refers to the time the righteous will resurrect. They will feast together in the kingdom. At that time, they will enjoy the blessing of the Lord on them.</P><P>First, the Lord "will come in to him." It is not in to them. It is in to those believers who open the door, and not to Laodicea. The destiny of Laodicea is sealed. The Lord is bestowing grace upon individuals. An individual believer cannot open the door for the whole church. It is a personal matter to submit to the Lord and to receive Him as the personal Lord of one's life. Anyone who receives the Lord as the Lord of his life, He will enter into him. Here the Lord is separating from a condemned church everyone who has a heart for Him. Hence, we should not sit back and say that there is no hope for the church today. The Lord is still knocking! Although the whole will not submit to the Lord, some individuals will. How then can we expect the whole church to be revived? That is a groundless, vain hope. The Lord is expecting only individuals who want to see Him. Do not be pessimistic. Neither be optimistic!</P><P>What does He do after He enters in? He is going to dine with him. This has some spiritual significance for the present time. The Lord will dine with all those who open the door; they will fellowship with the Lord, know the things of the Lord, and be in complete union with the Lord. "I...with him"-the Lord sympathizes with the believer. He wants to bear all his burdens. He wants to commend him for all his laborings. He wants to share with him in all his earthly endeavors, in difficulties, in tears, worries, and joy. "I...with him"-the Lord wants to join Himself to all who are the believers. The Lord wants the believers to know that He fully understands them. He treasures and feels all the sentiments the believers have, all their heart's desire aroused by the Lord, and all their reactions to things around them. Is this all? There is more! "I...with him"-believers and the Lord. Not only does the Lord know all the things that are of the believers, but the believers will know all the things that are of the Lord. The Lord is pleased to see His children's hearts communicating with His desires. To dine with him means to share his thoughts, feelings, joys, and difficulties. Such a fellowship, acquaintance, and trust can only be possessed by friends, not servants. "No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all the things which I have heard from My Father I have made known to you" (John 15:15). Those who can share with Jesus in His thoughts are His friends. Those who are willing to open their door will be rewarded with this. Any saint who opens his door will have a chance to fellowship with Christ's love and desires.</P><P>"I...with him and he with Me"-this is mutual; it is the peak of fellowship. Brothers, is it not true that we desire to have closer fellowship with the Lord? Do we desire to have unceasing fellowship with Him? Would we not be elated if the Lord would take our desires as His desires? Would it not be wonderful if we had the right to access what is stored within the Lord's heart? Such is a living of "I...dine with him and he with Me." How can we have this kind of living? There is no other way but to listen to His voice, to open the door to receive Him in, and to let Him be the Lord over our all. Is any point in your living a closed door to the Lord? Is there something in you that is autonomous and not open to the Lord's interference? This is the reason you cannot have a full union with the Lord and close fellowship with Him. If you are willing to open up every door, to fully submit to the Lord, to fully obey Him without exception, you will have the experience of dining with Him.</P><P>Anyone who is willing to open his door to the Lord will dine with Him in spirit in this age and will dine with Him in the kingdom in the next age.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE TWENTY-ONE</H2><P>Verse 21: "He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne."</P><P>Each church has its own special circumstances and its own specific temptations that it should overcome. Outwardly, this church seems to have none of these; there seem to be no persecutions, heresies, or filthy sins. It had merely fallen into worldliness, riches, and self-will. These are the things the Lord is calling it to fight against. Overcoming and defeat here have nothing to do with eternal life or eternal death, because through God's predestination and grace, the problem of a believer's salvation has already been solved. The overcoming here refers to whether or not these ones have kept their stand. Have they maintained the testimony of Christ through their words and conduct? Are they qualified to receive the reward?</P><P>How did they overcome? What is the nature of overcoming? To what degree do they have to overcome? "As I also overcame." All overcoming should be like the Lord Jesus' overcoming, although not all overcomers can be like the Lord in His overcoming. Among all of the Lord's promises, here is the only place that makes reference to the path the Lord took on earth. How did the Lord overcome? What did He overcome? Christians today focus on sins. It seems a marvel enough if one can overcome sins. Of course, to overcome sins is a very important matter. But what the Lord Jesus meant here is not the overcoming of sins because according to the Lord's view, the overcoming of sin is the common qualification of every believer. The Lord spoke about His own overcoming. His overcoming is the overcoming of firstly the world, and secondly Satan. He said, "Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out" (John 12:31). These are what He overcame. Saints should not spend all their lives fighting against sins only. We should go on to war with the world and the ruler of this world and overcome them.</P><P>The Lord Himself said, "Take courage; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33). The Lord overcame the world through the cross. "Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it" (Col. 2:15). The Lord Jesus overcame Satan and all his armies through the cross. What is the world? It is the common people, our environment, and everything that tries to pull us down from our high spiritual ground. We should overcome them instead of being pressed down by them. Anything that is against the Father is the world. We should fully obey God's will. We should not for a moment be overcome by worldly conversations, worldly temptations, worldly atmosphere, or worldly things. What is Satan? He is God's enemy. We should not only overcome the material world; we should also overcome the world of evil spirits. The spirit of the antichrist which is the spirit of Satan is now waging war everywhere. Therefore, the saints should overcome. The believers should overcome Satan and all his works in this age. He is working in the world and behind the world. The Lord has overcome them already. Now He is calling His people to overcome them as He did.</P><P>John told us concerning these two overcomings in 1 John: (1) "For everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory which has overcome the world-our faith" (5:4). (2) "You have overcome the evil one" (2:13). "You are of God, little children; and you have overcome them [evil spirits] because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world" (4:4). Believers should not be satisfied only with overcoming their sins. As the Lord overcame the world and Satan through the cross, we should also overcome the world and Satan through the cross.</P><P>The reward for the Lord Jesus' overcoming is to sit with the Father on His throne. If this principle of reward according to works is applicable to the Lord Jesus, no doubt we must have the proper works if we desire to be rewarded. To try to receive the reward by grace is as wrong as to try to receive salvation by works. Because of the complete obedience of the Lord Jesus, God rewarded Him by seating Him together with Him. The kingdom was given to the Lord Jesus because of His obedience. "But of the Son, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom. You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy above Your partners" (Heb. 1:8-9).</P><P>If we overcome, how will the Lord treat us? "He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne." If we can follow Christ's deeds and His overcoming, we will receive the glory and the kingdom with Him. Here we see two thrones. The throne on which Jesus is now sitting is the Father's throne which is in heaven and not seen by men. The Lord did not promise anyone to sit with Him on that throne. The future throne of the Lord Jesus will be seen by men; it will be the throne of David, the throne of the Lord as Messiah. This throne will be in the millennial kingdom and will be in Jerusalem (Ezek. 43:7; Luke 1:32; Psa. 45:6). Overcomers will sit with the Lord on this second throne. When the new heaven and new earth come, the Son will no more sit separately from the Father. At that time, the throne will be "the throne of God and of the Lamb" (Rev. 22:1, 3).</P><P>Now is not yet the age of Christ's kingdom. When the Lord Jesus comes down in glory and establishes His kingdom, the overcomers will reign as co-kings with Christ. Now is the time for the saints to overcome. The Lord is now preparing those who will be co-kings with His Son. Because the future glory is great, the position high, and the works abundant, today's preparation cannot be loose. Only those who have definitely overcome today are qualified to be kings in that day. There is no possibility for faking here. It must be an individual overcoming and it must be an overcoming. Today's circumstances, trials, and temptations are just training for the future kings. Whether or not one is qualified, up to the standard, or strong enough is fully manifested through all these things. Today's defeated ones will not be qualified to reign with the overcomers in that day. Those who cannot rule over everything today will not have the power to rule over everything in that day.</P><P>The last message the Lord spoke to Laodicea is a call to be co-kings with Him. As long as they overcome, they will be able to enter into glory. The throne of glory is the most encouraging thing to the saints who have been saved but are now backsliding.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE TWENTY-TWO</H2><P>Verse 22: "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."</P><P>The same words have been spoken six times before. This is the last time. If we do not listen this time, there will be no more chance. This calling is still sounded out loudly to the people of God. How I wish that this calling would meet and create open ears, so that they would no longer be bound by their coldness, and that they would zealously follow the Lord forsaken by the world. What the Spirit can say and should say to the churches has already been spoken. Now He is asking only for open ears to hear what He has spoken. If these words still cannot move their hearts, the Spirit will have nothing more to say.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>APPENDIX-<br>FULFILLMENT IN HISTORY</H2><P>This is how the Lord closed His letters to the seven churches. The example of Laodicea has been repeated too many times. We have no more heart to point out who is and who is not Laodicea. The Lord knows whom He is going to spew out; there is no need for me to say anything more. Brothers, if we depart from the dishonorable vessel, we will become the honorable vessels. Our heart is on what the Lord is after. Corporately speaking, Philadelphia preaches that all believers are brothers and that they are all members of the one Body. But Laodicea-the counterfeit of Satan-uses ecumenical conventions to replace the Body of Christ. It sacrifices the truth in order to preserve the whole. It drops the voice of the conscience for the sake of the majority. In man's eyes, Laodicea has the practice of Philadelphia; it is even considered a greater and more glorious Philadelphia! However, this is what the Lord wants us to come out of. Furthermore, we should not think that as long as we come out of the formal Laodicea, or remove the name from a Christian denomination, we are therefore acknowledging the truth of one Body among Christians. One can find Laodicea among many recently organized denominations; one can find it even among those who have come out of them. All believers are members one of another. This is not just a truth for us to acknowledge with our mouth and conduct; it should be something that we practice in a definite way. I am afraid that after we have read so much, we will think that as long as we are out of the denominations, everything will be all right and we will automatically be in Philadelphia. If one understands in this way, he misunderstands what I am preaching concerning the truth in the Bible. We came out of the denominations because we have experienced the Body of Christ and are compelled to remove what hinders the relationship of oneness among all believers. If this is not the case, to come out of the denominations will merely create confusion and will add another division to the Body of Christ.</P><P>What is our experience concerning the oneness of Christ's Body? It is an experience of life. A life cannot be divided. It is only when we experience the flowing of life among us that we realize the oneness of the Body of Christ. This great truth, like all other Bible doctrines, is an accomplished fact. Yet we need to have the definite experiences of it. The saddest thing is that too many believers today are still living according to the Adamic life so that they do not experience the oneness of the Lord's life. If we have a clearer separation from the old creation, and if we have a clearer understanding of the Lord's resurrection life, we will see that not only will we have a deeper union with the Lord (experientially speaking, of course), but we will experience a further oneness with one another. Apart from life, there is no genuine union in the world. The union between the Lord Jesus and the Father is this way, and so is the union between us and the Lord. Why should the union of the believers as the Body of the Lord be otherwise? The real oneness, the oneness that makes us one Body, does not come from agreement of understandings, agreement of comprehension, or agreement of condition. Even if one sacrifices all the differences in opinions, he will still not be able to produce the relationship and experience of being members mutually one of another, a relationship and experience of oneness. It is only when each individual believer seriously puts away all that is of the natural man and of Adam through the cross and lives out the life of the Lord Jesus through the Holy Spirit, that he can know experientially that we are members one of another. If we all are filled with the Lord's life, how can we stop this life from flowing between one another? This flowing of life is just our experience of the union of the members. This kind of union is the real union; all else is only superficial. (The Lord willing, later on in other places I will give more testimonies concerning this.)</P><P>Individually speaking, Laodicea represents a life of freedom and self-will, one which comes from the old creation. Philadelphia, on the other hand, means nothing other than being a prisoner of the Lord, one who has completely forsaken all that is of man, who has obeyed the Lord, and who is living according to the Lord. Unless a believer opens his heart and fully surrenders to the Lord, and unless he is willing henceforth to do nothing according to the self and to fully accept the Lord's work in him, it will be difficult for him to be delivered from Laodicea. Brothers, this is not a matter of outward behavior; this is a matter of our living. Unless we live by the Lord's life, much of Laodicea's work will be manifested. The days are short. May we all be faithful. May we all be more obedient.</P></body></html>
