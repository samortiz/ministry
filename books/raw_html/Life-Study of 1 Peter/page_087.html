<h2 class="head1">REJOICING EXULTINGLY</h2><p>In verse 13 Peter says that as we share the sufferings of Christ, we should rejoice so that at the unveiling of His glory we may rejoice exultingly. In this verse Peter speaks of rejoicing exultingly. According to my understanding, this means that we shall not only be joyful inwardly, but we shall sound out our joy. At the same time, we may stretch forth our arms and also leap for joy. This is to exult and to rejoice exultingly. At the time of the unveiling of the Lord&rsquo;s glory, we shall exult. I believe that we shall shout, rejoice, and perhaps even leap for joy. We shall be excited to the uttermost, beside ourselves with joy. Today we may rejoice, but when the Lord is unveiled we shall rejoice exultingly.</p><h2 class="head1">REPROACHED IN THE NAME OF CHRIST</h2><p>In verse 14 Peter goes on to say, &ldquo;If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.&rdquo; &ldquo;In the name of Christ&rdquo; is actually in the person of Christ, in Christ Himself, because the name denotes the person. The believers, having believed into Christ (John 3:15), and having been baptized into His name (Acts 19:5), that is, into Himself (Gal. 3:27), are in Christ (1 Cor. 1:30) and one with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). When they are reproached in His name, they are reproached with Him, sharing His sufferings, in the fellowship of His sufferings (Phil. 3:10).</p><p>The reason the persecutions we suffer are the sufferings of Christ is that we suffer in the name of Christ. According to Peter&rsquo;s word in verse 14, we are blessed if we are reproached in the name of Christ. Do not think that it is a curse to be reproached in the name of Christ. This is to be blessed. However, it may be a curse if people appreciate us too highly. Regarding this matter, we need to have a change of concept.</p><p>Today the opposers spread rumors concerning us and accuse us of teaching heresy. I can testify that I am a fundamental Christian and that I love the holy Word very much. I do not teach anything except the Bible with Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, I am accused of teaching heresy. In a sense, I welcome this kind of reproach, for it is actually a blessing, not a curse.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT OF GLORY RESTING UPON US</h2><p>Peter tells us in verse 14 that if we are reproached in the name of Christ, the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon us. Literally, the Greek says &ldquo;the Spirit of glory and that of God.&rdquo; The Spirit of glory is the Spirit of God. The Spirit of glory is the One through whom Christ was glorified in His resurrection (Rom. 8:11). This very Spirit of glory, being the Spirit of God Himself, rests upon the suffering believers in their persecution for the glorification of the resurrected and exalted Christ, who is now in glory.</p> <p>In this Epistle Peter mentions the Spirit of God four times. In 1:2 he speaks of the sanctification of the Spirit, in 1:11 he says that the Spirit of Christ was in the Old Testament prophets, and in 1:12 he speaks of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Here in 4:14 Peter says that the Spirit of glory rests upon the persecuted believers. According to what Peter says in this Epistle, the Spirit of Christ is in us, and the Spirit of glory rests upon us. The Spirit of Christ is in us to reveal all that Christ is to us for our enjoyment. The Spirit of glory rests upon us to glorify God. One aspect of this wonderful Spirit is that the Spirit is in us to reveal Christ, and another aspect of the same Spirit is that He is also the Spirit of glory resting upon us.</p><p>The more we suffer and are persecuted, the more glory there will be upon us. This is truly a blessing. I can testify that the more I am persecuted and evil spoken of, the more I am empowered. Persecution and reproach does not hold me down. On the contrary, it lifts me up. Therefore, we should rejoice when we are reproached in the name of Christ, because the Spirit of glory is resting upon us.</p>
