        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">HEAVEN OPENED AND THE ANGELS OF GOD<br />
ASCENDING AND DESCENDING<br />
ON THE SON OF MAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:50-51; Gen. 28:10-22</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will look at the last topic in John 1, which is contained in verse 51. In this verse the Lord told the disciples that they would see &ldquo;heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LADDER AND THE SON OF MAN</h2>
<p>Although John 1:51 was spoken by the Lord Jesus, His speaking was in reference to Genesis 28:10-12. These verses in Genesis speak of the dream that Jacob had while fleeing from his brother Esau. Jacob &ldquo;dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and there the angels of God were ascending and descending on it&rdquo; (v. 12). Genesis says that the angels of God were ascending and descending on a ladder, but the Gospel of John speaks of the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man. The utterance in these two portions of the Bible is exactly the same except that <em>a ladder</em> is changed to <em>the Son of Man</em> in the Gospel of John. These two portions speak of the same thing. Hence, the ladder in Genesis 28 is the Son of Man in the Gospel of John. The Son of Man is the ladder. It is not easy to understand that the Son of Man is a ladder, nor is it easy to understand that the ladder is the Son of Man. However, by combining these two portions, we can see that the ladder is the Son of Man and that the Son of Man is a ladder in the universe. In this universe there is a man who has become a ladder that reaches to heaven and connects heaven to the earth. In order to understand this matter, we need to read from the beginning of chapter 1.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE<br />
OF JOHN 1</h2>
<p>The Gospel of John is a special book, and it occupies a special position among the four Gospels. The Gospel of John has not only a special topic and a special content; even the utterance is special. In particular, chapter 1 has a strong independent character in comparison to the following chapters.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 begins with eternity past, before time began, and continues until heaven is opened to the earth and the Son of Man is a ladder upon whom the angels of God ascend and descend. Although we have a miniature of this today, its complete fulfillment will be in eternity future. Hence, chapter 1 covers from eternity past to eternity future.</p>
<p>Verse 1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; This Word is the Lord Jesus. At the end of chapter 1 the Word is the Son of Man; that is, the Word is a man. He existed in eternity past as the explanation and expression of God, the Word of God, but in eternity future He will also be the Son of Man.</p>
<p>Everything in eternity past was mysterious. Although the Lord was the Word of God, the Word had not yet come forth. He was God&rsquo;s explanation, but He had not yet been manifested. Everything in eternity past was hidden and mysterious; there was only the Triune God. Heaven, earth, man, and time did not exist in eternity past; only God existed. But in eternity future there will also be the Son of Man upon whom the angels of God will ascend and descend. Hence, in eternity future there will be heaven and earth. The angels of God will be in heaven, and man will be on earth. Man is the center of the creatures on earth. In eternity future heaven will be opened and will communicate with man on the earth.</p>
<p>There is a great difference between the beginning and end of chapter 1. At the beginning there is the Word, but at the end there is the Son of Man. At the beginning everything is hidden, abstract, and mysterious, but at the end everything is concrete and manifested. At the beginning only the Triune God exists, but at the end there are heaven, earth, angels, and man. Not only so, heaven is opened to the earth, and the angels are ascending and descending on the Son of Man. This is a very mysterious yet clear picture. At the beginning everything is mysterious, but at the end everything is clear.</p>
<p>The section between the beginning and the end of chapter 1 follows the course of time. The course of time is the time between eternity past, which is the beginning, and eternity future. The first thing that happened in the course of time was that God created all things through the Word. Verse 3 says, &ldquo;All things came into being through Him.&rdquo; The second thing that happened was that the Word came to be life. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; The first thing that took place in the course of time was creation; the second thing that took place was the Word coming to be life and light to man in order to be received. The story in the Old Testament is related to the old creation, but the story in the New Testament is related to the new creation, to the Word coming as life.</p>
<p>When the Lord came to be life, some people rejected Him (v. 11), but others received Him, and &ldquo;as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God&rdquo; (v. 12). Those who receive Him are regenerated and possess God&rsquo;s life. The Word came to be man&rsquo;s life in order for man to receive and gain Him by being born of God to be children of God so that He could raise up a tabernacle among men for God (v. 14). He was raised up as a tabernacle, making it possible for God to be received and touched by man. By receiving God, man receives grace, and by touching God, man touches reality.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John also says that receiving and touching the Lord are for man to enjoy His fullness (v. 16). This fullness is the fullness of God (Col. 1:19). The more we are in Him, the more we will touch the fullness of God and enjoy everything of God. The Lord declares the unapproachable, invisible, and unfathomable God by entering into man so that man can receive, experience, and enjoy all the fullness of God (John 1:18; 1 Tim. 6:16). This declaration is not a matter of teaching doctrine or objective speaking. This is the first half of John 1; it is also the introduction of the entire Gospel of John.</p>
<p>After the introduction we see the religious background and environment of the time. The people were in their religious concepts. Their mind was filled with the Jewish religion concerning the Messiah, Elijah, and the Prophet. John the Baptist, however, testified that the Lord Jesus was not the Leader whom the people were expecting according to their religious concept. He was the Lamb of God and the dove. The Lamb of God takes away our sin, and the dove is for us to receive the Spirit of God and be joined to God.</p>
<p>As soon as John the Baptist testified, some disciples began to follow the Lord. Although they were rather confused, at least five followed the Lord. When they came before Him, they encountered an extraordinary situation that could not be understood or expressed according to their religious background, thought, and concepts. They felt that He was different from an ordinary man because through the Lord they could touch and receive God. According to their religious thought, however, they said, &ldquo;We have found the Messiah&rdquo; (v. 41). They also spoke of the Lord as &ldquo;Him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote&rdquo; and as the King of Israel (vv. 45, 49). They said these things according to their Old Testament religious concept. Of those who followed Him, only Nathanael said, &ldquo;You are the Son of God&rdquo; (v. 49). In the Old Testament there are prophecies concerning the Messiah, the Prophet, and Elijah, but there is no word concerning the coming of the Son of God. Incredibly, Nathanael said, &ldquo;You are the Son of God.&rdquo; I believe that he probably heard this word from John the Baptist, who said, &ldquo;He who sent me to baptize in water, He said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit. And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God&rdquo; (vv. 33-34). If Nathanael heard this word, it would have left a deep impression on him. Thus, when he saw the Lord, he said, &ldquo;You are the Son of God.&rdquo; Even though this word was full of revelation, Nathanael still added a religious &ldquo;tail&rdquo; to it, because he went on to say that the Lord was the King of Israel. This shows the depth of the disciples&rsquo; religious concepts.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus did not want to be called the King of Israel. In chapter 6 the Jews wanted to make Him a king by force, but the Lord Jesus withdrew (v. 15). It was when He was nailed on the cross that the Roman governor Pilate wrote the charge against Him: &ldquo;THE KING OF THE JEWS&rdquo; (19:19; Mark 15:26). The Gospel of John does not say that the Lord Jesus came to the earth to be the King of Israel. On the contrary, it shows repeatedly that He is the Son of God and also the Son of Man. The Lord said, &ldquo;He who believes into the Son has eternal life,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing, for whatever that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner&rdquo; (3:36; 5:19). Thus, the Gospel of John concerns the Son. The Lord Jesus said repeatedly that He is the Son. On one hand, He is the Son of God, and on the other hand, He is the Son of Man. Nathanael was clear, and yet he was confused. He said that the Lord Jesus was the Son of God, but he also said that the Lord Jesus was the King of Israel. This drew out a special response from the Lord, who said, &ldquo;Is it because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree that you believe? You shall see greater things than these...Truly, truly, I say to you, You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man&rdquo; (1:50-51). Nathanael said that the Lord was the Son of God and the King of Israel, but the Lord said that He came to the earth to be the Son of Man and that Nathanael would see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on Him as the Son of Man.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
