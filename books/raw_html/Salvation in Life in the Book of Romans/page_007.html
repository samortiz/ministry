<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SUBJECTIVE AND DISPOSITIONAL SANCTIFICATION SAVING US FROM A NATURE SOAKED WITH THE ELEMENT OF THE WORLD</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 1:7a; 15:16b; 6:18, 22b, 19b</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The two aspects of sanctification:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Positional sanctification—Rom. 1:7a.</li>	<li>Dispositional sanctification:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Saving us from a nature soaked with the element of the world.</li>		<li>In the Holy Spirit—15:16b.</li>		<li>Our cooperation:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Presenting ourselves as slaves to righteousness—6:18, 22b.</li>			<li>Presenting our members as slaves to righteousness—6:19b.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>The fruit of subjective and dispositional sanctification:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Causing us to be sanctified dispositionally and occupied by God—6:19b.</li>	<li>The end of our being sanctified dispositionally unto God being eternal life—6:22b.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>When man fell, his whole person became the world. He was fully soaked with the element of the world. Therefore, God’s sanctification comes in to deal with the world. Sanctification means separation from the world. Since God wants to sanctify us dispositionally, He must deal with the worldly element in our nature. There is no one who does not love the world. Even children are no exception. After man fell, his inward nature was soaked with the element of the world. Now, as soon as he sees anything of the world, he desires it. Hence, after we are saved, we need to have a subjective and dispositional sanctification that will separate us from our nature that is soaked with the element of the world. For man to give up his love for the world is not an outward act. It is a sanctification in man’s inward nature. When his nature is inwardly sanctified, he spontaneously will not love the world. When you teach all these points to the new ones whom you serve, you must do so in a slow way, mouth to mouth, point by point, so that they all will be able to understand.
