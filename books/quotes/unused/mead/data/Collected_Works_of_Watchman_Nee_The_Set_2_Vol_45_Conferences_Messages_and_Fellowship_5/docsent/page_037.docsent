   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-SIX POVERTY AND RICHES Date: December 4, 1940</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Unrecorded</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Mal 3:10; Rev 3:17</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many of God's children do not know that they are poor.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In fact, many Christians have fallen into the condition of the Laodiceans.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In spiritual matters it is easy to deal with those who are empty, but it is very difficult to deal with the poverty that comes from self-proclaimed riches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is difficult to do anything with a person who lives in this kind of poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He seems to know everything, yet he does not know anything in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The poverty that I am speaking of does not relate to the absence of knowledge, but rather to the inadequacy and superficiality of one's knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is easy to know whether or not we do have something.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But very few people are aware of whether they live in a condition of poverty, because poverty is something that cannot be objectively quantified.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A rich man in the rural countryside becomes poor in comparison when he comes to Shanghai, and he will be even poorer when he comes to New York City.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All those who are blind think that they are rich.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I was a child, whenever I had ten dollars, I would exchange them for a great deal of coins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although I only had ten dollars, I felt that I was the richest person in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can know what we have, but it is difficult for us to know that what we have is not enough!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have seen many different kinds of people, and I have drawn the same conclusion: Most of the ones who think that they are rich are actually poor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A few days ago I was talking to a brother about obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He told me that during the past twelve years, he had obeyed God two or three times.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I heard this, I stood up and shouted, "Can someone like you know obedience?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Another time I was talking to a brother about the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever I spoke, he would interrupt me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I would begin a sentence, and he would finish it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You might say that there was a wonderful "coordination," but during the conversation, I almost shouted, "Do you really know what the cross is?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once I was talking to a man about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His words showed that he knew nothing about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I was talking to a sister about the subject of the kingdom six months ago, but she did not think that she was poor at all in this respect.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Tonight I choose to bring up this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am not lecturing here; I am merely stating some facts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Most Christians today are cheap Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They bear a cheap cross, buy cheap obedience, and pursue a cheap kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is nothing wrong in being poor.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, when poverty joins itself to a proud person, the results are disastrous.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church in Laodicea was both poor and proud.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She was poor, but she thought she was rich.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This presumption is where the trouble lies.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In spiritual matters those who think that they are rich are proud.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many Christians are proud, insubordinate, and troublesome because they have become full with their past experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These experiences have damaged them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have brought up the matter of the vessels in 2 Corinthians 4 and 2 Timothy 2.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no question that we are a vessel, but the question before us is what kind of vessel we are and what material is used to build up the vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is easy for us to see a vessel, but it is not easy for us to know the kind of material that makes up the vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A good and honest brother from the north once questioned me repeatedly about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He wanted to know about the Body, the church life, and the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Spiritual matters have to do with riches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They have nothing to do with how many questions one asks, but how deep the questions are.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a rich man stands next to you, you will become poor right away by comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In 1920 I spent a great deal of time studying the coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I thought that I could have had a Ph.D. in this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A year later I met Sister M. E. Barber.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One afternoon, we were on this important subject, and we spent quite a few hours talking about it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By the end we were still not through with it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>She wanted me to stay behind to talk about it some more, but I did not accept the offer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before I left she said, "You hide your disagreements in your heart and launder your politeness out in the front."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I admitted that what I knew concerning the Lord's coming was merely outward knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I studied and researched His coming, but Sister Barber was a person who waited for His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I was an earthen vessel, while she was a vessel of gold and silver.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>She was rich, and I was poor.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One brother said that God had dealt with him once or twice, and that he now knew the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Actually he may still be ignorant of it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A baby grows very fast during the first years of his life, and others easily can see the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But after thirty years it is difficult to grow anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After thirty years it is no longer a matter of growth, but a matter of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The condition of the church in Laodicea was miserable and poor.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Yet she thought that she was rich.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God has no intention to change those who have not into those who have; He only wants to make those who are poor into those who are rich.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I have heard Sister Barber and Brother Sparks speak.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Both of them have the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>During the past three or four years the shallow and superficial experiences have frustrated us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>These experiences have hindered us from launching into deeper experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Laodicea's self-estimate was exactly the opposite of God's evaluation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you are really rich, you should rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But the pitiful thing is that you do not look like those who have something.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In spiritual matters, those who are blind do not realize that they are poor; only those whose eyes have been opened realize that they have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The most important thing for us to do today is to see.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Once we see, we will no longer consider ourselves to be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I have said to some co-workers that the messages they give now may be the same as the ones they gave years ago, but there is a deeper understanding of what they are speaking now.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Sometimes when I look at some old magazines, I find some old articles that I have written.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I cannot believe that I could have said what I said then.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Today much of the terminology has become all too common and misused.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Many people say that they have received revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Actually they do not know what revelation is.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Those who are behind you spiritually will not benefit by what you have, while those who are ahead of you spiritually see through all your words.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Once a blind man sees, the first thing he notices is his own nakedness.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Just as Adam and Eve realized their nakedness in the garden of Eden, we see our nakedness when our eyes are opened.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Our true condition is laid open before our God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is difficult to preach the gospel to those who are already in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the same principle it is difficult to give a message to those who already think that they are rich.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The church in Smyrna considered herself poor, yet she was rich before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What are riches?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Riches are not a matter of having something.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Being rich is realizing that we only have elementary experiences before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Human wisdom, verbal understanding, and pride have no place here.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Those who are eloquent, who have a sharp memory, and who prepare their speeches well, are not necessarily the ones who are qualified to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Only those whose eyes have been opened by the Lord are qualified to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Every time we see something, we become conscious of our own nakedness.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>There is not one person whose eyes have been opened who has not seen his own nakedness.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>You can try this out for yourself when you go home tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The first time we saw the truth in Romans 6, which reveals that our baptism into Christ is a baptism into His death, we were thrilled.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>But when we try to share what we have spoken of in the past, we realize that we have nothing to add.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In fact, light does not add something to us; it tears down something.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Once a man said that he knew the church.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Later, he came back and said that he knew nothing about the church, because a greater light had swallowed up his former light.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>When you come to Shanghai, do not come with the thought that you will receive something.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If you think in this way, you will go home as empty-handed as when you came.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In spiritual matters what is needed is not knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>What is needed is a person who feels that he has never seen anything.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Once a man sees, he will realize that he is naked.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Some people think that all that is needed is some patch-up work, but this is not the way God operates.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>When light comes, everything of the past is torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>When light comes, there is the stripping, and the stripping will take away everything.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Light will shine to such an extent that a person will doubt whether he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>When light shines, a man will fall down like Saul and forget about his self-image and self-esteem.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Light will show us that we have nothing, that we are empty.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>It will bring us to the point where we feel that we have nothing except our initial salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>When light comes, we will realize that we really do not know anything.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>If we think that we know this and that, and if we think that we know a little about everything, we will never be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The way to riches is not through accumulation but through destitution.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Some people seem to know a little about everything, yet they can never carry on an in-depth discussion about anything.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>God's house is rich, but earthen and wooden vessels have no place in His house.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Grass and wood are not the proper materials to build His house.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>God's house can only be built with precious materials.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>We have to come under God's light, and we have to realize that God's house is so rich that there is no room for all the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>We should not hold on to the little that we have.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Instead, we should see that there are riches in God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>We should always receive something more, and we should always act as if we have not received anything.</S>
