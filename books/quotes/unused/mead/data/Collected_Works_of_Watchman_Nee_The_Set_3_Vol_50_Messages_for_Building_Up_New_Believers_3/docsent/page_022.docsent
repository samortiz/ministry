   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sacrificing Life to Preserve Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why did God give animals to man for food?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, this indicates that man has a need for food.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man's need for food before the fall was different from his need for food after the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must understand the meaning of food.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Food sustains our life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a man does not eat, he will die.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No one can live and survive without eating.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In addition to eating herbs, vegetables, and fruits, God ordained that man should take meat in order to live and survive.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, God shows us that after sin entered the world, life must be sacrificed to preserve life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is the need for an animal to lose its life to maintain our life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After sin entered this world, there was a need for the shedding of blood to maintain life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the reason that man's food after the fall is different from his food before the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christians should not be vegetarians; they should be free to take meat.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This does not mean that meat will necessarily do our body any good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whether or not it is good for our body is a different thing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are not medical researchers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Researchers claim that animal protein is better than vegetable protein.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The basic principle with us is that since sin has entered the world, man can no longer have life without the sacrifice of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After man sinned, he could no longer receive life without death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Life can only come through death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without death, man cannot live.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order for man to live, there is the need for the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we have death, we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the basic principle of eating after the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since the time of Abel, and in particular after the flood, God placed this way before men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Being a vegetarian is a subconscious declaration that we can live without death, that we can live without the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By eating meat, we are indicating that we cannot live without death and the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Is this principle clear?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the reason that God gave animals to man for food after the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man can no longer have life without the loss of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ gave up His life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now we can receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Romans 14 indicates that some people still believed that they could be vegetarians like Adam before the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some of them only ate vegetables.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul told us not to criticize these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He told us not to stop them or to condemn them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those who eat meat should not judge those who do not, and those who do not eat meat should not judge those who do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, Paul pointed out one thing: Those who only eat vegetables are weak v. 2 . Do not criticize them for their weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But this does not mean that vegetarianism is right.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It only means that we do not want to embarrass others over the matter of food.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, we must realize that Christian redemption involves life out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before there can be life, there must first be death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Vegetables alone are not enough; death must precede life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Life is sustained through death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is a fundamental Christian principle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some may be weak in their conscience and may only eat vegetables.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should not expose their weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But a Christian's stand is that meat is needed because it sustains life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Abstinence from Foods</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Being the Teachings of Demons</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>First Timothy 4 says that there will be the teachings of demons that forbid marriage and command abstaining from foods vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>1, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>D. M. Panton has shed some clear light on this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He said that only by abstaining from marriage and foods can one's soul power be developed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must realize that we are not those who abstain from meat.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the last days there will be such things as abstinence from foods.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the teaching of demons; it is not the teaching of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some abstain from meat because they do not know the Christian principle of life through death.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Eating only vegetables means that one's life is maintained by the vegetable life alone and that he has no need of a Savior, no need of death, and no need of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must be clear about this principle.</S>
