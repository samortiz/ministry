   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REASON FOR THE EVIL SPIRITS' ATTACK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why are the believers' minds so attacked by evil spirits?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One answer is that the believers themselves afford evil spirits also called demons an opportunity to attack in their minds.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should realize that it is possible for the believers' minds to suffer the demons' attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is proven by the experiences of many believers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The place the demons most often attack is the mind because the mind and evil spirits have a special rapport.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The attacks of evil spirits on the believers' minds produce the aforementioned phenomena.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Parts or the whole of man's mind have already isolated themselves from man's sovereign rule and fallen into the hands of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a result, evil spirits are able to think and stop as they wish and ignore the believers' own will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although the mind still resides in the body, its sovereignty belongs to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even though the believers may oppose it, nothing will avail.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In whatever aspect the believers give place to evil spirits, that aspect will not thereafter obey man's own will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, it will obey another will.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the believers give any ground in their minds to evil spirits, they have lost their sovereignty over their own minds.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To put it in another way, if the mind of a believer has lost its sovereignty and is no longer able to rule over itself, the mind is already occupied by evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If evil spirits have not attacked the believer's mind, his will should be able to rule over everything; he can think when he wants to think and stop when he wants to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He will not encounter any difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The minds of the believers are attacked by evil spirits because the believers have given place to evil spirits in their minds.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Believers are prone to give more place in the mind to evil spirits because the mind is related to evil spirits in such a special way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These places become leverage in the believers' minds upon which evil spirits freely work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should remember that man's mind is of man; if evil spirits do not have man's consent, they cannot use his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If man does not volunteer intentionally or unintentionally to hand over the mind to evil spirits, they cannot infringe on man's freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This does not mean that evil spirits will never tempt us in the mind such will not happen in this life .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But it means that when we exercise our will to oppose them, they will immediately stop.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The problem today is that even though many believers exercise their own will to resist, temptations still do not stop.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This should not happen; it is a proof of the work of evil spirits because it is done in disregard of man's will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After a believer has indeed yielded to evil spirits, his mind will inevitably be filled with the works of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Evil spirits will work on him according to the ground he has given them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since he has given ground to evil spirits in his mind, they can do whatever they want in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The most important principle in the work of evil spirits is that one has to give ground for them to work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They can only work when they have the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Without the ground, they have no way to work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The amount of their work is determined by the amount of ground they receive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whenever believers give ground in their minds to evil spirits, the evil spirits will work in the believers' minds.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There are six kinds of ground that believers can give to evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let us consider each one of them briefly.</S>
