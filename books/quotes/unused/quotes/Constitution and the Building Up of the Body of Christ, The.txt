4)The New Jerusalem will be God's ultimate building, built with precious stones for God's eternal expression Rev
The church has not only been constituted with Christ as its element; it is also being built up by the transformation in life
We have heard of peach trees, apple trees, and hundreds of other trees, but we may have never heard of a life tree
In this figure Christ presents Himself to us as a tree, not a pine tree but a vine tree, spreading Himself before us
According to the crucial view, the first figure in the Bible is the life tree, and the second one relates to Christ's coming
We do have such a Christ who is the embodiment of the Triune God as the source of life signified by the life tree
After the Bible tells us who Christ is by showing us the tree of life, it has thirty-nine books to present Christ to us
God entered into man and stayed in a human womb for nine months, and then when He was born, He was both God and man
He is the Sower, the Distributor of the divine life, and because He has sown Himself into us, we all have this life
The real Body the Body of Christ in reality is a plant growing out of Christ as the life seed sown into the human heart as the growing earth
If on the one hand you love Christ and, on the other hand, you love many things besides Him, your heart is not single, pure, and absolute
All of us need to purify our heart, simplify our heart, and deal with our heart so that it would be absolute toward Him
Two thousand years ago there was only one Jesus in Palestine, but today on this earth there are millions of 'Jesuses'
In the same way, the church is an organism of the Triune God that manifests and expresses Him as His fullness, His corporate expression
According to the items covered above, we can see that we Christians, as members of the Body of Christ, are very particular persons
The divine revelation of the entire Bible unveils to us that God in His eternal economy wants to have an organic Body for Christ
It was also for this purpose that He is sanctifying, renewing, and transforming us for the growth and building up of the Body of Christ
After he was saved and regenerated, the main goal of his life was corrected from keeping the law to living Christ
Simply because people talk about doctrines and practices concerning the church, but neglect the living of Christ
The Body of Christ is the new man as the organism of the Triune God, which eventually consummates in the New Jerusalem
In the previous chapter, we saw the constitution of the Body of Christ with the all-inclusive Christ as the life-element
Matthew 13 also reveals the constitution of the Body of Christ under the enemy Satan's frustration, damage, and corruption
Satan works to undermine the Lord's work in three ways first to frustrate, then to damage, and finally to corrupt
In chapter thirteen of Matthew, the Lord Jesus not only opened up the heavenly things but also opened up the hellish things
In eternity past He was God, but in His incarnation He stepped out of eternity into time and with His divinity into humanity
It is a wonder that the almighty, infinite God entered into the womb of a young virgin and remained there for nine months!
We know that Jesus now lives in us not only because the Bible tells us so but also because our experience testifies that it is so
From the day that we called on the Lord and received Him, we realized that someone came into us and was even added into us
Even in such a so-called Christian nation as the United States, millions of people have not yet believed in the Lord Jesus
He is still in the process of His coming until He eventually will come from the heavens to the air and from the air to the earth
Matthew 13 reveals the constitution of the Body of Christ under the enemy Satan's frustration, damage, and corruption
It remains on the surface of your heart, and then the birds, signifying the evil spirits, come to snatch away the word
All these negative things are typified by hard rocks underneath the surface of the field, making the earth shallow
Satan works to damage by sowing tares in the midst of the wheat to restrict and damage the growth and development of the wheat
Today in Christianity, among so many real Christians, there are also some false Christians, Christians in name
The farmers are not able to tell where the tares come from, but after the wheat has grown up, some tares are mysteriously among them
The false Christians among the real Christians always restrict and damage the growth and development of the wheat
The mustard signifies the church in life, which is good for food supply, but today's Christendom is a big organization, like a big tree
We Christians who follow the Lord Jesus are relatively small in number, but Satan has made Christendom very large
The genuine church is not something great but is like the small mustard that produces food for the satisfaction of God and man
For the proper church life, we need to have the fourth kind of heart, the good earth, for growing Christ, and we need to be small, not great
Leviticus 23 says that on the day of Pentecost, God requested His people to offer two leavened loaves, not unleavened loaves
Satan's corrupting work is also by leavening the church with different teachings other than the teaching of the economy of God
Paul exhorted Timothy to remain at Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach different things other than the economy of God
Because there are hundreds of different teachings today, there are also hundreds of different groups, different divisions
Satan's corruption is portrayed in Matthew 13:33, which speaks of the leavening of the entire meal through a woman
Satan worked to leaven the early church with Judaism in Sabbath keeping in circumcision practice in the socalled holy diet and in traditions
Satan also leavened the church with Catholicism in the papal system, hierarchy, heresies, idolatry, and pagan practices
Catholicism also invented the holidays of Christmas and Easter, which are pagan in their origin and full of pagan practices
The Presbyterians stress the presbytery, the ruling and managing of a so-called local church by a body of elders
All of the different denominations are founded upon their different teachings, and they have their traditions which they must keep
Satan's corruption is also seen in his leavening the church with the believers' natural man and their flesh and its lust
Even in a little church of eleven or twelve meeting together, there can be a number of opinions as a leavening factor of corruption
The word of life cannot penetrate the hardened heart, giving the evil spirits the opportunity to snatch the word of life away
The Lord Jesus in Matthew 13 likened these evil spirits to the birds snatching away the seed sown on the hardened earth
That person is the God-man, Christ the Triune God embodied in humanity as the source of life, signified by the tree of life
Regretfully there is also a negative picture, a picture in the night, a picture from the heart as the wayside to the corrupting leaven
We also need to be impressed with the vision of the negative picture of Satan's frustration, damage, and corruption
We have such a life, but we must look to the Lord for His mercy that we would be willing to let this life grow in us
In Matthew 7 the Lord Jesus said that the gate is narrow and the way is constricted which leads to life, and few are those who find it
In John the Lord said that if we come to Him and drink, rivers of living water will flow out of our innermost being
He also said that if we drink of Him, we will never thirst again , and that if we eat of Him, we will never be hungry again
The believers' growth in life has a source, and the source is the eternal Word God in eternity in whom is life
If we would sing a hymn such as 1151 in Hymns three times every morning for one week, we would be different persons
The base of the believers' growth in life unveiled in the writings of John is first the redemption of Christ as the Lamb of God
The base of our growth in life is also the termination by the crucifixion of Christ in the likeness of the serpent
Just as Moses lifted up the brass serpent in the wilderness, so Christ as the Son of Man was lifted up on the cross
Through the Lamb our sin is gone through the brass serpent our serpentine poison is terminated and through the dove we have been regenerated
Christ's death on the cross in His flesh has put the world, the cosmos of Satan, on His cross and has judged it and terminated it there
We can grow in the divine life by eating Christ as the living bread from heaven embodied in His words of eternal life
On the one hand, we read the Word, and on the other hand, we pray with what we read, not with our own word, but with God's loving, holy Word
When we come to a verse like John 1:29 'Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world' we should not merely read it
Our spiritual nourishment does not depend on the number of verses or chapters we read but on how many of the Lord's words we have eaten
We should get away from all persons and distractions to have a personal time with the Lord, in which we can enjoy Him in a hidden way
We can enjoy Christ in a public way with all the saints, but we still need a time apart from everyone to enjoy Christ as the hidden manna
Just as eating, drinking, and breathing are essential to our physical life, they are also essential to our spiritual life
Eating is mentioned in John 6; drinking is mentioned in John 4 and 7; and breathing is mentioned in John 20:22
Many immigrants came to the United States from the Far East with their children, and many of their children became bigger than they are
John said that the young children are those who know the Father and who have received the anointing to know all things
In the United States, it is difficult not to love the world because there are too many worldly attractions here
As the young men progress in the divine life, they grow into the fathers, who know Him Christ, who is from the beginning
As long as we remain in our disposition, our character, and our peculiar traits, we cannot be built up with anyone
In transformation we are changed not just in our form and our appearance but in our very element and our very essence
We all need such a metabolic change in the element and essence of our being through our growth in the divine life
We believe that even at this moment, while we are here waiting on You and looking unto You, You are really one with us
It is very interesting to see that all these three great writers John, Peter, and Paul touched the matter of the growth in life
It is true that God created the heavens and the earth, and He even did some remodeling of His creation, but God does not have two buildings
Although Peter was a fisherman who wrote awkwardly in Greek, his writing is very high and very solemn, with no lightness
In Peter's writings the first item as the base for the believers' growth in the divine life is the sanctification of the Spirit
One day as we were listening to the gospel, the Holy Spirit of God came to sanctify us, to separate us unto God and make us holy
In Luke 15 the Lord Jesus spoke three parables that correspond to the Divine Trinity in God's saving of sinners
As presented in Peter's writings, the first item as the base of the believers' growth in the divine life is the Spirit's sanctification
The sanctification of the Spirit ushered us to the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, which refers to redemption and issues in life
The next item in Peter's writings as the base of the believers' growth in life is the regeneration through Christ's resurrection
When Christ resurrected, millions of believers in Christ throughout all the centuries were regenerated together as a group
The Bible tells us that when Christ died, we died with Him and in Him , and when Christ rose, we were resurrected with Him and in Him
Another item in Peter's writings that constitutes the base of the believers' growth in life is the God-allotted, equally precious faith
In the Old Testament the land of Canaan was the unique good land allotted by God as an inheritance to His people Israel
At the juncture when we believed, it was not we who were believing; it was God who was allotting a portion of the unique faith into us
At that very juncture, this hidden Jesus, this mysterious Jesus, secretly entered into us and became our faith in Him
Another vital item as the base for our growth in life is the divine power which has granted to us all things relating to life and godliness
The tiny seeds of flowers are sown into the earth, and when they grow, they produce flowers of many different colors
The last items in Peter's writings as the base for our growth in life are the precious and exceedingly great promises and the divine nature
According to 2 Peter 1:4, it is through the precious and exceedingly great promises that we have become partakers of the divine nature
We desire to be holy, godly, and spiritual because these things are according to God's nature, of which we partake
Because we have God's nature, to do the things of God is natural to us, because the divine things are according to our divine nature
Our Christian virtues in our growing in the divine life are the spiritual expressions of the divine attributes of God
We have the God-allotted faith as a base, and then we progress in our growth in the divine life from faith to virtue
We need to know God in the four Gospels, in the fourteen Epistles of the apostle Paul, and in all the other books of the New Testament
We all need to progress in this way to the next step, that is, brotherly love in warm affection, characterized by delight and pleasure
From this brotherly love we still need to progress until we reach the climax, the divine love, which is God Himself
The base, the foundation, of this progression is the God-allotted faith, and its capstone, its topstone, is the divine love of God
In the writings of Peter the first issue of the believers' growth in life is to enjoy the continual and daily salvation
Peter in his first Epistle unveils to us that the Lord is a living stone and that we, by contacting Him, also become living stones
We were created as pieces of clay in nature , but by growing in Christ we become stones, transformed metabolically in our nature
To preach the gospel is to tell out the sweet virtues in a sweet way of the Lord who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light
Surely this kind of victorious, vital, and corporate trumpeting of the good news from the heavens would be triumphant and successful
The gospel preached by the apostle Paul is based upon the righteousness of God for God's full salvation in Christ
Going along with His regeneration God has renewed us by the germination of His Holy Spirit to have a new beginning in His new creation
In Paul's writings the way of the believers' growth in life is revealed in much more detail than in Peter's writings
In our spiritual life, day by day we need to eat sufficiently, rightly, and properly to receive the supply from Christ the Head
In our growth in life, we the believers progress from the fleshly man to the soulish man, and from the soulish man to the spiritual man
A fleshly man is one whose behavior is under the influence of his fleshly nature and partakes of the character of the flesh
According to Paul's writings, the believers also progress in their growth in life from infancy to maturity, that is, to full growth
Through our growth in life we the believers mature with Christ as the element of the divine life unto full growth
We need to grow from dust to plants, and we need to grow further and be transformed from plants into precious stones for the building of God
Many sisters read the newspaper not for the important items of the news but to locate the sales in the department stores
We should not remain as infants or merely as adolescents in the divine life; we must grow unto a full-grown man
The fullness of Christ here denotes the expression of Christ, and the expression of Christ is just the Body of Christ
We all need to grow unto the proper measurement of the stature of the Body of Christ, which is actually the stature of Christ
The word joined implies the thought of being joined by fitting, and the word knit implies the thought of interweaving
The Body is built up through the rich supply of every joint and through the operation in the measure of each one part
The joints are the specially gifted members of the Body, such as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
Like the writings of John and Peter, the writings of Paul also reveal the ultimate consummation of the believers' growth in life
Our growth in life will consummate ultimately in our being transfigured in the body in the completion of the full redemption
We have been redeemed in our spirit through regeneration, and now we are being redeemed in our soul through growth and transformation
The redemption of our body is the consummation of the full redemption, which includes regeneration, transformation, and glorification
The New Jerusalem is the final, ultimate sign in God's economy , and the final, ultimate goal of all God's redeemed people
In the second chapter of this book we saw the constitution of the Body of Christ under the enemy Satan's frustration, damage, and corruption
By His grace and mercy, we are seeking to see this Body be fully constituted with Christ, transformed, and built up
Without our growing up in Christ, in His life, there is no possibility, no way, that the Body of Christ can be built up
The stress in these chapters is on the building up of the Body of Christ by the transformation in the divine life
His human living, the effectiveness of His death, the power of His resurrection, and the height of His ascension are now in Him as life
Of the twentyone aspects listed above regeneration transformation and glorification are the three vital aspects in Gods complete salvation
Regeneration is the start of our spiritual Christian life and glorification is the consummation, the ending, of our Christian life
Both regeneration and glorification transpire in an instant, but transformation is a process that lasts through our entire Christian life
Glorification saturates the believers' body with the glory of God to glorify them by bringing them into God's glory
We need to remember these three vital items in God's full salvation: regeneration, transformation, and glorification
In order to grow in life and have the transformation in life, we need to eat Christ as our healthy, spiritual food
When we eat, digest, and assimilate Christ as our spiritual food, the essence of this food gets into our being and produces transformation
The new element replaces the discharged old element, and we have an inward, metabolic change in nature and in essence
When we eat and drink Christ, He becomes the new element within us to replace and discharge the old things within us
The divine essence comes into us to replace the fallen human element, causing us to be transformed metabolically and inwardly
The inward transformation in our nature and essence is the result of the positive organic reaction of the divine life in our entire being
Within us there is the divine life, and with the divine life there is always some positive, organic, and living reaction
We must allow the Lord Jesus to occupy our entire being our mind, emotion, and will for our transformation in life
Every day the Lord is renewing us, and His renewing is a kind of metabolism to supply us with His new element to replace our old element
He is the divine life within us, moving, living, and working in every part of our being to make our being a renewed being
Transformation results in the manifestation of the processed and consummated Triune God in the believers' new man
Eventually, we will fully express Him as the God of love, the God of incarnation, and the God with the elements of humanity and human living
Transformation is accomplished in the believers who, with unveiled face, behold and reflect as a mirror the glory of the Lord
We can be exactly the same as He is in His life, in His nature, in His image, in His expression, and in His attributes
My burden in these days is with this fellowship concerning the constitution and the building up of the Body of Christ
We have seen that God's economy is accomplished in us in three steps: regeneration, transformation, and glorification
We need to pay attention to the words consummation and transformation, since they are not common but very particular
We may fertilize, water, and trim the tree, but it grows by itself according to its constitution with the life element
The essence of the seed of the tree spontaneously mingles itself with the earth, not the whole earth, but just the essence of the earth
When the Lord Jesus sowed Himself as the life seed into our heart as the soil, as the earth, the seed began to grow
When the essence of the seed and the essence of the earth come together and are mingled together, some constituting work is going on
In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul told us not only that we are God's farm to grow Christ but also that we are God's building
The first foundation is jasper , the wall of the city is jasper , and the light of the entire city is like a jasper stone
God's appearance is like jasper , so the entire New Jerusalem bears the appearance of God and expresses God by her shining
God sitting on the throne looks like jasper, and we, the entire city, bear His appearance, so we are His enlargement
Nothing in the New Jerusalem can be burned because it is not of the plant life but it is built with gold, pearls, and precious stones
When we were saved, we were like green, tender sprouts, but gradually we will become precious stones through being transformed
While we are growing, we are being transformed from plants into minerals, that is, into precious stones for God's building
We will also be troubled by the mustard seed being changed in its nature into a big tree and by all kinds of leaven
All kinds of isms such as Judaism Catholicism Protestantism socialism nationalism racialism and liberalism are different kinds of leaven
The missionaries set up hospitals and schools, and these became a part of the big tree with big branches, good for lodging the birds
Eventually, from that division which he set up, some negative writings were put out which defamed Brother Watchman Nee
Today there are all kinds of leaven, but one day we will be in the holy city, the New Jerusalem, which is impossible to be leavened
We have seen that the all-inclusive Christ, the Triune God embodied in humanity as the source of life, is signified by the tree of life
God said that every tree in the garden was pleasant to the sight and good for food, including the tree of life
In the morning we eat breakfast, and during the day what we have eaten is being digested and assimilated into our being
We need to eat Christ as the living bread from heaven embodied in His words of eternal life , as the tree of life , and as the hidden manna
By eating Christ we can be constituted and supplied with Him as our life element so that we can grow in life and be transformed in life
Some may have the attitude that their local church is independent and autonomous and should not be interfered with
Sometimes we call a meeting for the co-workers to come together to fellowship about the Lord's work, but in the meeting they say very little
Their policy is that the more you say, the more mistakes you make, and the less you say, the less mistakes you make
If we do not have open fellowship with one another and if we keep secrets, anything of the Lord which is under our hand will be killed
The single sisters may have the desire to get the best husband someone who is a hero who is very capable and who has the highest education
In the Lord's recovery, all of the races with all the different colors white, black, yellow, brown, and red are blended together
Paul said that he desired to know Christ and the power of His resurrection that he might be conformed to Christ's death
The constituting of the believers into precious materials through transformation issues in the practical building of God
There is the possibility of having the one accord in the local church and of enjoying the oneness universally in the Body of Christ
Now we want to see the ultimate consummation of the transformation for the composition and constitution of the New Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem is purely of the originating God in His divine nature, signified by the pure gold of the base of the city
The holy city is exclusively of the redeeming Christ in the work of His all-inclusive death and His life-supplying resurrection
His death is all-inclusive to solve all the problems, and His resurrection is supplying us with life all the time
When an oyster is wounded by a grain of sand, it secretes its life-juice around the grain of sand and makes it into a precious pearl
Today in the local churches there are some brothers who are like gates, through which people can enter into the realities of the holy city
After this honeymoon time in the church life, everything may become unpleasant, because all the dust comes out
My burden is to show all the saints that if we mean business to keep the oneness for the Lord's recovery, we must learn to be transformed
We have to read and study the outlines with the verses in this book so that we can see how we should live and behave in the church life
The church can be built up with the mature saints and even built up to the uttermost with the transformed saints
We need to spend some time to read the Scripture references, the outlines, and the fellowship in this book with prayer
