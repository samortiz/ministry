 <h2 class="head3">&ldquo;Your Name Be Sanctified&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Following this there are three things that we have to ask for: &ldquo;Your name be sanctified,&rdquo; &ldquo;Your kingdom come,&rdquo; &ldquo;Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth.&rdquo; First we ask, &ldquo;Your name be sanctified.&rdquo; In the Bible, the words <em>sanctification, holiness,</em> and <em>separation</em> are the same word in Greek. It means to set apart a person or a thing unto God. Whether we set ourselves apart or are set apart by someone, being set apart means to be sanctified.</p>
<p>There are two aspects to our sanctification. The first is positional and objective. For example, <em>men</em> can be sanctified:</p>
<p>(1) Aaron and his sons. Exodus 28:41 says, &ldquo;And shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest&rsquo;s office.&rdquo; Here we have the sanctification of Aaron and his sons.</p>
<p>(2) The firstborn. Exodus 13:2 says, &ldquo;Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.&rdquo; Here we have the sanctification of the firstborn of Israel.</p>
<p>(3) The saints. Acts 9:13 says, &ldquo;Lord, I have heard from many concerning this man, how many evil things he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;saints&rdquo; shows that the disciples are sanctified.</p>
<p>(4) The wife, the husband, and the children. First Corinthians 7:14 says, &ldquo;For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the brother; otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.&rdquo; Here the husband and the wife are sanctified.</p>
<p>The Bible also mentions <em>things</em> being sanctified.</p>
<p>(1) Food. Leviticus 21:8 says, &ldquo;You shall sanctify him, for he offers the food of your God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(2) Every creature of God. First Timothy 4:5 says, &ldquo;For it [every creature of God] is sanctified through the word of God and intercession.&rdquo; The above verses show us that both food and every creature of God can be sanctified.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Bible also mentions <em>places</em> being sanctified.</p>
<p>(1) Jerusalem. Matthew 4:5 uses the phrase <em>holy city,</em> showing that Jerusalem is sanctified.</p>
<p>(2) The temple. Matthew 23:17 refers to the temple being sanctified.</p>
<p>(3) The altar. Matthew 23:17 and 19 say, &ldquo;The temple which sanctifies the gold...the altar which sanctifies the gift.&rdquo; This speaks first of the temple and altar being sanctified, and then of the gold and gift being sanctified through the sanctification of the temple and the altar.</p>
<p>The second aspect of sanctification is experiential and subjective. It is sanctifying God&rsquo;s name through one&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>(1) The Lord Jesus. Matthew 4:10 says, &ldquo;Then Jesus said to him, Go away, Satan! For it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s name is sanctified before Satan through the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>(2) Enosh. Genesis 4:26 says, &ldquo;And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh: then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s name was sanctified before men through Enosh.</p>
<p>(3) Abraham. Genesis 14:22 says, &ldquo;And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s name was sanctified before the king of Sodom through Abraham. He called God the most high God.</p>
<p>Genesis 21:32-33, &ldquo;Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. And Abraham planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the Lord, the everlasting God.&rdquo; In verse 33 God&rsquo;s name was again sanctified through Abraham. He called God the everlasting God.</p>
<p>(4) Isaac. Genesis 26:28 says, &ldquo;And they [Abimelech, his friend Ahuzzath, and Phichol the chief captain of his army] said, We saw certainly that the Lord was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s name was sanctified before Abimelech through Isaac.</p>
<p>(5) Jacob. Genesis 30:27 says, &ldquo;And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s name was sanctified before Laban through Jacob.</p>
<p>(6) Joseph. Genesis 39:9 says, &ldquo;There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he [Potiphar] kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?&rdquo; God&rsquo;s name was sanctified before Potiphar through Joseph.</p>
<p>(7) David. First Samuel 17:46 says, &ldquo;This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s name was sanctified before Goliath through David.</p>
<p>(8) Samson. Judges 16:28 says, &ldquo;And Samson called on Jehovah and said, O Lord Jehovah, remember me, I pray; and strengthen me, I pray, this one time only, O God, that I may be avenged of the Philistines at once for my two eyes.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s name was sanctified before the Philistines through Samson.</p>
<p>(9) Elijah. In 1 Kings 18:37 Elijah said, &ldquo;Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s name was sanctified before the priests of Baal through Elijah.</p>
<p>(10) Paul. In Acts 27:22-23 Paul stood and said, &ldquo;And now I advise you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. For this very night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood by me.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s name was sanctified before Paul&rsquo;s companions through Paul.</p>
<p>Hence, sanctifying God&rsquo;s name is making God&rsquo;s name distinct in the ear of the hearer from all other names who are not God, such as the devil (John 8:44), the stomach (Phil. 3:19), and idols (Isa. 36:19). Sanctifying God&rsquo;s name is to make His name distinct whenever it is mentioned.</p>
