   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Constitution, the Basic Principle,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Administration</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of God s New Testament Economy</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The administration of God s New Testament economy is the topmost administration in human society.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is the constitution of God s administration?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without question, the constitution of God s administration is the sixty-six books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This constitution was not instituted by the representatives of the people; this constitution is simply God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, God s administration in the New Testament is not by human autocracy or by human democracy, but by God Himself administrating.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the apostles, elders, deacons, and all the saints are walking according to the Bible, then they are in God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Otherwise, whether they are apostles or local elders or deacons or the saints, they fall outside of God s administration and bring in a situation of confusion in which they act at will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the situation of today s Protestantism and Catholicism; this is also the main reason we left that system.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not wish to serve in such a situation of confusion, but rather we would forsake everything to come back to the Word of God and serve according to His Word and His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the basic principle of God s administration in His New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Administration in the Lord s Recovery</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1922 the Lord raised up His recovery in China.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The one who took the lead among the first group of brothers and was used by the Lord to release His truths was Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He made a thorough study of the Bible and possessed spiritual insight and knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He collected many writings in Christianity concerning church history, the establishing of different denominations, biographies of famous men, and the writings by the great teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There were about three thousand volumes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, he was not merely enlightened by the Bible to see God s New Testament economy and the administration in this economy; he also compared the ways of administration in the different denominations and Christian groups in the last two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He had seen the proper practice of God s New Testament economy, and he practiced the church life according to what he had seen, as I have mentioned briefly before.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the same time, there was a group of brothers and sisters like Levites helping him in order to put into print what he had seen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever he opened his mouth to give a message, there were some who would do the recording, transcribing, and polishing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The messages were reviewed by him, then typeset, printed, and published.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was our past practice in mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1949 we were led by the Lord to move from the mainland to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the Lord s leading in the past among us, that is, according to God s administration which we have followed, we began to have local churches, the work of the apostles, and those who serve the apostles and their work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At present, the Lord s recovery has spread to six continents and has more than nine hundred churches, requiring the service of more Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>My ministry alone occupies about sixty full-timers, who serve in the three ministry stations in Anaheim, California, and Irving, Texas, in the United States, and Taipei, Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Besides these, there are many who volunteer to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the full-timers training this time there are many from abroad who volunteered to come to help in meal preparation, construction, cleaning, and translation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, now in Taipei we can see the model of the administration in God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here we have the church, the work of the apostles, and the service of the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE MANAGEMENT OF FINANCES</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>IN GOD S ADMINISTRATION</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because of the fact that it requires money to carry out anything on this earth, there is the matter of finances.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no definite rule or guide regarding this matter in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no such thing as controlling finances, nor setting up a department to manage finances.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the principle in the Bible, the management of finances is carried out spontaneously, not requiring the setting up of a center for management.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If this is done, there will be much harm.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the present, there are nearly one thousand serving the Lord full time in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to the way of Christianity, there would definitely be the need to set up a mission to handle all the monetary offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Everything would need to pass through that mission and be distributed by it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But we cannot do things that way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The proper situation among us should be that no matter which church produces the full-timers, whether these full-timers stay in that same city or go to work in other localities, the church which produces the full-timers should be before the Lord to follow His leading concerning the matter of supporting them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this way man s flesh will not have any opportunity to exercise control, and those who receive the support will not have the sense that they are being hired, that they cannot move freely.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, many full-time brothers and sisters are now working in Taipei; yet they are being supported by other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church in Taipei only receives the benefit of their work without bearing any financial burden for them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Without the Lord s grace, this kind of practice can never be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A church may have produced a good number of full-timers, but most of them work in other localities; yet the church that produced them still supports them in love month after month.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suppose that particular church says that since those full-timers supported by them do not work in their locality, they will not support them any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The full-time brothers and sisters should not question, saying, Why will you not support me when I work in another place?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That will cut off my supply and I will not be able to survive.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not have problems such as these.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you feel that you cannot survive, then you should not serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you want to serve full time, you need to do it absolutely, whether you live or die.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the Lord s way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I have been serving the Lord for nearly sixty years, and I have been living without definite support.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If today there is something to eat, I will eat.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As for tomorrow, let the Lord be responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In 1949, when we came from the mainland to start the work in Taiwan, we were sent by the work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, among us, whenever the work sent someone, the work did not supply him financially.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I brought all ten members of my family to Taiwan with only three hundred U.S. dollars with me, an amount sufficient for three months living.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After I had worked in Taiwan for more than ten years, I went to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At that time I did not have even three hundred dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The brothers in the United States thought that Brother Lee was well-known everywhere and loved by many, and that those in the Far East surely had monetary offerings for him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>And the brothers in the Far East thought that since Brother Lee had gone to work in a wealthy country, he surely had received much money.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Eventually, neither side took much care of me.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Who then took care of my living?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I thank the Lord that He was the One who took care of my living.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Today in the United States, the property for the two ministry stations in Anaheim and Irving alone is worth a considerable amount.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Where did this come from?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This was from the Lord s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The land was provided, and the buildings were also constructed.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the management of finances in God s administration.</S>
