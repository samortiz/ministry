<h2 class="head3">4. The Goal of the Intensified Work<br />of God&rsquo;s Organic Salvation</h2><p>For what are the believers saved from degradation by the sevenfold intensified Spirit? In order to answer this question, we need to see the goal of the intensified work of God&rsquo;s organic salvation.</p><h2 class="head4">a. Producing the Overcomers</h2><p>This salvation is for producing the overcomers to build up the Body of Christ for the initial consummation of the New Jerusalem in the kingdom age (2:7) and the full consummation of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth (21:2). As we look at the situation of today&rsquo;s Christians, we may wonder who will build up the Body of Christ. Without the overcomers the Body of Christ cannot be built up, and unless the Body of Christ is built up, Christ cannot come back for His bride. Christ will come back not only as the Savior but also as the Bridegroom to marry His bride, who will be the totality of the overcomers. The building up of the Body of Christ is by the overcomers produced by God in the intensified work of His organic salvation.</p><p>The building up of the Body of Christ by the overcomers in this age is for the initial consummation of the New Jerusalem in the kingdom age and eventually for the full consummation of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Preparation of the Bride</h2><p>The intensified work of God&rsquo;s organic salvation is also for the complete preparation of the bride of Christ so that the Bridegroom may have His triumphant wedding in the millennium for His satisfaction according to His good pleasure (19:7-9). John 3 indicates that Christ is the Bridegroom coming for the bride, who is composed of all the regenerated people. But nearly two thousand years have passed, and the bride still has not been prepared. The overcomers produced by Christ&rsquo;s intensified work will build up the Body of Christ, which will become the bride of Christ. Thus, Christ&rsquo;s wedding will take place as a result of His intensified work.</p><h2 class="head4">c. The Formation of the Bridal Army</h2><p>Next, Christ&rsquo;s intensified work is for the formation of the bridal army for Christ to defeat and destroy His top enemies in humanity, the Antichrist and his false prophet (Rev. 19:11-21; 17:14). At the end of this age Antichrist and his false prophet will rise up to be the top enemies of Christ in humanity. Who will defeat them? These enemies will be defeated by Christ&rsquo;s bridal army, formed with the overcomers. Christ and His bride will fight against His human enemies and destroy them.</p><h2 class="head4">d. The Binding of Satan</h2><p>Furthermore Christ&rsquo;s intensified work is for the binding of Satan and the casting of him into the abyss for one thousand years (20:1-3).</p><h2 class="head4">e. The Bringing In of the Kingdom</h2><p>Finally, Christ&rsquo;s intensified work is for the bringing in of the kingdom of Christ and of God which will be the millennium (vv. 4-6).</p><h2 class="head3">5. The Final Outcome</h2><p>The final outcome of Christ&rsquo;s intensified work will be that the ultimately consummated Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God becomes the Bridegroom, and the aggregate of the overcoming saints becomes the bride of the universal romance between the redeeming God and His redeemed man as the conclusion of the entire Scriptures (22:17).</p><h2 class="head1">III. AN APPENDIX</h2><p>The words, listed as follows, concerning the compounded, all-inclusive, life-giving, and indwelling Spirit, unveil also the secret of God&rsquo;s organic salvation:</p><p>A. The consummated Spirit as the second Paraclete (the Comforter), the realization of Christ as the first Paraclete, takes care of the believers, especially in the matter of the Divine Trinity being the main, life element of the organic salvation of God (John 14:16-18).</p><p>B. The indwelling Spirit joins in to help the believers in their weakness and He Himself intercedes by groaning in the spirit of the believers that all things may work together for good to those who love God that they may be conformed to the image of His Son that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers (Rom. 8:26, 28-29).</p><p>C. The believer who is joined to the Lord can experience the Lord to the climax, even to be one spirit with the Lord (God) (1 Cor. 6:17).</p><p>D. The Father strengthens the believers, according to the riches of His glory, with power through His Spirit into the believers&rsquo; inner man, for Christ to make His home in the believers&rsquo; heart that they may be filled unto the fullness of the Triune God for His corporate expression (Eph. 3:16-19). When Christ has the freedom to make His home in our heart, then we will be filled unto all the fullness of the Triune God to be the Body to express the Triune God corporately.</p><p>E. The apostle who sought to know Christ and gain Him was enabled to do all things in Christ who empowered him by His Spirit of bountiful supply (Phil. 3:10a, 12; 4:13; 1:19).</p>
