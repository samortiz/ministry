It covers the importance of this type of training, the main points to take care of, and some practical suggestions
At the very beginning of his Christian life, every new believer should be taught emphatically to have no trust in himself
For the past forty years, he has lived in the world, squandered his days in sin, followed the customs of this age, and been bound by Satan
For the past forty years, he has lived according to his own temperament and walked according to his own concepts, feelings, and ideas
Only those who have learned the lessons and who know these standards can tell others what they should not do and what they should not say
The building up of a new believer consists of teaching such a one the standards of the Christian life so that he can walk accordingly
Why did the Lord say, 'Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens' ?
The building up of a new believer consists of identifying the things to be dealt with the things to be eliminated and the things to be added
On the negative side, the building up of a new believer consists of tearing down everything that he had in the past
If a new believer does not break down everything that he had in the past, he will experience much frustration in his Christian walk
He may be greedy for vainglory and earthly treasures, yet think that he is above worldly pursuits and base gain
From this point forward he has to drop his old concepts tear down his old ways remove his old ideas and get rid of everything that is old
He can no longer have the same temperament and use the same vocabulary, and his clothing and food can no longer be the same
The leaders have to encourage the audience to ask questions and to talk about the things that they do not understand
Even if a person has some disagreement, he should only express himself through constructive suggestions, not destructive criticisms
After a year, he will have heard most of the things that he should hear and should have learned most of the things that he should learn
As far as his spiritual experience is concerned, he needs a fresh start and should join the new believers meeting
In making arrangements for the new believers meeting, all the churches should try their best to set aside Wednesday or Thursday
Whether this meeting involves many people or few people, the whole congregation or small classes, it should be on Wednesday or Thursday
Whenever a new believer goes to another place that has a church, he should be able to join in immediately and not miss any lessons
When these brothers return to their respective localities, they can bear the responsibility of teaching in the local new believers meeting
In order to take care of this, we can ask one brother to head up the matter by gathering the leading ones every week to train them
If he comes across anything that he does not understand, he should ask, and everyone should discuss it together
In delivering a lesson, the main goal is not to help the new believers understand more teachings but to do some carving work on them
One should pay attention to the areas that require carving; he should know what needs to be torn down and what needs to be added
Of course, in order to achieve the desired objective, the leading ones first must be dealt with in the area they are speaking about
If a church has very few new believers or if there are not enough speakers, there is no need to divide the new believers into classes
In such cases one person should simply bear the responsibility of teaching these lessons, followed by questions, week after week
If a church has many new believers, these believers should be divided into smaller classes and should be trained separately
In this case everyone in the audience should carry a notebook and write down the crucial points and the subject of every portion
The leading one should ask questions as he moves along, and the listeners should also feel free to ask questions as they listen
Sometimes the listeners can be asked to say something, but their speaking has to be brief and should not occupy too much time
Those who can take notes should prepare a notebook and write down the important points throughout the course of the lesson
Our purpose is not just to speak something to the new believers but to check whether or not they are practicing what they have heard
We have to keep pushing and checking with them, until they begin to practice and deal with these things conscientiously
The leading ones have to find out how much time they should spend on a lesson and how long they should continue with it
If the Lord's blessing is with us, we will not be off the mark by too much even when the practical arrangements are not altogether desirable
The opposite of eternal life is perdition, but the Bible does not regard salvation as the opposite of perdition
If you are on the world's side, no matter what kind of person you are, you are opposed to God, and you are God's enemy
Salvation, however, is not just a personal matter; it has to do with the corporate body to which you formerly belonged
The receiving of eternal life speaks of what one has entered into; it does not speak of what one has come out of
Most people pay much attention to their personal salvation, but the question before us is what are they saved from
He said, 'My work will never grow, because once a person believes in the Lord, he has to be sent away immediately
You need to confess before God and before men that you have come out and have nothing to do with that corporate body
Be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit'
If a person believes in his heart but does not have any outward gesture, the world will still consider him to be part of it
Recently, when we baptized some people in Foochow, a brother said, 'We do not like to conduct the baptism meeting in such a messy way
If this is the case, John the Baptist would have to learn from this brother because John conducted baptisms that were not that orderly
Eternal life is something that our spirit gains before God, but salvation is an act of our separation from the world
When we step into the water of baptism or when we look back after being believers for many years we must remember that we are already dead
In the murder spoken of above, the murderer apparently killed only the mother; he did not kill the two children
As soon as this gospel is preached to us, we should learn to look from God's viewpoint and acknowledge that we have died in the Lord
Reckoning in Romans 6 involves both reckoning oneself dead in Christ Jesus and reckoning oneself alive in Him as well
Even the Epistles which touch on our wrongdoings in the past mainly tell us what we should do hereafter not what we should do about our past
John answered, 'He who has two tunics, let him share with the one who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise'
John replied, 'Extort nothing from anyone by force, nor take anything by false accusation, and be content with your wages'
But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God'
The emphasis here is not on dealing with the past, because we have a Savior who has already dealt with all our past
It does not tell us how to deal with our past falsehood but that henceforth we should no longer remain in falsehood
Man is not saved by repentance for his past bad deeds, just as he is not saved by trusting in his past good deeds
Unless one is pressed by special occasion or circumstance, it is inadvisable to go near or purposely tour any temple
Even at the pulpit, we should carefully avoid the names of other gods except in the case of a necessary illustration
If you cannot take a strong stand against idols today, you will have a hard time escaping the greatest idol on earth in the future
Please remember that you cannot worship any idols; you must reject all of them, even images of the Lord Jesus and Mary
If all the brothers and sisters take care of this matter, they will not fall into the hands of Roman Catholicism in the future
In some countries artists often look for people who resemble their idea of Jesus and then pay them to pose for portraits of Jesus
The Holy Spirit moved in such a strong way that the Ephesians brought out all the improper books in their possession
Apart from the kind of objects mentioned above, there are many other questionable objects that need to be dealt with
Some garments may be too short, and we can lengthen them; others are odd-looking, and we can make them look more inconspicuous
We must realize that being a Christian is a very practical matter it is not just a matter of going to church and listening to some sermons
Zaccheus did not do this as a result of doctrinal teaching; he did this as a result of the working of the Holy Spirit
If it had been the result of doctrinal teaching, only the exact amount would have been repaid, no more and no less
Since it was the working of the Holy Spirit, the amount could vary; it could be a little more or a little less
Suppose that before you became a believer, you had extorted or defrauded others, stolen from them, or obtained things by improper means
His fourfold restoration went far beyond what he owed, thus shutting the mouths of others and restoring his testimony
There are hundreds and thousands of items of unfinished business in our families, with our fathers, and in our lives
It means that they should not wait until they have settled all their earthly matters before coming to the Lord
Even if he is unaware of this loss, you should still confess to him, especially when material loss is involved
Although consecration is the first basic experience of our service to God we do not find many direct teachings from Gods Word concerning it
According to the original language the word constrained can be translated pressed on from all sides that is tightly confined on all sides
After a person has been constrained by the Lord's love and has acknowledged His right, there is a further step that he should take
In some instances in the Old Testament, the Chinese Union Version translates the word consecration as 'the receiving of the holy service'
Only the members of this household-the household of Aaron-were qualified to be priests, and only they could consecrate themselves
Initially, only the members of Aaron's household could consecrate themselves; if anyone else came near, he would have been put to death
Those who consider that they are doing God a favor by forsaking all are but outsiders; they are not consecrated at all
It is not a matter of offering ourselves to God's work, but a matter of God being gracious to us and giving us a portion of His work
At the same time, while the Lord Jesus was on the cross, the veil was rent from top to bottom, bringing us into the Holy of Holies
The sin offering stops at the propitiation of sin, but the burnt offering brings the sinner further by making him acceptable to God
Since God has accepted us in Christ, we should acknowledge the blood's separation of our ears, hands, and feet fully unto God
We apply the blood upon the tip of our right ear, the thumb of our right hand, and the big toe of our right foot
When Aaron's hands were filled and his hands could no longer hold anything except the Lord, there was consecration
From this day forward, our ears will listen for the Lord, our hands will work for the Lord, and our feet will run for the Lord
As soon as a person consecrates himself, he must realize that from that point on, the Lord's requirement comes first
Once a person has believed in the Lord, he should not keep the matter a secret; he has to confess the Lord with his mouth
If he cannot say 'daddy' and 'mommy' when he is young, he probably will not be able to say it for the rest of his life
Romans 10:10 says, 'For with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation'
Once you put out this signboard, your colleagues, classmates, relatives, and family will know the kind of person you are
In John 9 the Jews made a decision: Whoever confessed Jesus to be the Christ would be put out of the synagogue
Perhaps they felt uneasy about confessing the Lord, but they felt even more uneasy about not confessing the Lord
As a genuine believer, you will surely offend your conscience if you pretend and sympathize with the Lord's opposers
When others oppose the Lord, you have no peace in your heart, yet you must force yourself to say, 'What you are saying is interesting'
They think that having good behavior is the most important thing for a Christian and that confession with the mouth is not that crucial
We have heard people say that if they have good outward conduct, there is no need for them to say anything with their mouth
Please remember that no one will bother to criticize those who say this if they fail slightly in their personal conduct
If a man stands up to proclaim that he is a Christian others will immediately criticize and rebuke him when there is any slip in his conduct
We can tell such ones that if they do not confess because they are afraid of stumbling or failing, they will surely fail
When we buy a watch, we want to use it for five or ten years; no one buys a watch with the view of throwing it away
After praying about it, he went to the other one and shook his hand tightly and said, 'I am a very timid person
If you tell others that you are engaged in technical research, they will congratulate you for having a good future
You are not ashamed to talk about other things, but as soon as you confess your Christian faith, you feel ashamed within
It is true that the world feels shameful about someone becoming a Christian, but we must overcome this feeling
On the one hand, we have to realize that when the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He bore our sins as well as our shame
The humiliation we suffer before man can never be compared with the humiliation our Lord suffered on the cross for us
On the other hand, there is a good hymn which says, 'Our shyness is like the early morning sky disowning the sun!
If that is a shame, then all the grace we have received should also be considered a shame to us, and we should deny it all!
We should feel shameful for such things as carousing, drunkenness, unrestrained dissipation, works of darkness, sinning, and evil works
They may be beaten, burned alive, or thrown into the lions' den, but they still proclaim, 'I belong to Jesus the Nazarene'
We would rather suffer humiliation with Christ as Moses did, which humiliation is far better than the glories of men
We cannot be like those rulers who, for the sake of their love for the synagogue, refused to confess their faith in the Lord Jesus
It is difficult for Him to confess us because we are prodigal sons who have come home, and there is nothing good in us
The Bible uses four different places to represent the world and shows how God's people come out from these different aspects of the world
Whether or not you will perish does not depend on your family's status or your behavior; it depends on whether you have the blood
They ate their meal quickly, with their loins girded and their staff in their hands, because they had to leave immediately
Once the angel of destruction has done his work of separating the saved from the perishing, the saved ones must leave
When they need salvation, they trust in the blood of the Lamb; but after they are saved by the blood, they settle down firmly in Egypt
The separation of the blood separates the living from the dead; it also separates the children of God from the people of the world
When the Israelites first wanted to leave Egypt, Pharaoh only allowed the strong men to go; the young and the old had to stay back
He knew that if a person served God in Egypt, he would not have a testimony and he would have to serve Pharaoh in the end
Satan is quite familiar with the words in Matthew 6:21: 'For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also'
Just to confess the Lord with our mouth and say, 'I have believed in the Lord today,' is not enough for a testimony
While a believer is living on this earth, the world is a journey to him; when he dies, the world is only a tomb in which he is buried
The world wants to be closer to us, but if we allow it to come too close to us, it will be impossible for us to serve God
The world wants to keep our people and our treasure, but if these things are kept in the world, we will not be able to serve our God
Before we touch any specific item, we should realize that our heart and spirit are the first things that need separation from the world
We must stay away from things that the worldly people, the Egyptians, consider inappropriate for Christians to do
If we are not treated the same as our Master something is wrong with us and something is definitely wrong in our relationship with the Lord
Our relationship with the world must be compatible with our Lord's relationship with the world; we cannot take a different way
We only need to ask What is my relationship with this matter and what was the Lord Jesus relationship with it while He was on the earth
Anything that is not on the same ground as the Lord or that stands against the Lord is the world, and we must depart from it
Many things appear to be very good to our eyes, but they quench the fire within us after we touch them once or twice
Any kind of social function, communication, or activity that causes us to hide our lamp under the bushel is the world
Many of God's children are gradually sucked into the world through indiscriminate social activities and contacts
It is not the words of the strong Christian but the words of the weak Christian that should determine what we should or should not do
He might have been clear about what he was doing, but others who followed him may not have known what he was doing
The words Almighty God in the Old Testament are also Elshadai, which should be translated as 'the All-sufficient God'
Many people do not feel the excellency of the Lord when they come to Him because they have not counted all things as refuse
Twenty or more years ago, when our testimony first began, six to eight out of ten persons who were saved had no thought of joining a church
They thought that it was good enough to be a Christian by themselves and that there was no need to join a church
You may think this is a very strange thought, but according to our experience, quite a number of people think this way
When a person is saved, he should see that there is an individual aspect as well as a corporate aspect to his Christian life
On the individual side, he has received the Lord's life, and he can fellowship with the Lord and pray by himself
During the two thousand years of church history, many people have thought that they could be believers individually
Of all, God's Word tells us that when a person is saved, he becomes a member of God's household; he becomes God's child
Once a person is born again, he is born into God's family, and he becomes God's child together with many other children of God
After a person believes in the Lord, he receives not only an individual life but also a life that is related to many other people
It is a strange thing for anyone to have no affection for his own brothers and sisters or to have no desire to communicate with them!
We can say that if a stone is not joined to other stones to be God's dwelling place, it will lose its function and spiritual riches
Brothers, we must see that we are the building material the Holy Spirit is using for the building of God's dwelling place
As soon as you believe in the Lord, spontaneously there is an inclination within you to contact other children of God
Many sober-minded persons will not automatically accept your church just because you have introduced them to the Lord
When a certain need arises in a certain place, certain individuals are raised up to emphasize certain teachings
There are over fifteen hundred different kinds of churches, and these are only the orthodox ones, the ones which are well established
Consider what happened in China: The Nestorians first established their churches in the Tang Dynasty during their evangelization of China
Now we have the churches of the Tang Dynasty, the churches of the Ming Dynasty, and the churches of the Ching Dynasty
Now we have another big group-the Brethren, in addition to the Nestorians, the Roman Catholics, and the Protestants
There is no doubt that there are distinctions between churches in the Bible, but there is one, and only one, kind of distinction
If there is only one side to a truth and you make a mistake about it, it means that you are very foolish and blind
Some passages in the Bible say that justification is by faith, while other passages say that justification is by works
After reading these portions of the Scripture, we should be quite clear about what the Bible says concerning this matter
We can only have 'the churches in Fukien,' not 'the church in Fukien'; to have such would make the church bigger than its locality
Brothers, we must be clear that the church cannot be named after a person, a doctrine, a system, or the place of its origin
As long as you belong to the Lord and are begotten by Him, you are already in the church; there is no need for you to join
You cannot join a church by signing a document, sitting for an examination, writing your resolution, or making up your mind
You have to seek the fellowship of the members, the fellowship of the Body, and learn to serve God properly in the church
Today, if God's children are only baptized without experiencing the laying on of hands, their experience is not complete
The Bible shows us clearly that the foundation of the word of Christ includes baptism and the laying on of hands
If we have received baptism without receiving the laying on of hands, we are short of this foundation in our pursuit of the Lord
The error of the church today is altogether different from the error the Hebrew believers fell into at that time
The Hebrew believers already had laid the foundation yet they wanted to lay the same foundation again and again thus going about in circles
The apostle told the Hebrew believers to leave the word of the beginning of Christ and strive to be brought on to maturity
If the laying on of hands, as another part of the foundation, is missing, trouble will also arise down the road
If part of the foundation is missing, it must be completed before he can proceed with the rest of the building
If we have to put ourselves in the fire, does this not mean that God's demand is more severe than Molech's demand?
When Jacob laid his hands on his two grandsons, he put one hand on each of his grandsons' heads and blessed them
After we have believed in the Lord and are baptized, why do we need the apostles as representatives of the Body to come and lay hands on us?
When God poured His Spirit upon Him and endued Him with the Spirit, God did not pour the Spirit upon Him individually
Many people are deprived of any blessing because they come to God alone, hoping to receive the Holy Spirit and the anointing by themselves
Today a person enjoys the anointing because of his position in the Body, not because of his condition before God
When an apostles hand is upon your head it is not only the church that is laying hands on you but also Christ who is laying His hands on you
You have to come under the headship; you have to submit to the authority of the Head along with all the other children of God
The apostles in Jerusalem heard of this and sent Peter and John to Samaria to pray for the Holy Spirit to come upon them
Baptism is a declaration that we have forsaken the world, whereas the laying on of hands is a declaration that we have entered the Body
Since we are in the Body, we need to be identified with all the children of God and need to submit to the authority of the Head
If we put our entire being under the authority of the Head, we will experience the flowing of the anointing within
At that very moment a marvelous thing happened: The Holy Spirit descended upon them and the anointing flowed to them
During one of his evangelistic journeys, Paul arrived in Ephesus, where he met twelve disciples who had received only the baptism of John
Thank and praise God that when the anointing oil flowed down from the Head, we received it because we are in the Body
Cornelius's house was an exception because after Pentecost, all the apostles thought that the Lord's grace was confined to the Jews
Cornelius's household had indeed believed, but Peter dared not baptize them for fear that the brothers who were with him might not accept it
At this point the Lord poured down the Spirit upon the Gentilesbefore they were baptized and before they had received the laying on of hands
When Peter went back, he could say boldly, 'I only said a few words; the gospel was not even clearly presented
Baptism is to forsake the world and enter into Christ, whereas the laying on of hands is to receive the anointing
Later, when Paul returned from Gentile lands to the church in Jerusalem, an argument followed concerning the Gentiles
If we do this, the anointing will be manifested in our living and our work spontaneously, and we will have a way to go on before the Lord
Corinthians 12:13 says, 'For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free'
There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus'
From these three portions of the Scripture, we see that all believers are one in Christ, and all of their distinctions have been abolished
Following this there are differences between male and female, barbarians and Scythians, and circumcision and uncircumcision
According to the apostle Paul, no matter what differences there are among men, we all have been made one in Christ
If we bring our personal status and position into the new man, we will make the new man old because these distinctions belong to the old man
They are the descendants of Abraham, the chosen people of God; they are the only nation established by God on earth
Instead of humbling themselves before God and exalting Him, they are proud and boast of themselves before other races
He needed to see a vision three times and had to hear the Lord say three times, 'Rise up, Peter; slay and eat'!
Peter and the others told Paul and Barnabas to go freely to the Gentiles and assured them that they would all remain in the same fellowship
Whether one is a Chinese believer an English believer an Indian believer or a Japanese believer he has become a brother or sister in Christ
If a brother or a sister introduces such a thing among us, it means that he or she is bringing in a foreign element
The moment we bring such a thing into the church, the church becomes an organization of the flesh and no longer the Body of Christ
Though we are Chinese and under the jurisdiction of our country, this relationship ceases when we are in Christ
After this introduction, a brother from England stood up and said, 'We are not English brothers; we are brothers from England'
How can there be an English brother, an American brother, a French sister, or an Italian sister in the house of God?
Our generation has probably never experienced the sharp class separation which exists between the free man and the slave
If a master felt that the children of a slave were eating too much, he could bring the children to the market and sell them
Profitability was measured by the number of children one produced; those who produced more were sold for a better price
If one killed a slave, he merely needed to negotiate the monetary worth of the slave with the master and pay accordingly
If Philemon brought Onesimus to the meeting of the church, one would call Onesimus Philemon's brother, not his slave
Whenever we kneel down to pray or discuss spiritual matters, our status is changed, and there is no class distinction between us
We cannot introduce any class relationship into the church, because such a relationship does not exist in the church
He said when a rich man comes, he is given a better seat, and when a poor man comes, he is told to stand or be seated at the footstool
The fourth distinction that has been abolished in Christ is that of gender, that is, the distinction between male and female
In Christ and in the new man, both the man and the woman have the same stand; there is no distinction between them
Every case in the Bible where the Chinese version translates 'sons and daughters,' the original word is children
Historically, when one speaks of religion, he thinks of the Jews, and when one speaks of philosophy, he thinks of the Greeks
Those who walk according to the mind can be Christians, and those who walk according to feelings can also be Christians
Since all kinds of people can be Christians, one must learn to drop ethnic characteristics when he comes into the church
If you consult Greek literature, you will see that the Scythians were a respected people, while the barbarians were a despised people
If you put a typical English gentleman beside an African native, the difference in culture will become very obvious
Unlike the American who is so particular about his creature comfort, the Jew is not particular about food or lodging
It is difficult for a person with a polished culture to see eye to eye with one who has a seemingly unpolished culture
When we contact each other in Christ and love one another in Christ, there is nothing that cannot be tolerated
We should not allow anything to come between God's children, to differentiate the brothers and sisters in Christ from one another
They think that only those who are circumcised are under God's covenant, while those who are not circumcised are not under His covenant
If they are used to separate God's children, they will lose their spiritual significance and become mere marks of the flesh
Do not think that we disagree with baptism by immersion, the breaking of bread, the head covering, or the laying on of hands
If a person has the spiritual reality of something but is unconcerned about its physical symbol, we should not isolate him because of this
As long as they have the spiritual reality, we should be satisfied with our spiritual oneness and should not insist on the symbols
Paul stated quite clearly that circumcision is not for the purification of fleshly blemishes but for the removal of fleshly activities
You cannot set yourselves apart from others just because you are obedient to the Lord with respect to certain physical symbols
If God wants to speak something to others through us, He will also do it on the basis of what He has spoken in the past
If we do not know what God has said in the past, He cannot speak through us to others, and we are useless in the eyes of God
If we read the Bible carefully, we will find the New Testament expressions in the Lord,in Christ,in Christ Jesus, etc
When we analyze and compare the Scriptures in this way, looking to God for enlightenment, we will see something
In reading Romans we find the words Christ Jesus, which mean that the Christ today is the very Jesus who was on earth in the past
Through His death and resurrection, God has made Him the Christ, and God has joined us to Him through the Spirit
Following His death and resurrection, the Lord said that He would come back to them and that God would give them the Holy Spirit
After a little while they would see Him no longer, but then they would see Him again, and He would abide in them
If it had been plural it would have referred to the many children of Abraham that is the Jews and the meaning would be completely different
If he cannot discover any facts and if he reads through the Bible in a hasty and mindless way, he will not understand much
He should rather spend a few months to read through the whole Bible and familiarize himself with it in a general way
In familiarizing himself with the Bible, he should read the whole book chapter by chapter, consecutively over and over again
Those who have just received the Lord should learn to read the Bible and remember the number of times they have read through it
It is good to write a letter to notify a more elderly brother the first time you have finished reading through the New Testament
Those who are more advanced in the Lord should pay attention to the way the newly saved ones read their Bibles
If a person reads his Bible according to the above way, after some time his knowledge of the Bible will increase
We have not seen a brother or sister who studies for three hours a day who can maintain this schedule for long
There are twenty-eight different ways to study the Bible, which are covered in the book The Ways to Study the Bible
If you decide to dedicate twenty minutes of your time each day to this kind of study, do not prolong or shorten it
There are many special terms like reconciliation, blood, faith, joy, peace,hope, love, obedience, righteousness, redemption, mercy, etc
Write down all the materials you have gathered, and from these write down the main words and meanings of each passage
In writing down 'sealed with the Holy Spirit' in 1:13, you should also write down the meaning of the word seal
By paraphrasing the Bible with simple words, we express a passage in a way that others can understand at a glance
Do it properly and intelligently so that you can understand it and so that other brothers and sisters who read it can understand it as well
After you have tried one book, you will know how precious the experience is and how profitable the exercise is
After you finish a book, go back and revise your work once or twice, modifying it with appropriate words and polishing your sentences
If we have been a Christian for three to five years without receiving one answer to prayer, we are ineffectual Christians
Prayer is so simple that the moment a person believes in the Lord, he can start praying and have his prayers answered
It is useless to spend an hour or two hours or even eight or ten days before the Lord without asking for anything
When you seek something specific, you will not be satisfied with just anything; you want that particular thing
While God often gives us 'superabundantly above all that we ask or think' , asking evilly is a different matter
If a person has obvious and known sins in his heart, yet is unwilling to drop or part with them, the Lord will not answer his prayer
The moment we begin our Christian life, we have to ask for the Lord's grace to keep us from falling and to sanctify us in our conduct
Proverbs 28:13 says, 'He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: / but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy'
Even if you do not ask evilly, the Lord will not answer your prayer as long as you keep back a favorite sin and regard it in your heart
The Lord Jesus said, 'All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them'
We hope that as soon as a person has received the Lord, even a week after his conversion, he will know what faith is
They pray to the Lord that the mountain be taken up and cast into the sea, and they believe that it will be so
Not only do new believers need to learn this, but even those who have been believers for many years need to learn this
If he says, 'I believe the Lord will surely heal my sickness,' he will probably need to try harder to 'believe'
Let us look at Mark 9:21-23, which says, 'And He questioned his father, How long has this been happening to him?
Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise and take up your mat and walk'?
The Lord was showing them that to man it was a question of whether or not one could do it, but to God it was a question of which was easier
Whether or not God can do something is not the question here; rather, it is a question of whether or not God is willing
Faith is not just believing that God can and will do something but also believing that God has done something already
Many people's prayers are not answered because they are not clear about this point; they still hope that they will receive something
Perhaps, you have prayed continually for three or five days, a month, or even a year, and still your hands are empty
Simply put the first stage is to pray from nothing to having faith and the second stage is to praise from having faith to actually receiving
Many Christians have the experience that as soon as their prayer strikes faith, they can no longer continue to pray
Another point about prayer which requires attention is that we must persevere in prayer and never stop praying
Please count how many of your prayers have been offered for the second time, the third time, the fifth time, or the tenth time
The third column should record the date the prayer is answered, and the fourth column should record how God answers the prayer
In this way one will find out how many things he asks God for in a year how many prayers God answers and what prayers are still unanswered
The advantage of writing things down in a prayer-book is that it shows us whether or not God is answering our prayers
It is good for Christians to be zealous in serving the Lord, but such service is useless if their prayers are not answered
Any item that has been recorded in the book, but has not received an answer, should be followed up by persistent prayer
In using the prayer-book, note that some items require daily prayer while others require prayer only once a week
If there are many items, you can arrange for certain items to be prayed over on Mondays and others to be prayed over on Tuesdays
He must learn the lesson of prayer well before he can have a deeper knowledge of God and a fruitful future for himself
Many children of God lead a sick life, not because they have spiritual problems, but because they rise up too late
Many children of God have no lack in consecration, zeal, or love, but they cannot live a normal Christian life because they rise up too late
Many people have been Christians for years, yet they fail to live a proper Christian life because they rise up too late
The moment we believe in the Lord, we should set apart the early morning for fellowshipping with God and for contacting Him
Every one of them had the habit of waking early in the morning and fellowshipping with God early in the morning
Any brother or sister who wants to follow the Lord must never think that there is little difference in rising up an hour early
Although one may spend the same amount of time in reading the Bible, an hour's difference will produce very different results
One brother was asked at least fifty times during his first three years as a Christian, 'What time did you get up this morning'?
How about the servants of God who are not mentioned in the Bible, like George Muller, John Wesley, and many other famous servants of God?
We can give it another name, but no matter what name we give to it, meeting God early in the morning is a very crucial matter
To fellowship means to open up our spirit and our mind to God and allow Him to enlighten us, speak to us, impress us, and touch us
Read a single portion of the Bible carefully, always mingling your reading with unceasing communion with God and singing
If you maintain this practice before God every morning, you will be filled after some time, and God's word will dwell in you richly
After one fellowships, praises, and eats manna, he has strength and can present everything in prayer before God
After you do this for a few days, you will not want to go back to sleep even if your mind is telling you to do so
Those who are not advised by doctors to stay in bed and who are not really sick should rise up early in the morning
It is unfortunate that some have been Christians for years and yet have never enjoyed the blessing of early rising
If more brothers and sisters will come together to learn this lesson and if everyone will rise up early in the morning the church will grow
If every brother and sister takes this way, there will be many containers before God, and we will be richer and richer as the days go by
If we all learn to rise up early, and if we all maintain this habit, we will have a bright spiritual future ahead of us
It seems that unless two or three people pray, or all the brothers and sisters come together to pray, God will not answer
We have two kinds of answers to prayers: One is answer to individual prayers, and the other is answer to assembly prayers
Many brothers and sisters can testify that they understand more of God's Word in the meeting than when they study it individually
If we do not meet with others, the most we can have is individual grace; we will miss a great part of the corporate grace
After that they continued steadfastly in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers
If all the called out ones are separated from one another, we will not have the church; the church will not be produced
After we have believed in the Lord there is a basic need we must take care of, that is, to come together with other children of God
Chapter twelve speaks of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and chapter fourteen also speaks of the gifts of the Holy Spirit
According to these two chapters, it seems that the mutual functioning of the members of the Body is expressed in the meeting
There was sunlight in the outer court, and there was the lamp with olive oil burning before the veil in the Holy Place
The more compelling and powerful presence is experienced only in the meeting; we cannot experience such a presence individually
Although individually we can have the Lord's presence, this presence is never as great or as powerful as His presence in the meetings
We have to learn to meet together with the brothers and sisters because it is in the meeting that we experience the Lord's special presence
It is impossible to find a 'self-taught' Christian who can experience this kind of powerful presence of the Lord
We do not go to a meeting to visit certain brothers or sisters, nor do we go because we are attracted by certain brothers or sisters
They have a message in their heart which they want to preach, and they must speak it when they come to the meeting
They have a hymn in their heart which they like to sing, and they will do anything to find an opportunity to sing it
In the meeting, if we take care of the needs of others and try to build up others, the Holy Spirit will be honored
Your speaking must be for the benefit of the meeting, and your silence must also be for the benefit of the meeting
We need to learn to speak for the purpose of building up others and we need to learn to be silent also for the purpose of building up others
If you are not sure whether your speaking will build up others, the best thing to do is to check with more experienced brothers
Whenever we meet and whenever we fellowship with one another mutually, we should remember that, as believers, we are one in Christ
There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus'
There cannot be any distinctions because we have put on the new man; we are being constituted into one new man
In the new man there cannot be Greek or Jew, circumcision or uncircumcision, barbarian or Scythian, slave or free man
The Jews should not boast that they are descendants of Abraham and God's chosen people, and they should not despise all foreigners
If you bring the idea of kinship and regional flavor into the church, you do not know what the church of Christ is
Often the church suffers because many people try to bring their natural flavor and peculiar traits into the church
Whether you are quick or quiet cold or warm intellectual or emotional once you become a brother or a sister you must put off these things
When you bring your disposition and temperament into the church, you will make yourself the standard and the criteria
Those who get along with your character will be deemed right and those who do not get along with your character will be deemed wrong
Paul wrote the Epistles of 1 Corinthians, Galatians, and Colossians during the Roman era when slavery was practiced
In Christ and in the new man, the male and the female have the same status; there is no distinction between them
Bread-breaking and the laying on of hands have spiritual meanings, but they can also become marks of piety in the flesh
We may use these things to separate God's children, boasting about marks which others do not have, and the result is disunity
If we do this, we have downgraded these matters from their spiritual level and made them mere physical marks in the flesh
If we differentiate between God's children based on these things, we have made distinctions according to the flesh
God's children should not allow physical marks to damage the oneness in the Lord and the oneness in the new man
If we do this, there will be no division in the meeting of the church of God and in the fellowship between the saints
We have to pay attention to these matters in the meeting, and we have to live out such a life in our daily walk
In the four Gospels, Acts, and the beginning of church history, the gospel meeting was always a very important meeting
The church exists on earth not only for the purpose of building up itself but also so that others might know Christ
As far as the building up of the church is concerned, the gift of the evangelist can be relegated the last place
The rest of the saints should pray in one accord for the speaking brothers, that the latter may release the gospel with power
Many brothers and sisters who attend the gospel meeting forget that the testifying brother is not testifying to them but to the unbelievers
If the speaker mentions a word or term that requires explanation, you have to explain it to your friend softly
Another brother went over to him and said, 'These people do not know who the Israelites are; nor do they know anything about Egypt'
Your eyes must be fixed on them, and you must pray for them, saying, 'Lord, move his heart and make him understand
Many times the brother on the podium will say the very words that you have prayed for, as if he has heard your petition
Satan works in men's hearts to hinder them from receiving the Lord, while we are trying to push them to believe from their heart
When the brother at the podium invites people to receive the Lord, we have to observe our friends' reactions closely
Mark down the area, the street, and the street numbers of their homes so that others can find them when they want to visit them
When the church arranges for visitation, you have to accompany the brothers and sisters to your friends' house and talk to them
Everyone is responsible, and everyone should actively advance the gospel and bring people to salvation in one accord
In other words, chapter eleven emphasizes our remembrance of the Lord, while chapter ten emphasizes our fellowship among God's children
Another is centered on the bread on the table, which signifies us, the children of God, having fellowship with each other
In other words, the first section of salvation has to do with the Lord, and the second section has to do with the Father
During the first part of the bread-breaking meeting, all our hymns, thanksgiving, and praises should be directed toward the Lord
In other words, the first section is our remembrance of the Lord, and the second section is the Lord bringing us to the Father to praise Him
On the day the Lord Jesus resurrected, He said to Mary, 'I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God'
In earlier chapters in the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus addressed the Father as 'My Father' or just 'Father'
The meeting spoken of in Hebrews 2 is the meeting of the firstborn Son with the many sons singing praises to the Father
The second part of the bread-breaking meeting is precisely this meeting of the firstborn Son with the many sons
The gospel meeting and the bread-breaking meeting are important meetings, and the prayer meeting is also important
If two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens
We may pray specifically for a brother or a sister, or we may pray specifically for sickness among the brothers and sisters
If there is still time after we have prayed thoroughly over one subject, we can bring up another subject for prayer
Please remember that the cross was the work of the Son of God, while Pentecost was the work of the children of God
In order for the prayer meeting to be strong, all the prayers have to be genuine; no prayer should be artificial
We do not need to speak many words before God in the prayer meeting, as if God knows nothing and needs to be informed of all the details
On the other hand, we have to pray as if we were alone before God; we have to pray to God in a genuine way according to our needs
The Lord Jesus then said, 'For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it shall be opened'
Of course, prayer in the meeting is a little different; it should not be exactly the same as your personal prayer
If you go to a prayer meeting and constantly use words that you do not use in your private prayers, your prayers are bound to be artificial
As far as accomplishing anything is concerned, the prayer in the meeting is always more effective than private prayers
Today we receive more answers to private prayers than assembly prayers because there are too many false and vain prayers in the meeting
There should be more answers to corporate prayers than answers to individual prayers; there should be not only more but very much more
If Gods children come together and everyone prays in a simple specific genuine and harmonious way there will be more answers to our prayers
We cannot function according to what we do not have; we can only function according to the gifts that we do have
For this reason, a locality cannot insist on having a meeting for the exercise of the gifts; nor can it imitate other churches in any way
If there is only speaking in tongues without the interpretation of tongues, the mind will be unfruitful, and the church will not be built up
Only the speaking of the gifted ones will render supply to the brothers and sisters; not everyone can do the same thing
Unfortunately, the gifted brothers who have the ministry often have an improper attitude towards such meetings
In such a meeting, all the gifted brothers should bear the responsibility to seek before the Lord for something to speak
They must open their mouths more when they are being encouraged and open their mouths less when they are reminded to stop
The responsible brothers in the church must not only perfect the more advanced ones but also constantly look for new gifts
The fifth type of meeting may not be as crucial as the other meetings, but it is used equally by God to release His word to the saints
A meeting where people come to listen to the word is the simplest kind of meeting, but like other meetings, there is much to be learned
If you have some physical handicap in listening or seeing, explain to the ushers so that they can choose a suitable seat for you
It is impossible for a speaker to try to deliver a message to closed hearts or to those who purposely reject the message
Twenty-five hundred years later, God gave the seventh day to man as the Sabbath day and told man to rest on this day
A man who does not rest is one who thinks that he can work and act by himself; he thinks that he does not need God's work
On the Sabbath the Lord Jesus went to the synagogue and read the Scripture ; He went to the synagogue and taught people
It does not say that the Lord Jesus resurrected on the seventh day but that He resurrected on the first day of the week
Here is a wonderful thing: God has made Him-'the stone which the builders rejected'-'the head of the corner,' that is, the foundation
Verse 24 tells us something more wonderful: 'This is the day that Jehovah has made; / Let us exult and rejoice in it'
The day that Jehovah has made is the very day in which the stone, rejected by the builders, became the head of the corner
Verse 11 says, 'The stone which was considered as nothing by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner'
The special characteristic of the Lord's Day is that there is only a positive charge; there are no negative commandments
The beginning of the new creation was on the first of the seven days, which clearly and plainly signifies a new beginning
The Lord Jesus resurrected on the first day of the week, and that whole week completely belongs to the new creation
The writings of the early church fathers give us ample proof that 'the Lord's Day' refers to the first day of the week
Some say that Christians in the second and third centuries met on the Sabbath day and only changed to the Lord's Day in the fourth century
The rejecting of the stone by the builders and its becoming the cornerstone refer to the Lord's crucifixion and resurrection
The rejection of the Jews was the rejection of the builders, and the Lord's resurrection was His becoming the cornerstone
According to the original text, the first day of the week here does not refer to the first day of a certain particular week
At that time all the churches spontaneously gathered together to break bread in remembrance of the Lord on the first day of the week
We cannot refrain from forgiving those whom He forgave, and we cannot refrain from remembering those whom He remembers
On this day it is a most spontaneous thing for us to remember all those who have become the new creation together with us
There was bread-breaking to remember the Lord, and there was the collection for the saints on the first day of the week
On the one hand, we remember how the Lord gave Himself for us, and on the other hand, we also have to give to the Lord on this day
A thanksgiving offering in the form of material goods should be included in the thanksgiving and praise which we offer to Him
Offering material goods to the Lord on His day is something that we should start practicing the moment we believe
We hope that the brothers and sisters will enjoy the Lord's grace abundantly and serve Him properly on this day
If we do this from our youth, we will be able to say after seventy years that we have given ten years fully to the Lord
We see from the above sources that the keeping of the Lord's Day began from the time of the apostles and the church fathers
In addition to the Psalms, the Song of Songs, and Lamentations, there are also songs in the history and the commandments
If a Christian walks noisily into the meeting and has no concern for others, he is not behaving like a well-tempered Christian
If a person walks into a meeting and runs over others left and right, knocking over chairs, he is not behaving like a person of song
We must realize that from the day we were saved, God has been training us to have fine and tender feelings day by day
We are putting human errors into their hand when they go before the Lord; we are ushering them into an improper sentiment
God does not meet us according to the poetic sentiment of the hymn; He meets us according to the truth conveyed in the hymn
Hebrews 9:14 says that the Lord Jesus' blood purifies our conscience-the conscience is part of the heart, not the heart itself
The biblical teaching concerning the heart is that our stony heart is removed and that God gives to us a heart of flesh
If we go to the Lord and praise Him, saying, 'The blood of Jesus cleanses my heart,' our praise is not according to the truth
They express a hope to be saved, a desire to be saved, and a pursuit of salvation, but there is no Christian assurance whatsoever
Many hymns give people the impression that God's grace is still far off and that a man still needs to seek for it
In reading it, we find David's repentance doctrinally correct, his words carefully chosen, and the structure of the psalm intricate
More than that, we feel something within the words; there is a spiritual reality, a spiritual feeling, within the psalm
Many times in reading the book of Psalms, there is something we are struck with-every sentiment expressed in these psalms is genuine
A hymn must be not only accurate in truth and poetic in form and structure, but also filled with the sense of spiritual reality
We cannot sing a hymn on repentance without having a corresponding echo in our heart; we cannot be laughing while we are singing it
We cannot say that a hymn calls for prostration and brokenness before God, yet remain comfortable and proud of ourselves
At the same time, it must invoke the singer to the spiritual reality behind the words, that is, to touch what the hymn says
In singing it, we feel as if we are being lifted up to the universal stage in Revelation 4 and 5, the scene after the Lord's ascension
The heaven is filled with glory, and at the name of Jesus, ten thousand voices begin their praise, and ten thousand knees bow to worship
And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea and all things in them' respond together
Spontaneously this brings out Philippians 2:11: 'And every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord'
Once the writer of the hymn touches the Father and the Son, he brings out the doctrine of the Son and the doctrine of the Father
The fourth stanza turns from the Son to the Father and then from the Father back to the Son; it begins with the Son and ends with the Son
The first line says, 'If there's less of earth joy,' while the fifth line says, 'If sweet earthly ties, Lord, / Break
Since stanza two reaches the climax, stanza three turns into a prayer: 'Lonely though the pathway, / Cheer it with Thy smile'
We can classify the hymns into four categories: the gospel trumpet; words of praise; Christ as life; and the church life
If God blesses these hymns the hidden needs of the sinners will be touched and they will see their own condition as well as Gods salvation
The very day we were saved, we received heavenly joy, and thanksgiving and praises swelled from within us toward heaven
Since His resurrection and ascension, His body is the church, and now He wants to be expressed through the church
After becoming believers our pursuit turns to the knowledge and experience of the life of Christ we seek to live out the life of this Christ
It includes everything related to our Christian walk, the everyday experience, environment, work, and affairs of a Christian
Colossians 316 says Teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to God
When the church gathers together, we should choose hymns which are directed toward God; our hearts must be directed toward God
When we engage ourselves in work or when we address the saints or sinners the hymns function as part of the preaching and we sing toward men
When we are by ourselves or when there are individual needs, we can use the hymns that are meant for ourselves
As far as we know, there are three ways to sing in the Bible: congregational singing, mutual singing, and solo singing
On the last night the Lord and the disciples were together, Matthew 26:30 says, 'After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives'
Corinthians 14:26 says, 'Each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation'
The audience must not pay too much attention to the tune; they should try their best to receive the supply from the spirit
At the beginning, if you cannot sing, you can hum a few tunes every morning, or you can make up simple tunes to hum to the hymn
He appointed Levites to play psalteries and harps to exalt, thank, and praise God before the ark of His covenant
When Solomon completed the building of Jehovah's temple, the priests carried the ark of the covenant into the Holy of Holies
In the Psalms we can touch the most wounded feelings, and in the Psalms we also can find the greatest and highest praises
God desires much more to see His people writing psalms and praising Him when they 'walk through the valley of the shadow of death'
Hebrews 1315 says Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God that is the fruit of lips confessing His name
In other words, God inflicts wounds; He breaks and cuts a person deeply, yet at the same time, such a person turns to Him and praises Him
If we have not learned to praise God every day, it is hard to have the kind of sacrifice of praise spoken of in Hebrews 13
At that very moment, you should remember that Jehovah's throne has not changed, His name has not changed, and His glory has not changed
You realize that God's throne is established in the heavens and cannot be shaken, and you do not hold back your praise
Many people say that Satan is afraid of the prayers of God's children; he flees whenever God's children kneel down to pray
We will point out another fact: Satan's greatest attacks are not aimed at prayers; his greatest attacks are aimed at praise
God's children are foolish if they stop praising when they suffer under adverse environments and downtrodden feelings
If God takes you above the jail the chains the painful wounds on the body the suffering and the shame you will offer praises to His name
They were brought by God to the point where the jail, the shame, and the pain were no longer a problem to them
When they praised in such a way, the doors of the jail opened, the chains fell off, and even the jailer was saved
Whenever you run out of strength to pray and you find your spirit heavily oppressed, wounded, or sagging, praise Him
When you encounter unusual circumstances and problems and are bewildered and feel like collapsing just remember one thing Why not praise
If you offer your praise at that moment, God's Spirit will operate in you, open all the doors, and break all the chains
Even though their circumstances and wounds try to bury them, they are not willing to be buried, and they try to get out by prayers
When you put yourself in such an overcoming position, you immediately transcend everything, and no problem will be able to bury you
Of course, none of the last kings of Judah was perfect, but nevertheless, Jehoshaphat was a person seeking after God
And when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir'
When everyone was singing praises to Jehovah, He rose to smite the Ammonites, Moabites, and the people of Mount Seir
God's children often are tempted to think that their problems are too big and that they have to find some way to deal with their problems
At such times, it is easy for them to turn their attention to their problems; it is easy for their eyes to be set on their own difficulties
New believers should not think that they have to pass through many years before they can learn the lesson of praise
When you have some problems or when you are sorrowful, you pray, and as you pray, a kind of faith rises up in your heart
Do this until you turn from having no feeling to having feeling, or from having a feeble feeling to a strong feeling
When our prayer reaches the point where we have faith and assurance we know that the Lord has answered our prayer and we should praise Lord!
When you praise the Lord this way, your spirit will soar above your problems; it will soar above your inner wounds
The more others try to put us down, the more we should rise up before the Lord and say, 'I thank You and praise You'!
We need to learn not only to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit but also to praise the discipline of the Holy Spirit
We can only feel the pain of all the inward wounds and outward trials that we have encountered and experienced
If some of our footsteps had not been stopped by the Holy Spirit, we cannot imagine how pitiful our fall would have been!
Many things, thousands and even millions of things which we do not see today, will become clear to us on that day
What we encountered may have been a misfortune, but through that encounter we may have avoided greater misfortunes
When our eyes are opened and we become clear on that day, how very shameful we will be when we recall our murmurings
Today we have to learn to believe that the Lord is good and that He is never wrong, even though we cannot always understand what He is doing
After that they had to take the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of their houses
The Lord was trying to show us that we should take His supper in the same way the Jews took the Passover feast
God's children today are saved and delivered from the sins of this world, and they partake of the Lord's supper
The Lord used unleavened bread, instead of leavened bread, because He instituted His supper during the Passover
The 'product of the vine' spoken of in Matthew 26, Mark 14, and Luke 22 can also be translated as the 'fruit of the vine'
During the bread-breaking meeting, we can use either grape wine or grape juice, as long as it is a product of the vine
The Lord wants us to remember Him, not simply because we tend to forget, but also because the Lord needs us to have such a remembrance
If we do not always remember Him and place His redemption before us, we will easily be entangled with the sins of the world
Another spiritual reason for breaking bread in remembrance of the Lord is to prevent God's children from having any quarrels or divisions
It is unreasonable for us to remember the Lord's forgiveness of our many sins and yet quarrel with the brothers and sisters
He loves all those who belong to Him, and we spontaneously love all of His children because we cannot hate those whom He loves
The Lord wants us to remember Him, which means we have already met Him at Golgotha and have already received His grace
We look back to remember the Lord in the same way that the Jews look back to remember the feast of the Passover
Corinthians 11:26 says, 'For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord's death until He comes'
In charging us to take His supper, the Lord is asking us not just to remember Him but also to proclaim His death
When you see the bread, you are reminded of ground wheat, and when you see the cup, you are reminded of pressed grapes
The Lord spoke through Paul, 'For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord's death until He comes'
We should preach the gospel not only with our mouth, in the meeting hall, or with our gifts but also with the Lord's supper
As a supper which He instituted on the last night before His death this meeting is for remembering Him and declaring His death till He comes
In chapter eleven the Lord said, 'This is My body, which is given for you' ; this refers to the Lord's physical body
We need to see the remembrance aspect the declaration aspect and the fellowship aspect of the Lords table we also need to see the oneness
If some of God's children gather together and see only themselves and if their bread only includes the few of them, that bread is too small
If we want to establish a church that is our own, our bread is too small and cannot represent the whole church
If we put them aside completely when we break our bread, our bread is not big enough, and our heart is not big enough
The Lord sets up His table in a locality in the same principle that He first set it up in that large upper room; that room was borrowed
Although there is no problem with our person, we must realize that we are partaking of the Lord's body while we are eating
