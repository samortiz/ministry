   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Its Particular Truth</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All denominations not only have a particular name, they also have a particular truth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This does not mean that the truth they espouse, like baptism or justification by faith, is bad.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It means that taking a truth as the center of the church, as the center for the believers to be united around and separating themselves from the rest of the children of God is to be a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is against the Bible!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church is built upon "this rock" Christ Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is the center of the believers' meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The believers' fellowship is not around certain truths but in Christ 1 Cor 1:9 and in the Holy Spirit 2 Cor 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The denominations are established because people made certain truths higher than Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Baptism is right.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, putting baptism over Christ makes baptism the center of the believers' meeting; this separates some from the rest of the children of God, and this is a denomination!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Its Particular Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A denomination must have a particular fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If someone wants to participate in this fellowship, he must join the group first and become a member.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible tells us that the believers are the members of the Body of Christ Eph 5:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we believe, we are already united in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whoever is a member of the Body of Christ is in the church; they have already been united with the Body of Christ, and they participate in the fellowship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So we do not have to join the fellowship of the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can only acknowledge who is in the fellowship and who is not.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whoever has the life of Christ partakes of the fellowship of Christ; therefore, we should receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should receive even those who are weak in faith Rom 14:1 , "for God has received him" v. 3 . Whoever thinks that being a Christian is not qualification enough for one to be received, and that one must also join a group or be officially recognized as a member is practicing denominationalism.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Anything that one can associate with or disassociate from is by definition a denomination!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, a denomination must have:</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1 a name that does not include all the children of God,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2 a particular truth as its center,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>3 a fellowship which does not include all the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a group has any one of these three things, it is a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Baptist Church has all three of these, so the Baptist Church surely is a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is still more to this letter, but we will finish publishing it in the next issue.</S>
