   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE THIRTEEN GOD S DEMAND AND PHARAOH S RESISTANCE 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With this message we shall begin to consider the matter of God s demand and Pharaoh s resistance.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s demand and Pharaoh s resistance issued in a number of conflicts, which are recorded in chapters five through fourteen of Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we come to the first of these conflicts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. THE FIRST CONFLICT A. The Demand of Jehovah, the God of Israel,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>the God of the Hebrews, on Pharaoh</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Exodus 5:1 says, And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this verse we have an important title of God: Jehovah, God of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verse 3 God is entitled the God of the Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the demand on Pharaoh was made by Jehovah, the God of Israel, the God of the Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have pointed out that in Hebrew the title Jehovah is a form of the verb to be .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that Jehovah is the unique self-existing One.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is the One who was, who is, and who will be.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only to Him can the verb to be be applied in an absolute sense.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only God is; we and all other things are not.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 6:3 God says, I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God All-sufficient; but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God revealed Himself as Jehovah for the first time in Exodus 3.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob did not receive this revelation of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 5:1 God is also called the God of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This title is different from the title the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, a title which signifies God as the God of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The title the God of Israel indicates that God is the God of a transformed people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jacob was the name of a natural man, but Israel was the name of a transformed man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At birth, Jacob was not given the name Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, he was called Jacob, which means a heel-holder, a supplanter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But throughout the course of his life, Jacob was transformed, and eventually God changed his name to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This name implies victory and kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the one hand, the transformed people are victors; on the other hand, they are kings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even when the children of Israel were in a dreadful situation in Egypt, God still regarded them not as Jacob, but as Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the eyes of God, His chosen people had already been transformed into victors and kings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The same principle applies to the way God sees the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the eyes of God, the church is already glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, if our eyes are set on our spiritual condition, we may regard ourselves as being very pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may see ourselves as Jacob, not as Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, as God sees us, we are Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In His dealings with Satan, the persecutor and usurper, God told him that He is the God of a transformed, victorious, and kingly people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all need to see and believe that we are an Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You may not believe this today, but you will certainly believe it in the future, either in the next age or in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In eternity all God s chosen people will be an Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not be shortsighted, limited in your vision by your present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God does not regard you as one still in bondage under Pharaoh; rather, He sees you as one who has been delivered and brought into the all-inclusive Christ typified by the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you dare believe that you are such an Israel, such a victor and king?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all must be bold enough to believe this and to declare it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not hold to your feeling regarding yourself, but believe in the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If God says that you are an Israel, then you are an Israel, whether you feel this way about yourself or not.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yes, in chapter five of Exodus the children of Israel were still under bondage in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, God knew that they soon would be delivered from this bondage and brought into the wilderness, to the mountain, and eventually into the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the good land they would be Israel, and God would be their God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, as God came to Pharaoh to negotiate with him, He was not disappointed by the condition of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He did not have Moses and Aaron tell Pharaoh that He was the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Instead, He let Pharaoh know that He was Jehovah, the God of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It seemed as if God were saying, Pharaoh, you must realize that I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am He who was, who is, and who will be.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You cannot change Me. Furthermore, in My sight, My people have been transformed into an Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They also are Hebrews, river-crossers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because they are Hebrews, don t try to keep them on this side of the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am Jehovah, and whatever I say must come to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I say that My people are Hebrews; therefore, they are Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You cannot keep them in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You must let them go.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The titles of God mentioned in chapter five are extremely important.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even in diplomatic relations among the nations of the world, titles are of great significance.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If a representative of a certain nation is to negotiate with the government of the United States, he must have a proper title.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If he were simply a consul or minister, his position would not be high enough.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He would need to bear the title of ambassador.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then he could engage in diplomatic negotiations.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the same principle, as God was negotiating with Pharaoh, He presented Himself according to the proper title: Jehovah, the God of Israel, the God of the Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He let Pharaoh know that He was the great I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As the I Am, He was everything, and Pharaoh was nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Moreover, He revealed Himself to Pharaoh as the God of Israel, the God of a people transformed to be victors and kings.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As the One with such a marvelous title, God made His demand of Pharaoh.</S>
