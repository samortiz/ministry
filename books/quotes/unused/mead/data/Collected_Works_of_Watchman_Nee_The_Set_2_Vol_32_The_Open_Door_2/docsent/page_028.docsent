   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Dear Brother Tsi-yi in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother Ma Chuan-foo came yesterday and told me that you are concerned about our recent condition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let me relate it to you in the following way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There were over fifty brothers and sisters from Fu-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After we arrived in Lan-Si, we had to take refuge at a relief center.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There was no liberty to move around in the relief shelter, and it was not convenient to preach the Lord Jesus in public.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>During the month that I stayed in the relief center, I always prayed that the Lord would give us the chance to preach the gospel to individuals and to the refugee children at least.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He allowed me to preach the gospel to the presiding Buddhist monk and some of the refugees.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I was able to teach for two weeks at the refugee school and tell them Old Testament stories and the salvation of the cross, including one short hymn.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord's grace is sufficient for us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We ask for your prayer concerning two things: 1 Prolonged traveling has tired me out.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I find that I cannot sustain myself in writing and reading, and my eyesight is failing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I wonder how I can continue to serve the Lord this way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>2 Pray that the brothers and sisters taking refuge in Lan-Si would soon find a safe place where they can support themselves and worship God.</S>
