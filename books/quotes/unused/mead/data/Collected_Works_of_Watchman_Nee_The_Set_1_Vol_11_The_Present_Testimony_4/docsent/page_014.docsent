   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Overcoming the Environment</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you can overcome the feeling of dryness, you can overcome your environment.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The feeling of dryness is the most difficult to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you can overcome this feeling, you surely will overcome your environment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The environment that is closest to a Christian is his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only by overcoming your emotion can you overcome other things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you exercise your will to say, "I will read the Bible, I will pray, and I will testify," even though you are living a dry and parched life, you will find that you can overcome all kinds of environments, no matter how great they may be.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I will say frankly that those who have not overcome their environment have not overcome their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those who would overcome their environment must first overcome their own emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>D. Living by Faith</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The duration of joy becomes shorter, while the duration of dryness becomes longer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The degree of joy is less, while the degree of dryness becomes more.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The end result is that at a certain point, the two will meet.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They will be like two streams merging into one; there will not be any distinction between them anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the beginning, the joy becomes shorter and less intense, and the dryness becomes longer and more intense.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in the end, we cannot tell the difference between our joy and our dryness anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The reason God is leading us this way is to show us that there will eventually be no difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In other words, our joy and our dryness will be completely merged as one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today God has no intention other than having the just live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The just do not live by emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, no matter how we feel in our emotions, they will not bring us anything.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some believers have to go through God's training ten or twenty times until they do not exercise the strength of their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's training causes the dryness to increase more and the duration to become longer, in order to bring these ones to the point where they will live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a man is not saved, we have nothing to say about him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if he is saved, his experience will surely be one in which the times of dryness become longer, while the times of joy become shorter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His plain days will become more, and his joyous days will become less.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God will point out to him what his goal is.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many Christians are living a dry life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Of all the days in a year, he may only experience three to five days of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some may even go through three to five years in dryness, without any joy at all.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you have never been trained, you will see in that day that your emotional strength is useless because the just live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Finally, if you live by faith, you will be able to live a joyful life in the driest hour and live the driest life in a joyful way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These words seems to be contradictory, but it is a reality in the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God is leading you to live such a life by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What is it to live by faith?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is what the three Hebrew men Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego said to Nebuchadnezzar: "Our God..will deliver us out of your hand, O king.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But if He does not..we will not serve your gods nor worship the golden image that you have set up" Dan 3:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They were saying even if God did not save them, they still would not change.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is to live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christians today are strongly inclined toward a life in the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever God takes away their feeling of joy, they have nothing left.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But God says that we should live by faith and not by feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In a few years, we will see that joy and dryness are the same, and neither joy nor dryness can affect us anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We will live the same in dryness or in joy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We do not have to live like those whose vessel is small and who are easily satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When they are happy, they dance in their rooms.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When they are dry, they wet the wall with tears.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we live by faith, we will not be affected by either of the two.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This does not mean we are insensitive; we do have feelings of joy and dryness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But these outward feelings will not affect us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This article covers the joy experienced by the outward man; it does not cover the joy that the inward man enjoys in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The latter is deep and unshakable.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But this deep and unshakable joy can only be enjoyed by us after we can fully control the outward joy.</S>
