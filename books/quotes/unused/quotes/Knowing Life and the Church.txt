Although man's natural mind cannot understand, from the beginning to the end of the Bible God cares only about the matter of life
If we look at the first two chapters of Genesis under God's light, we can clearly see that life is the goal of His creation
In the orderly process of His creation, God first created inanimate objects, and then He created organic things
The creation of living beings started at the lowest level of life and advanced step by step to higher levels of life
Man is the highest life in God's creation, because the Bible says that God created man in His own image and according to His own likeness
Among all created things, man is like God because he has God's image; he also represents God because he has God's authority
If man does not come to life and life does not come into man, God's creation of man would have no meaning, purpose, or result
Consequently, man did not contact the tree of life but ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Although man knows that he should forsake evil and do good, he does not have the ability or the means to work out the good
We need to pay special attention to John chapter 1 and Genesis chapter 2; we need to read these two chapters together
Genesis helps by showing that after man was tempted and fell he lost the top blessing of life he lost a treasure the center in the universe
After Genesis chapter 2, it is difficult to find the matter of life until we see in John 1:4 that life is in Him
Life is the goal of creation in the Old Testament, and also life is the goal of redemption in the New Testament
The purpose of God's creation is to bring man into life; likewise, the purpose of God's redemption is to bring man into life
On one end of the wire is a powerhouse, God, and on the other end is a light bulb, man, and there is a current flowing between the two
Even the characteristics of children, who become loud, angry, or happy whenever they desire, are matters of life
In the same way, a higher life produces a higher life, a better life bears a better life, and a poorer life produces a poorer life
All the beauty, power, brightness, and ability of the church come from the fact that the life of God is her inward content
God's life is in the Holy Spirit, and this life is the God who was in the beginning and the Creator who existed in the beginning
They can remain angry for several months, and their anger cannot subside because they have only a small measure of life
Such a person will not lose only her temper; she will also provoke others to anger, because this is her natural talent
Just as God created the universe and everything in it, this life, which is Christ Himself, can do so much work in us
The story of the entire universe is related to life in living creatures, with God's life being the highest life
Now we need to see two crucial points: what does the life that we speak of refer to, and how do we contact and touch this life?
Verse 63 begins by saying that the Spirit gives life, and it ends by saying that the words the Lord spoke to us are spirit and life
If raw grains of rice are placed in front of us, they cannot be enjoyed or eaten by us, and they cannot satisfy our hunger
In order for raw grains of rice to be eaten and enjoyed by us and to satisfy our hunger, they need to be steamed
If we understand these words, we will know why the Lord said to the Jews, 'I am the living bread which came down out of heaven'
When we eat steamed rice, we are not eating rice grains that have been taken directly from a rice bag or a rice bin
The Gospel of Matthew records that a Canaanite woman came to the Lord and cried out, 'Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David'!
The Jewish land can be compared to the dining table and the Jews were Gods children but they wasted their bread and threw it under the table
He is not only the bread of life; He is also the crumbs that fall from the Jewish land so that He can inwardly satisfy us, the Gentiles
If God does not have a relationship with man, He would remain high in the heavens where man could not touch Him or contact Him
If we want to obtain and touch everything of God, we need to touch God's life because all the riches of God's nature are in His life
They are saturated with the fatness of Your house, / And You cause them to drink of the river of Your pleasures'
The fatness and the river of life are to be enjoyed by man in the shadow of God, that is, in His house, in Himself
At the end of the Bible, Revelation 21:22 says, 'I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple'
To enjoy the fatness of God's house is to enjoy God's riches in God Himself, for with Him is the fountain of life
Because God's riches are in His life, if we want to receive God's riches, we must touch life because God Himself is life
One of the disciples made a very interesting request of the Lord Jesus, saying, 'Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us'
In John 14 the Lord Jesus said that the Father is in Him, and then He said that He would leave the disciples in a little while
He came as the Spirit, 'even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him'
The Spirit has a very special name; He is called the Spirit of life , which means that the Spirit gives life to people
Whenever we touch the Lord's word, the word becomes light in us, and the word becomes life to satisfy our hunger
Sometimes the word seems tangible, and it speaks clearly in us; sometimes the word seems more intangible, as if it is just a feeling
Whether or not we can touch, contact, and obtain life all depends on how we handle God's word and how we contact God's word
When they go home, they are still empty within and cannot touch God, and they go to sleep with this empty feeling
The brothers and sisters also have some understanding concerning the way to obtain life and the issue of obtaining life
Although we know that God's life has come into us to be our life and to be lived out of us, in reality, this life encounters obstacles in us
The most difficult problems and severe restrictions that God's life encounters in the universe are related to these obstacles in man
God's life still does not have a way in us, and it is unable to get through in us because it faces obstacles in us every day
In our daily living, we do not give God's life the way, and we do not allow God's life to have the ground in us
God may encounter significantly greater and even stronger obstacles in these saints rather than in those who are ungodly and unrighteous
It is very rare and noteworthy for us to find someone who does not place restrictions and obstacles before God
No matter how good, lovely, and precious, all our concepts are in darkness, and they keep us from knowing Christ as life in us
After some people are saved and become Christians, they have a concept that they need to be zealous and preach the gospel
They look down on everything that is physical and worldly, and they even attempt to forsake everything that is worldly
The first problem that God's life encounters in us is that we do not realize the darkness of our human concepts
We do not realize that our concepts, even though they seem proper and upright, are actually full of darkness and without life
From that day forward, our being a Christian has not depended on anything other than taking care of the living Christ in us
After experiencing this kind of moving within, a brother may not apologize but instead begins to reason, 'I am a man, a real man
We may preach the gospel and be zealous, but this does not mean that the living Christ is living Himself out of us
If we genuinely know the Lord when we pray to Him in the morning He will move in us and give us a sense of our need to apologize to our wife
If we would all do this, the living Christ would have more ground and opportunity to speak to us and to give us even more feelings
The result of this continual operation would spread to our dealings with others, or it may touch our wrong actions toward others
The Lord will direct us to do something else, and without relying on our own concepts and opinions, we can simply follow Him
It is difficult to change our concepts, but we will not have a way to go on unless we put aside our own concepts and opinions
There was a sister in the church in Nanking who spoke slowly and walked softly; everything she did was soft and gentle
People cannot speak a few sentences to him before he starts an argument with them; he can pound the table and glare at people
Not only do other people think that such a brother is spiritual, but even the brother himself thinks that he is spiritual
Some people may be naturally gentle, modest, uncontentious, caring, willing to shed tears for others, sympathetic, and self-sacrificing
From the point of view of morality, people should have these virtues, but from the point of view of life, these virtues are false
Regardless of how much a person can meet-and even go beyond-the standard of morality, this is still not necessarily life
There is a greater possibility of these people becoming truly spiritual if they would lose their temper once or twice
Some people are born with a disposition that does not lose its temper even when others try hard to make them lose their temper
It is difficult for some people not to lose their temper, but for others, it is difficult for them to lose their temper
Christ operates and moves in us in order to make us clear about His will and requirements for us and about His leading and dealing with us
Instead we may visit with a brother, a sister, or even a gospel friend because we do not like to stay at home and fellowship with the Lord
At such a time we should realize that our outward work of preaching of the gospel is merely a religious activity
We may be very active and zealous in doing those things but still may imprison the living Christ within us by ignoring Him
When a person touches them, he only senses their capability and ability because they have never been broken in their capability and ability
When he contacts them, he can only say that they seek and pursue the Lord but that their natural capability has not been broken
If we said to an unbelieving friend, 'You are not merely human,' this would sound like an insult to him, and he would feel uncomfortable
In the end, the ones who run the best are the teams that have the best mutual understanding and the ability to coordinate together
The team that typically wins the final victory is made up of two people with similar disposition, pace, view, and understanding
Even though we outwardly seem to be the same as we were before our salvation, many of us can testify that now there are two persons in us
To perform a two-man comic show well, the person hiding in the back and the person in front must act in unison
There are times when the One in us is sad, but we are laughing on the outside, or we may be sad, but He is happy
Every genuine Christian can testify that he is not a normal Christian when his living within and without are in contradiction
When God is happy in him, he is happy; when God is sad in him, he is sad; and when God gives a command, he immediately follows
Whenever God moves he moves whenever God urges him to speak he speaks with one voice and the words that God speaks within he speaks outside
It is as if we are all bad actors in a two-man comic show, who cannot act in unison and who are not 'professional'
These problems can be divided into three categories, but there may also be a fourth category that needs some final consideration
If there is no filament in a light bulb, electricity cannot flow into it and the bulb cannot shine forth any light
Our innermost part is our spirit, but surrounding our spirit is our person, our self, which is also the soul spoken of in the Bible
In order to be consistent within and without, our mind, emotion, and will in our soul must cooperate with our spirit
The mind, emotion, and will equal our person, which is the outer man spoken of in the Bible; the Holy Spirit in our spirit is the inner man
Our soul can be compared to the actor at the front of the stage and our spirit can be compared to the person hiding at the back of the stage
The Lord Jesus lives in his spirit, and when he prays in the morning, the Lord may give him a feeling to apologize to his wife
Inwardly, there is a sense that he should apologize, but outwardly, his thoughts are focused only on preaching the gospel
His only consideration is to preach the gospel zealously he has no thought to apologize to his wife even though he has a sense in his spirit
When the Spirit moves in us, we ignore, suppress, and put Him aside; instead, we exercise our mind to think and our eyes to watch
Even though our mind often understands the intention in our spirit and we know the will of God, we are unwilling to submit and obey
We may understand know apprehend and deeply sense that the Lord wants us to do a certain thing but our will refuses to submit and surrender
Although this brother clearly knows that the Holy Spirit wants him to apologize to his wife, his will is too strong, and he refuses to obey
A sister can argue and quarrel with her husband at home but sit with him before the Lord's table in the bread-breaking meeting
Even though a brother knows that he should submit to the Lord, he can be incapable of moving because he is not strong in his will
No matter how much he is exhorted, he is like a soft, wet noodle that cannot be propped up with a pair of chopsticks
The New Testament does not speak only of Christ being our life and of God coming into us so that we can live out Christ through the Spirit
They realized that without the renewing of our mind and the dealing with our will, God's life could not be expressed through us
We often have the Lord's presence and feeling within, but our emotion has some preference other than the Lord's
Such a friendship takes her away, and in the end, she follows her outward friendship while disobeying her inward feeling
We need to let God lead us so that our disposition is one with His disposition in order that we would have His emotions and tastes
Each and every part of our soulour mind emotion and willmust cooperate with the Holy Spirits operation in us and with the Lords feeling
We may have been saved by grace, but our person remains unbroken; we have never been broken by God, and we remain intact
According to the original Greek these two phrases are two of the hardest phrases to translate because there is no such expression in Chinese
Having fellowship in the Lord's sufferings is to have fellowship with the Lord in His sufferings and through His sufferings
To be conformed to His death means that His death is like a mold and that we are in this mold to be conformed to His death
Although the life of God is in us His life often cannot come out of us because there are strong hindrances obstacles and restrictions in us
The life of God has a difficult way to get through in us; it is rebuffed at every point and resisted in every matter
In God's salvation, however, the blood is an important matter because without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins
The Chinese like to display words in their homes like blessing, wealth, longevity, and happiness, but no one likes the word death
In regard to God's salvation, we often say that we have received the life of God, a life that is eternal, holy, full, and shining
We may not realize that there is also something else that is precious in Gods salvation which people do not like to hearthe matter of death
He said, 'To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death'
Knowing this fellowship meant that Paul participated in this fellowship, which caused him to be conformed to Christ's death
Through the blood our sins are forgiven, and through the cleansing of our conscience our fellowship with God is restored
Very few of us realize that God has prepared another wonderful thing for us in His salvation-the death of Christ
We may have been Christians for many years, but have we ever realized that God has prepared death for us in His salvation?
John 12:24 says, 'Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
There is life in a grain of wheat, but unless the grain falls into the ground and dies, the life within the grain will not be released
If we bury the seed in the earth, the seed will have an opportunity to enter into death so that all of the seed's content will come out
After more time we will see a leaf sprouting on the seedling and after still more time the leaf will be full grown and a flower will blossom
Regardless of whether it is plant or animal life, life must pass through the process of death in order to be born
Paul said, 'Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body'
We cannot find the word cultivation in the Bible; spiritual cultivation is not the central thought in the Bible
Death does not sound good, but in order for a man of the old creation to be transformed, death, rather than cultivation, is required
Whether we have life and are in life does not depend on whether we are fast or slow but on whether God has been released from us
By this he meant that as a person with God's life and as a person with Christ living in him, he had been crucified with Christ on the cross
We need to see that cultivation is not God's will, because God does not intend that we would improve ourselves
The cross does a work of death in us so that we may pass through death in order for His life to have an open way in us
They think that they will arrive at the standard of a Christian by improving their temper a little and doing good rather than bad things
We may be naturally irritable or meek, or we may be naturally quick or slow, but in any case, we are a problem to the life of God
When we abhor and hate our self the Holy Spirit will show us that our self which restricts and opposes God has been crucified on the cross
When we repented of our sins, the Holy Spirit showed us that the Lord Jesus had borne them on the cross for us
In the same principle the Holy Spirit will show us that our self as an enemy of God is the real hindrance and restriction to the life of God
Everyone who sees this vision will praise, worship, and immediately say, 'O Lord, my person has been crucified on the cross
Regardless of whether we think we are good or bad, fast or slow, eventually the Holy Spirit will show us that the life of God is in us
Just as losing our temper is not necessarily related to the life of God controlling our temper is not necessarily related to the life of God
Every good thing and every bad thing, when measured against the standard of the life of God, are hindrances and obstacles
Once we have seen this vision, we will start on the way of life, and the life of God will begin to be expressed through us
A person who has not seen the cross will lose his temper, and so will a person who has seen the cross, but there is a difference
If he quarrels with his wife, he feels deflated after only one sentence and realizes that something is not right
A person who has not seen the vision and who is unwilling to bear the cross will quarrel in the evening after quarreling in the morning
Those who have not seen the cross are energized by their quarrels, but those who have seen the cross are deflated by their quarrels
We soon discover that our very being hinders Him the most, even though we pursue and zealously follow the Lord
When we are shown this mercy by the Lord, we will realize that our very person hinders and troubles Him the most
At this point we will experience death; we will pass through a gate, and we will enter onto the pathway of the spiritual life
From this point forward, the Holy Spirit will bring us into the way of the cross every day, and He will bring us into the life of the cross
For us to live a life of the cross and to walk on the way of the cross mean that we live a daily life of death and take the way of death
To unbelievers, this sounds strange, but to believers, who are pursuing the Lord, it is a sweet and real experience
Although we may love, pursue, and follow the Lord, the Holy Spirit still must open our eyes to show us that we are a hindrance to God
Passing through the gate is only an entrance; after we pass through the gate, we still need to walk on the way
In spiritual matters we do not walk on the way and then enter through the gate; instead, we enter through the gate and then walk on the way
Thereafter, we will know the cross and the death of the cross, and the Holy Spirit will bring our whole being into the way of the cross
After imitating others for a period of time, the Holy Spirit will bring them to the point of passing through the gate
Many Christians have been saved for five, ten, or even twenty years without passing through the gate of the cross
We meet Christians everywhere who are zealous, love the Lord, pursue the Lord, preach the gospel, save souls, and help the saints
It is very difficult to meet a saint who has passed through the gate of the cross and who knows the death of the cross
Since he has passed through the gate, he knows something of the cross and of the meaning of being crucified with Christ
The death of the cross is applied to us through the power of the Holy Spirit, and its effect is to put us to death, to kill us
As an example, a brother may see the vision that he has died with the Lord and realize that he has been crucified with Christ
Even though he insists on his opinion, there is now a hole in his opinion, and his opinion has changed a little
As he continues on this way, the Holy Spirit will work in him more intensely to the point that he will be conquered inwardly by the Spirit
After this experience, there will be a few more holes and cracks in this brother's being because he has been broken a little more
Based on his seeing of the cross, the Spirit will shine on him and the light will condemn and question: 'Is this you or the Lord?
His preferences, thoughts, and opinions will be put to death on the cross, and he will receive and experience the cross once again
Consequently, little by little, day after day, and event after event, he will experience the cross in the Holy Spirit
Romans 6:6 says, 'Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him,' and Galatians 2:20 says, 'I am crucified with Christ'
Paul speaks of the cross also in 5:24, which says, 'They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts'
Those who teach the truth concerning the cross make a mistake of speaking only about one side of this truth in the Bible
On the one hand we have been crucified on the cross on the other hand we need also to put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit
A brother who has seen the light of the cross may still quarrel with his wife at home because quarreling is according to his natural being
When he quarrels with his wife however the Holy Spirit will shine the light of the cross in him and question Is this Christ or you yourself
When the Spirit shines and questions him in this way, he will be punctured by the cross and be unable to continue to quarrel with his wife
Once he is under the discipline of the Holy Spirit, however, the Spirit will enable him to cooperate with and submit to the Holy Spirit
Without the death of the cross there is no work of the Holy Spirit wherever the Holy Spirit works there is a putting to death by the Spirit
God has put us on the cross in Christ so that our person, which troubles and limits God, can be dealt with through the cross
When God deals with us, it may take Him twenty or thirty years, and He still may not complete His dealing with us
A carpenter who wants to modify a counter or a table will take only one or two days to finish the job even if he spends much time and effort
When people contact them, they have not changed at all; they are intact in spite of the fact that they are full of wounds and scars
Sisters may feel that they are meeker than the brothers, but strictly speaking, the meeker one is, the harder it is to deal with her
If we hit a piece of glass, it easily breaks; however, if we hit a piece of rubber, it will not break, no matter how hard we try
Can be compared to glass which breaks immediately but sisters can be compared to rubber which does not break no matter how hard it is hit
If we pay attention to grace, we will see that it is easier to deal with brothers and harder to deal with sisters
We need much grace, life, Spirit, truth, the word of the ministry, spiritual books, and the testimony of the church
They may feel that our believing into Jesus is too much, but the more we love, pursue, and serve the Lord, the more joy we have within
He knows the kind of boss, co-workers, classmates, and neighbors that we need; therefore, He prepares and orders everything for us
God is doing a work of grace in us, and He has prepared everything in our environment and our circumstances in life for us
We even desire and pray to the Lord that we would be willing to be broken, subdued, and filled with Christ in order to live out Christ
Many saints, after much consideration in choosing a spouse, eventually choose a 'dear one' who deals with them
The discipline of the Holy Spirit is evident not only in small matters, but also in the big matters of our life
God often gives us a 'dear' wife or 'dear' husband, and at times we do not know whether we should laugh or cry
There are great disciplinary arrangements in our human life that we cannot avoid or escape because we cannot be raptured nor die
We make thousands of mistakes in our lives, and these mistakes are not our fault; everything has been set forth by God
In the matter of marriage, we may reject someone who lives near us, and we also may reject someone with whom we are familiar
Sometimes, we are afraid of making mistakes, and we try to avoid and prevent mistakes, but after trying everything, we still make mistakes
Truly speaking, these matters are not in our hands; a man's heart devises his way, but Jehovah directs his steps
God measures a certain person to be our spouse; this is arranged by God or, at the very least, permitted by God
If our spouse, as God's chief helper, is not sufficient to deal with us, He adds more little helpers to deal with us
Everything is arranged by God; some things were arranged by God before we were born, and some things come to us through our prayer
They neglect and ignore their circumstances and environment, and they miss the benefit that can be gained from them
Our circumstances and environment are a great means arranged by God for dealing with our person and subduing us
For our spiritual understanding, it is not enough only to know the Holy Spirit, we must also know the 'all things' in our circumstances
With this kind of desire and prayer of the Holy Spirit within us, these prayers and groanings pass through the Holy Spirit and reach God
The thorn in Paul enabled him to enjoy the grace of God and experience God's power being perfected in weakness
We may pray and hope that others will change, but the more we pray in this way, the clearer we are that nothing will change
In the eyes of unbelievers, a Christian's circumstances often seem very strange, and they lack an understanding of what they mean
Every proper Christian has some difficulty or burden and is under some kind of oppression or affliction in all kinds of circumstances
When truth is released, there will be a response in us, and through our prayer the Spirit will begin to work in us
According to man's natural thought, the church refers to either a building, chapel, organization, group, or denomination
Similarly, the church as the Body of Christ means that the church and Christ are joined together; the two are one
Ephesians 5:31-32 speaks of a husband and wife becoming one flesh, signifying that Christ and the church are one body
When we see a brother and touch his body, we say, 'This is Brother So-and-so'; we do not say, 'This is Brother So-and-so's body'
When Peter realized that Christ is the Son of God, the Lord Jesus immediately spoke of the building up of the church
Once we know the living Christ and have His life, the church is produced in us, and the element of the church is in us
When God made the woman, He did not create her apart from Adam; instead, God took a rib out of Adam, and this rib became Eve
His redeeming blood and eternal life flowed from Him and entered into us and millions of others, making us the church
God's life came into Jesus, and He was called Christ; God's life also entered into everyone who is saved, and we are called the church
These matters are of no consequence to an immature Christian however the more mature a Christian is the more he wants to know these matters
Everyone knows that there is only one sun and one moon for us in the universe, but there are thousands and millions of stars
According to typology in the Bible, the sun typifies Christ , the moon typifies the church , and the stars typify the saints
Just as there is only one sun, there is also only one moon; just as there is only one Christ, there is also only one church
If we ask the brothers from England how many moons are in England, they would laugh and answer that there is only one moon
There is one expression in Taipei, one expression in Tainan, one expression in Taichung, and one expression in Kaohsiung
Regardless of how many expressions there are and regardless of whether these expressions are large or small, they are all one
There are at least three different signs one says Baptist Church another says Presbyterian Church and a third says Christian Assembly Place
We all know that the church is Christ Himself, that Christ and the church are one, and that the church is joined to Christ
The church is divided and confused because of one reason only-something other than Christ has been brought into the church
Today's Christianity has been divided into many sects and denominations because things other than Christ have been brought into the church
Since the church of Christ is the church of Christ, why should we call her the Lutheran Church or the Methodist Church?
It seems that the Bible is not sufficient for many groups in Christianity, because in addition to the Bible they must have creeds
Sometimes people ask, 'Even though you say that you have no special name and that you are not a denomination, what are your beliefs'?
All our beliefs are in the Bible, and we do not have anything other than the Bible; we do not have special creeds or beliefs
In proper circumstances, as the children of God with the same Father, we can have fellowship with one another in the Father's life
Having special names, special beliefs, and special fellowships are three main factors that cause division and confusion in the church
Since they do not have special names, special beliefs, and special fellowships, their condition should be quite normal
Today the church has lost her nature and the proper ground because the things of man have been brought into the church
When we touch the matter of the church, a few say, 'I think this matter should be done this way, and that matter should be done that way'
There are so many divisions in today's Christianity because many people bring their own views and preferences into the church
Whenever we bring our own things our own views our own preferences opinions intents desires and ways into the church the church is nullified
Man's views, intentions, inclinations, and preferences have come into the church, and these things result in different sects
We must consider whether our actions, including our thoughts, views, activities, and practices, are according to the Bible
We need to filter everything with the Bible so that we can keep out everything that is not according to the Bible
We need another test, and that is to examine whether the things we are bringing into the church are of Christ or of ourselves
We need to ask ourselves if what we are bringing into the church is under the ruling of the Spirit in us or if it is from our own decision
The activities in some local churches are mainly the work of the flesh; we cannot see the authority of the Holy Spirit in these activities
Outwardly they are according to the Bible but in reality the flesh is moving and reigning and the Holy Spirit has no authority among them
The church is the Body of Christ, and the church is Christ Himself; thus, in the church there is nothing other than Christ
The saints need to see the basic point that the church is Christ Himself, that is, Christ Himself in the saints
God also has a great intention to mingle Himself with man; God wants to mingle divinity with humanity in order to make them one
Regrettably, many saints do not see this matter, but if we take this matter away from God's salvation, there would be no more salvation
The first step of the mingling of God with man was in one person, that is, in Jesus the Nazarene, and this One is Christ
After the death and resurrection of Christ, this principle in Christ was expanded through the enlargement of the mingling of God and man
Through the death and resurrection of Christ God in the Holy Spirit has entered into thousands even millions of people and mingled with them
Through the death and resurrection of Christ, God in the Holy Spirit has entered into millions of people and mingled with them
Making practical arrangements should not come out of the human element of a certain brother but out of the mingling of God and man
The church is an entity composed of the mingling of God with man, an organism made up of the mingling of God with man
Everyone says that he is right, and it seems as if it is quite difficult to judge who is right and who is wrong
If we paint two chairs using gold paint, some people may think that the chairs are made of gold because they look only at the outward color
Today if some people put up a sign that indicates they are the church, it does not necessarily mean that they are the church
The church is the mingling of God with man; the church is Christ, the Body of Christ, and the fullness of Christ
We should not choose according to ourselves instead we should choose what God chooses suggest what God suggests and decide what God decides
The relationship between a husband and a wife is an exact description of the relationship between Christ and the church
Ephesians 531 says For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife and the two shall be one flesh
When a couple is married, they declare to the universe that the two have become one; that is, they have one head
We must ask the married brothers who have some experience in their married life whether their marriage has two heads or one
It is a marvelous thing that in every place and throughout all time, brides have covered their heads during a wedding
We need to be subject to God, but this does not mean that we do not have any consciousness, choice, preference, or thought
Outwardly it may seem as if only the church is moving, but actually God is mingled with the church and moving in the church
It is not a simple and easy matter to make a judgment based on this principle, and if we are careless, we can easily make mistakes
We should take this as a basic principle but not make any judgment according to this principle in a loose and careless way
If a group calls itself the church, its inward condition, activities, and everything about it must be according to the Bible
According to the Bible, a local church should not have a special name, a special belief, or a special fellowship
If we reply, 'I am from the Church Assembly Hall,' it will puzzle people and cause them to wonder exactly what the Church Assembly Hall is
Chang's house, saying, 'Chang's Residence,' it would not be a problem, and it would be all right if there were no sign
It would be very strange if someone puts up a sign that says, 'Wang-Chang's Residence' or 'Liu-Chang's Residence'
Just as we cannot give someone a name in a careless way, we cannot name the church in a careless way; God does not permit this
Those who really know the church and the truth concerning the church would never dare to give a name to Christians
The apostles were on the earth several decades after the Lord's death and resurrection, and many of them were greatly used by the Lord
They did not dare to carelessly give a name to the Body of Christ; it is absolutely forbidden because it is not according to the Bible
Not only is a special name a serious matter but so are the matters of a special belief or a special fellowship
We need to see that compromising is man's way of neutralizing things; man always likes to neutralize the truth
If a Christian group has more of the element of man than the element of Christ, this certainly will be their situation
The more a church is in Christ, the more the saints in that church are eager to receive fellowship from others
Whenever we are secluded and try to serve God by ourselves, we should remember that we are being independent and sectarian
People in the world look to ones who have wealth, education, and social status; however, we do not have such things in the church
The outward appearance of the church is based on the Bible the content of the church is Christ and the move of the church is the Holy Spirit
It must also be completely spiritual and under the Holy Spirit's ruling, the Holy Spirit's moving, and the Holy Spirit's operation
In order for the church to be scriptural, human views, manipulation, abilities, and worldly methods must be stopped
We need to look at the condition of each local church, placing all the problems of the churches before the Lord and studying them together
Once a person is saved and brought into the church, we should immediately help him to know the truth and experience life
Some churches are not so strong, rich, or capable, and they cannot take care of these four matters at the same time
If the church decides to preach the gospel, the saints should study how to preach the gospel and how to lead people to receive the Lord
We must consider everything in detail and adequately prepare everything in order to be on track and to produce results
We must be like this in the work of the gospel, and we must also be like this in the perfecting of the saints in the truth
It is not possible to preach any truth without some preparation, nor will we develop this ability by peacefully sleeping at home
You should not be like the Chinese proverb which says, 'Bandage the head only when it hurts, and bandage the foot only when it hurts'
When a patient comes to us, we should conduct a diagnosis by examining his whole body and then treat his illness step by step
Similarly, when people set up a school, they must have some procedures, whether it is a secondary school or a university
No worker should sleep peacefully at home every day; a good worker and a good responsible one must be a person who studies every day
If anyone working for the Lord is able to sleep peacefully every day, he will be useless, and there will be a big loss to the Lord's work
Through the preaching of the gospel in the church in Taipei, people have been brought into the church in groups of three to five hundred
If we can carry out these four crucial matters, then the church will have a firm foundation after four or five years
We should have the attitude of a climber who tirelessly advances up a mountain, and we should not sleep peacefully and be at ease
Concerning this, we need to pay attention first to the young people, and among the young people, we should concentrate on the students
If we look at society, we can see that any work or business must pay attention to the young people in order to have a future
After hearing this word, please do not feel that this is unfair and wonder why the future of the church depends on the young people
In the church life, the function of the young people is very different from the function of children and older people
Even when the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He treated the disciples differently from the way He treated others who served Him
The Lord brought His followers to a high mountain, a special place, where He could bring them on in order for them to meet His need one day
It was the one hundred and twenty disciples who were able to meet the Lord's need at the beginning of the church age in the New Testament
We may need to pay special attention to the condition of some saints, even allowing some to stay in the same condition for the moment
Every worker, every elder or responsible brother, and even more, everyone who loves and pursues the Lord must learn this
If a person has the portion of an elder, we should train him; if a person has the portion of a deacon, we should diligently help him as well
Although Brother A concentrates on what he is doing, he does not have much consideration; consequently, he is fast
If both the kingdom of the heavens and the lake of fire are before us, we should not have to think about the choice
When we are clear about what is more important and what the Lord wants us to do, we need to drop everything else
If we cannot drop certain things and stop working for the Lord, we cannot take up other things and truly work for the Lord
When we meet a certain brother and say, 'Brother, this is a very important work,' he may reply, 'Yes, but we cannot neglect that work'
Or when we say, 'We should take care of this person,' he may reply, 'Yes, but we should also take care of that person'
Those who are more experienced can quickly pinpoint a goal in an accurate and strong way and then act accordingly
In our speaking about the church, we have been able to touch only a few points, because the matter of knowing the church is a broad topic
If we want to test any Christian group with the Bible, we need to see the crucial point that Christ is the content of the church
The more we go on before the Lord, the clearer we become that these points are great filters for any Christian group and even for us
Whenever the elements of man, the world, or organization are in a local church, the church loses Christ's position and nature
In the original text, the Ark of the Covenant means 'the Ark of the Testimony,' and it typifies Christ as the testimony of God
We can also see the two natures of Christ from the Ark in the Old Testament, which included both the nature of wood and the nature of gold
From both God's perspective and the perspective of the worship of God's children, the Ark and the tabernacle could not be separated
Even though they were one, there was a distinction, but even though there was a distinction, they could not be separated
In normal circumstances the Ark and the tabernacle could not be separated when God's children were worshipping Him because the two were one
In a normal situation the Ark and the tabernacle should always be joined together and never separated from each other
Something abnormal happened in the Old Testament-God's children failed and the Israelites became desolate and degraded
In the beginning, the situation of God's children was normal because the tabernacle was among them, and the Ark was in the tabernacle
The tabernacle with the Ark inside was the center of the service of the children of God, and they kept God's testimony on the earth
The majority of the Israelites saw the outward tabernacle, and they continued to offer sacrifices and serve God there
David did not focus on the tabernacle, because he knew God; instead, he brought the Ark back and placed it in the city of David
When the children of Israel became abnormal, fallen, and desolated, the Ark was captured and separated from the tabernacle
In other words, when God's children are in desolation, they may have an outward form without the inward reality
During the period of desolation, the majority of God's children served God at the location of the tabernacle at Gibeon
Only a small group of people-like David, who knew God, who was according to God, and who was pleasing to God-paid attention to the Ark
When David passed away, his son Solomon became the king; however, like a child, he did not know God adequately
Interestingly, according to the record in the Bible, God came to Solomon that evening and gave him a vision and a dream
After Solomon received wisdom, he immediately went back to Jerusalem, the place where the Ark was, and he worshipped God there
After he received wisdom and a vision from God, he immediately went back to the Ark in Jerusalem and offered sacrifices there
Only a few people like David do not focus on the outward form and appearance of the tabernacle but care only for the Ark, for Christ
God's eyes similarly are not on the outward form but on the reality; God does not look on the tabernacle but on the Ark
From the beginning of Israel's degradation, God was interested in the Ark and its location, not the tabernacle
May God be merciful to us and show us that whenever we speak concerning the matter of the church, we cannot neglect Christ
We cannot merely have an outward appearance of the church that is according to the Bible but not have Christ within
Based on outward form and appearance, it may seem that it is a complete tabernacle that does not deviate in any way from the Scriptures
Additionally, the truth of Christ's death on the cross may be present, and the gospel may be spread quite effectively
If we want to examine the church in our locality, the best means are by the tabernacle, the bronze altar, and the Ark
The church may preach the gospel bring people into the worship of God and even help people receive Christs redemption grace and salvation
Originally the tabernacle with the altar typified Christ but when the Ark was gone there was only an outward form without an inward reality
If those who seek God with a pure heart arrive at the tabernacle, God can still give them the vision, revelation, and light to go to the Ark
Solomon went to the tabernacle in Gibeon to offer up sacrifices; he had a common view, a general view, the view of most Israelites
When Solomon went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices and worship God he was enlightened to see that Gods presence was not there but in Jerusalem
The crowds will pay attention to the tabernacle and the altar, but those who know God's heart will pay attention to the Ark, Christ
We should not neglect the altar; that is, we should not ignore the teachings concerning the cross and redemption
We even need to prepare an outward form for the Ark that is larger and more solid and secure, which is the temple
Because of the church's desolation, they believe that they will lose Christ's presence if they care about the church
If we read 2 Chronicles 3 and 4, we will discover that the Ark needs an outward form; the Ark is not complete without the tabernacle
Just as Solomon needed to build a temple for the Ark, we need both sides of the truth-the outward form and the reality
One brother told us recently that fifty young people from the United States suddenly volunteered to go to Japan to preach the gospel
Today there are many mission boards that preach the gospel zealously; however, they do not have the tabernacle and the Ark
We humble ourselves before the Lord and say that we absolutely do not have the intention of criticizing others
In other words, she should have the church, the redemption of the cross, and the glorious Christ as her center
We should never despise the Lord's gospel, and we should exalt the Lord's redemption in order to make the bronze altar brightly shine
According to typology we must focus on the matter of the church the matter of redemption and the matter of Christ as life at the same time
We must preach the gospel everywhere, help people to believe in the Lord, and help people to gain Christ as their life
Since the Ark represents Christ as the inner substance of the church, we can measure the church only by Christ Himself
In other words, all the responsible brothers and serving ones need to submit to Christ and allow Christ to mingle with them
In this way, even though we are still human, we will have the mingling of Christ within; we will be humans who are mingled with God
In such circumstances, however, it is not we who are being blocked and hindered; rather, the Holy Spirit is being blocked and hindered
The Lord will raise up a group of people who will submit to the Holy Spirit's authority and who will have much fellowship with Him
David was a man who knew God's heart, and he brought the Ark to the house of Obed-edom because he knew God's heart
The beginning was the tabernacle, and the destination was the temple; Obed-edom was only a part of the building process
Over twenty years ago, the meetings that began in many places in mainland China were like the house of Obed-edom
Those who know God will not leave the Ark in the house of Obed-edom; instead, they will bring the Ark and set it in the city of David
The Ark can stay in a certain person's house for a short time, but eventually it needs to enter into the temple
A church may increase in the knowledge of the truth outwardly, but she may not have much increase of Christ inwardly
Many Christian organizations have studied the truth and published magazines for many years, but they have merely human views and ideas
It is difficult to find anyone among them who is under the breaking of the cross who allows Christ to rule and who lives in the Holy Spirit
Often we have the doctrine of the discipline of the Holy Spirit but not the reality of being ruled by the Holy Spirit
Some Christians pay more attention to spiritual cultivation than to Christ, but spiritual cultivation is not Christ
Sometimes we visit seminaries and see people holding Bibles in their arms, walking slowly, and looking up to the heavens every few steps
We can be like this as well; we can act like two totally different persons when we are with the saints and when we are at home
We need the discipline of the Holy Spirit in the church life, but we cannot use this item to measure the church
There is no hierarchy in the church but there is an order there is no control of others in the church but there is submission to one another
The authority of the church that we speak of is entirely different from the authority of the pope in the Catholic Church
A proper church is an upright church, and the brothers and sisters serving there know their position and relationship to one another
When we go to some local churches, the elders are sitting in the business office like department or section heads in a government agency
When the deacons come to see the elders, they behave like subordinates coming to receive orders from superiors
My arm is higher than my hand, but my arm does not show off its strength, thinking that it is higher than my hand
Some deacons have this concept when they are with the elders; they think that they should simply take orders from the elders
Activities in human society always require prior arrangements, such as voting for a president and a vice-president
It is not the same in the church life; all the brothers and sisters should live in life and allow the Holy Spirit to be the Ruler
If there are five brothers in a family, it is not necessary for them to come together and vote on who is first and who is second
A sensible child obeys his father, mother, oldest brother, second oldest brother, third oldest brother, and so on
When the brothers and sisters take care of the cleaning service in the church life, we have discovered two kinds of situations
They simply follow the responsible one who tells them how they should clean, what they should use, and what their responsibility is
When the responsible brothers try to tell them how they should do it, they may say, 'I will do my part, and you should do your part
The more a person lives in the Holy Spirit and in life, the more he knows his position, the order of life, and the authority in life
The entire church often suffers loss when a small brother or sister refuses to keep his or her place in the church
Every joint in the body has its own measure, which is developed through life, and it is able to supply all the members richly
In order to have the church, we cannot have individualism, and in order to have the Body, we cannot have independence
In the Body there is no individualism, no individual idea, judgment, decision, inclination, choosing, or preference
Every believer has his own personality and characteristic; God's salvation does not nullify our personality and characteristic
In a family an older brother may be bigger, but he is still a person, and a younger brother may be smaller, but he is also a person
On the other hand, when we speak of the church as the Body of Christ and ourselves as the members in this Body, our person does not exist
If all the members in our body were their own person, we would be in great trouble, and we would not be able to live
Some brothers and sisters insist on being their own person in the Body, and as a result, they prevent the Body from making any move
In principle we can divide this topic into two aspects: the first aspect concerns the Bible, and the second aspect concerns the inner life
As long as God's children have some reverence and godly fear in their hearts, they will never object to the Bible
Everyone must respect the position of the Bible before God and treasure the authority of the Bible among God's children
When we speak of the matter of the church, we must check with the Bible concerning the condition of the church
Every person who is godly and belongs to God must eventually examine the matter of the church according to the Bible
After comparing the situation with the Bible, they discovered that all the Christian groups they encountered had some problems
They hoped that the condition, content, and activities of the church and all of their work would be according to the teaching of the Bible
They wanted to drop everything that was not in the Bible, and by the Lord's grace, they wanted to recover everything that was in the Bible
Whatever man can see and touch related to the whole condition and situation of the church should be according to the teaching of the Bible
If we judge according to the will of man, we get into trouble because everyone has his interpretation and view
If we try to answer the question of the church according to man's view, we will only become more and more confused
We must all learn to drop our views, cease from our opinions, and bring the question of the church to the Bible
Unless a certain person has some prejudice, his reading of the Bible will not be different from what it actually says
He said that when the weather gets cold, and both men and women need to change clothes, it becomes troublesome
She only asked him to read the Bible thoroughly, and because Muller paid attention to the Word of God, he read the New Testament again
Muller concluded that the Bible speaks concerning baptism by immersion more clearly than it speaks concerning prophecies
The most precious thing to a Christian is that we have not only the Bible outwardly, but the life of God inwardly
If we try to feed a chicken unclean things, however, it will refuse to eat because they do not match its taste
A need in him will increase, and when he grows and knows the Lord more, he will not feel satisfied in these meetings
After a while there will be a further need in him which cannot be satisfied, so he will look for another group
We need only to show them the principles of being according to the Bible and according to the inner demand of life
If people fear the Lord, they will bring the matter of the church to the Bible and resolve it according to the Bible
They will also take care of the taste and demand of the life within them; they will go wherever this life requires
We need to know the Lord's Spirit and life, and we need to allow the Lord to rule so that the cross can break us more deeply
If we do not have this, we merely have some outward rituals, and we are according to the Bible merely in an outward way
Outwardly, the church must be completely according to the Bible; inwardly, the church must be completely filled with Christ and the Spirit
We need to use the Bible outwardly and the Spirit inwardly; we have the light of the Bible without and life's demands and tastes within
We should not despise either of these two aspects; both aspects are principles for solving the question of the church
Christ is the embodiment of God, and He is God becoming flesh, taking the likeness of a man, and living the life of a man
When people touch the matter of the church, all of the Is, like 'I think,' 'I view,' 'I want,' and 'I will,' begin to come out
If it is not the commandment of the Bible, it can be removed, but if it is the commandment of the Bible, what can we say'?
We must all learn the lesson of stopping our reasonings and simply saying Amen to God's Word without anything else
The Bible is a strong, outward requirement; however, there is something stronger within us-the Holy Spirit and life
Consequently, we sometimes need only to point out certain things and then let their inward feeling continue to speak to them
We should not give these things any ground, because neither the Bible nor the Holy Spirit gives them any ground
Everyone who follows the Lord must realize that there are certain spiritual requirements in every spiritual matter
In our fellowship we will often encounter spiritual requirements from the outward teachings of the Bible and from the inward sense of life
Before a sister is saved and begins to pursue the Lord, she may always set herself over her husband and take the lead in everything at home
If we do not agree with the Lord, we will feel very uneasy throughout the day; it will seem as if something is missing in us
If we do not agree with this demand, we will feel that we have offended the Lord, and we will immediately be condemned by our conscience
After we agree, we will immediately feel bright, fresh, and comfortable, and we will have the Lord's inward presence
The standard of our walk is based on a spiritual requirement, and there are two kinds of spiritual requirements
We often experience these requirements at the same time, and they correspond to an inward and outward requirement
If we are truly saved and fellowship with the Lord, we should sense some spiritual requirements in us every day
If it has been a long time since we touched any spiritual requirements, we should realize that something is wrong in us
As soon as we begin to live before the Lord, we can sense a spiritual requirement within to fellowship with other saints
The life we have received, which is in each one of us, is not an individual life; rather, it is the Lord's life, a great life
They may not have much consciousness of the fact that life requires fellowship, and they may even feel that they have too much fellowship
Some saints have said that there are too many meetings, yet if they do not come to the meeting, they do not have peace
The saints there were very warmhearted, and they invited the brothers and sisters to eat the best food every day
The human life needs food, but people cannot eat too much; otherwise, their bodies will not be able to bear it
When we were in northwest China, we had to wait for a long time before we could attend a bread-breaking meeting on the Lord's Day
If we live before the Lord and have fellowship with the saints, there will be a condition in us that requires us to serve and supply others
Since she was the wife of a manager, she had several maids in her house, and she did not need to do any housework
He could not understand why his wife would go to the meeting hall to mop the floor when they had several maids in their home
There was a gospel friend who attended our bread-breaking meeting, and he was quite puzzled by what he observed
Even managers and chief executives wait in line, but they are willing to do this because the life in them has a need to be supplied
If we care for these requirements, it will not be difficult to touch the way of the church and see the genuine condition of the church
When we go to a Christian group, the people we meet often do not match us, even though we are open and eager to have fellowship
If we do not have any problems, such as loving the world, living in sin, or caring for the flesh, then the problem is not with us
We should never assume that it is enough for some people to say that they are Christians or that they are a Christian group
They may have the Bible in their hands, but the word of the Bible does not have much ground among them or in them
The requirement for fellowship enables us to test whether a Christian group is taking the way that pleases the Lord
On the one hand, every saved person has the desire to exercise his gift and supply others according to the requirement of life
On the other hand, some Christian groups can hinder the believers from manifesting their true function according to the requirement of life
A church that allows the Holy Spirit to exercise authority and has the presence of Christ will be eager to let the saints function and serve
We did not know one another, but after fellowshipping a couple times, we began to know one another in the Lord
His mission was not under the authority of the Holy Spirit, and it had lost Christ's presence and the Holy Spirit's operation
Many things that appear to be the same may not be what we think they are; we can know if there is a difference only by tasting them
One kind of vinegar looks similar to grape juice, but if we taste them we will know the difference; one is sweet, and the other is sour
We may also be in a prayer meeting and hear some very long prayers but not touch any spiritual reality in them
Although some groups call themselves Christian, we can sense only human activity, human ruling, and human position there
Ephesians 2:15-16 clearly shows that the Lord created the Jews and the Gentiles in Himself into one new man through His death
In chapter 2 Paul indicates that the Body is the new man that the Lord produced on the cross; it was created by Him through His cross
The church as the Body of Christ is the new man, a new creation, and it was created by Christ through the cross
There are not many new men; rather, the many believers have been constituted into one new man through Christ's cross
In the new man there cannot be Greek and Jew circumcision and uncircumcision barbarian Scythian slave free man but Christ is all and in all
Verse 9 says that those who are saved, who belong to Christ, and who are in the church have put off the old man
Verse 10 says that we 'have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him'
A church that matches the teaching of the Bible and the inner sense of life is a church that is on the pathway of God
Because the church comes out of Christ and is formed by the life of Christ, the essence of the church is Christ
Before tea is added to a cup of water, the water is plain water; however, after tea is added into the cup, it becomes tea-water
We all need to see that after believing into the Lord, we become Christ-men, and the aggregate of all the Christ-men is the church
The condition of the church today is full of man's element; thus, the church has many things that come from man
When we consider the matter of the church and touch the matter of the church, there cannot be local people or mainlanders
When Christ is gone, the church loses her true nature, and she becomes the church in name only but not in reality
It seems that we could speak concerning anything, but whenever we spoke concerning the church, we could not go on
A person who knows the Lord and lives in the Lord would never be willing to do this ask others to do this or allow others to do this to him
A week later he came and told the brothers, 'I feel that our meeting hall should make a change here and an alteration there'
When the brothers went to visit him, he said that he was ashamed to come because the brothers did not accept his suggestions
Even if we have received the greatest help from a certain brother, we still need to learn not to be so quick to praise
The church is produced through the cross, maintained through the cross, and, even more, expressed through the cross
When the cross is present, man goes out and Christ comes in, and when Christ is present, there is the reality of the church
He will be able to understand the church, touch the nature of the church, know the essence of the church, and discern the church
He will be able to judge the church accurately, and his view of the church will be according to the Bible and life
By the Lord's mercy, we have a desire to serve the Lord; therefore, we must pay attention to our material and our way
When we speak of knowing life and the church, our purpose is to help the brothers and sisters obtain the necessary capital and material
If we want to do the Lord's work, we must know life and the church in order to obtain the material for the service of the Lord
In regard to the Lord's work, many churches are weak and poor because the brothers and sisters do not know how to do things
The condition of some brothers and sisters is very good before the Lord-they love the Lord, they are godly, and they pray frequently
Once a work is placed in their hand, it is finished; once a local church is entrusted to their care, its condition becomes poor
In order to produce sound, there is a need for support from many other things, such as an electrical plug and wires
Similarly, if we are not spiritual and do not pray, and we rely simply on a method of doing things, we will also not have the results
Anyone who feels that he does not know life and does not know how to serve, work, and do things should not feel embarrassed to ask
Those who serve the Lord should have a basic understanding that God requires man to cooperate with Him in His plan
Just as tea-water is produced by the mingling of tea and water, redemption is accomplished by the mingling of God with man
Without God, redemption could not be accomplished, but without man, redemption could not be accomplished either
When our Savior accomplished redemption on the cross, did He redeem us in His status as God or in His status as man?
When He was on the earth, His thoughts, His work, and even the direction of His footsteps were all for redemption
We need to be clear that the One who was born in the manger in Bethlehem and was worshipped by man is God yet man
If a brother is giving a message in himself, this is no different than the practice in Islam, Taoism, or any other religion
When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was the son of Mary and the brother of James, but within He was the Word of God; He was God
The redemption of Christ began from Bethlehem, and the significance of Bethlehem is incarnation, which is the mingling of God and man
From the Old Testament to the New Testament, those who served God were called by God; no one served out of his own desire
Saul, who took the way of religion, persecuted Jesus the Nazarene and was zealous in all kinds of religious activities
One day he saw a great light on his way to Damascus, and he heard a voice from heaven, saying, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me'?
In religion man volunteers to serve God, but in the church man's service comes from a calling that originates from God Himself
In principle, only that which is of God, is called by God, and answers God's demand is the service of the church
Anyone who does not serve God according to this way serves God according to his own imagination, decision, and desire
Although these people say that they are serving God in the church, they are involved only in religious activities
Once we see that God's work requires man's cooperation, we will realize that man has an important place in God's work
Although God the Almighty created the heavens and the earth, those who know God will say, 'God, You can work only when You have us
Throughout the years we have realized from our experience that even though God is almighty, there are things that He cannot do
God needs our cooperation; He cannot do many things in us because, even though He is almighty, there are many limitations in us
God wants to cross from one side to the other through man, but many people have a sign that says Not a Through Street
God's principle in redemption is that man would cooperate with Him and that man would be a bridge for Him to pass through
If we do not have a clear understanding about this point, regardless of how well we speak, our speaking will be useless
While we should not quarrel or argue, is anything gained by only being meek and by refraining from quarreling?
We absolutely must see that God is not looking for meek and perfect people in His work; rather, He needs people who will cooperate with Him
May we not be proud but pray: 'O God, You can work without me, but if You have me, it will be easier for You to work
If we have seen that God needs our cooperation, we will realize that we cannot be independent from God in anything
On the one hand, we know that if God does not have us, He cannot get through; on the other hand, if we do not have Him, we cannot move
If we do not have morality before man regardless of how much knowledge we have before God we will not have any position to speak before men
When we do anything, we should continually contact the Lord within and continually consecrate ourselves to the Lord and cooperate with Him
Even though both were serving God, Abel's offering was not a religious activity because his offering was of God, not of himself
Although he knew God, thought of God, and worshipped God, his offering of a sacrifice was according to himself
He offered the fruit of the ground to God; this was not according to God's charge, commandment, or ordination; it came from his own thought
It may seem that a person works much and is consecrated to God, but his zeal for God can be of man, not of God
Cain was not rejected by God because he sinned but because he did not worship and offer sacrifices according to God's way
We may think that God will accept us and be delighted in us as long as we preach the gospel, serve Him, and fervently work for Him
Genesis shows that Cain did not commit the sin of murder immediately; rather, he committed murder some time later
Just as we fear our temper, do we also fear our preaching of the gospel, our zeal, our service, and our consecration?
One who serves the Lord must be fearful that his work, even the ability to preach and cast out demons, is not a service to God
A religious activity is any service and worship that does not originate from God's revelation, command, and leading
A man may know of God and be zealous in doing things for God according to his own view, but this is only a religious activity
Even the measurements and methods of building the ark were not according to Noah's imagination but to God's determination
Except for his going down to Egypt and falling , all his actions were accepted by God because they were of God as a result of His appearing
Moses feared and knew God, and he was very zealous for the children of Israel because he was educated by his family
Moses was dealt with by God in the wilderness for a period of forty years to the extent that all his human capabilities were taken from him
Being nearly eighty years of age, he surely must have wondered whether he could do anything other than shepherd a flock
Anything that comes from us is a religious activity; only that which comes from God is service according to revelation
He overcame all enemies by trusting in God's grace, and he was made king and lived a peaceful life in the palace
Looking at his situation he felt that he owed something to God because he lived in such a good palace while God dwelt only in the tabernacle
Out of their zeal for God, they build one chapel after another; out of their love for God, they establish one school after another
If David did not fear God, after listening to Nathan's word, he might have thought, 'What are you talking about?
David wanted to build a temple for God, but God said that He would build a house for David from which a kingdom would come forth
We must stop all our opinions, decisions, and ideas; we need to let Him speak, let Him come in, and let Him command
On the Mount of Transfiguration, Peter saw the Lord's face shining like the sun, and His garments became as white as the light
Peter was stirred up in his zeal and said to the Lord, 'I will make three tents here, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah'
On the Mount of Transfiguration, after seeing the Lord's transfiguration, Peter felt good and suggested making three tents
We should not be those whose opinions and ideas come out whenever we serve the Lord; rather, we need to be quiet and listen to His command
When he was Saul, he was not a great sinner; rather, he was a Pharisee who feared God, obeyed the law, and was zealous and pious
All his activities, however, were religious activities without revelation or God's light; they were all based on his ideas
All those who serve God must see a principle from these examples Gods work needs mans cooperation but it does not require mans initiation
At the same time, he truly wanted God, and even God boasted that there was 'none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man'
The unique prerequisite to receiving God's revelation is to stop our speaking, our opinion, our view, and our self
When Peter tried to stop the Lord from going to Jerusalem to suffer, the Lord said to him, 'Get behind Me, Satan!
When we serve in various places to lead and administrate the churches, the greatest problem we encounter is opinions
Question: The most difficult thing in our service to the Lord is that we do not know how to understand God's will and touch God's word
The Lord added a few Taiwanese sisters, and we felt that we should visit them, but two brothers said that we should not go
After we prayed, some had the feeling that we should not be too hasty and go too soon, lest the sisters withdraw
Answer: Those who serve the Lord must thoroughly see, at least once, that their service must originate from God
The basic problem is whether or not we have seen, at least once, that our service to God must originate from Him, not from ourselves
They try to analyze whether their service is according to God's will and whether or not their service will render help
The basic matter is that we must fall down because of God's enlightenment and see that our service to God must come from God, not from us
In the Old Testament David realized that he could not initiate anything in the service of God only after Uzzah was struck by God
When a service is initiated by us according to our opinion, often our enjoyment, preference, and boast are associated with it
The negative test is whether or not we are able to eat and sleep peacefully when our work is not carried out successfully
If we want to determine whether a person's work is of God or of himself, we only need to see if he is anxious in the work
If a person's work is according to God's sending, the sent one will not be anxious, and there will not be many opinions
We serve in many ways, but what the Lord does through us, whether it is a success or a failure, should not give us much feeling
May the Lord have mercy on us and teach us in these matters so that we may see whether our work is of man or of God
If a brother sees an improper condition in the church and is not able to eat or sleep well, this will become a problem
When our heart is set on the Lord's work, we should be able to eat and sleep well, no matter how difficult the environment
If a brother is able to sleep peacefully when the sky is 'falling' simply because he has no real care or concern, he is useless to God
Sometimes after we hand over certain matters to the co-workers, they make excuses when they are asked about what they have done
If one wants to give messages well, work well, and even study the Bible well, he must be serious in whatever he does
When someone entrusts us with a certain matter we must realize that this is a matter of responsibility we should not say that we do not know
We must all learn to bear responsibility and burden before the Lord, and we must also serve the Lord faithfully
Although these matters are not decided by us nor originate from us, we must be absolutely faithful and responsible in what we do
Relying on the Lord actually means that we carry out our service by being joined to the Lord and by being in fellowship with Him
When a person serves his Master, the first question we should ask is whether the service originates from himself or from the Master
If Brother So-and-so is working for the Lord in Pingtong, he must ask himself whether his work is of the Lord or of himself
The first requirement of the work is that we stop; we must stop all our activities and restrain our opinions, thoughts, and ideas
Although these matters are quite meaningful, we may have never considered how they are related to the things revealed in chapter 16
Peter's suggestion to the Lord was according to his own concept, not according to God's purpose for His Son, Christ
The body of a person is his dwelling place; likewise, the Body of Christ, which is the church, is Christ's dwelling place
We can contradict replace and even damage His determination because our proposals thoughts ideas and opinions are quite similar to His will
The first point we must pay attention to in our service is to put ourselves on hold; that is, we must stop our entire being
As soon as God leads us to the Mount of Transfiguration and we see His glory, we have many proposals and opinions
None of these ideas were present before we went to the Mount of Transfiguration; we did not care about such things
Once we have been touched by the Lord and truly receive a spiritual burden we immediately want to use our ideas to do something for the Lord
The Lord's intention is to build His church, that is, to build His church as His dwelling place, but Peter suggested making a tent
We need to restrain our opinions and stop our proposals, but we need to rise up to meet the Lord's need and fulfill the demand in His work
His entire being was stopped so that he could receive God's revelation and see that his service should come only from God, not from man
Even though it is not easy for us to stop, nevertheless, we still must rise up to meet God's need and fulfill His demand once we stop
If his master wants him to sweep the floor, he must obey his master by sweeping the floor before cleaning the windows
A servant also may hear his master's word and know that he needs to sweep the floor but goes to sleep after hearing the word
When facing the vast expanse of the sea while he waited to catch a fish with a stater in its mouth, Peter must have been greatly troubled
After we are saved, we often feel that we are inadequate to meet the Lord's need and cooperate with Him when He wants to use us
Even though some saints talk to people, it is not easy for them to enter into their feeling or to understand them
When the saints come to us, we often do not understand their words, and sometimes our understanding is the exact opposite of what they mean
In particular, when we serve people, we must learn to know them, understand their words, and know their desires
In short, there is much for us to learn in this second point, that is, in the matter of rising up to meet the Lord's need
Not only would they need to change their clothes and make alterations, but even their skin would need to be 'peeled off'
If the Lord arranges for us to be responsible for receiving guests from out of town, we should consider everything related to hospitality
Sometimes a brother who will give a message in the meeting begins to consider what to say only at the last minute
We cannot say that we are fully qualified to meet the Lord's need, but the Lord requires us to be all-capable for His service
One of my classmates became a newspaper reporter when he was about twenty years old, but later he quit his job
Everyone should schedule his time properly, planning when to pray, visit people, clean, prepare for a message, and so forth
Not enough people have risen up, and there are still many things that require our learning and many works that require our labor
At a certain point, the Holy Spirit will impart the words that have entered into our mind and memory into our spirit
The words will impart light, and when we receive this light, it will become life, which is the Spirit, Christ, and God
Concerning the items related to prayer, when you have the inspiration, pray, and when you do not have the inspiration, do not pray
If he needs to learn how to cook a fish when a customer asks, 'Please cook a fish for me,' the customer will starve
If we have not been properly trained and have wasted much time, it will not be easy for us to receive God's command
According to 2 Timothy 2:21, one who serves the Lord must first cleanse himself in order to be useful to the master
We must not have a part in any place that is improper, unclean, and full of gossip so that we will not be defiled in any way
If we prepare ourselves in such a way, we will be able to meet all the Lord's needs when the Holy Spirit commands us
Answer: Many who serve the Lord may not necessarily have the Lord's command when they first begin to pursue the Lord
If we do not learn in our ordinary living, we will not be able to meet the need when we later receive the Lord's command
We should observe our living quarters, our attire, and the way we conduct ourselves in life and handle matters
If we are loose in our daily living, it will be difficult for us to meet the Lord's need precisely when He gives us a command
In matters related to ourselves or others, we always seem to do either too much or not enough; this is not right
We have more than forty brothers and sisters who serve full time, but it is difficult to find one who is accurate
If the character of the brothers and sisters is improper, a task will not be taken seriously, and it will be done carelessly and sloppily
After the trays and cups were used, however, they were not returned to their original place; everything was a mess
When we encounter a certain matter, we will not be confused or timid, but we will have good judgment and boldness
We need to pray for the revival of the church and for the serving ones including the elders deacons and responsible ones in the small groups
We need to pray for the sending of workers for the preaching of the gospel and for the salvation of our friends, relatives, and colleagues
May all of us serving ones enter into the four stages of the experience in life so that we may grow in life unto maturity
It would be best if we could practice the four stages of spiritual life in every place, as our brother fellowshipped
It is possible not to rely on the Lord or look to Him because we are able to work according to our own capability diligence and earnestness
As a proper serving one, we should stop our thoughts, views, and concepts because none of our service should be out of ourselves
When a person has the Lord's command and receives the Lord's revelation, he should immediately rise up to cooperate with the Lord
In the same way, many have the Lord's calling today, but they are unable to rise up because of their personal concerns
It is difficult to find someone who rises up to answer the Lord's call without considering his own needs first
They left their boat and nets and even were not concerned about their father; they simply rose up to meet the Lord's need
We need to solemnly see that when the Lord's calling comes, we must rise up immediately to answer His call and meet His present need
As long as someone is willing to receive His salvation, He saves him; as long as someone is willing to answer His call, He calls him
The problem is not that He does not save or call but that we are unwilling to receive His salvation and to answer His call
As long as someone has the resolve, capability, responsibility, and boldness to take risks, he can do some work
No matter how strong we are and how much we can rise up for the Lord, we should all be weak in every step of our work
Someone suggested that we ask a sister to visit this brother's wife to ask her to exert some influence on him and change his mind
Moses was a great politician, a great military leader, and a great educator; he was a man of great capability who knew how to play politics
He had lived in the Egyptian palace , and he had led the children of Israel to come out of Egypt and cross the Red Sea, and they obeyed him
Moses was saying, 'O God, You must forgive them; even if You do not want to forgive them, You still must forgive them'
Moses negotiated with God, and eventually 'Jehovah repented of the evil which He said He would do to His people' , and Moses was given rest
We must always remember that serving the Lord is a matter of the Lord's work and of meeting His need in coordination with Him
Some people no matter how many times the Lord calls cannot rise up they are either concerned for their wives or concerned for their children
It is difficult for those who cannot rise up to rise up, but it is also difficult for those who have risen up to fall down
Only those who can stop in God's work, rise up in His call, and fall down in His service can serve God and administrate the church
When we want them to stop, they cannot stop, but once they stop, they go to an extreme and even stop meditating and praying
We must learn to stop ourselves in the Lord's work, to rise up in the Lord's command, and to continually fall down in His service
No matter how much the children of Israel tormented Moses he was willing to rise up but he also always fell down before God and let Him work
To be prudent is to escape the difficulty and harm that come from others; to be guileless is not to hurt others
A brother once said that the strictness of our interview with people before their baptism should be re-examined
The strictness of the interview is not the point; rather, we must be able to sense that a person has met the Lord when we interview him
If someone has met the Lord, he may outwardly say that he does not believe, but he cannot help but believe inwardly
Every saved one has met the Lord, but the difference is that some have met the Lord in a strong way, and others in only a more moderate way
Our concern is not whether someone has met the Lord, but whether, after meeting the Lord, he is serious, quick to respond, and absolute
Our problem is not related to being unable to touch and meet Him but in being too slow and dull in answering His call
Through the infusing of his parents, Moses had the godly thought and concept that he needed to rescue the children of Israel
At a certain time, He arranged for us to be in the proper environment and did not let us go; it was at that time that we answered His call
In a broad sense whatever God does in this age through the church the saints and the workers through their service to Him is the work of God
In a narrow sense, there are a few, such as Paul, who are chosen and called by God and commissioned by the Lord to do His work
Before bearing responsibility, we should first ask whether God has moved and entrusted this responsibility to us
A genuinely spiritual person usually has much to minister in the meetings because he is joined to the Lord in fellowship
If we all actively exercise our spirit to fellowship with the Lord in spirit, we will have something to say, and the meeting will be living
We should actively fellowship with the Lord in spirit in every meeting and not passively wait for Him to move our deadened spirit
If our spirit is living, we will cause the entire meeting to touch the Spirit whether we are praying or reading the Bible
Strictly speaking, in order to be useful in the Lord's hand and according to God's heart, we must pass through much breaking by God
Breaking removes what we originally have in our natural being, changing our original appearance and altering our original condition
We may have numerous good and noble things, but God still must tear down and destroy these good and noble things
For a period of time we have been speaking of the exercise of the discipline of the Holy Spirit and the breaking of the cross
God's work of breaking often is deeper and heavier than the discipline of the Holy Spirit and the breaking of the cross
Since we are there for just a few days, we bear the situation even though the height of a door or the size of a bed does not fit our height
What we are originally, including our original appearance and taste, does not match God and is not compatible with God
We need to be broken in order to be useful in God's hand because we will match God only when our natural things have been removed
We may be able to clearly speak of the doctrine of the cross, but unless we are broken, we will not have any trace of the cross in our being
Calls the things not being as being refers to God's creation, and gives life to the dead refers to God's resurrection power
Once it passes through death, it will enter into resurrection; once it is resurrected, it can attain to God's goal
Without being broken, it cannot pass through death; without entering into death and passing through death, it cannot enter into resurrection
When a brother matches our disposition, we submit to him, and when a brother allows us to vent our anger on him, we submit to him
We truly do not know ourselves; only those who have truly submitted to others know the rebelliousness of their natural man
From this we can see that whoever has not been broken cannot be trusted; at a certain time he will rise up to oppose
Although Moses is of great importance to the Jews, he is not called their father; only Abraham and David are called their fathers
In other words, God could become flesh and come among men because He gained the cooperation of two men on earth-Abraham and David
If a garment does not fit, we must tear it apart and alter it so that we will feel comfortable and happy when we wear it
When Samuel went to anoint one of the sons of Jesse, Jesse kept seven sons with him but sent David away to tend the sheep
On that day there was not only to be an anointing of a king but also good food, yet Jesse still sent his youngest son away
After the seven sons of Jesse passed before Samuel, the Spirit of Jehovah said to Samuel that He had not chosen any of them
The entire family knew that a prophet was coming and that there was going to be a feast, yet David was sent to tend the sheep
All our judgments concerning being right or wrong are expressions of our flesh; all our arguments only manifest our true condition
After more battles, women came out of the towns of Israel singing and dancing with tambourines and joyful songs and stringed instruments
They sang to one another as they played, and they said, 'Saul has struck down his thousands; / But David, his ten thousands'
David was not afraid of Saul, but he feared God, so he only cut off a corner of Saul's cloak as a proof to Saul
Even with doing just this, however, David's heart smote him because he had done something out of his flesh to vindicate and glorify himself
One day God arranged a situation in which David fell, causing him to usurp the wife of Uriah and to plot to kill her husband
If David's natural godliness had not been broken because of this fall, his perfection according to the old creation would have remained
God could not allow a person who was naturally godly to live in hypocrisy before Him; thus, He had to deal with the situation
Someone who has never been pressed, mistreated, broken, depreciated, or wronged by people is raw, wild, and useless to God
When we are treated well, appreciated, praised, and exalted by others, we gladly receive the discipline of the Holy Spirit
If we possess a good attribute, we want to make it known and testify to others so that everyone in the world will know about it
Rather, he lived before God, hid in God, and learned many lessons in secret-lessons that were hidden from his father and his brothers
Only those who are broken can be according to God's heart and serve Him, serve people, and minister to people according to God's heart
If we have truly seen what it means to be broken, we will realize that everything that comes upon us can cause us to worship God
We can let go of and accept others' despising, disagreements, and ill-treatment; we can even let go of their high regard and welcome
The New Testament begins by saying, 'The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham'
At that time one of the sisters who served the Lord with us said, 'Perhaps Brother Lee has made a huge mistake before the Lord
The first friend thought that Job had erred because God would never discipline a faultless person, but Job said that he had not erred
On the negative side, Job's friends said that he had erred, whereas on the positive side, Job said that he had not erred
These sufferings came to Job in order tear down a person who was godly and blameless and who gave no ground for Satan's accusations
The calamities that came upon Job were not for dealing with his errors or sins but for dealing with Job himself
It was only at this point that Job knew that God struck and afflicted him because He wanted to tear down the natural wholeness of his being
He said, 'Until the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked and buffeted and wander without a home'
According to my concept, since he was so faithful and perfect, he should not have had a need for food, clothing, and peace
According to the record of the Bible, Paul not only suffered for the Lord inwardly but also was in want outwardly
Even some from the church in Corinth, which he had established personally, said that Paul was crafty and that he took them by guile
None of us can be more faithful or have more faith than Paul, but even such a faithful one as Paul was always in lack
The most godly and irreproachable man in the Old Testament was Job; the most faithful man in the New Testament was Paul
The stories of Job and Paul reveal that God is doing a continual breaking work in those who pursue Him and serve Him
Only by being broken can Christ's life have a channel to be released; only by being broken can Christ's life swallow up all our death
After believing in the Lord, the feeling that we have in our sufferings is different from the feeling we had before we believed in the Lord
Sometimes we may not be happy with God because it seems that we have been deceived; nevertheless, even this feeling is good
Every believer can testify that it is truly joyful and satisfying to follow the Lord, even with all the difficulties and pressures
In the Bible there is no record of Esau suffering anything; on the contrary, he married whom he liked and obtained what he wanted
Jacob's life shows that a natural person must pass through breaking in order to become Israel, that is, a prince of God
He was full of schemes; he knew how to deal with his mother, father, uncle, wives, children, and God; he even wrestled with God
Jacob knew how to deal with people, but in his old age, his entire being was changed; he became a man without any plans
If this is our case, when we stand before a beggar, we will not think that we are greater than he is or have more than he has
The New Jerusalem is a structure built with pure gold, pearl, and precious stones, all of which refer to God Himself
In terms of being created, we are men of clay; in terms of being fallen, we are men of grass and wood; that is, we are men of the flesh
Corinthians 3:12 says that those who work for God should not build with wood, grass, and stubble but with gold, silver, and precious stones
God's breaking work in us is not His evil treatment of us but rather his kind treatment and special care for us
God will not allow someone in His hand to be the object of constant attention and flattery like a pretty flower in a vase
Even though they may not oppose us or say anything against us outwardly, they will despise and criticize us inwardly
Please remember that the ultimate benefit that the Lord of resurrection wants us to gain comes from the judgment and criticism of men
Sooner or later, God will tear down what is praiseworthy in us and cause us to be base and reproachable in man's eyes
The anointing and the discipline of the Holy Spirit are good works of God, but the harshest work of God is the breaking
Suppose the Lord allows a certain brother who is serving the Lord in the church to be opposed by another brother
Although he has a large capacity, there is no wound or opening in him, so life cannot flow out from within him
When a person who is according to the principle of magnanimity encounters circumstances, he will pray, 'O Lord, enlarge my capacity'
Our wife may trouble us, but we should not respond with magnanimity or tolerance, because this is not the way of a Christian
The way of a Christian is to prostrate ourselves before God when our wife troubles us and to ask, 'O God, what needs to be broken in me'?
We should have the light and the teaching of the anointing within; we need revelation within to see the area that God wants to break in us
We need to receive God's 'axes' and 'knives,' that is, the troubles from our wife in the areas that God wants to break us
Rather, we should learn to prostrate ourselves in God's light and receive his breaking and tearing down without trying to cover ourselves
When everyone praises a forbearing brother whose wife quarrels with him all day, we should not follow them to praise him
Church A: In general, the saints here love the Lord but do not have a solid foundation and, therefore, greatly need guidance
Even the responsible ones for various services have not been perfected so that they can truly bear burdens in a practical way
Over the past year we have paid much attention to the gospel and have also done some edifying work, but the results have not been apparent
Because the spiritual weight of the leading brothers and sisters is inadequate, our impact is low, and we have little supply
Church B: Last year we focused on the aspect of service, but since the beginning of this year, we have turned our attention to the gospel
There are problems in the service because many of the brothers and sisters have been saved for only a short time
In our service meetings, many opinions were expressed, and there was no mutual understanding; therefore, we had to stop
In terms of numbers, we have more than five hundred saints and as many as two hundred attending the Lord's Day meeting
According to the human perspective, the outward tabernacle of the church looks good, but the spiritual weight within is lacking
In terms of spiritual pursuit, it is very difficult to bring the brothers and sisters into the reality of pursuing
If we are careless, some of our fellowship related to service will turn into mere friendships, which is a kind of leaven
We feel deeply that our learning in the service does not carry much weight because we do not have any real exercise and experience
A sanatorium with a total of three thousand beds in five different locations is nearby, and a few sisters work there
Some saints also are relatives of the patients, and there is a total of about two hundred saints meeting there
Concerning our service, we have a few who always serve, but we have been unable to perfect more saints to coordinate with us
In all of the brothers' fellowship we should all see the common principle that our work is always based on our person
What we gain in the work does not depend on how much we hope and expect; it depends on what we are in our being
Many things cannot be carried out or done well simply by our endeavoring, nor can they be successfully accomplished by our striving
Even if we have not done so well or done so much, we do not need to be discouraged, because discouragement serves no purpose
On the other hand we must devote a great deal of effort to work on ourselves including the way we conduct ourselves and the way we do things
The result of our work is based absolutely on the weight of our work, and the weight of our work is based absolutely on what we are
All of these expectations are futile and should be condemned because they all come from man's natural concept and vain imagination
Conversely, if we ignore these points and concentrate all our efforts on working, our work will fail and amount to nothing
If we do this, we will be equipped practically to know the truth and be well-trained in conducting ourselves and in doing things
We do not know how many churches will be established through us and how many saints will be edified through us; this is up to the Lord
Learning is the real work; the real work of serving the Lord is ninety-five percent learning, and five percent doing
Our sight should never be set on results but on how we conduct ourselves, deal with God's life, and handle matters
In other words, we put in less effort related to our conduct and to doing things than we do in giving messages
Our work is unable to produce serving ones because we are inadequate in the way we conduct ourselves and do things
If we serve in a certain place for two or three years without producing an elder and some serving ones, it is because of what we are
We must be diligent to know the truth, and we must labor to learn to be skillful in the way we conduct ourselves and do things
Giving messages can stir up people's emotions to love the Lord but cannot enable those who have been stirred up to be perfected and useful
On the other hand, we have not been doing a proper perfecting work on some of the saints who have a heart for the Lord
If there is a need for these ones to go to another area of the work, their locality immediately will have a shortage of useful ones
If our work cannot produce useful ones, the workers will be entangled and unable to cooperate with the move of the Holy Spirit
After the students enroll, the real problem involves how to teach the students and how to arrange the classes, dormitories, and teachers
There are two basic principles: first, we must learn, and second, learning requires that we make a sufficient effort
A few years ago we did something very risky in the work in order to care for the needs of all the churches on the island of Taiwan
There was a thought that as long as the saints loved the Lord and served God zealously, money would pour in from other countries
Wherever saints rise up to serve God as a local church, the local saints should bear the responsibility for the service and expenses
If the saints in a locality do not have that much material offering, the locality should not have much service
In the Old Testament all the furnishings in God's tabernacle came from the Israelites; they did not come down from heaven
If he is financially able, he can build two small rooms to serve as the church business office; if not, he does not need to do anything
When the first group of saints began breaking bread in Tsinan, they broke bread in a cemetery on a remote hill
At that time they were only poor students; later some of them sold their clothing and gradually saved up some money for a meeting place
We must let the brothers and sisters see that a church must be self-sufficient financially in order to rise up to function
All the churches in Taiwan have the ability to care for the needs of the work and the workers, and our heart to serve is unquestionable
When there is a conference, the work has a great number of expenses; we even take care of the transportation of the participants
All the churches should have a normal fellowship regarding finances unless we believe that the work is not of God
Because of our special geographic location and the great mobility of people, there is a great need for the preaching of the gospel
The whole church has been praying and fellowshipping hoping to strengthen the meetings in the homes but in the end it is difficult to spread
We must confess that the main hindrance is that there is too much of the human element and too little of the element of Christ
We repent before the Lord and hope that in the fellowship we may be able to see the naturalness and complexity of our self
Church C: Overall, we pay much attention to ministering the word, but we do not have much action because the saints are not able to keep up
The focus of the work is on the preaching of the gospel, but the saints do not have much of a heart for the gospel
Church D: The focus of our work in the past was on preaching the gospel, but the gospel has not yet been widely spread
At the beginning we gained several Taiwanese saints, but because we do not have a Taiwanese brother to lead them, they were all lost
As far as meetings are concerned, there are fifty to sixty who meet during the week and over a hundred who meet on the Lord's Day
We rent our meeting hall, but because the landlord is quite unreasonable, the saints find it difficult to bear
There are seven to eight saints who specifically give themselves to the Lord, so the Lord has some spread here
The brothers who moved the trees last year uprooted the trees without leaving very much soil attached to the roots
The person who moved the trees this year not only kept the trees alive but even kept their leaves from falling
Rather, it depends on our ability to grasp the secret of doing everything in a practical and thorough way without being loose
Some spoke of a lack of financial cooperation from the church, and while this may be a reason, it is not the main reason
From the fellowship of these few brothers, the Lord has shown us that our problems are related to nothing other than our looseness
If this brother was earnest in doing things, regardless of his skills, he should have started sweeping from the corners
If we know how to work, our financial difficulties will not keep us from being able to 'dig' out money when it is needed
It seems as if they are squandering their time day after day even though there are at least three and a half full-timers
We must let the saints see that many things are upon us and that we are not able to cope; rather, we need their help
If this is the case, no one in the church will say, 'Why do the young serving ones not do anything but live on the church's support'?
When all the saints are doing something, but we are standing around and doing nothing, what kind of feeling will they have?
When they come to the Lord's Day meeting and see that we are reading Genesis 28, inwardly they may say, 'Why does he not find a job?
In the meeting hall some saints were cleaning, some were preparing the meeting area, and some were preparing meals
We should never think that we can serve God as long as we do not watch movies, play mah-jongg, or quarrel with people
We will have a regular training for the responsible brothers and sisters from various churches and district meetings
As far as qualifications are concerned, elders who want to join the training from all the churches will be accepted in principle
We will lead them to minister the word, to visit people, to take care of practical matters, and to read the Bible
In the state of confusion concerning the church today, we should have a proper attitude toward other Christian groups
Apart from us, there are thousands upon thousands of saved ones, and among them there are many who genuinely love the Lord
On one hand, we may receive some spiritual help from them; on the other hand, we may grant them some spiritual help
If others render us help, we should be humble to receive the help, and we must be willing to render help to others according to their needs
On one hand, we acknowledge that there are brothers and sisters in Christian organizations and that we should have fellowship with them
Although we do not endorse this, there is no regulation among us about it, and this is not an item of our faith
At that time there were many Christian youth fellowships preaching the gospel at various campuses, but we had a different attitude
The gospel work at the National Chiao Tung University was very effective, and many brothers and sisters were pursuing the Lord
Many brothers at the Medical College of National Defense and even at the National Central University in Nanking were saved
In the matter of leading the saved ones to be edified and to know the Lord's life, we believe that you are the same as we
Since we were raised up by the Lord in China some twenty years ago, we have been opposed and troubled by Christianity
In terms of practice, however, he belonged to an organization that we could not be a part of and have rejected for over twenty years
He was clear that we rejected their form of organized Christianity, not the gospel or the truth that they preached
We do not endorse the saints' contact with these organizations, but this is not a matter of exercising control over the saints
When people listen to him, they may be touched by his eloquence, but in fact, they unknowingly have been damaged
We have no intention to exercise control over the brothers and sisters by preventing them from receiving help from others
Toward others, we do not need to interfere, and toward ourselves, we should faithfully follow the light we have received from the Lord
The Lord has commissioned us with a work in Taiwan that we will have a difficult time finishing even if we doubled our manpower and time
As long as they have not committed any obvious sin against the Lord, they can have fellowship at the Lord's table
All the missions and denominations have a centralized place for their finances, and then from the center, money is distributed
We should never think that the church in Taipei is the headquarters and the financial center of the churches in Taiwan
These ones should rise up to serve the Lord, but they also should be clear that those who serve the Lord must take care of their daily needs
If we are shown mercy and have a desire to serve the Lord, we must deal with this matter before the Lord thoroughly and directly
If we are stricken by poverty or hunger, we should not approach people for help, because no one is responsible for us
When we rise up to serve God we must realize that a person center or organization has not hired us rather the Lord Himself has called us
We need to deal with the Lord, exercising our spirit to draw near to Him and exercising our faith to trust in Him
If a worker receives more offerings, he should not save them for his personal use but should care for the needs of other co-workers
Since all the coworkers labor together for the Lords work we should not think that the Lords abundant support is only for our personal use
The Lord wants us to be strong in this matter so that we will not fall under man's control or into a sense of inferiority
Paul was the leading one among the Gentile believers, and Peter and John were the leading ones among the Jewish believers
We should not say that we can be loose because the churches are financially independent and because we do not have a center of work
In this way we will learn to have proper fellowship and spiritual supply without involving human control or methods
As we fellowshipped earlier, all those who join the training must be those who have the capacity to be co-workers
We need to take care of the needs of the churches in our localities and the needs of the trainees in a balanced way
We need to decide, based on the needs, who should stay in the churches and who should come and join the training
If some could come only at the beginning but cannot stay until the completion of the training, we should not consider them
A person should be clear whether or not he should leave his job permanently; we cannot replace the function of his conscience
According to our budget, those who come to the training must take care of their own expenses; we have no way to take care of them
