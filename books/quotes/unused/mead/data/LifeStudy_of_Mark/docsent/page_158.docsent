   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE FIFTY-FOUR A LIFE FULLY ACCORDING TO AND FOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY 3 Scripture Reading: Mark 1:1, 10-11; 9:1-9; Acts 21:18-24 THE SUBSTANCE OF GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing message we pointed out an important difference between the Epistle of James and the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In James we see something of a life that is not fully according to and for God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Mark we see a life that is fully according to and for God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In fact, the life presented in the Gospel of Mark is the reality, substance, and pattern of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Perhaps you are wondering what our reason is for saying that in the Gospel of Mark we see a life that is the substance of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We say this because the life the Lord Jesus lived was the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the Gospel of Mark, there is no indication that the Lord Jesus was living merely in a way to keep the law, that He did certain things simply because they were required by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, the Gospel of Mark does not indicate that the Lord Jesus only lived a good life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How, then, did the Lord live?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus lived God, and He expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whatever He did was God s doing from within Him and through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that all that the Lord Jesus did was not merely the keeping of the law or the doing of good in an ethical sense.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus was a Person who lived God and expressed Him in all that He said and did.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>LIVING IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I can assure you that there has never been another life like that of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The biographies of other people may indicate that they were good or that they tried to keep the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the Lord Jesus is the only One who lived God and expressed Him in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Of course, the Lord never broke the law, and He never did anything wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nevertheless, the crucial matter regarding His life was not that He kept the law or that He did good.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The crucial point is that He lived God and expressed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord s living was not in the kingdom of law-keeping or of doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He lived altogether in another kingdom, the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do you live in the kingdom of God?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may say that we live in the kingdom of God, but we may live in another realm in a practical way day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead of living in the kingdom of God, we may live in the kingdoms of law, ethics, or morality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Throughout the centuries, many saints have lived in these kingdoms and not in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Especially since the time of John Wesley, there has been much talk among Christians concerning holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some regard holiness as a matter of so-called sinless perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Others think that holiness is related to regulations concerning such matters as the style of dress.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Regulations such as these are not in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They belong to another kingdom, perhaps the kingdom of good.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those who live in the kingdom of God have God as their life, and they live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God lives in them, through them, and out of them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result, they live a life that expresses nothing other than God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is the real holiness, morality, and ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, to have God as life and to live Him is to live in a way that is higher than human morality or ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE LIFE THAT PRODUCES THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only the kind of life that lives God and expresses Him produces the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Any other way of living always damages the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Throughout its history the church has been divided not mainly by evil things, but primarily by good things that are not God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If all Christians would care only for God Himself and for having Him as life and living Him, there would not be any divisions among believers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The reason there would be no divisions if we all cared only for God Himself is that God is one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Ephesians 4:4-6 Paul speaks of the one Body, the one Spirit, the one Lord, and the one God and Father.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we see the oneness in Ephesians 4, we shall know how to keep the oneness of the Body of Christ, a oneness that is actually the Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we all have God as our holiness, righteousness, and everything to us, there will not be any divisions among us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, if we have something other than God, there will be divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Anything that we have other than God Himself is a factor of division.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is God s intention in His recovery to bring us back to His New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The pattern for God s New Testament economy is found in the life of the Lord Jesus, as presented in the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Not even the writings of Paul present us a complete pattern, because at least once Paul himself was distracted from the New Testament economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, not even Paul is a complete pattern of God s economy.</S>
