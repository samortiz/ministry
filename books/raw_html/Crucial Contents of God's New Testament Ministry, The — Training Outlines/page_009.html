3:21-26; 9:30-31.</li>		<li>It is through God's fulfilling of all the requirements of His righteous law on sinners by Christ's redemptive death on the cross&#151;Gal. 3:13; 1 Pet. 2:24; 2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 9:12.</li>		<li>It was accomplished in the physical realm of Christ's earthly ministry by the Christ in the flesh.</li>		<li>It results objectively in God's:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Forgiveness of the believers' sins&#151;Luke 24:47; Eph. 1:7.</li>			<li>Washing away the believers' sins&#151;Heb. 1:3.</li>			<li>Justifying the believers&#151;Rom. 3:24-25.</li>			<li>Reconciling the believers who were His enemies to Himself&#151;Rom. 5:10a.</li>			<li>Sanctifying the believers in their position unto Himself as His holy people&#151;1 Cor. 1:2; Heb. 13:12; 10:29.</li>			<li>Thereby qualifying and positioning the believers to enter into the grace of God for the accomplishment of the purpose of God's salvation.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>God's judicial redemption is the procedure of God's complete salvation for the believers to participate in God's organic salvation as the purpose of the complete salvation of God&#151;Rom. 5:21.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>God's organic salvation is the organic aspect of God's complete salvation:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>It is through the life of God&#151;Rom. 1:17b; Acts 11:18; Rom. 5:10b, 17b, 18b, 21b.</li>		<li>As the purpose of God's salvation, it accomplishes all that God wants to achieve in the believers in His economy through His divine life.</li>		<li>It results subjectively in the believers' regeneration, feeding, dispositional sanctification, renewing, transformation, building up, conformation, and glorification.</li>		<li>All of the items of God's organic salvation are carried out not by the Christ in the flesh in His earthly ministry judicially and objectively but by the Christ as the life-giving Spirit in His heavenly ministry organically and subjectively.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>God's organic salvation:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Regeneration is the propagation of the divine life:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Regeneration is the center of God's entire salvation and the commencement of God's salvation in its organic aspect.</li>		<li>It is to regenerate and re-create the redeemed believers in their spirit by the Spirit of God&#151;John 3:6b.</li>		<li>It is through the resurrection of Christ that He may impart His life into them as the authority for them to be the children of God, begotten of God as His species&#151;1 Pet. 1:3; John 1:12-13.</li>		<li>Through regeneration the believers have the eternal, divine life of God in addition to their natural, human life&#151;John 3:15, 36.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Feeding in shepherding is the nourishment of the divine life:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Feeding is the continuation of regeneration through Christ's shepherding His flock by nourishing and cherishing that His sheep may grow in the divine life unto maturity&#151;Eph. 5:29; John 10:10-11, 14-16; 21:15-17; Heb. 13:20; 1 Pet. 5:4; 2:25.</li>		<li>Feeding nourishes His newborn babes (new believers) that they may grow and be saved gradually through the supply of the milk in the word of God&#151;1 Pet. 2:2.</li>		<li>Feeding supplies His growing believers with the solid word, which is the Spirit of life&#151;Heb. 5:14; John 6:63.</li>		<li>Feeding results in the believers' maturity in the divine life unto transformation and conformation to the image of Christ&#151;2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2; 8:29.</li>		<li>Feeding is also by the believers through the mutual shepherding for the building up of the Body of Christ for the accomplishment of God's eternal economy and the achievement of God's eternal purpose&#151;Eph. 4:11-16; John 21:15-17; 1 Pet. 5:2-3.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Dispositional sanctification constitutes the believers with God's divine nature:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>It is an inward sanctifying of the believers who are growing in the divine life by the working of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of life, in their disposition&#151;Rom. 15:16; 8:2.</li>		<li>The believers are sanctified with the divine, holy nature of God for them to be holy unto God and thus fulfill God's purpose in choosing us&#151;2 Pet. 1:4; Eph. 1:4.</li>		<li>Dispositional sanctification implies transformation&#151;Rom. 6:19, 22.</li>		<li>Sanctification will ultimately be manifested in the New Jerusalem as the holy city&#151;Rev. 21:2, 10; 22:19.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Renewing is the process of God's new creation:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The believers are spontaneously renewed in their spiritual life when they are sanctified by the Holy Spirit&#151;2 Cor. 5:17.</li>		<li>Renewing is the continuation of the washing of regeneration (Titus 3:5) and is based upon the ongoing process of sanctification, making the believers new.</li>		<li>It is carried out:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>By the renewing Spirit mingling with the believers' regenerated spirit indwelt by Christ as one spirit to spread into the believers' mind to renew their entire being as a member of the new man&#151;Titus 3:5; Eph. 4:23.</li>			<li>By the believers' walking in the newness of life in resurrection&#151;Rom. 6:4; Eph. 4:22-24; Phil. 1:19-21.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>It is through the consuming by the believers' environmental sufferings&#151;2 Cor. 4:16.</li>		<li>The believers must be thoroughly and absolutely renewed that they may be practically the genuine new creation of God and for God&#151;Gal. 6:15.</li>		<li>Renewing causes the believers to be new as the New Jerusalem&#151;Rev. 21:2.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Transformation is the metabolic process in the divine life:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>This process transforms the believers' entire being, beginning from the renewing of the mind, that they may fully participate in God's divinity&#151;Rom. 12:2b.</li>		<li>It is not any kind of outward correction or adjustment but a kind of metabolism, by the addition of the element of the divine life of Christ into their being, to be expressed outwardly in the image of Christ.</li>		<li>It is accomplished by the Lord Spirit (the pneumatic Christ) transforming the believers into the image of the glory of Christ&#151;2 Cor. 3:18.</li>		<li>The believers should live and walk by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25) and walk according to the mingled spirit (Rom. 8:4b), that the divine life of Christ may have the way to regulate them and transform them into the image of the Lord in glory.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Building up is the joining and knitting together in the divine life:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>God's building is brought forth through the joining and knitting together by the working of the transforming Spirit on the believers&#151;Eph. 4:16.</li>		<li>It is the issue of the believers' growing into the Head, Christ, in all things&#151;Eph. 4:15.</li>		<li>This is the building up of the Body of Christ to consummate the building of the holy city, New Jerusalem&#151;Eph. 4:16; Rev. 3:12; 21:10-11.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Conformation is the maturity in the divine life:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Conformation is the consummation of the believers' regeneration, feeding, sanctification, renewing, and transformation in the divine life&#151;Rom. 8:29.</li>		<li>Conformation is when the believers have matured in the divine life by the maturing Spirit in their spirit to be a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ&#151;Col. 1:28; Eph. 4:13.</li>		<li>Conformation is to be conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son&#151;Phil. 3:10; 1:19-21a; 1 John 3:2.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Glorification is the full manifestation of God's complete salvation:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>In regeneration God seals the regenerated believers with His Spirit unto the day of redemption&#151;Eph. 1:13; 4:30.</li>		<li>The matured believers will be glorified from within through the lifelong saturation with the glory of God and from without through their being brought into God's glory&#151;Eph. 4:30; 2 Thes. 1:10; Rom. 8:23, 30; Heb. 2:10.</li>		<li>The glorification of the matured believers is the top portion of their divine sonship in God's organic salvation, which they received at the time of their regeneration&#151;Gal. 4:5; Rom. 8:23.</li>		<li>The redemption of the believers' body is the transfiguration of their body at the Lord's coming back&#151;Phil. 3:20-21.</li>		<li>Through glorification God realizes the ful-fillment of His eternal purpose&#151;the New Jerusalem&#151;the crystallization of the union and mingling of the processed and consummated Triune God with His regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite elect.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol>
