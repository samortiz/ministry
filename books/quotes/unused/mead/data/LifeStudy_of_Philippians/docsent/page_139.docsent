   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FORTY-SEVEN THE CONSTANT SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN OUR PRACTICAL LIFE Scripture Reading: Phil 1:19-21; 2:12-16</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the book of Philippians, there is a salvation which is constant in our practical life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To say that this salvation is constant means that it is a salvation we may experience every day, every hour, and every moment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A SUBJECTIVE SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>FOR MAGNIFYING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Philippians 1 and 2 Paul uses the word salvation twice.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1:19 he says, For I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 2:12 he says to the saints in Philippi, Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The salvation in 1:19 denotes the salvation Paul experienced during his imprisonment in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A typical Jew, he was held a prisoner in Rome, far from his native land.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Using today s terms, Paul was held captive by the Roman imperialists.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It certainly was a shameful, dishonorable thing for a Jew to be held in a Roman prison.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Most of the time, Paul was probably chained to a guard.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It certainly must have been an insult for an educated upperclass Jew to be chained to a guard in a Roman prison.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was also dishonorable for such an apostle of the Lord Jesus to be imprisoned in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, Paul testified that his situation would turn out to him for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 1:19 Paul is not referring to eternal salvation, the salvation from hell and the judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That salvation is objective.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What Paul has in mind here is a very subjective, experiential salvation, a salvation experienced not once for all, but moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Paul said that he expected his situation to turn out for his salvation, he did not have in mind release from prison.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some readers of the book of Philippians may think that Paul s expectation was that, through the prayers of the saints, especially those in Philippi, he would be released from prison.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, according to the grammatical construction of 1:19-21, this cannot be the meaning of salvation here.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The salvation in verse 19 is related to Paul s word in verse 20 about not being put to shame in anything and about Christ being magnified in his body, whether through life or through death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, in verse 20 we have the definition of the salvation mentioned in verse 19.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, salvation here consists of not being put to shame in anything, but of magnifying Christ in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Salvation here certainly does not mean release from prison.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, it means that, no matter how difficult Paul s situation was and no matter how insulting, he would not be put to shame in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, Christ would be magnified in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not even being chained to a guard would hinder Paul from magnifying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is what we mean by constant salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, the word constant is not adequate to describe the salvation in 1:19.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All our words are related to our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a certain matter does not exist in our culture, we shall not have a word for it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The salvation here is altogether wonderful and marvelous, and no word is sufficient to describe it fully.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not even in prison would Paul be put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead of being put to shame, he knew that he would magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This was Paul s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Suppose instead of rejoicing in the Lord, Paul wept about his situation and complained, saying, I m an educated Jew and also an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, called, commissioned, and sent by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now I m in prison chained to a guard.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How terrible!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If Paul had wept and complained, he would have been put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, Paul did not weep or complain.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the contrary, he rejoiced in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Anyone who visited him in prison may have been astonished and amazed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Perhaps Paul even testified to the jailer that he was happy in the Lord and rejoiced in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Possibly Paul s enjoyment of Christ in prison may have been a factor in bringing Onesimus, a runaway slave, to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Anyone who observed Paul in prison would have seen a man praising the Lord and rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When Paul was imprisoned in Philippi, he and Silas sang praises to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Acts 16:23-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To be sure, the Philippian believers knew of Paul s experience there in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They knew that the praises of Paul and Silas brought in a great earthquake.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No doubt, while in prison in Rome, Paul also exercised himself to sing praises to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Far from being found complaining or weeping, he could be found rejoicing in the Lord, singing praises to Him, and testifying concerning Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is constant salvation.</S>
