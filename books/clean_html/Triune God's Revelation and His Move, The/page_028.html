<h2 class=head1>II. THE REVELATIONS</h2><p>In the previous message we saw the facts concerning the Triune God’s revelation and His move in the New Testament. In this message we want to see the revelations concerning these facts.<h2 class=head2>A. The Triune God’s Incarnation</h2><p>The Triune God’s incarnation is to bring God into man, mingling God with man to make God one with man both in the divine life and divine nature (but not in the Godhead) and in the human life and human nature (John 1:14; 1 Tim. 3:16).<h2 class=head2>B. The Human Living of the Man Jesus</h2><p>The human living of the man Jesus on earth is to express God in man through His divine attributes expressed in the human virtues of Jesus. This is the real revelation of Jesus as a man living on this earth. The phrases through His divine attributes and expressed in the human virtues of Jesus are priceless. The reality is the divine attributes, and the expression is the human virtues. God has many attributes, and all of these attributes are the items of what God is. God is love and light. Love and light are two of God’s attributes. With God they are the attributes. With man they are the virtues. Christ lived out God’s attributes expressed in His human virtues.<h2 class=head2>C. The Crucifixion of Jesus Christ</h2><h2 class=head3>1. To Terminate the Old Creation with Its Involvements</h2><p>The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is to terminate the old creation with all its involvements—Satan, the world, sin, the old man, and the law with its ordinances (Heb. 2:14; John 12:31; John 1:29; Rom. 6:6; Eph. 2:15). From my youth I was told only that Jesus was crucified and died for my sins. But according to the New Testament revelation, the crucifixion of Jesus Christ implies many things. The entire old creation with all of its involvements was crucified on the cross.<h2 class=head3>2. To Release the Divine Life</h2><p>The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is also to release the divine life from Jesus’ human shell for the dispensing of the divine life into the believers of Christ (John 12:24). Jesus said He was like a grain of wheat, and God’s divine life was contained within the shell of this grain, the shell of Christ’s humanity. The cross broke this shell to release the divine life so that this divine life could be dispensed into Christ’s believers.<h2 class=head2>D. Christ’s Resurrection</h2><h2 class=head3>1. To Designate (Uplift) His Humanity into the Divine Sonship</h2><p>Christ’s resurrection from among the dead after His crucifixion is to designate (uplift) His humanity into the divine sonship, producing Him to be the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 1:4; Acts 13:33). We have to learn to speak this kind of language when we go out to preach the gospel.<h2 class=head3>2. Making Him the Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>Christ’s resurrection is to make Him, the last Adam, the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b).<h2 class=head3>3. To Regenerate All the People Chosen by God</h2><p>Christ’s resurrection is to regenerate all the people chosen by God, making them the children (sons) of God, members of Christ for the constitution of the organic Body of Christ (1 Pet. 1:3; John 1:12; Rom. 8:16; 12:4-5). According to 1 Peter 1:3 we were regenerated when Christ was resurrected.
