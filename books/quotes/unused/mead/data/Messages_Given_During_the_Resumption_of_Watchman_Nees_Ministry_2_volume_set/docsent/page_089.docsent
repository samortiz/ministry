   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What are the crucial points?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What are the things that we should pay attention to in this age?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>UNDERSTANDING THE TWO ASPECTS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>OF THE CONDITION OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother Watchman Nee: First we have to see the condition of the church in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning this matter, there are generally two schools of opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One group says that the church is always advancing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In every age, there are different recoveries of the truths, such as the truth concerning justification by faith, the truth of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The other group, represented by brothers such as J. N. Darby, says that the present church is in a state of desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you consider the church life of the first century, the absolute consecration seen in Acts 2 and 4, the keeping of the apostles' teaching, and the perfecting of the saints unto the fullness of the Body of Christ in Ephesians 4, and compare such conditions with the condition of the church today, there is undoubtedly a vast difference between the two pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once when I was in England, I was invited by Brother T. Austin-Sparks to have afternoon tea at his house.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He asked me my opinion concerning Ephesians 4 and when this chapter would be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Humanly speaking, the condition of the church today is too far from that described in Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we read the final Epistles of Paul, we will see that the church had degraded at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 2 Timothy, he said that "all who are in Asia turned away from me" 2 Tim 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Peter's description in 2 Peter of the situation at his time was the same.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the end, the apostle John also declared that antichrist has come, and he warned the believers to be watchful 1 John 2:18; 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>CATCHING UP WITH GOD'S PRESENT WORK</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>TO MAINTAIN THE TESTIMONY OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Both of these views are true, and they are based on facts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, what God wants today is to gain a group of people who will stand on God's side under these two contradictory conditions, who will maintain God's testimony, and who will uphold such a testimony of overcomers together with God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In every age, God has His work, and the purpose of such work is to maintain His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The book of Kings says that at the time Solomon's temple was being built, there was no noise heard.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the materials for the building of the temple, all the stones and the wood, were measured and cut according to size in the mountains, before they were ever sent to Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every stone and piece of wood was properly coordinated together already.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This was why at the time of the building of the temple, "there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house" 1 Kings 6:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God is doing the same work on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The book of Acts is an unfinished book.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the whole Bible, only this book does not have an ending; all the other books have an ending.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Pentateuch, the Gospel of Matthew, and the book of Revelation all have their endings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the Acts of the Apostles is different.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many questions are left unanswered and unsolved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What happened to Paul later?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How did his work end?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These things are not recorded in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The reason for their absence is that the Holy Spirit is still working today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the church today, there is still the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
