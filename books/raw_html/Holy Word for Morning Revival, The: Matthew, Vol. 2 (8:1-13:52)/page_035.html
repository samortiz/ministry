<p class="bold">WEEK 10 — DAY 6</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 13:47-48, 52</h2><p class="bold">47 &nbsp;Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a net cast into the sea and gathering from every species,</p><p class="bold">48 &nbsp;Which, when it was filled, they brought onto the shore, and sat down and collected the good into vessels; but the foul they cast out.</p><p class="bold">52 &nbsp;And He said to them, For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a householder who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>This [seventh] parable [vv. 47-48] corresponds with that in 25:32-46. The net here signifies not the gospel of grace, which is preached in the church age, but the eternal gospel [see Life-study of Revelation, Message Forty-seven, pp. 541-547], which will be preached to the Gentile world during the great tribulation (Rev. 14:6-7). The sea into which this net is cast signifies the Gentile world, and every species signifies all the nations, all the Gentiles (25:32). During the tribulation, Antichrist, who will oppose all religion, will persecute both Christians and Jews. Christ will consider these persecuted Christians His brothers. Because [of this persecution] an angel will be sent forth to proclaim the eternal gospel. The eternal gospel is absolutely different in content from the gospel of grace.…The eternal gospel…will say that men should fear God and worship Him. It will not touch the matter of repentance nor will it require faith. [Those who would]… persecute and kill…God’s people must hear that God will come in to avenge them.</p><p>Christ will judge the living at the time of His coming back. This will take place before the millennium. In addition to the Jews and the Christians,…a number [of unbelievers] will still be living at the time He comes again. These living ones will be the nations....The eternal gospel declared in Revelation 14 will be the basis for Christ’s judgment upon the living nations.…According to Matthew 25 [vv. 32-46], the King will judge the nations according to the way they have treated His little brothers…during the tribulation.…Those who treat the believers favorably will be regarded by the King as sheep. But those who do not treat them well will be regarded as goats. The goats [the foul, 13:48], will be cast into eternal fire, but the sheep [the good, 13:48], will be transferred to the millennium to be the citizens on the earth.</p><p>At the end of this chapter the Lord spoke an additional parable [v. 52].…After giving the seven parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom, the Lord likened the discipled scribe to a householder who has a treasure, a rich store of things new and old, signifying not only the new and old knowledge of the Scriptures but also the new and old experiences of life in the kingdom. A scribe…in the Old Testament…knew the books of Moses and the prophets.…Such a learned one has been discipled into the kingdom of the heavens. Formerly he was a scholar of the Old Testament dispensation, but now he has been discipled into the kingdom of the heavens.…For this reason he is likened to a householder who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old. When the new things are put with the old things, we have the precious things. The apostle Paul was such a person. He was an Old Testament scribe who one day was discipled into God’s New Testament economy.</p><p>In giving this parable the Lord was expecting that some of His listeners would be scribes, not all fishermen….At the turn of the new economy, He had to go to Galilee to find the unlearned fishermen. But after the turn had taken place, there would be the need of some learned ones to carry out all the mysteries.…I hope that some of the young people will become scribes. For the Lord’s recovery today we need both the fishermen and the scribes.
