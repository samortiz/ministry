   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FORTY-NINE THE LORD S TABLE 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 10:14-22</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 10:14-22 Paul speaks about keeping the Lord s table from idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verses 14 through 18 he speaks of the fellowship of the Lord s blood and body, and in verses 19 through 22, the separation of the Lord s table from the table of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FLEEING IDOLATRY</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 14 Paul says, Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word wherefore at the beginning of this verse indicates that the following section to verse 30 is a conclusion to the preceding section, from 8:1, concerning eating sacrifices to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Literally, the Greek words rendered idolatry are the idolatry, referring to the idolatry involved in eating sacrifices to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In his understanding of the holy Word, Paul is able to see through the physical things and through the black and white letters and to see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, in 10:4 he speaks of a physical rock as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that in this rock he sees Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the same principle, by the word idolatry Paul does not merely mean graven images, but something much broader and more inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we shall see, idolatry here implies a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 15 Paul continues, I speak as to prudent men; you judge what I say.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul expected that the readers would not stop at the black and white letters, but dig into what he says and then investigate, discern, and judge it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He wanted them to carefully examine and judge what he was saying.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>FELLOWSHIP OF THE BLOOD AND BODY</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 16 Paul suddenly speaks of the cup of blessing: The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a fellowship of the blood of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The bread which we break, is it not a fellowship of the body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Apparently there is no flow of proper continuation between verses 15 and 16.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without any transition, Paul begins to speak of the cup of blessing, indicating that it is a fellowship of the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He also speaks concerning the bread, indicating that it is a fellowship of the body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not take this verse for granted, assuming that we understand it when we actually understand very little, if anything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to investigate the meaning of the expressions a fellowship of the blood of Christ and a fellowship of the body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Greek word rendered fellowship also means joint participation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Fellowship here refers to the believer s communion in the joint participation in the blood and body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This makes us, the participants of the Lord s blood and body, not only one with one another, but also one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We, the participants, make ourselves identified with the Lord in the fellowship of His blood and body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The apostle s thought here is to illustrate how eating and drinking make the eaters and drinkers one with what they eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Corinthians should realize that their abusive eating of idol sacrifices actually makes them one with the demons behind the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>ONE BREAD, ONE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verse 17 Paul speaks a strong word concerning the one bread and the one Body: Seeing that we who are many are one bread, one Body; for we all partake of the one bread.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are all one bread, one Body, because we all partake of the one bread.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our joint partaking of the one bread makes us all one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This indicates that our partaking of Christ makes us all His one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The very Christ of whom we all partake constitutes us into His one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Partaking of the one bread, that is, eating of it vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>28-30 , identifies us with it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that our partaking of Christ, our enjoyment of Christ, identifies us with Him, making us one with Him.</S>
