Concerning the Losing of the Right<br>to Enter the Congregation of Jehovah</H2><P>Deuteronomy 23:1-8 is a word concerning the losing of the right to enter the congregation of Jehovah. No doubt, the congregation of Jehovah typifies the church. We need to be careful not to lose our right to enter the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. He Who Had Been Wounded in the Testicles<br>or Had the Male Organ Cut Off<br>Not Entering the Congregation of Jehovah</H2><P>He who had been wounded in the testicles or had the male organ cut off was not to enter the congregation of Jehovah (v. 1). In such a one the power to produce had been destroyed. This prohibition indicates that those who are barren, those who do not produce and bear fruit, will lose their right to enter the church life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. An Illegitimate Child<br>Not Entering the Congregation of Jehovah,<br>Even to the Tenth Generation</H2><P>An illegitimate child was not to enter the congregation of Jehovah, even to the tenth generation (v. 2). The life of such a one was illegal and impure.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. An Ammonite or Moabite<br>Not Entering the Congregation of Jehovah,<br>Even to the Tenth Generation</H2><P>An Ammonite or Moabite was not to enter the congregation of Jehovah, even to the tenth generation (v. 3). Both Ammon and Moab were sons of Lot, born through incest committed by Lot with his daughters. Ammonites and Moabites could not enter the congregation of Jehovah because they did not come to meet the children of Israel with bread and water in the way when the people were coming out of Egypt (v. 4a). They were prohibited from entering the congregation of Jehovah also because they hired Balaam to curse the children of Israel (v. 4b). Jehovah their God would not listen to Balaam, and He turned the curse into a blessing, for Jehovah loved them (v. 5). The children of Israel were not to seek the peace and the prosperity of the Ammonites and the Moabites all their days forever (v. 6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Children of Israel<br>Not Abhorring an Edomite nor an Egyptian</H2><P>The children of Israel were not to abhor an Edomite, for he was their brother (v. 7a). Neither were they to abhor an Egyptian, for they had been a sojourner in his land (v. 7b). The children of the third generation of the Edomites and the Egyptians could enter the congregation of Jehovah (v. 8). In a sense, the Egyptians did something good for the children of Israel, and the Edomites did not trouble them but allowed them to pass through their territory. Therefore, God remembered the Edomites and the Egyptians and allowed them to enter His congregation.</P><P>As we consider all the matters covered in this message, we see how careful, detailed, kind, and fair God is. Because we have God's life, we should learn of Him to be the same as He is. We need to learn to care for the interests of our brothers, the fellow members of the Body of Christ. We must also learn to be without mixture but pure in every way and in every aspect. In our living there should not be any mixture, for God wants us to be single, simple, and pure. Therefore, we need to eliminate all mixture and keep ourselves pure. Moreover, we should love the producing things and be careful not to lose the right to enter the congregation of the Lord. In order to do all these things, we need the divine life, the life that works with God for His people.</P><P>If we thoroughly study all these matters, we will know God better and also know what kind of person we should be, what kind of being we should have, and in what kind of way we should walk. We should walk before God and with God according to what God is. Let us learn God's ways and not merely learn doctrine. Let us learn what God is and how He acts and behaves. If we take the Lord's way and what He is, we will be transformed into His image.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_091.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_093.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Deuteronomy &nbsp; pg 92</div><br></body></html>
