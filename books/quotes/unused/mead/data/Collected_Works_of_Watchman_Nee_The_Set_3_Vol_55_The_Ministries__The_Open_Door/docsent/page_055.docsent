   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD'S LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING LIKE RED-HOT BURNING COALS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We received your letter on January 28.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word in that letter has truly become light to our pathway and strength for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He dispenses food to the needy at the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I consecrated myself during the conference in 1948, my desire was to give my very blood to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There was no such opening in my environment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I desired to shed my blood but did not have anywhere to shed it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I wanted to die but had no place to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is the God who hears prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He received my small consecration and brought me to the place He ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Keep my consecration, that I would not be shamed by these words.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Lord, You know our weakness and that it is possible for anyone to deny You three times.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lord, I truly dare not trust in my consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I put this consecration into Your hands.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>May You accomplish it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Make me burning but not foolish; make me willing to die but not live lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>May You gain something in me whether through life or death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>O brother!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>My heart feels as if it has been stabbed by a knife!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord's love is like red-hot burning coals within me!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We will fellowship more later!</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Map of the Churches in Manchuria FELLOWSHIP MEETINGS NANCHANG</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our original idea in coming to Nanchang was to serve with Brother Hsu during the Nanchang conference so that the brothers from Nanchang would not be distracted by anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After we arrived, we found that Brother Hsu unexpectedly was unable to come.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At first we thought we should return immediately, but inwardly we felt that this would cheat the brothers and sisters in Nanchang.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After praying on the spur of the moment, we decided to continue in our responsibility of our service.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We had three fellowship meetings beginning the first day of the Chinese New Year.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He blessed His children.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many brothers and sisters gained some knowledge concerning the church and consecrated themselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are also willing to coordinate with the church and to learn to serve the Lord together.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are almost thirty brothers and sisters here in college.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Their spirits are very clean.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I hope some brothers and sisters who are strong in the truth would migrate to Nanchang soon to give them some good help.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He has heard our prayer and given us some farmland near the Tungjia Railway Station.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is twelve li from Yingtan and eighteen li from Kueixi.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It can be reached by a fifteen-minute train ride.</S>
