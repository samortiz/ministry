   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FORTY-THREE THE SANCTIFICATION OF AARON AND HIS SONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE THE PRIESTS 11 Scripture Reading: Exo 29:29-46</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing messages we have seen that with the sanctification of Aaron and his sons to serve God as priests, there were four important points.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Three of these points are related to the priests, and one is related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The three points concerning the priests are the matters of being washed, being clothed, and being satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The one point related to God was that of preparing food for God and feeding Him so that He may be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The groceries used in preparing God s food involved three items of the animal life a bull and two lambs and three of the plant life flour, oil, and wine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we know, flour comes from wheat, oil comes from the olive tree, and wine comes from the grapevine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE FUNCTION OF THE SIN OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we have seen, the bull offered as a sin offering was not God s food in a direct way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, the bull of the sin offering was for atonement, for propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that it was offered for appeasement.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Daily we need to raise Christ as a bull for a sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that we need to practice every day offering Christ to God as the sin offering because our nature, our being, is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we invite others to our home for dinner, we like to have everything clean and in order.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then, with everything properly prepared, we and our guests shall be able to enjoy our food in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This illustrates the function of Christ as our sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This sin offering, typified by the bull offered to God in Exodus 29, clears up the situation between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The basic problem between us and God is that of our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through the fall, sin entered into mankind, and as a result we are constituted of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, we actually are sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When Christ was incarnated, He came to be made sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Second Corinthians 5:21 says that He was made sin for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to Romans 8:3, Christ, the Son of God, came in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Moreover, this verse reveals that when Christ was on the cross, God condemned sin in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, Christ was made sin for us, and God condemned sin in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the sight of God, sin, which has its source in Satan and which has entered into man, is the element of our fallen nature and of our old self.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, we ourselves are sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ became sin and brought the flesh of sin to the cross, where God condemned sin in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, before God, sin has been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you read the New Testament carefully, you will see that nowhere are we told that Christ bore our sin on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, the New Testament tells us that Christ bore our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, Hebrews 9:28 says that Christ has been once offered to bear the sins of many.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First Peter 2:24 says that Christ Himself carried up our sins in His body onto the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Regarding sin, the New Testament says that it was taken away or put away.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to John 1:29, John the Baptist declared, Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Speaking of Christ, Hebrews 9:26 says, He has been manifested for the putting away of sin by His sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we have already pointed out, Romans 8:3 says that God has condemned sin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to these verses, sin has been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It has been condemned, taken away, and put away.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>SIN NOT ERADICATED</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In saving us, God does not eradicate our sinful nature at the time of our repentance, conversion, and regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To save us in that way is not according to God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we repented, God forgave our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He also came into our spirit to regenerate us with His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, He did not eradicate the sin that is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although we have been forgiven, cleansed by the precious blood of Christ, and regenerated by the Spirit, we are still in our old nature, in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the one hand, we are a new creation and have a new nature; on the other hand, we are still in the old creation with the old nature.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, we need to be reminded that in our old nature, our flesh, we are still sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to realize that we are sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some Christians hold on to a concept of the eradication of sin or to a doctrine of absolute holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some teach that once a believer receives the baptism of the Holy Spirit, he becomes absolutely holy and can no longer sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Such teachings are not according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Furthermore, accepting the concept of eradication or absolute holiness has led some to excuse sinful things by calling them weaknesses or shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In some cases, those who hold onto the concept of eradication or of absolute holiness have fallen into gross sin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to the Bible, we are a new creation in Christ, but in our fallen nature we are still in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yes, we have eternal life, the divine nature, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This means that God Himself is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Yet, we still have the old man, the old creation, and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, with us there is always the possibility of falling into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to realize that we are still sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>According to the typology in the book of Exodus, every day we need to offer Christ to God as the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The seven days mentioned in Exodus 29 signify a full course of time, that is, our entire Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Until we have experienced transfiguration, the redemption of our body, we shall continue to need the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Daily we should remind ourselves that we are sin and that we need Christ as the sin offering to clear up the situation between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we apply Christ as the sin offering, the problem between us and God is solved, and we are cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Because God has been appeased through Christ as the sin offering, we may be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now in an atmosphere of peace, we can serve food to God.</S>
