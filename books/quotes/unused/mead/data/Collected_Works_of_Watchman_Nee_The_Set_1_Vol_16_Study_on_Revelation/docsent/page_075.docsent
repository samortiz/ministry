   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ETERNAL PERDITION OF SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>REVELATION 20:10</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"And the devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where also the beast and the false prophet were; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The counterfeit trinity is now in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some may ask, "How can there still be day and night'?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Revelation 21:23 we shall see that in the city there is "no need of the sun or of the moon that they should shine in it."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It does not say that there is no sun or moon in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, the tree of life will bear fruit every month.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If there were neither sun nor moon, how could there be the monthly bearing of fruit?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE JUDGMENT OF THE GREAT WHITE THRONE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>REVELATION 20:11-15 A. Revelation 20:11</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"And I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose face earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This throne is different from the one in chapters four and five.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Two adjectives are used to describe this throne:</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>1 "Great."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This judgment is extraordinary; thus, it is great and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>2 "White."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the color that is especially related to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, the Lord Jesus' hair is white, and He rides on a white horse.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>White signifies being perfectly clean, absolutely righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Him who sat upon it."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is much evidence for this in the New Testament, such as John 5:22; Acts 10:42; 17:31; Romans 2:6; 1 Peter 4:5; and 2 Timothy 4:1.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Earth and heaven fled away."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some say that the fleeing of the earth and the heaven is simply God's restructuring of the earth and the heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the following clause, "And no place was found for them," shows that the old heaven and old earth are removed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because the trace of sin can still be seen in the old heaven and old earth, the Lord now casts them away.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is what is prophesied in 2 Peter 3:7, 10, and 12.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Probably at the same time that God sends down fire to devour the rebellious people, He will burn away the old heaven and old earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>B. Revelation 20:12</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and scrolls were opened; and another scroll was opened, which is the book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And the dead were judged by the things which were written in the scrolls, according to their works."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"The dead" in 20:12 are "the rest of the dead" mentioned in 20:5.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"Standing before the throne."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Standing is an indication of being alive.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since they are standing, they are resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Will there be anyone who is saved at the great white throne?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The answer is yes for the following reasons:</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>1 This is a judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To judge is not only for judging, but also for distinguishing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If all are unsaved, they should simply receive punishment; why would they still need to be judged?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>2 Not only the scrolls are opened which record the deeds but also the book of life he who has his name here is saved .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This tells us that some names are in the scrolls, and some are in the book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>3 The Lord Jesus clearly says that some will be saved at the end in the day of resurrection: "An hour is coming in which..: those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have practiced evil, to the resurrection of judgment" John 5:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>4 Practically speaking, it is impossible to say that there are no saved ones here, because:</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>a Death still exists in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If these people are resurrected at this time, how can they not be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>b There are many people who have no part in the first resurrection before the kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If they appear at this time, how can they not be the saved ones?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>c The spirits of those believers who had been excommunicated by the church those who did not repent until the end can be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If they are resurrected at this time, how can we say that they are not saved?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>d The Bible clearly says that if any man denies Christ before man, Christ will also deny him before the angels of God Luke 12:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These will have no part in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If they are resurrected at this time, how can they not be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>e In the Old Testament time many were saved, yet they were not worthy to reign with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If they are resurrected at this time, how can we say that they are not saved?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>f Also there are many babies.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If they are not saved at this time, when will they be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>5 Besides the dead that are resurrected, there are also the living people of Israel in fact, the whole nation who will stand before the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Can we say that they are not saved?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Moreover, we have the living Gentiles of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When Satan deceives the nations, we cannot say that they will all follow Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Can we say that those who do not follow Satan are not saved at this time?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>"Scrolls" is plural.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>"According to their works" has two meanings: 1 "By means of," which means that the deeds constitute the basis of judgment; and 2 "Based upon," which means that the degree of their punishment is decided by the degree of good and evil in their deeds.</S>
