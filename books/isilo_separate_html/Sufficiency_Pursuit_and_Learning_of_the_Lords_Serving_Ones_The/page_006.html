<p>In order for the serving ones to be in coordination, we must have many service meetings. The purpose of these meetings is for the serving ones to come together and fellowship. I hope that every serving one would receive the Lord&rsquo;s mercy so that we could frankly discuss any matter. For example, the serving ones should be able to fellowship concerning the shortages in a message given by a brother. Through such fellowship the lack in the message will be covered, and strong, positive, and rich points can be added. This will strengthen and enrich the speaking. The way the Lord has taken among us does not depend on raising up one good speaker who manifests a strong ministry of the word. The Lord&rsquo;s way is to lead all the brothers who are responsible for the ministry of the word to be blended into one. Such mutual fellowship will strengthen and enrich the word that is released.</p>
<p>We should fellowship not only concerning the ministry of the word but also concerning visiting the saints, leading the church, and the young people&rsquo;s work. The full-time workers, the serving saints, and the elders should have thorough fellowship concerning how to carry out the young people&rsquo;s work. They should pray and fellowship together. Even saints who are not directly involved in a service can still fellowship concerning that service. As a result, all the saints will be brought into fellowship and built together; there will not be a distinction between those who are involved and those who are not. According to the Lord&rsquo;s word in John 15, if we love one another, we will bear much fruit. If we continue to live before the Lord individually, we will serve individually and not be balanced in our service. As a result, there will not be fruit.</p>
<p>We must change our way and practice loving one another. We should come together and fellowship concerning our service. When we receive correction from other members, our weaknesses are removed. The result of this kind of fellowship is that one person&rsquo;s work becomes everyone&rsquo;s work, because he no longer works according to his personal view but according to the view of all the serving ones. Thus, we will be blended together. Then when a brother gives a message, the message will contain not only the light he saw but also the light from the other brothers, and the serving ones will bear the result of his message. The message is not given by one person but by many brothers. Perhaps only two co-workers carry out a certain task, but all the co-workers are involved through fellowship. Thus, a practical expression of loving one another will be produced among us, and any function that is manifested will come out of mutual love. We will not only abide in the Lord, having fellowship with Him, but we will also love one another.</p>
<p>We lack mutual love that comes out of coordination. We need to lead the saints to pursue fellowship so that all the full-time serving ones and the elders will have the expression of loving one another in their service and in bearing fruit as co-branches. Every branch not only abides in the vine tree but also loves the other branches. Then we will grow in life, and our various functions will be manifested. Every member of the Body has a different function, just as our body has hands, a mouth, eyes, and feet. Some members receive burdens directly from the Lord, but others accept the coordination in the work. Some members may be like the apostle Paul. Others may be like Titus and Timothy. Nevertheless, none of these functions will override our personal fellowship with the Lord or our living before the Lord.</p>
<p>When our service is in coordination, our work will be successful, and we will have learned the lessons. Furthermore, the two problems in our service will be resolved. May the Lord have mercy on us and lead us into this stage so that in all our service in the work we would live before Him and love one another.</p>
<p>The saints in a certain local church are learning to live before the Lord and serve in coordination. After the brothers minister the word, they fellowship with all the co-workers concerning what was spoken. They also fellowship before the message is delivered. Everyone expresses his feelings. The brothers also fellowship concerning the direction of the meeting. As a result, there is an understanding among the saints, and they are in coordination.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>On one hand, we are not discouraged, because we realize that we have faith. On the other hand, no matter how much we accomplish, we still must acknowledge that we are unprofitable slaves. Not only so, in our service we should learn to abide in the Lord and love one another. We should fellowship and coordinate with one another. This is the way we should serve in the ministry of the word, in visiting the saints, in leading the meetings, and in all the other services. Through coordination we will be strengthened, enriched, balanced, and protected. This is the way to learn many wonderful lessons and avoid unnecessary mistakes.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
