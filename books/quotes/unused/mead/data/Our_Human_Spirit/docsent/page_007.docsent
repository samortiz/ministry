   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before we were saved we didn't have life in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our spirit was only an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we received the Lord Jesus, He came into our spirit to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In our spirit we have another life, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word which the New Testament uses for this life is zoe.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Zoe is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Bios is the physical life in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Psuche is the human life in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Zoe referring to the divine life is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This divine life is simply God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This divine life is simply Christ Himself, God Himself, coming into our spirit to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now we have three kinds of lives.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In our spirit we have zoe, in our soul we have psuche, and in our body we have bios.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have a biological life, a soulish life, and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This divine life, zoe, is simply the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE BIRTH OF OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our spirit has been born by God coming into our spirit as life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"That which is born of the Spirit is spirit," John 3:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now the divine life is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our spirit was born because God's life got into it, and this birth has nothing to do with our fall.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even if Adam had never fallen, he still would have needed to be born in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He still needed to have God come into him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Otherwise, he couldn't express God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to be born again by having the life of God get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This life gets into our spirit and our spirit is born.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now in our spirit there is life, and this life is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>LIVE THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since we have three lives, by what life should we live?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By the biological life?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By the soulish life?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Or by the divine life?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are used to living by the soulish life, but now we need to live by the divine life in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we don't know our spirit, we can't live by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all need to know our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE LORD WITH YOUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This divine life has been installed into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we need to turn on the lights, we go to the switch.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What we need today is to touch the "switch" of our spirit because the divine life is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nothing could be more clear or definite than 2 Timothy 4:22: "The Lord be with your spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We don't have to go to other places.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to come to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are used to going other places.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even when we come to the church meeting and the brothers say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Amen!" sometimes we would not go to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We still would keep ourselves in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may even question: "Do the brothers need to be so loud and noisy?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a strong proof that we are used to being outside of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are used to being in the mind, but we must turn ourselves to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Forget about how loud and noisy the brothers are.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You have to exercise your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When you get into your spirit, you may be louder.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The problem is that we Christians would not turn to the very spot where God is.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Where is God today?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"The Lord be with your spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Matthew 28:20 there is a great promise given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord Jesus promises to be with us until the end, the completion of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is one of the great promises in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is with us to the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Where is He with us?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Everything we need is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The divine life in our spirit is inexhaustible and immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have the divine life within us, which is just God Himself in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is God Himself after incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today this very God comes into us to be with us in our spirit with the incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>TURN TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need to turn to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need to be strong in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We need to act and walk in the spirit because it is here that we have God, Christ, and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The soul-life and the biological life are secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We have the divine life which is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is not God before incarnation, but God after ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The very God with His incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension is within us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All the day we should turn ourselves to this dear One by calling on His name Rom 10:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You will see the riches, you will see the sweetness, and you will see the refreshment.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You will see the power, even the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>THE STRATEGIC POINT</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The human spirit is the strategic point for the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We all have to know our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is here that we have been born again and it is here that we worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>"God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit" John 4:24 , not in the Holy Spirit, but in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In our reborn human spirit we worship God, we serve God, we fellowship with one another, and we grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We even have the church life here.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If you are not in the spirit, you cannot have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The church life is a life absolutely in the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When we turn to the spirit, you are one with me, and I am one with you.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Regardless of how much we talk about the church life, we are still not in it unless we turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When we turn to our human spirit, we are in the church life, and we are one.</S>
