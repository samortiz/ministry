<p>Peter was one of the apostles. The Lord knew that Peter was entrenched in his concept and habits and that it would not be easy for Peter to break away from the law. For this reason, the Lord showed him a vision three times. The Lord also arranged the environment so that Cornelius sent men to invite Peter. These factors subdued Peter to contact the Gentiles.</p>
<p>Later, while Peter was in Antioch, he ate with the Gentile believers. But when some Jewish believers came from Jerusalem, he shrank back and separated himself from the Gentiles. Not only did Peter shrink back, but Barnabas also joined Peter in this hypocrisy (Gal. 2:11-13). It is difficult to believe that Peter would do such a thing. He was an experienced apostle and had received special leading from the Lord through a heavenly vision, yet he separated himself from the Gentile believers.</p>
<p>There is a tendency within us to keep the law. This does not refer to the moral laws. In the New Testament age God has no intention for us to keep the ceremonial laws. God does not want us to keep the ordinances of the law.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXAMPLE OF PAUL, THE APOSTLE TO THE GENTILES</h2>
<p>The fact that Peter was influenced by the Jewish believers indicates that he was not fully delivered from the law and its ordinances. For this reason, Paul opposed Peter to his face (v. 11). We would think that since Paul opposed Peter, wrote the book of Galatians, and knew grace according to the New Testament, he should have been fully delivered from the bondage of the law and its ordinances. However, Paul also became weak. On his last trip to Jerusalem he was subdued by the Jewish believers. Paul went to see James and the elders in Jerusalem. He greeted them and related to them the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. After listening to Paul&rsquo;s report, they glorified God and said that thousands of Jews had believed and were zealous for the law (Acts 21:18-20). The Jewish believers in Jerusalem not only kept the law but were also zealous for the law. The elders felt that Paul did not have a good reputation among the Jews, because he taught the Jews to abandon the rituals of the law (v. 21). They therefore advised Paul, saying, &ldquo;We have four men who have a vow on themselves; take these and be purified with them, and pay their expenses that they may shave their heads. And all will know that there is nothing to the things that they have been informed of concerning you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the law&rdquo; (vv. 23-24).</p>
<p>Should Paul have followed their advice? It was true that Paul acted contrary to the law by contacting the Gentiles. He told the Gentiles and the Jews that they did not need to be circumcised or keep the ordinances. Since this was Paul&rsquo;s teaching, would it not be hypocrisy for him to follow the proposal of the elders? Would he not be lying? Paul should not have agreed.</p>
<p>By this time, Paul had already written Galatians and Romans. In these books his words are very strong. In Galatians 3:1-2 he says, &ldquo;O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed crucified? This only I wish to learn from you, Did you receive the Spirit out of the works of law or out of the hearing of faith?&rdquo; These words are surely strong. Based on these words, we would assume that Paul would not listen to the elders in Jerusalem. However, Paul became weak. This shows the power of the law. We should never think that we are completely delivered from the law. When we enter into a certain environment, we may also become weak and succumb to the law.</p>
<p>Not only did Paul participate in the rite of purification and pay the expenses for the other brothers, but he even had the priests make offerings for them. This is hard to believe. In Hebrews Paul says that the Old Testament offerings were over (10:5-9). In Galatians he says, &ldquo;You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace&rdquo; (5:4). By following the proposal of the elders in Jerusalem, Paul was rebuilding what he had torn down. When Paul was about to conclude the rite of purification, God stirred up a turmoil so that Paul was arrested by the Jews and subsequently sent to Rome to be imprisoned. He never returned to Jerusalem. Then in A.D. 70 God sent the Roman prince Titus with the Roman army to destroy Jerusalem. They tore down the holy temple and destroyed the holy city; they did not leave one stone upon another. God destroyed Jerusalem, the center of Judaism, and scattered the Israelites among the nations. That was two thousand years ago. Since that day, Jerusalem has been under the devastation of the Gentiles. The Lord did this in order to destroy the center of Judaism.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Being Delivered from Religious Rituals and Walking according to the Spirit &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
