<h1 class="title">THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE TRUTH<br />
IN 1 AND 2 TIMOTHY,<br />
TITUS, AND PHILEMON</h1>
<p>Now we come to the crucial points of the truth in 1 and 2 Timothy. First Timothy unveils to us God&rsquo;s dispensation, His New Testament economy, concerning the church. The purpose of 2 Timothy is to inoculate the church against the decline. On the one hand, an inoculation is positive, and on the other hand, it is negative, because it indicates that we need to be protected from a disease that could kill us. Paul&rsquo;s purpose in writing 2 Timothy was to inoculate the church against decline, degradation, and deterioration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FIRST TIMOTHY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Economy in Faith</h2>
<p>The first crucial point in 1 Timothy is God&rsquo;s economy in faith. In 1:3-4 Paul says, &ldquo;Even as I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently, nor to occupy themselves with myths and unending genealogies, which give occasion for questionings rather than God&rsquo;s dispensation which is in faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s dispensation (v. 4) or God&rsquo;s household economy (Eph. 1:10; 3:9) is God&rsquo;s household administration to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people, that He may have a house, a household to express Himself, which household is the church, the Body of Christ (3:15). The apostle&rsquo;s ministry was centered upon this economy of God (Col. 1:25; 1 Cor. 9:17), whereas the different teachings of the dissenting ones were used by God&rsquo;s enemy to distract His people from this. This divine economy must be made fully clear to the saints in the administration and shepherding of a local church.</p>
<p>Faith in the New Testament bears two denotations, an objective denotation and a subjective denotation. The dispensation of God is a matter in faith, that is, in the sphere and element of faith, in God through Christ. Faith may be in contrast to questionings. God&rsquo;s economy to dispense Himself into His chosen people is not in the natural realm, nor in the work of law, but in the spiritual sphere of the new creation through regeneration by faith in Christ (Gal. 3:23-26). By faith we are born of God to be His sons, partaking of His life and the divine nature to express Him (1 John 5:11-12; 2 Pet. 1:4). By faith we are put into Christ to become the members of His Body (Eph. 5:30), sharing all that He is for His expression. This is God&rsquo;s dispensation according to His New Testament economy carried out in faith. God&rsquo;s economy is a matter in this kind of faith.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Full Knowledge of the Truth</h2>
<p>From God&rsquo;s economy in faith we come to 2:4, which says that God desires all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth. No other verse besides 1 Timothy 2:4 in the entire New Testament tells us that God wants all men to enter into two things: His salvation and His truth. God desires all men not only to be saved but also to have the full knowledge of the truth. Truth means reality, denoting all the real things revealed in the New Testament, which are mainly Christ as the embodiment of God and the church as the Body of Christ. Every saved person should have a full knowledge, a complete realization of these things. By such a verse we can realize where we should be. We should be in the full knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p>We should realize that God from the beginning has wanted all men to be saved, and for all these saved ones to come to the full knowledge of the truth. We should endeavor, spend our energy, our mind, and our time, to get into the full knowledge of the truth. This is the word to all the believers, not just to the leading ones. All the believers should come to the full knowledge of the truth. No doubt there is a terrible shortage of those who have come to the full knowledge of the truth. We all should endeavor to be in the full knowledge of the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Function of the Church</h2>
<p>In chapter three the crucial point of the truth is the function of the church in verses 15 and 16. In these verses the church is the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth, and the manifestation of God in the flesh. The church functions as the house and household of the living God for His move on the earth, as the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth, bearing the divine reality of Christ and His Body as a testimony to the world, and becomes the continuation of Christ&rsquo;s manifestation of God in the flesh. This is the great mystery of godliness&mdash;Christ lived out of the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh!</p>
