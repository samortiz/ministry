<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Man-child Born of the Universal Woman</H2><P>The man-child born of the universal woman is a great sign in the book of Revelation (Rev. 12:1-2, 5). He signifies the resurrected ones of the earlier overcomers, including all those of the Old Testament age. Many of the overcomers of the Old Testament age were martyred. The first overcomer was Abel, who was martyred by his brother Cain. Even Isaiah was martyred. Of course, some were not martyred, but they also died. All of these dead Old Testament overcomers along with the additional overcomers who die before the great tribulation will be a part of the man-child raptured to the throne of God (Rev. 12:5). These overcomers have overcome the devil, Satan, the adversary of God and the accuser of God's children (v. 11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Firstfruits to God and to the Lamb</H2><P>The firstfruits to God and to the Lamb testify concerning Christ for God (Rev. 14:1-5). They signify the living ones of the earlier overcomers in the New Testament age. They follow Christ as the Lamb of God wherever He goes, and they will be raptured before the great tribulation to Mount Zion in the heavens. They are a sign of the living and existing overcomers before the great tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Late Overcomers</H2><P>The late overcomers signify the rest of the believers of all the churches (Rev. 12:17; 15:2). The late overcomers overcome the persecution of Antichrist in the great tribulation, the last three and a half years of the church age. They are martyred for the testimony of Jesus which they bear for God. After the rapture of the dead overcomers with the living overcomers, there will still be many believers left on earth who are not yet matured. They will remain to live in the great tribulation. Many of them will be martyred under the persecution of Antichrist and then resurrected with Christ to reign in the millennium (Rev. 20:4).</P><P>On the one hand, to get matured today is easier. If you wait to pass through the tribulation, you will have to be martyred to be an overcomer. On the other hand, it is often easier to overcome in great and difficult things than it is to overcome in smaller and easier things. Many so-called good, spiritual, heavenly sisters have the habit of looking at the newspaper Saturday morning for sales so that they can go shopping. They may realize within that this is not of the Lord and that they do not need what they are going to buy, but they still go shopping anyway. This is a small thing that is seemingly easy to overcome, but most of the time they are defeated in this matter.</P><P>But when the Antichrist is ruling during the great tribulation, he will threaten people with death if they do not worship him. In a sense, such a great thing could be easier for us to overcome. If you refuse to worship him, you will be martyred immediately. You will not have the time to consider as you do when you are about to go shopping for things on sale. Whatever the case, though, we all have to overcome so that we can be matured.</P>
