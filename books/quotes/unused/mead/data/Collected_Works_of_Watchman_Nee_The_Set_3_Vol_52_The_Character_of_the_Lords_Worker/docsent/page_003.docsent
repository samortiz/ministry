   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE A GOOD LISTENER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The personal life of a worker of the Lord is intimately related to his work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, we have to consider matters of character, habit, and conduct when considering the qualifications necessary to be in God's employment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This relates to the constitution of character and the formation of habits.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A man must have not only a certain amount of spiritual experience, but a certain constitution in his disposition; the Lord must constitute a certain kind of disposition within him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many things need to be built up, cultivated, and developed into habits within a worker.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These things relate more to our outward man than to our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As these things mold the outward man into a proper shape, we will become suitable for the Lord's use.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It takes grace and mercy from God for this to occur; character is not built up in a day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if the Lord gives a person enough light and if He speaks to him often enough, his natural and undesirable elements will be burned away; they will not be allowed to remain or grow.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In His mercy, God will reconstruct a new character in him through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let us now speak of a few things that all seasoned servants of the Lord have realized and apprehended.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The lack of any of these will result in a breakdown in service.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>ONE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first thing we want to speak of is an ability to listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A worker of the Lord must build up the habit in his daily life of listening to others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I do not mean that he should listen to others in the sense of obeying them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I mean that he should listen to others in the sense of being able to hear what they are saying and to understand what he has heard.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is a great need for this trait to be built up in a worker's personal life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No worker of the Lord can do a good job if he can only speak to others but cannot listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A worker is of little use to God if he can only speak to others, if he can only blast incessantly at others like a firecracker.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No worker of the Lord can be an incessant talker.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If he can only speak to others, but cannot listen to them and realize their problems through conversation, his usefulness is very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a Christian turns to a servant of the Lord for help, the worker should be able to discern three aspects of his brother's words while he is listening: the words that are being uttered, the words that are being held back, and the words that are lying in the depth of the brother's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, you must fully understand what the person is actually saying.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that you need to be a quiet person before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Your mind must be clear and your spirit must be calm.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Your inner being should be like a blank piece of paper before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You should not have any prejudice, preconception, or inclination.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You should not make any determination in your mind or pass any judgment on anything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You should remain perfectly calm before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the other person opens his mouth and relates a story, you should learn to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As you listen quietly, you will know what he or she is talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Listening is not an easy matter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When a brother is trying to explain his problem, how much do you understand of what he is saying?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sometimes when many people listen to the same person at the same time, there are as many impressions of that person's problem as there are listeners.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You may have one impression, and another may have another impression.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many impressions are formed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It would be disastrous if there were the same diversity of impressions in relation to matters of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Listening to others is a very basic training, and one of the basic qualifications for a worker is to be able to understand what others are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Others come to you with a burden on their shoulders; they try to unload their problems to you and expect some help from you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What would happen if you misunderstood their words or if you missed their problem altogether and gave them an answer based on what was in your mind the previous two days?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some have their mind on a certain theme for a couple of days.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When a sick brother comes to them, they speak on the matter that they have been meditating on because their mind is full of thoughts on that subject.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When a healthy brother comes to them, they bring forth the same thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When another brother in distress or in joy comes along, they tell him the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They cannot sit down quietly to listen to what others have to say.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a worker of the Lord cannot listen to what others have to say, how can he expect to render help to others?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When others are speaking, we have to listen carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to understand what they are talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our work is more difficult than that of a doctor diagnosing his patient.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At least he has a laboratory where he can make tests to aid him in his diagnosis of various cases, whereas we have to make our diagnosis without any such aid.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Suppose a brother comes and talks to us for half an hour, relating all of his problems to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We may have no idea how he has been living, what his family background is, or what his condition before the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Ten minutes, twenty minutes, or half an hour is a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we cannot listen to what he is saying, how can we expect to render him the proper help?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Every worker of the Lord has to build up a proper habit; we must have the capacity and the ability to sit down to listen and understand what others are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is very important, and we have to pay much attention to this exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have to learn to understand what others are saying as soon as they open their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to be very clear about their condition, and we have to have a clear diagnosis of their case.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must have clear discernment and assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only then will we know whether we are qualified to handle the need.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sometimes we know that the condition of our brother is beyond our ability to help, and we should tell him honestly that we are not the right one to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But we should know where he stands and where we stand as soon as he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the first thing we have to do; we have to hear and understand what others are saying.</S>
