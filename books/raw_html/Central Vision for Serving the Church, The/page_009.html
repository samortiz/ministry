        <h2 class="head2">The Spirit Needing to Be Released to Supply Others</h2>
<p>Thus, I have no desire to exhort the elders merely to accept the dealing and breaking of the cross; rather, I must speak of our need to live in the spirit, not in our knowledge, consideration, or views. This is the age of our spirit. Based on my recent experience of speaking, I have found that no subject draws the attention of people more than the spirit; people respond only to speaking related to living in the spirit. When I speak of living in the spirit, I am referring to our spirit, not the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>When we are in our spirit, we will be open to others and willing to let them serve. Whether they are able to carry out the responsibilities related to their service is up to the Lord. I believe that at least eighty out of a hundred saints will be able to carry out the responsibilities that are placed in their hands. We should not think that things will be taken care of properly only if they are in our hands. Even if only eighty percent can carry out certain responsibilities, we will still have a worthwhile outcome. However, if everything remains in our hands and we have no &ldquo;apprentices,&rdquo; there will be no subsequent generation. We must learn to live in the spirit, and we should release our spirit to supply those who are bearing responsibility.</p>
<p>The focus of the church is not on doing things well but on releasing the spirit and supplying life. Hence, we should not place too much trust in our insights and ways; we also should not linger in teachings from the past. It was right to speak on the teaching of the anointing twenty-five years ago, but we need to be up to date. Although Edison invented the electric light bulb, there has been much improvement in electric light bulbs. We must not stay in the past; we must go forward. What we once called the anointing, we now know as the Spirit. We must know the Spirit more and live in our spirit more.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living in the Spirit and Not Holding On to Authority</h2>
<p>Some elders hold on to authority and exercise authority over everything, even to the point that morning watch must be in their homes. Although they may not be holding on to authority intentionally, this is the actual situation. Holding on to authority can easily produce &ldquo;power struggles.&rdquo; I really do not like to use this term, and it is a shame if such a thing occurs in the church. Nevertheless, some elders think that since they are the leading ones, the ones with the most function, everything should be under their authority. This is not a situation in the spirit; instead, it is a killing situation, and there is no release of the spirit. Every elder should forget about authority and live in the spirit. Once the elders live in the spirit, there are no problems related to holding on to authority.</p>
<p>Some may say that Paul speaks of the elders taking the lead (1 Tim. 5:17). However, when the Lord Jesus spoke to His disciples in the Gospels about authority, He said, &ldquo;You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave; just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve&rdquo; (Matt. 20:25-28). Furthermore, He said, &ldquo;You call Me the Teacher and the Lord, and you say rightly, for I am. If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another&rsquo;s feet&rdquo; (John 13:13-14). The Lord did not regard the exercise of authority as a matter of being great and first but rather as a matter of serving others and washing others&rsquo; feet. When we live in the spirit, authority is not a consideration, and we are willing to wash our brothers&rsquo; feet and let others be higher.</p>
<p>However, if we regard being lower as being better than higher, we may not necessarily be in the spirit either. When I say this, some may respond that they do not know what to do. People often say to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you say that something is good today, but you say something different three days later. You speak on this and then on that; we do not know what to do.&rdquo; I reply, &ldquo;Exactly. I do not want to tell you what to do. Your desire to do things is too rigid.&rdquo; Rather than trying to determine what to do or not to do, we should turn to our spirit. We need to train the saints to turn to the spirit.</p>
<p>A brother once came to me and accused the elders of being domineering, overbearing, and controlling. I responded, saying, &ldquo;You are more overbearing than the elders because you want to overthrow them. They were appointed to be elders, but your overbearing attitude toward them shows that you are a &lsquo;self-appointed elder.&rsquo;&rdquo; In contrast to this, some elders speak of their desire to be humble and to resign from the eldership so that the more capable ones can function. In reality this is an even more severe case of being in the flesh rather than in the spirit. When I say this, they do not know what to do because when they labor diligently, people say that they are overbearing, but when they consider resigning, I say that they are in the flesh. Being overbearing or resigning is not the issue; living in the spirit is all that matters. This is the most difficult truth to understand in the Bible. If we live in the spirit, we are right even if we show anger, but if we do not live in our spirit, we are wrong even if we show love. Being angry or being loving does not matter; living in the spirit is all that matters. We are not a social group that needs to focus on condemning the assertion of authority; we should focus on learning to live in the spirit. An elder&rsquo;s assertion of authority only proves that he is not living in the spirit; if he lives in the spirit more, he will assert less and less authority.</p>

	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
