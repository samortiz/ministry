Although the prophets can prophesy, all the others must "discern" (1 Cor. 14:29). Everyone must discern according to God's word. Every conscience must be responsible to God directly. Everyone should be concerned about what is said. Not only should we pay attention to how we hear, we should pay attention to what we hear. This attitude will turn many to trust in God. Many times we are inclined to listen to man's philosophy and traditional teachings, but God's intention is to break us away from these things so that we may come afresh before His word and hear the teaching of the Bible. In this way, what we believe in will not be of man's wisdom but will be of the power of God.</P><P>The teaching of the authority of the church is, of course, most acutely found in the Roman Catholic Church. However, this seed is now sown everywhere and is found almost everywhere. Other than this teaching, there is another Romish practice which is also found almost everywhere. Certainly, the Roman Catholic Church represents the pinnacle of it, but its rudiments are scattered everywhere. This is the practice of the church's occupying a high position in the world. The Roman Catholic Church is, of course, the greatest example of this. Jezebel is a queen. She is not a widow, and she never sees any sorrow. She reigns, and under her feet are the neck of the kings. She takes the Lord's word on future kingship to be her lot in this age: "Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet" (Psa. 91:13). Although many Christians do not believe that they should rule the world like the Catholic Church does, they are nevertheless affected by its poison and consider it right for Christians to play a part in the world arena. To play a part means to take up an office there. Who can be more qualified than Christians to be the kind of persons the world desires? They never consider that before the Lord Jesus came, Satan was already the prince of this age and that everything that this age does is opposed to God and His Son Christ. Only when the Lord Jesus comes again in His power will Satan be driven out and will the world come under His subjection. Actually, if the saints receive power in the world, they will be changed by the world. They will not be able to cleanse the world. Moreover, God's command is that believers must not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. To obtain political status in this way will naturally make those who serve alongside the world lose their position as the children of God.</P><P>We know that the fornication and idolatry taught by Jezebel are the same as the fornications and abominations seen in the great harlot in chapter seventeen. There we see that the kings of the earth commit the sin of fornication with her. Through her corrupt teachings, she has received power and authority in the world, while her Lord has only received a cross and a grave in the same world. It is an unimaginably evil thing that the church wants to gain authority in a Christ-rejecting world, but then, is this not common now? Many who oppose the Roman Catholic Church are taking part in many worldly things. They think that they are much superior to the Roman Catholic Church. Actually they are the same as the latter.</P><P>In Jezebel, we see that she considers the church to have authority not only in doctrines but in politics as well. This greatly changes the original nature of the church. The church is now no longer a genuine church but has become hypocritical and is only the continuation of what was once genuine. The principle of the world has leavened the whole lump, and she has lost all her testimony.</P><P>"And I gave her time that she might repent, and she is not willing to repent of her fornication." The Lord's call now is not for repentance, nor for them to do the first works, nor to recover their first love. These are no longer suitable for the church in Thyatira. The opportunity for repentance was already given before, but it was rejected. There is now no more opportunity for repentance. What is now left is judgment. This judgment is most dreadful, because during the long delay much of her deserved wrath has accumulated. "Behold, I will cast her into a bed." The Lord has grace and patience, yet those who have forever rejected this grace and patience will receive His judgment. The failure of Thyatira is final and severe. The church has gradually failed. By the time it reaches Thyatira, it has reached the ultimate point.</P><P>Here we should pay attention to three kinds of people. First is Jezebel. Second are those who commit adultery with her. Third are her children. God's judgment towards these three kinds of people is different. The Lord knows what kind of sins they have committed, and He knows how to differentiate the degree of closeness of different groups in relationship to her. No one who sins can be free. Judgment is sure. The only difference is in the verdict. The Lord will reward and punish man according to his works.</P><P>Jezebel rejected God's grace and was not willing to repent. Hence, her judgment is sure. Today is the day of God's grace, and He is slow to wrath. He is not oblivious to man's sin. Although a sinner can misunderstand His grace and can treasure up His wrath, God is always willing to bestow grace and to see man repent. However, God's patience did not produce any result in Jezebel. She rejected God's continuing kindness. As a result, there was no other way left for her except judgment. "I will cast her into a bed." A bed of sin is now turned into a bed of pain. In her suffering she will come to realize the displeasure of the Most High. She has committed a mortal sin, and there is no hope left for her.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 05: The Christian (3) &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
