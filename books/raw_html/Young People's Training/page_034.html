 <h2 class="head1">THE &ldquo;RAW&rdquo; GOD AND THE &ldquo;PROCESSED&rdquo; GOD</h2>
<p>In the past, I never used such terms as &ldquo;processed God&rdquo; or &ldquo;raw God.&rdquo; These terms sound strange to religious ears. Most of these terms came as a result of the enlightenment regarding the compound Spirit. Anything that has been compounded has been processed. If it has not been processed, then how could it be compounded? Our God has truly been compounded. He is no longer &ldquo;raw&rdquo;; He is the compounded God, the &ldquo;processed&rdquo; God. Before the olive oil was compounded, it was raw. But after it was compounded, it was no longer raw. Based upon this fact, I have the boldness to say that before Christ&rsquo;s death, resurrection, and ascension, the Spirit of God was not processed. However, after Christ&rsquo;s death, resurrection, and ascension, the Spirit of God became processed. This word is unacceptable to the ears of theologians. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the Lord has surely shown us something deeper. Most Christians do not have this experience or this knowledge.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH PEOPLE REGARDING THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>When you meet other Christians, it is better not to touch the issue of the Trinity. What should you do if they raise this question? Firstly, do not argue with them. Listen to all their points, take them down, and ask them to explain the matters to you. The more they talk, the more they will be snared. Do not play politics and do not say a word in reply. Rather, you should say, &ldquo;I will consider these matters. I certainly would like to study the truth with you. May we get together for this purpose? If what you have told me is right, I will take it. If what I have been taught is wrong, I will repent and give it up. I hope that, by the mercy and grace of God, you would have the same attitude. None of us should have the assurance that we are clear concerning such a thing as the Divine Trinity.&rdquo; Take all the points home with you, pray, fellowship with others, and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading how to contact them again.</p>
<p>When you see them again, do not argue over any points. Simply read to them certain verses or give them some of the booklets that are suitable. Sometimes you need to read certain paragraphs to them, perhaps even asking them to read. If they argue, do not argue back, but say, &ldquo;I would like to see what the pure word of the Bible says.&rdquo; If they continue to argue, then listen to their arguments. Take time and be patient. Perhaps during your next contact with them you will read Isaiah 9:6 or 1 Corinthians 15:45. Do not fight with them, but maintain the good attitude of a learner, of one who wants to study the pure revelation in the Bible. I believe that this will open the door and give an opportunity for the Lord to do something in their conscience. Of course, you need to pray a great deal about this. However, do not spend all of your time with this kind of person. If you do that, you will be snared by the enemy. At most, you should only spend a fourth of your time with the opposers. All the rest of your time should be spent on the positive ones. Nevertheless, we would not give up the critical ones, but patiently contact them again and again. As they consider the pure revelation concerning the Triune God, they may lose their peace and sense the need to reconsider their belief. Do not argue or fight with people, but have a good time with them. You need to pray much for them. If not many are convinced, at least a small number will be helped. They will at least begin to question the charge that we are heretical. They will no longer have the peace or assurance to say that we are heretics. You need to show them that although what we believe may be different and even against tradition, it is according to the pure word of the Bible. We all must conduct ourselves in this wise manner.</p>
