The attacks we have received in the last six months have been hard to take. I really know our position now. The Lord places those who obey Him in the battlefield to manifest the victory. When I received your postcard that was sent before you left, I thought that I could go by any means to Ch'ang-ch'un to see you before you left. Then something came up, and I could not go to Ch'ang-ch'un, nor could I answer your letter. My heart was very sad until I received your letter. Then I was somewhat comforted. In these six months there have been many difficulties on all sides. Not only have there been problems in my home, but also the assembly has had some. There were only four brothers to begin with&mdash;Brothers Hsiao, Kao, Yu, and myself. (There is another brother, Chin, but he is a worker, so he is very busy and does not come to the meetings often.) In the fall Mr. Kung Hsiang from Harbin came to visit. He is Brother Yu's brother-in-law. He is in the Assembly of God and only speaks about the baptism in the Holy Spirit and the doctrine of speaking in tongues. He came among us and caused much trouble. Ultimately, Brother Yu was drawn off by him to speak in tongues. There was a great problem. He set up another meeting in Brother Yu's house. It hurt all our members. I was very sad because of this. I deeply felt that I have offended the Lord much because I did not take care of our brother in love. Shortly thereafter, the denominations gave us difficulties. They kept distracting Brother Kao so that he suffered much. We were really in danger for a few days. Satan used many different ways to divide our brothers. Finally, Brother Hsiao, Sister Hsieh, and myself gave the whole matter to God in prayer and begged God to protect His children. We deeply believed that God had opened a door that no man could shut and that He would protect us. We asked the Lord to give us strength to overcome this attack. Thank the Lord, we stood firm by His blood. A few days ago I went to Ch'ang-ch'un to visit old Brother T'ien and Sister Chang. I learned about the conference in Hangchow from them. I really thank the Lord that He raised up Brothers Lo and Chao to serve the brothers and sisters. They are very clear about the truth and bear the responsibility of deacons in the assembly. (Parts omitted.)</p><p>The assemblies in Manchuria will continue to suffer if gifted workers do not come to lead them. It will not be easy for them to go on either. We entreat the Lord to send Brother Nee to Manchuria soon. (Parts omitted.)</p><p>Please greet Brother Ma Mei T'ang. May you be clearly dealt with by the Lord in this time so that you might have more strength to bear an overcoming testimony for the Lord, amen. Please read the entire fourth chapter of 2 Corinthians.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />An Ching T'ien<br />December 4, 1934</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> </body></html>
