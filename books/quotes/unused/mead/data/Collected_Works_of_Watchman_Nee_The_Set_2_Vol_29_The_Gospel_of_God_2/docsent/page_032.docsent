   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REWARD AND GIFT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we want to see the third difference the difference between reward and gift, in other words, the difference between the kingdom and eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are many Christians in the church today who cannot differentiate between the kingdom of the heavens and eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They think that the kingdom of the heavens is eternal life and that eternal life is simply the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They have mixed up the Word of God, taking the condition for the receiving of the kingdom as the condition for the preservation of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They take the losing of the kingdom as the losing of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the distinction between these two is very clear in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One may lose the kingdom of the heavens, but he will not lose eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One can lose the reward, but he will not lose the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What then is the reward, and what is the gift?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We were saved because of the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God gave the gift to us freely by His grace; therefore, we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The reward pertains to the relationship between us and the Holy Spirit after we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we were saved, we were related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This relationship allows us to obtain the gift that we are absolutely unworthy of receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Similarly, after we have been saved, we have a relationship with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This relationship allows us to obtain the reward which we could not otherwise obtain by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If one believes in the Lord Jesus as Savior, accepting the Lord Jesus as life, this one is saved before God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After he is saved, God immediately puts this one on a pathway, so that he will run in the race and will obtain the reward placed before him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A Christian is saved because of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After he is saved, he has to manifest the victory of Christ by the Holy Spirit day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If one will do this, then at the end of the race, he will obtain the heavenly glory and the heavenly reward from God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, salvation is the first step of this path, and the reward is the last step.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only the saved ones are qualified to gain the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The unsaved ones are not qualified for this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God has given us two things rather than one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God places the gift before the worldly people and places the reward before the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When one believes in Christ, he receives the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When one follows Christ, he receives the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Gift is obtained through faith, and it is for the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Reward is obtained by being faithful and having good deeds, and it is for the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is a big mistake in the churches today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man thinks that salvation is the only thing and that there is nothing else besides being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He takes the kingdom of the heavens and eternal life as the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He considers that since one is saved when he believes, he no longer has to be concerned with works.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Bible makes a distinction between God's part and man's part.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One part is the salvation given by God, and the other part is the glory of the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be saved has absolutely nothing to do with one's works.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once anyone believes in the Lord Jesus, he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But after his salvation, God immediately places the second thing before him, telling him that besides salvation, there is a reward, a coming glory, a crown, and a throne for him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God puts His throne, crown, glory, and reward before the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If one is faithful, he will obtain these.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If he is unfaithful, he will lose them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we do not say that good works are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, we do say that good works are useless as far as salvation is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Man cannot be saved by his good works.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Neither can he be prevented from salvation by his evil works.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Good works are applicable to the matter of the reward, the matter of the crown, the matter of the glory, and the matter of the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Good works are useless regarding the matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God cannot allow man to be saved by his work; neither will He allow man to be rewarded by his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God cannot allow man to perish because of his evil works.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God can determine only man's salvation or perdition by whether or not he believes in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Similarly, God cannot determine a man's receiving of His glory by whether or not one believes in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whether or not you have His Son in you determines the matter of eternal life or perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whether or not you have good works before God determines the matter of receiving the reward and the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In other words, God will never save a person because he has merits, and He will never reward one who has no merit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If someone has merits, God will not therefore save such a one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the other hand, God will never reward anyone who has no merit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Man has to come before God totally helpless and meritless in order for God to save him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But after salvation, we have to be faithful, and we have to endeavor to produce good works through His Son Jesus Christ in order to obtain the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Please do not think that good works are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are saying that good works are useless towards salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Good works have nothing to do with salvation at all.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Salvation depends on whether or not you would repent of your former position.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It depends on whether you would have regret over your past to believe in His work on the cross and in His resurrection as the proof of your justification.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the crux of all problems.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The matter of work is related to reward.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Work is useful, but only in the matter of reward.</S>
