The Satanic Chaos with the Returned Captives</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Returned Captives Being Idle<br>in Building the Temple of God</H2><P>The returned captives were idle in building the temple of God (Hag. 1). They should have been excited and diligent to build the temple, but instead they became idle, forgetting the rebuilding of the temple.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Returned Captives Being<br>in a Messy Situation</H2><P>The returned captives were in a messy situation. This situation was dealt with in the books of Nehemiah, Haggai, and Malachi.</P><P>The Old Testament ends with chaos but not with disappointment. On the contrary, there was much expectation. The godly Jews were expecting to see the Messiah and looked forward to Messiah's coming. Thus, the Old Testament ends not only with chaos but with expectation&#151;the expectation of Christ's coming.</P><P>The coming of Christ is of two parts: the first coming and the second coming. Christ's first coming was the initiation of the New Testament economy, and Christ's second coming will be the consummation of the New Testament economy. The first coming is in the beginning of Matthew, and the second coming is in the end of Revelation. The church age, the time between these two comings, is actually the coming of Christ. The church is the process of Christ's coming. Christ is in the process of coming through all the church members, through the proper church life.</P><P>The entire New Testament is a matter of the coming of Christ, the wonderful One. In between the initiation of the New Testament economy and its consummation, there is the process of the church, and the church life is the process of Christ's coming. Christ is on the way of His coming, and the church life is the way on which Christ is coming. Christ has come to initiate the New Testament economy, and He is coming to consummate the New Testament economy. Now He is on the way of His coming, and this way is the church. Therefore, if we are in the church, we are in His coming.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
