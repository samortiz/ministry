   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE THIRD STEP OF THE FALL A. The Cause</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the first step of the fall, the enemy of God was outside of man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the second step of the fall, this enemy was inside of man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now, the enemy took another step, causing man to fall even further.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Evil Spirits Mingling with Man</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>the Fallen Angels Joining with Man</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>through Illegal Marriage</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Genesis 6 tells us that the sons of God married the daughters of men.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here the sons of God were the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Job 1:6 and 2:1 we are told that the angels are called the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Also, the Syriac Version of the Old Testament renders the sons of God as the angels in Genesis 6.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The angels that married the daughters of men were those who did not keep their principality, as recorded in Jude 6 and 7.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some of the fallen angels under Satan came down to the earth and took human bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They formed illegal marriages with the daughters of men.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They committed fornication through the bodies of men, so that the human race was no longer pure but became a mixture of human nature with the fallen spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, God decided to send the flood to exterminate the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Man Becoming Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Genesis 6:3 says, And the Lord said, My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, for that he indeed is flesh Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the first step of the fall, man did not exercise his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the second step of the fall, man followed his own will and lived by his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the third step of the fall, man abused the fallen body and became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Romans 7 and 8 reveal to us that the flesh is thoroughly and absolutely hated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God will not tolerate it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, when the entire human race became flesh, God came in and told His servant Noah that He was going to destroy that whole generation together with the earth Gen 6:11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>B. The Process</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first step was the fulfilling of the lusts of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Man lived and indulged in lusts, and every imagination of his thoughts was evil continually Gen 6:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The second step was that man was not only evil, but corrupt to such a degree that even the most tolerant God could not tolerate it any longer Gen 6:11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>C. The Result</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First, the Holy Spirit withdrew Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord said, My Spirit shall not strive with man forever Gen 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before that time although man had fallen, God s Spirit was continually striving with man and moving in man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nevertheless, at this point God could not do anything further.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When man had become flesh, the Spirit of God had to withdraw.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Man was completely separated from God and forsaken by God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Second, the deluge brought in the judgment of destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With the exception of Noah and those in the ark with him, all were exterminated by the flood.</S>
