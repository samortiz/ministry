   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>How can a man tell if his words are right or wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He can tell by the way the spirit is released.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If his spirit is released while he speaks, the words are right.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If his spirit is not released, they are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the restriction the Spirit places upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have said before that we do not know immediately when we are saying the right thing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we stand at the crossroad, we do not know immediately what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After speaking for a few minutes with both the word and the spirit moving together, we know that we made the right turn a moment earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One does not know immediately whether the spirit and the word are moving along together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the reason we say that the whole matter has more to do with God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The more we realize this, the more we have nothing to depend on.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we function as a minister of the word, we can do nothing except look solely to God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By ourselves, we cannot guarantee that we will speak by the Spirit of God for longer than five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is easy for us to turn, and it is easier for us to make the wrong turn.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Human wisdom, knowledge, and experience cannot help in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are under God's mercy during ordinary times and we learn to look to the God who is full of mercy and commit ourselves to Him, we will find that our words will be right spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if God does not grant us mercy, we cannot keep ourselves in this way all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is not something that a servant can dictate; it is something that only the Master can dictate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is not something we can do; this is something that only the Lord can do.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It does not matter how much experience we have had in the past or how much knowledge or training we have received from God; we have to commit ourselves unreservedly to the Lord's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Otherwise, we may be right for three or five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But as soon as we make a turn, we are off again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before the Lord a minister of God's word must see that his release of the word is not just for the sake of releasing the word; he is releasing it to release his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The purpose of releasing the word is to release the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No minister should think that his responsibility merely lies in the release of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The responsibility of the minister is to release the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Speaking the word alone does not constitute the work of the minister; the work of the minister involves the discharge of the spirit through the word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A fundamental test that a minister of the word can apply to himself is to ask how much of the spirit was released after he delivered his message.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The more the spirit is released, the more the speaker is relieved; he knows that the Lord has used him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He does not have to worry about the fruit because the Lord is responsible for the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whether or not someone is saved or has received help is a matter that is in the hands of the Lord; it is not in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The result or the success is the Lord's business; this should not be of concern to us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are the servants.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For us there is only one subjective fruit the assurance, as we are speaking or after speaking, that the Lord has graced us and has granted mercy to us to discharge our burden.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The joy of a minister of the word is not in the number of words he has spoken, the nodding of the audience, or the help that others profess to have received.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The joy of the minister of the word lies in the release of his spirit in his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once the spirit is released, the burden is gone, the heart is lightened, and he knows that he has fulfilled his responsibility and done what he should do.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the word is released without the spirit, the burden remains.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He can raise his voice, strain his throat, and exhaust his energy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But he remains a total failure because his spirit is closed and bound.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A man speaks to discharge his burden.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He has to let the spirit flow.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more the spirit flows, the more the speaker is relieved, and the more he is relieved, the happier he is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When our spirit is released, we have God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If our spirit is not released, our word is not God's word; it is only an imitation of His word, not His very own word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever God's word passes through us, the spirit surely accompanies the word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should pay attention to the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only foolish ones set their eyes on their fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only foolish ones take in the praises of others or appreciate their own words.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Foolish ones think that it is unnecessary to touch their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A man has to remain in foolishness, darkness, and total blindness to appreciate and be content with his own words.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Such a person has forgotten the fact that his words are altogether vanity if they are void of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must pay attention to the release of the spirit in our words.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we pay attention to this, the word and spirit will be together.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we neglect this, the two will be separate.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once we are not watchful, the word and the spirit lose touch with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the negative side, we have to watch out for the separation which is caused by the lack of watchfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the positive side, we have to insure that the word and the spirit are joined to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This can only be accomplished through God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Every word must be accompanied by the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As long as the spirit is released, the speaking is right and others touch something high.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the one hand, we have to be watchful, but on the other hand, we have to look to God for His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>By ourselves, we do not know how to make a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As soon as we make a turn, we lose our bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But if God continues to grant us mercy, we will not lose touch with the spirit when our words make a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If a brother takes pride in his own preaching, it can only mean one thing: He is merely a preacher; he does not have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He can go home feeling great and elevated, but he does not have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A foolish man is a proud man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must remember that only God's mercy can keep the word and the spirit together.</S>
