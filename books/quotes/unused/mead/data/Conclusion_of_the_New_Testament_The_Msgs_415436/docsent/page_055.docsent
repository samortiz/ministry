   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY-THREE EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION 30</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we will continue to consider Christ as the Husband of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>g. Christ as the Tree of Life Growing</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>on the Two Sides of the River of Water of Life</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Revelation 22:1 says, He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Out of the throne of God and of the Lamb flows the river of water of life, and in this river the tree of life grows as a spreading vine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The river of water of life in the New Jerusalem signifies the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, God s Spirit will be a river.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This river of water of life is in the city s unique spiral street.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the whole city there is only one street.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The street with the river spirals down the mountain to reach every part of the city and all its twelve gates.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The street is the communication that ministers something to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the ministering communication to water the whole city for the city s drink.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The tree of life, the life-supplying Christ, is a great vine growing on the two sides of the river to nourish the entire city for its food.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s throne is for His government, the river is for our watering, and the tree of life is for our nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Triune God governs, serves, waters, and feeds the entire city.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The tree of life signifies God Himself in Christ as the life supply to us Gen 2:9; John 1:4; 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This tree is the embodiment of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the divine revelation, only God Himself is life in the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This God who is life is absolutely embodied in Christ Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ is the tree of life, and in this tree of life is the full enjoyment of all the riches of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In brief, the tree of life in the Bible is a figure of the Triune God embodied in Christ to be the substance of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This tree is good for man to take and eat Gen 2:16; John 6:57b that man may be constituted with God as the constituent of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, man and God become organically united and live together as one person 15:5; Phil 1:20-21a .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Colossians 3:4 says that Christ is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we need to take Him as our supply, as the substance of the divine life, in which we can be victorious and overcoming, even reigning in His eternal life Rom 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, we will be co-kings with Christ in the thousand-year kingdom Rev 3:21; 20:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all have two lives.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have the natural life, the human life, and we have the spiritual life, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The natural life is just our self and the divine life is also a person, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Each one of us is also two persons, one person being our self and the other being Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have the life from Adam, and we have the life that is Christ Himself in us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all need to live by Christ, the divine life, not by our self, the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today we should enjoy God as our life and as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Out of the enjoyment of the Lord as our life supply, we will have our daily life, our walk, our work, and the building up of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then everything we have will be according to God s divine element, not according to our own concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The tree of life is one of the outstanding features of New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the first two chapters of the Bible we see the old heaven, the old earth, the old garden, Adam, and the tree of life Gen 1:1; 2:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the last two chapters of the Bible we see the new heaven, the new earth, and the city with the tree of life Rev 21:1-2; 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this city we do not see Adam but Israel and the apostles, who represent the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the garden in Genesis there was the old man; in the city in Revelation there is the corporate new man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the garden there was the tree of life, and in the city there is also the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The heaven and earth have changed, the garden has been changed into the city, and the first man has been changed into the corporate new man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the tree of life remains unchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everything has been changed or improved except the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From the beginning to the end, the tree of life remains the same; the tree of life never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>1 The Tree of Life Revealed in the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the Bible the tree of life is mentioned first in Genesis 2, and it proceeds to the end of the Bible in Revelation 22.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the beginning of God s relationship with man in Genesis 2, God placed man in front of the tree of life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Immediately, God brought this man out of His creating hand to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This indicates that what God wanted man to do was to eat the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The tree of life is a sign, signifying that the creating God is the life supply to His created man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Psalm 36:9 says, With You is the fountain of life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>According to this verse, with God there is the fountain of life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The tree of life must be related to life, which is in God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thus, God is the fountain, the source, of life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>John 1:4 says, In Him was life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The word Him in this verse refers to the Word in verse 1, who is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the Word, who is God, is life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In John 14:6 Christ came and told us, I am...the life ; in 10:10, He declared, I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly ; and in John 15:1 He said, I am the true vine.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Besides Christ, every vine is a false one; only He is the true vine.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A vine is a tree, and if we put together these two matters of life and the tree, we have the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The tree of life is the Triune God who embodied Himself in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ, as the embodiment of the Triune God, is the life in the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, Christ is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then in Revelation 2:7 the Lord Jesus said that to him who overcomes He will give to eat of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>At the end of the Bible there is the holy city with the river flowing with the living water 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the flow of the living water grows the tree of life v. 2 . The tree of life fulfills, for eternity, what God intended from the beginning Gen 2:9 . The tree of life was closed to man due to his fall 3:22-24 , but it has been opened to believers by the redemption of Christ Heb 10:19-20 . Today the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life is the believers common portion John 6:35, 57 . In the millennial kingdom the overcoming believers will enjoy Christ, the tree of life, as their reward Rev 2:7 . Eventually, in the new heaven and new earth for eternity, all of God s redeemed will enjoy Christ, the tree of life, as their eternal portion 22:14, 19 .</S>
