The Two Trees Being the Two Most Striking<br>in the First Group of Signs<br>in Genesis 1 and 2</H2><P>The two most striking in the first group of signs in Genesis 1 and 2 are the two trees (Gen. 2:9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The First Being the Tree of Life,<br>as the Highest Sign</H2><P>The first of these signs is the tree of life, as the highest sign, signifying God, even the Triune God, as life to man in man's relationship with Him (Psa. 36:9a). God created man, breathing into him the breath of life (Gen. 2:7), which became man's spirit; but at that time, He did not put Himself into man as man's life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Second Being<br>the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil,<br>as the Highest Negative Sign</H2><P>The second of these signs is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, as the highest negative sign, signifying Satan the devil, even the evil one, as death to man in man's fall before God (Gen. 2:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Both Signs Signifying Persons</H2><P>Both of these signs, as the most striking ones, signify persons&#151;God and Satan&#151;not things or matters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The First Tree Signifying God Only as Life</H2><P>The first tree signifies God only as life, with no implications of other elements.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Second Tree Signifying Satan as Death</H2><P>The second tree signifies Satan as death, with the implications of knowledge, good, and evil. Whereas God is simple, Satan is very complicated.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Good and Evil Not Being Signified by Two Trees<br>but by One Tree&#151;the Second Tree</H2><P>Good and evil are not signified by two trees but by one tree&#151;the second tree. Thus, seeking good other than God belongs to Satan.</P><P>According to the divine revelation, knowledge is Satan, good is Satan, and evil is Satan. Today the world is in an age that worships knowledge. Before eating of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Adam and Eve were ignorant, not knowing, so they had no sin. After they ate of the tree of knowledge, their eyes were opened, and they became knowledgeable. That was sin. We all consider that to commit sin is sin, but we may not consider that knowing sin is sin.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_118.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_120.html">Next</a> </body></html>
