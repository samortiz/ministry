S.</h2><p>I was saved in 1938, but I touched the Lord's way only five years ago. In the past my life was caught up with people in military-political circles. One day I read in Matthew 7 about entering the narrow gate and taking the constricted way. I began to cry. I saw that the Lord is my Friend and my world. I was willing to become a gospel preacher. After I was saved, I testified to others all the time. I loved to sing hymns, to study the Word, and to pray. Yet I still cherished other things. First, I loved my own life; second, I loved my wife; and third, I loved antiques and calligraphy. My love for the Lord occupied the fourth or fifth place. Later, I offered up my antiques and calligraphy, and I had a great release. I began to live by faith. The Lord said that I should seek first His kingdom and His righteousness and all these things would be added to me. I worked in northwest China. In 1947 I came to Shanghai and saw Brother Witness Lee, Brother Yu Cheng-hwa, and Sister Wang and Sister Lee for the first time. I received the life supply from them. My inner eyes began to open, and I saw the Body life and the life of coordination, etc.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>I thank the Lord for His past guidance in our brother. I hope that the Lord will fill up his lack this time on the mountain. Our brother has experienced much leading and dealing from God, but he is still short in faithfulness. The discipline of the Holy Spirit in our brother is never wrong. Unfortunately, our brother's spirit is not strong enough, and his thoughts are not rich enough. I believe our brother would not mind me saying this. It is the Lord's grace that He would deal with us time after time, but our brother needs a fundamental dealing. If he experiences this fundamental dealing, all other problems will be settled. I am not talking about general dealings in life, but about a fundamental dealing for our brother's living. His spirit also has to be empowered for the work. Our brother's problem is that he has a weak spirit. As ministers, we must have a strong exercise of our spirits; we should push out our spirits. Some people can never release or exercise their spirit on the platform. A person with a strong spirit can exercise and use his spirit all the time. To exercise the spirit is to push it out. Our brother has the flow of the spirit, but there is little exercise of the spirit. He cannot bring others to any high-peak experience. If we cannot exercise our spirit freely, our work and testimony will not bring others to a high peak. If we can bring others to a high peak, our work will become fruitful.</p><p>Our brother has only experienced some fragmented dealings in life; he has not experienced a fundamental dealing. He is short of a strong spirit in the work; he cannot push out his spirit or bring others to a high peak. Our brother must learn to be a good minister of the word. He must learn to lift his spirit to new heights. Once our spirit is pushed out, it is released. When our spirit feels something within, we need our mind to translate this feeling into words and then release them. If we are rich in thoughts, we will be able to know the feeling of the spirit, and we will be able to release the spirit through words. We have many words but little spirit because our thoughts are not rich enough. Therefore, on the one hand, we have to pray for a strong spirit. On the other hand, we have to have rich thoughts. The spirit is released in a spontaneous way; it does not require a loud voice or a solemn face. Such a release cannot be imitated, and one cannot force himself to release his spirit. If a minister of the word cannot use his spirit, he will not know when his spirit is supplying others and when his burden is discharged. We have the Holy Spirit within us; He gives us feelings and rich thoughts. When we capture these thoughts with our own spirit, our words will become powerful. We are short of utterance because we are poor in thoughts. But sometimes an increase in words is not accompanied by the release of the spirit. We have to ask the Lord to give us proper words and rich thoughts. When we have feelings in our spirit again, we can convey them with proper words through enriched thoughts.</p>
