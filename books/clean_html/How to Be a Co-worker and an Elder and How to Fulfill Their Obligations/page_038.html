In the previous chapter we have already covered three things on the negative side which we need to guard against, namely, ambition, pride, and self-justification. In this chapter we want to see that we need to be wary of not doing some positive things. The Bible mentions a great number of positive things. Furthermore, the things mentioned in Brother Nee's books and in my books are the positive things mentioned in the Bible. I have released three to four thousand messages in the United States which cover all these positive things. What we need to beware of is the "not" with regard to these positive things. There are too many "nots" in us. Indeed, the Bible speaks of many positive things, and Brother Nee and I have also been speaking these things for several decades. However, few are those who practice what they have heard, and many are those who do not.</P><P>Some may say, "Brother Lee, does this mean that we don't love the Lord?" Many people in the Lord's recovery truly love the Lord and are willing to pay the price; they have also seen the light and the revelation so that they know God's economy and, even more, the Lord's recovery; moreover, they are living the church life in the Lord's recovery and are learning to build up the Body of Christ. For this, I truly worship the Lord. When I observe carefully, however, I realize that the work being carried out by the co-workers and the condition of the churches under the shepherding of the elders are not quite satisfactory to us. We are not satisfied, because we do not practice what we have seen. The many clear revelations which we have seen in the Bible have been released among us and printed in books; also, many hymns have been written. However, I first ask myself frequently whether or not I live according to this light and revelation in the Bible. I admit before the Lord that although He has inspired me to release these messages and compose these hymns of high quality, I do not live closely according to the Lord's revelation and inspiration to me.</P>
