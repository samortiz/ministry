[1]  The God-ordained Way to Practice the New Testament Economy CONTENTS
[2]  The contents of our fellowship in this book will be to study the new way for the Lord s new move.
[3]  Our desire is to see and enter into the God-ordained way to practice the New Testament economy.
[4]  We are not merely going to knock on people s doors, but we are going to visit people in the same way that the Lord Jesus did.
[5]  The first major item in the divine economy is the completion of Christ.
[6]  When God created the present universe, He spent only six days.
[7]  But for God to complete Christ, He spent thirty-three and a half years.
[8]  God went through a long process to finish the completion of His Christ.
[9]  This universal authority is composed of and with Christ s deity, Christ s incarnation, Christ s human living, Christ s death, Christ s resurrection, Christ s being the life-giving Spirit, Christ s ascension, and Christ s being the economical Spirit of power.
[10]  The next major item in the divine economy is the propagation of the pneumatic Christ.
[11]  In the book of Acts, the completed Christ was being propagated, multiplied; on the day of Pentecost three thousand were baptized Acts 2:41 .
[12]  To knock on people s doors and to preach the gospel to them is to make them the multiplication of the pneumatic Christ.
[13]  This pneumatic Christ is the essential Spirit of life to impart the divine life of resurrection into God s chosen and believing people John 3:3, 5-6 .
[14]  In Luke 10 the Lord told the disciples that He was sending them as lambs in the midst of wolves v. 3 . However, among these wolves there are a good number of sons of peace who are God s chosen people v. 6 . Our trainees in Taipei have the experience of being able to discern whether or not a person is a son of peace within a few minutes.
[15]  We need such a clear vision to see what a great thing it is to go out by being linked to Christ so that people can be regenerated with the essential, pneumatic Christ and baptized not only into the Triune God but also into the Body of Christ.
[16]  Through our going out to knock on people s doors, we bring them God s completed Christ as the very pneumatic One, who is the essential Spirit of life and the economical Spirit of power, to produce regenerated and baptized believers.
[17]  This is according to God s eternal plan Eph 3:11 to accomplish the mystery hidden in God from the ages v. 9 . We need to practice the new way as persons who are linked with Christ and who go out with Christ to impart this Christ to people as life and as power that they might be regenerated and baptized for the producing of the church.
[18]  CHAPTER TWO THE DIVINE TRINITY S OPERATION Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:1-12 THE SUBJECT
[19]  First Corinthians 12:1-12 is a portion of the Word that has been misunderstood and even misused throughout the history of the church.
[20]  God anointed His Son to be His Christ, yet even His Son, the God-anointed One, needed to be completed, to be equipped, in order that He might have the ability and the qualifications to carry out His commission to accomplish God s eternal plan.
[21]  After God has done so much to complete Christ and to propagate Christ to produce the church life, we have to see how the church should meet, and the way for the church to meet is by the Divine Trinity s operation.
[22]  God s New Testament economy is first to complete His Christ and then to propagate, to duplicate, to reproduce, this completed Christ and dispense Him into His chosen and believing people for the producing of the church, which is the organism of the Triune God.
[23]  In the Divine Trinity s operation, the Spirit moves the believers to say Lord Jesus and distributes gifts to the believers 1 Cor 12:3-4 .
[24]  CHAPTER THREE THE DEFORMED AND DEGRADED CHRISTIANITY Scripture Reading: Rev 2:14-15, 20; 3:1-2
[25]  We love all of our brothers and sisters in the Lord, yet we have to admit that today s Christendom is absolutely far off from God s eternal plan.
[26]  The deformed and degraded Christianity has left the God-ordained way for carrying out the New Testament economy.
[27]  Christianity does not care for the New Testament economy, but God does.
[28]  God s New Testament economy is first to complete His Christ and then to propagate this completed, pneumatic Christ to produce the church.
[29]  The entire Christianity is far away from this economy, having left the God-ordained way to carry out God s eternal purpose.
[30]  We are not here for religion but for God s economy, which is to propagate His completed Christ to produce the church as the Body of such a Christ.
[31]  TO MOVE AND ACT IN THE SO-CALLED CHURCHES
[32]  Christianity also opens the way for the nominal Christians to move and act in the so-called churches.
[33]  Many Christians know the birth of Christ, the incarnation of Christ, but they have never seen that the incarnation was the first step for God to complete His Christ.
[34]  The last step of God s completion of His Christ was Christ s ascension into heaven that He might become the economical Spirit of power to be poured upon His Body.
[35]  We have pointed out that the Brethren say that 1 Corinthians is merely a book on how to solve all the problems in the church while those in Pentecostalism say that 1 Corinthians is the unique book that focuses on speaking in tongues.
[36]  To have a proper meeting life, we do not just need to know Christ or to have a revelation concerning Him, to see Him.
[37]  In chapter one Christ is our God-given portion v. 2 . God has called us into the participation of Christ, the fellowship of Christ, that is, into the enjoyment of Christ as our portion v. 9 . This is why verse 2 says that Christ is theirs and ours.
[38]  Christ is also God s power and God s wisdom to us as our righteousness concerning our past, our sanctification concerning our present, and our redemption concerning our future 1:24, 30 .
[39]  In chapter two Christ is the Lord of glory v. 8 and the deep things of God v. 10 . In chapter three He is the unique foundation of God s building v. 11 . No one can lay another foundation besides Him.
[40]  CHAPTER FIVE THE CHRISTIAN GATHERING Scripture Reading: Matt 18:20; 1 Cor 14:23, 26; Acts 2:46; 5:42; 12:12 THE ENJOYMENT
[41]  One of the principles of how to have proper meetings for the church life is that we must help people learn to enjoy Christ.
[42]  Without the enjoyment of Christ, it is difficult to have meetings which are profitable for the church life.
[43]  What we have, what we are, and what we can do, apart from the enjoyment of Christ, are altogether useless.
[44]  We should not use anything we have, anything we are, or anything we can do to benefit the church meetings.
[45]  The only thing worthwhile for the church meeting is Christ Himself, the Christ who has passed through all the processes to become the completed Christ.
[46]  TO CARRY OUT THE DIVINE ECONOMY The Building Up of the Church
[47]  First Corinthians is the unique book regarding Christian meetings 11:17; 14:23, 26, 34, 35 revealing that the Christian meetings are to build up the church 14:4-5, 12, 26 .
[48]  We should keep this thought in our understanding whenever we take the lead to help the home meetings.
[49]  We build up the church in the church meetings by the Spirit s gifts, the Lord s ministries, and God s operations 1 Cor 12:3-7 .
[50]  The believers first met in the homes beginning on the day of Pentecost Acts 2:46 .
[51]  CHAPTER SIX THE SUPPORT OF THE CHURCH MEETINGS Scripture Reading: Phil 1:20-21; 1 Cor 14:26; Eph 4:15-16 THE CHRISTIAN DAILY LIFE TO LIVE CHRIST
[52]  For anything to exist, to act, and to live, there must be a support for that thing.
[53]  The Christian daily life is for the church life.
[54]  The church as Christ s Body is Christ Himself 1 Cor 12:12 .
[55]  Our going out to visit people by knocking on their doors is a wonderful, proven practice.
[56]  I received letters from some saints, however, who told me that they knocked on doors for a long time without getting any baptized.
[57]  FOR THE CHRISTIAN MEETINGS 1 Scripture Reading: Rom 8:11; 2 Tim 1:7; Eph 5:18b; 1 Cor 6:17; Acts 13:52; Gal 5:16, 25; 1 Cor 14:15; Eph 6:18 THE BELIEVERS SPIRIT AND THE SPIRIT
[58]  According to the Bible and to our experience there are four basic factors for the Christian meetings: the mingled spirit, the word, praying, and singing.
[59]  When God the Spirit regenerates us, He imparts God Himself as the divine life into our being, that is, into our spirit.
[60]  The way to practice being one spirit with the Lord is to call on His name unceasingly.
[61]  Do not call on the Lord only before the meeting, after the meeting, or in the meeting.
[62]  FOR THE CHRISTIAN MEETINGS 2 Scripture Reading: Col 3:16; Eph 6:17-18; 1 Cor 12:8; 14:6, 26 LOGOS AND RHEMA
[63]  In chapter seven we saw that the first basic factor for the Christian meetings is the mingled spirit.
[64]  The word for the Christian meetings is not our word, but the holy word, God s word, the divine word.
[65]  The word of knowledge 1 Cor 12:8b imparts the general knowledge of things concerning God and the Lord 8:1-7 .
[66]  The word of knowledge speaks in a general way about the Lord Jesus dying for us, His accomplishing redemption for us, and His relationship with us.
[67]  The first principle in handling God s word is that we should not exercise our mind too much.
[68]  In the Lord s light we can see that Jacob s brother was not chosen by God, so Christ had nothing to do with him.
[69]  FOR THE CHRISTIAN MEETINGS 3 Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 5:17; Acts 4:31; Eph 6:18; 1 Cor 14:15; Col 3:16; Eph 5:19
[70]  As we have seen, the first two factors for the Christian meetings are the mingled spirit and the word.
[71]  When we have an inner realization of God s grace, this realization will stir up our being to sing.
[72]  TO SPREAD THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Gen 3:8-9, 15, 21; Exo 3:8; 1 Tim 1:15; Luke 19:1-10; John 4:3-15; Matt 10:5-8, 11-13; Luke 10:1-6; Mark 16:15; Matt 28:19 GOD S PATTERN
[73]  Going out to visit people is the most effective way to spread the gospel for the kingdom of God.
[74]  OF THE DIVINE TRINITY S ORGANISM Scripture Reading: John 15:1-8, 16; Acts 2:46; 5:42 THE DIVINE TRINITY S ORGANISM
[75]  CHAPTER TWELVE SETTING UP HOME MEETINGS Scripture Reading: Acts 2:46; 5:42; 1 Cor 14:26; Rom 12:4-5; Eph 4:16; 1 Cor 12:1-3, 8; 14:6
[76]  In the Lord s new way to carry out the increase and spread of the church, we have discovered that setting up home meetings is more difficult than going out to knock on doors and baptize people.
[77]  We must endeavor to learn how to raise up home meetings.
[78]  We must pray for a living way to bring the new believers onward that they may grow in life, in knowledge, and in function as members of the Lord s Body.
[79]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE WAY TO BUILD UP HOME MEETINGS Scripture Reading: Acts 5:42; 2:46, 42; 12:12 CHRISTIAN MEETINGS BEING FOR
[80]  In the home meetings we have to tell the attendants that Christian meetings are for the worship of God and the Lord Jesus.
[81]  To worship God and the Lord Jesus does not necessarily mean that we have to kneel down or bow down to adore Him with praises and thanks.
[82]  We can worship God and the Lord Jesus by preaching the gospel, teaching the truth Acts 5:42 , breaking bread to remember the Lord 2:46 , fellowshipping one with another 2:42 , and praying 2:42; 12:12 .
[83]  In our understanding, in our realization, and in our spirit we should do all things with the sense of worshipping God and the Lord Jesus.
[84]  When we go out to knock on people s doors to afford the Lord a way to save them, this is counted as a kind of worship to God and the Lord Jesus.
[85]  Eventually the Lord Jesus revealed that to contact God the Spirit with our spirit is to drink of the living water 4:24 , and to drink of the living water is to render real worship to God.
[86]  The proper worship of the Lord Jesus can also be seen in the house of Simon the leper in Bethany where Mary, Martha, and Lazarus were John 12:1-3; cf.
[87]  These dear saints were rendering the Lord Jesus the highest standard of worship, and the Lord was happy.
[88]  We need to lead and promote each one of the attendants in the home meetings to learn to take part in the activities in the meetings.
[89]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE STANDARD OF HOME MEETINGS Scripture Reading: Matt 24:14; Luke 17:20-21; John 3:3, 5; Eph 3:8-11
[90]  In the Lord s recovery our preaching, teaching, and home meetings must come up to the high standard revealed in the New Testament.
[91]  After visiting people by knocking on their doors, leading them to receive the Lord, and baptizing them, we should return to these new ones again and again to meet with them in their homes.
[92]  In the New Testament, different terms are used for the gospel, such as the gospel of grace Acts 20:24 , the gospel of God Rom 1:1; 15:16 , the gospel of Christ Rom 15:19 , the gospel of Jesus Christ Mark 1:1 , the gospel of the glory of Christ 2 Cor 4:4 , the gospel of peace Eph 6:15 , and the gospel of our salvation Eph 1:13 .
[93]  We must also have the high standard of the gospel concerning the economy of the mystery hidden in God Eph 3:9-11 .
[94]  The entire universe is a mystery, but within this mystery there is a deeper mystery which has been hidden in God.
[95]  Thus, Paul told us that he preached not only the unsearchable riches of Christ but also the economy of this mystery hidden in God from the ages.
[96]  What God desires is to gain a group of people to contain Him that they may become the members of the Body of Christ, that Christ may be their life, their Head, and their manifestation, and that they and He could be one universal new man to express Christ as the embodied God to fulfill His eternal purpose.
[97]  The mystery of God is Christ, the mystery of Christ is the church, and Christ and the church are the great mystery Eph 5:32 hidden in God from the centuries and revealed to the apostle Paul.
[98]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN ABSOLUTE FOR GOD S ORDAINED WAY Scripture Reading: Acts 28:31; Luke 10:1-6; Acts 2:46; 5:42; Luke 9:59-60; Rom 12:1; Eph 6:18; Gal 5:26; Heb 12:1; 1 John 2:15-17; Acts 13:52; 2 Cor 5:10; Matt 25:19 LIVING TO GOD FOR THE SPREADING OF HIS KINGDOM
[99]  In the foregoing chapters, we have seen a clear vision of God s ordained way to practice the New Testament economy.
[100]  Upon seeing such a vision, we should be absolute for this vision.
[101]  The four Gospels are a record of the completion of Christ, and the book of Acts records the propagation of Christ for the spread of the kingdom of God.
[102]  God in eternity chose many people to be sons of peace, yet God s selection needs our going out to visit people that these chosen ones can be found and brought to God.
[103]  The elders must learn not to control; rather, they must learn to help the saints to grow, to promote their function, to develop their gift, and to cultivate their divine ability.
[104]  Then all the saints will rise up to preach the gospel in a prevailing and effective way by knocking on people s doors, reading The Mystery of Human Life, helping people to believe, and baptizing them.
[105]  At least once a week, or perhaps two or three times a week, the saints would build up the home meetings by teaching the new believers the truth, and by edifying them and helping them to grow in life, thus establishing the local church with a view to building up the Body of Christ.
[106]  We must live to God for the spreading of His kingdom by visiting people and setting up home meetings, and we must be absolute for such a living for our whole life.
[107]  We should take such a living as the purpose of life, whether we are job-dropping full-timers or money-making full-timers Luke 9:59-60 .
[108]  Then we must use the rest of our ability, time, and resources for going out to knock on people s doors to baptize them into the Triune God and to set up home meetings to build up the churches.
[109]  To be able to say at the Lord s return that thousands of people have been baptized into the Triune God through us and that many churches have been raised up through our home meetings will be a glory to us at the Lord s coming back.
[110]  If we are vigilant in consecration, in prayer, in dealing with self-seeking, sins, and worldliness, in being filled, saturated, and empowered by the Spirit, in bringing people to Christ and building up home meetings, and in taking the spreading of the kingdom of God as our real career, we will be ready to meet the Lord at His judgment seat 2 Cor 5:10; Matt 25:19 .
[111]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN ONE WAY FOR ONE GOAL Scripture Reading: Mark 16:15; Matt 28:19; Acts 5:42; Eph 4:11-12; Rev 21:2; 1 Tim 1:3-4; Acts 2:42; 1 Tim 6:3; Eph 3:9 ONE WAY FOR ONE GOAL IN THE GOSPELS AND ACTS
[112]  Every point of the final four chapters of this book is crucial and vital to our present situation in the Lord s recovery.
[113]  We must be deeply impressed that what is revealed in the four Gospels plus Acts is the one way to carry out God s one goal.
[114]  The one completed Christ was preached and propagated for the spreading of the kingdom of God by one way according to God s eternal economy.
[115]  This one unique goal is the building up of the Body of Christ that God may have a corporate expression on the earth with a view to the coming New Jerusalem as God s eternal corporate expression Rev 21:2 .
[116]  We need to see that the Lord s new way is the one way, the God-ordained way, and this way is to visit people for the preaching of the gospel and to establish home meetings for the building up of the church Mark 16:15; Matt 28:19; Acts 5:42 .
[117]  From the beginning of the Lord s recovery in mainland China, we studied the Bible and the history of the church thoroughly so that we could see the proper practice of the church life.
[118]  We have said that we are taking the Lord s new way, but actually this new way is an ancient way.
[119]  We are living in the midst of this confusion, but we have been brought into the Lord s recovery through His mercy to practice the one way to carry out His New Testament economy.
[120]  The one goal in the Lord s recovery is not merely for the spreading of the gospel, not merely for the release of the biblical truths, not merely for saving sinners, and not merely for edifying the believers, but mainly for the building up of the Body of Christ that God may have a corporate expression on the earth, even in this age, for the building up of the coming New Jerusalem as God s eternal, corporate expression Eph 4:11-12; Rev 21:2 .
[121]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE APOSTLES TEACHING AND FELLOWSHIP Scripture Reading: Acts 2:42; 1 John 1:2-3; 2 Cor 13:14; Phil 2:1; Eph 4:3-6; 2 John 9-11; 1 Tim 1:3-4; Jude 3; Eph 4:13; 1 Cor 1:10
[122]  In this chapter we want to see the apostles teaching and fellowship.
[123]  Acts 2:42 says, And they were continuing steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.
[124]  If I were to teach foot-washing as a condition for receiving the saints, this teaching would immediately produce a particular fellowship.
[125]  AND MINISTERS Scripture Reading: Acts 1:17, 25; 2 Cor 4:1; 3:8-9; Eph 3:8; Gal 1:6-9; Eph 3:6-7; Col 1:24-25; Eph 4:11-12
[126]  Thus far, we have seen that in God s economy there is one goal and that God has ordained one way to reach this goal.
[127]  Furthermore, to have the one way for the one goal we must be in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles.
[128]  The danger of different ministries can be seen in the inner life movement.
[129]  The inner life movement began in the seventeenth century with the mystics in the Catholic Church such as Madame Guyon and Father Fenelon.
[130]  His teachings were a great help to Andrew Murray, who played a prominent role in recovering the truth concerning Christ as the believers inward life and experience.
[131]  AMONG THE NEW TESTAMENT MINISTERS Scripture Reading: Acts 1:17, 25; Eph 4:3-6; 1 Tim 1:3-4; 6:3-5; 2 John 9-11 ONE UNIQUE LEADERSHIP
[132]  In the New Testament there is only one ministry and only one leadership in the ministry.
[133]  He had to charge these ones not to teach things that were different from the apostles teaching, which is concerning God s New Testament economy to dispense the processed Triune God into His chosen and redeemed people that Christ might have a Body to express Himself and that the Triune God might have a complete, eternal expression in the New Jerusalem.
