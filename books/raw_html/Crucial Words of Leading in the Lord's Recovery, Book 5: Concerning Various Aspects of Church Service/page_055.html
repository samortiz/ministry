	 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">TRAINING FOR THE MEMBERS<br />
IN THE SMALL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we ask You to remember us as we are here for Your recovery. By Your precious blood and through You as our sin offering and trespass offering, we enter into Your presence. We confess that we are still weak and full of failures and that we are lacking in many ways. We still live on this earth and in this flesh, and we are contaminated in many aspects. We are indebted to You for Your grace, Your mercy, and Your glory, but Your mercy is exhaustless and never ceases. For this reason, we are still in Your recovery.</p>
<p>Lord, cleanse our conscience, our mind, and our feeling so that our inner being is bright. We truly desire to have fellowship with You in the light so that each one of us departs from darkness and so that we speak in the light, listen in the light, and receive in the light. Dispense more of Yourself into us. We only want You. Lord, we are willing to enter into Your burden. We are here because we want to receive a new burden from You.</p>
<p>We offer praise and thanks from the depth of our being, because we are Your treasure. We receive Your grace, and we have been Your continuation for the past thirty-six years. Lord, we look to You to give us grace that we may enter into another stage and that we may sense that a new age has begun. We want to enjoy new grace and experience new riches of Christ. Cause all of us to see, to understand, and to enter into a new realm. Cause the trumpet of Your recovery to sound stronger. How we desire to see Babylon fall down. Build up Your Body and build up Your testimony on the island of Taiwan! We give You the glory. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EACH MEMBER SHOWING CONCERN<br />
AND HAVING A BURDEN</h2>
<p>There are close to thirteen hundred brothers and sisters participating in this training for the members in the small groups. These saints are the fruit of the past thirty-six years of our labor on the island of Taiwan. This is a fulfillment of Isaiah 53:11, which says, &ldquo;He will see the fruit of the travail of His soul, / And He will be satisfied.&rdquo; After the Lord resurrected from the dead, He saw the fruit of His labor and He was satisfied. We also are satisfied by seeing the fruit of our labor. This gathering is a revival meeting, and the reviving factor is the small groups. We must labor in the small groups, and we must work out a way for the small groups.</p>
<p>For the construction of any building there must be a solid foundation. If the foundation is not solid, the building will not be strong. According to our fellowship and the report from the brothers, the ones participating in this training for the small groups are concerned and burdened about the small groups. Praise the Lord that He has gained thirteen hundred members who are each concerned, eager, capable, and have a sense of responsibility.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being One with the Lord and<br />
Cooperating with His Move</h2>
<p>In the beginning of August 1949, when we began the labor in Taipei, three or four hundred brothers and sisters were gained quickly. However, they were the old churchgoers from mainland China. Because the denominations they belonged to had not yet moved to Taiwan, they were temporarily homeless, and therefore came when they saw our meeting hall. The thirteen hundred members, however, are different. These saints are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and are concerned about the recovery. They have a burden and are experienced. We can say that these are family members. For years we have been bathed in the Lord&rsquo;s grace, and now our heart is moved by His grace. We can even say, &ldquo;Lord, whatever You need, we are willing to give ourselves to You. Because You have given everything to us, we now want to give everything to You.&rdquo; This is the feeling of each one of us. The Lord is happy to see so many people who are one with Him and are cooperating with His move.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Every Person Brought In through the Small Groups<br />
Knowing How to Function</h2>
<p>Currently there are over three hundred sixty small groups in Taipei. If the thirteen hundred saints were evenly divided, each small group would have three to four persons. Initially, many of us were very worried about how to lead the small groups. Even though the burden for taking care of the twenty-one meeting halls was heavy, we were increasing from twenty-one areas in which we labor to three hundred sixty. If the thirteen hundred saints can be brought into function, all our worries can be laid aside.</p>
<p>Through much consideration I studied once again all the portions concerning Christian meetings in the New Testament and saw that there is a distinction between large and small meetings. In order for an airplane to be steady when it flies, both wings are needed. We cannot fly an airplane with only one wing. In the past we relied on the big meetings, which was like relying on one wing to fly an airplane. Now we want to stress both the small groups and the big meetings. From the day of Pentecost, when the church was produced, the disciples met in the temple as well as from house to house. This shows that the practice of small groups is according to the Bible. The history of the church also confirms that small groups are the most effective way to bring in new ones and to uphold them. All the people brought in through the small groups grow up in the small groups, and they do not need to be prodded to function. They know how to function. In this way every new one becomes a responsible one because the atmosphere in the small group causes every member to exercise his function.</p>
<p>After many years of studying, we discovered that it takes a great effort to encourage one saint in a traditional gathering to open his mouth and function in the meeting. He might even stop meeting and complain, saying, &ldquo;It is most difficult to worship in your meeting hall. When I go to another place for Sunday worship, I can sit and enjoy their service. People sing for me, pray for me, speak a message for me, and bless me. I do not need to do anything.&rdquo; We need to see that it is wrong to bring people to the big meetings and ask them to share and fellowship. This can be compared to asking a person who is born and raised in Shantung province to speak Cantonese. We are asking too much of him. If we want him to speak Cantonese, we need to send him to live in Hong Kong. Then there is no need to force him. As long as he lives there for a period of time, he will be able to speak Cantonese fluently. After we lead people to salvation, we should bring them to the small group meetings where there is the atmosphere of each member exercising his function and responsibility. After participating in the small group a few times, the new one will spontaneously exercise his function and responsibility.</p>
