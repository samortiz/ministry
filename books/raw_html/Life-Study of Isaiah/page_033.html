<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. CHRIST'S WARNING COMMISSION TO ISAIAH</H2><P>In verses 8 through 13 we have Christ's warning commission to Isaiah. After Isaiah was purged, he received a commission from the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Lord's Need</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. His Calling</H2><P>Regarding the Lord's need, we first have His calling. The Lord said, "Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us?" (v. 8a). The words I and Us indicate that the One speaking here is triune, that this One is not merely Christ but Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Isaiah's Answer</H2><P>Isaiah's answer was very good. He said, "Here am I; send me" (v. 8b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Lord's Warning Commission to Isaiah</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. His Charge</H2><P>In verses 9 and 10 the Lord gave His charge to Isaiah. The Lord said to him, "Go and say to this people,/Hear indeed, but do not perceive;/And see indeed, but do not understand./Make the heart of this people numb;/Dull their ears,/And seal their eyes;/Lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears,/And their heart perceives and returns, and they are healed." This indicates that there would be no way for the people to be healed and recovered.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Isaiah's Question</H2><P>In response to the Lord's charge, Isaiah asked a question. He said, "For how long, Lord?" (v. 11a). He was asking how long this situation would remain.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Answer</H2><P>In verses 11b through 13 we have the Lord's answer to Isaiah's question. The Lord said to him, "Until cities lay devastated,/Without inhabitants,/And houses are without people,/And the land is devastated and a waste;/And Jehovah has sent men far away from it,/ And desolate places abound in the midst of the land./But there will still be a tenth part in it; / And it in turn is to be burned/Like a terebinth or an oak, /Whose stump remains after its felling; /Its stump will be a holy seed." Except for the word concerning the holy seed, this prophecy has been fulfilled.</P>
