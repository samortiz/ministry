	 <h2 class="head4">Conferences</h2>
<p>We have had one conference per year except in 1955 and this year, in which we have had two conferences. This makes a total of nine conferences. These conferences include the time when Brother Sparks came to visit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Long-term Bible Study</h2>
<p>The first study we made of the Bible was to examine sixty topics related to the fundamental truths in the Bible; that is, we studied sixty crucial topics from the Bible one by one.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Publication Work</h2>
<p>We have the publication work of the Gospel Book Room, which publishes spiritual books and hymnals as well as a monthly publication called <em>The Ministry of the Word.</em></p>
<h2 class="head4">Trainings</h2>
<p>Since the work is still in the early stages, all of our trainings have been short-term, but they have helped the churches.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our work, through which we help the saints in all the local churches, is in four main areas. Thank the Lord that during these seven years we have seen the Lord&rsquo;s blessing on these four matters. The edification from the messages in every conference is a blessing. During the conferences, the leading brothers from all the localities come together and fellowship with each other so that the grace from one locality can quickly flow to the entire country; this is an even greater blessing. It is also a blessing that during the conferences we can examine our problems and make some corrections. Despite the fact that our trainings are short-term, they have been helpful to those bearing responsibility for the service in the localities. The publication work has also been greatly blessed by the Lord so that we have put out many spiritual books in addition to the publication of <em>The Ministry of the Word.</em> These books supply the saints with truths concerning baptism, the Lord&rsquo;s table, leaving the denominations, and other topics; the saints have received much revelation from God through the publication work. These four matters&mdash;conferences, long-term Bible study, the publication work, and trainings&mdash;are related to our move and work; in addition, there have been spiritual recoveries. I hope that the Lord will continue to bless us and grace us in the fellowship.</p>
