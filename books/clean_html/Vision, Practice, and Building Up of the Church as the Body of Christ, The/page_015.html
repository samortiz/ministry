<h2 class="head2">The Life Aspect Being<br />
the Mingling of God and Man</h2>
<p>By all of the above we can see clearly that in order to realize the church life, we first must know the real experience of Christ within us as our life. We need to experience Christ to such an extent that He is truly our life. This is a matter of the mingling of God and man. Some have criticized our use of the word <em>mingling,</em> asking, &ldquo;How can God mingle with us?&rdquo; These dear persons are too preoccupied by traditional theology. Whenever I hear others criticizing our messages, I am not subjective. I try to be objective to see their point of view and further consider what we are teaching. Many times I take the attitude that we could be wrong, and I check this teaching again. Even this morning I checked again whether or not something might be wrong with it. However, the Lord told me, &ldquo;Look at John 6:57: &lsquo;As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&rsquo;&rdquo; Can we eat something without it being mingled with us? If we eat a chicken, the chicken and we are joined together. Whatever we eat is digested and mingled with us. The Lord Jesus is the bread of life, and He said, &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem has four sides, and on each side there are three gates (Rev. 21:13). This is not three plus four but three multiplied by four. The number three signifies the Triune God, and the number four signifies man as the leading one of all the creatures (Matt. 28:19; Ezek. 1:5, 10). These figures signify that the Triune God mingles with man. The first time I gave a message about this picture was in 1941 in my hometown. Now, because I have been criticized for this teaching, I went back to check with the writings of Brother Watchman Nee. In <em>The Glorious Church</em> Brother Nee speaks about four women: Eve in Genesis 2, the wife (the church) in Ephesians 5, the universal woman in the vision of Revelation 12, and the New Jerusalem, the wife of the Lamb in Revelation 21 (<em>The Collected Works of Watchman Nee,</em> Vol. 34, pp. 99 ff.). Brother Nee pointed out that these four women are actually one woman, signifying God&rsquo;s redeemed people composed together. Concerning the last woman, Brother Nee said, &ldquo;In the New Jerusalem, the union of God and man is no longer seven, but twelve. It is no longer three plus four, but three multiplied by four. Multiplication is a perfect union, something which can never be separated. When the Creator mingles with the creature, it is twelve, and twelve is the number of perfect union&rdquo; (p. 132). When Brother Nee spoke this message in Chinese, he used the word <em>mingle.</em></p>
<p>In order to have the church life, we must realize Christ as life to us, not merely in a general way but in the way of food to be digested by us. We must eat Christ and digest Him. &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&rdquo; This is the word of the Lord in John 6:57, which we must never forget. We need to experience the Lord as life in the way of food to be digested by us, thus becoming our very constituent. Then spontaneously we are in a proper order under His headship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Life and Building Being Found<br />
throughout the Entire Scripture</h2>
<p>The thought of life and building runs throughout the entire Scripture. In Genesis 2 there is the tree of life, and there is also the building implied by the precious materials of gold, bdellium, and onyx stone (vv. 9, 11-12). At the end of the Bible, in Revelation 21 and 22, there is again the tree of life and the building with precious materials (22:2; 21:18-21). In the seven parables in Matthew 13 there is also the thought of life and building. In these parables, the seed sown is the seed of life which grows to be wheat (vv. 3-8, 24). Even the mustard seed and the three measures of meal are related to life (vv. 31, 33). On the other hand, the treasure hidden in the earth and the pearl of great value are the precious materials for the building (vv. 44-46). Similarly, 1 Corinthians 3 tells us that, on the one hand, we are God&rsquo;s cultivated land, and on the other hand, we are the house of God (vv. 9-12, 16). As the cultivated land we need life to grow, and as the house we need to be built up. Throughout the entire Scripture we have these two matters&mdash;life and building.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Bridal Aspect and<br />
the Building Aspect of the Church</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament there are a number of types of the church. However, all the types are in two categories. The first category is the women. A number of women are types of the church. Eve is the first type of the church (Gen. 2:22; 3:20). Rebekah also is a type of the church (24:15, 64-67). Most of the positive women in the Old Testament are types of the church. The women are a matter of life. Eve came from Adam. She received her life from Adam, and Adam was life to her. This typifies that the church receives life from Christ, and Christ is life to the church. The second category of the types of the church is the house of God, the tabernacle, the temple, and even the city. All these are a matter of building.</p>
<p>The book of Ephesians contains both of these aspects. On the one hand, Ephesians tells us that we are the house, the dwelling place of God (2:20-22). On the other hand, it tells us that we are the wife, the counterpart of Christ (5:25, 32). As the counterpart we need to grow, and as the house we need to be built up. A single verse, Colossians 2:7, mentions both aspects. This verse says, &ldquo;Having been rooted and being built up in Him.&rdquo; To be rooted is a matter of life, and to be built up is a matter of building. Here again is life and building.</p>
