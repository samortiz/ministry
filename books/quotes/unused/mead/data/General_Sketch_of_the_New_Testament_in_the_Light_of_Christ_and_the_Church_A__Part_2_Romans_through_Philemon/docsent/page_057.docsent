   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Attaining to the Out-resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter three of Philippians, the word resurrection is used twice.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first time it refers to the resurrection power by which we are conformed to the death of Christ v. 10 . Then verse 11 says, "If perhaps I may attain to the out-resurrection from the dead." Many translations of this verse are not adequate; the translators neglected the first part of the Greek word for resurrection because they did not have the proper light.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word resurrection is composed with a prefix and should be translated extra-resurrection or out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The out-resurrection is something special.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many verses in the New Testament tell us that at the coming of the Lord Jesus, all the saved persons who have died in the Lord will be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, there is a difference in the way they will participate in that resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Of all those who share in that resurrection, some will enjoy a special resurrection, an outstanding resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This may be compared to a graduating class.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although all the students graduate, only the top ones share an outstanding graduation, an "extra-graduation."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul was pursuing this special resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The out-resurrection is nothing less than a special portion of Christ experienced by us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A special portion of Christ will be awarded to certain ones.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is similar to the hidden manna, which is different from the open manna Rev 2:17; Exo 16:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Both the open manna and the hidden manna are a type of Christ, but the hidden manna is a special portion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is the resurrection in a general way John 11:25 , but Christ as the out-resurrection is a special portion of Christ as a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Counting All Things as Loss in Order to Gain Christ</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All young believers should learn to recite Philippians 3:7 and 8.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul says, "But what things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What things in verse 7 refers to the religious things, the things in Judaism as mentioned in the previous verses.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul dropped all those religious things for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 8, however, Paul dropped not only the religious things but all things on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the above verses show us that Christ is not only our life and pattern but also our goal and our aim.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We drop all other things and pursue nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our goal is to gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>CHRIST AS OUR SECRET AND POWER Being Initiated with the Basic Principles to Solve Every Problem</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Chapter four reveals to us that Christ is our secret and our power, our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verses 12 and 13 say, "I know also how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to lack.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Greek the phrase I have learned the secret means "I have been initiated."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This may be illustrated by mathematics.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we teach a young student addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, we initiate him by giving him the basic principles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way he learns the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whenever he comes across a problem in mathematics, he knows the secret of how to solve it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is not only our power but our secret.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We live by this power, and we live by this secret.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then whatever matter comes to us, we can solve it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because we know the secret, we do not care whether we are rich or poor or whether we are abased or we abound.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The unbelievers in the world are foolish because they do not know the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are like people who have never learned the principles of mathematics; no matter what problem they come across, they cannot solve it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are not this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have been initiated in Christ, with Christ, and by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because Christ is our secret, we know how to face any kind of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whether people honor us or despise us, we know the secret and we have the power.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is our secret, and Christ is also our power.</S>
