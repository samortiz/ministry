   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENCOURAGED BY THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By the Lord s sovereignty Paul was rescued from the hand of the rioting Jews into the hand of the Roman commander 21:27-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After Paul defended himself before the Jews 21:40 22:21 , was bound by the Romans 22:22-29 , and defended himself before the Sanhedrin 22:30 23:10 , he was encouraged by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning this, 23:11 says, But the following night the Lord stood by him and said, Take courage, for as you have solemnly testified concerning Me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This was a word of strong assurance to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Surely Paul was afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If he had not been afraid, there would have been no need for the Lord to tell him to take courage.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul certainly had been in a very frightening situation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But sovereignly the Lord rescued him from that situation, and then He came to assure him that he would testify of Him in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this way Paul s desire to see Rome would be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>PAUL S VISION OF GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let us consider again the picture of the situation in which Paul found himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church was weak, compromising, and lacking in light.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With the church in Jerusalem there was not a genuine testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The religious people in Judaism were blind, devilish, and full of hatred, and the Roman politicians were corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Against such a background we see Paul, a man burdened for and saturated with God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As Paul considered the situation involving the church, Judaism, and the Roman government, he knew that what was needed most was God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is God s New Testament economy?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God s New Testament economy is to propagate the processed Triune God in the Person of the all-inclusive, resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only the propagation of this resurrected Christ is the answer to the pitiful situation on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is needed is for us to allow God to carry out His New Testament economy in propagating the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul must have considered this very much during the two years custody in Caesarea.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, when he was brought to Rome, he began to write the last eight of his Epistles: Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians, Philemon, 1 Timothy, Titus, Hebrews, and 2 Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These Epistles give us a clear view of the carrying out of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not long after Paul presented a clear view of God s New Testament economy by completing his writings of the divine revelation, he was martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Approximately a quarter of a century later, the book of Revelation was written.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the seven epistles of Revelation 2 and 3 we can see that the churches, which had been established mainly by Paul for the accomplishment of God s New Testament economy by propagating the resurrected Christ, had become degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The degradation consisted of the loss of the all-inclusive Christ and the taking in of other things as replacements of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With the exception of the epistle to the church in Philadelphia, we see that in these seven churches various things had crept in to replace Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Almost nineteen centuries have passed since the book of Revelation was written.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Throughout these centuries a struggle has been taking place between Satan and God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Satan has been trying in different ways to replace Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a result, many of us, including me, were born into an organized Christianity that had very little of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, how much of Christ is there in the celebration of Christmas?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In today s Christianity there is a mixture of truth and falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Very few believers know the truth in a deep and thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After I was saved, I immediately began to love the Bible and study it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Gradually the light has come through the Word concerning God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through the Lord s enlightenment we can see that Paul was burdened for the full revelation of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The accomplishment of the divine economy involved Christ s incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension so that He might propagate Himself by imparting Himself into God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this way God s people may become His sons and the members of Christ to be a corporate Body to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This expression is in local churches in this age and will be in the New Jerusalem in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the vision Paul saw, and this is what we need to see today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul s vision concerning God s New Testament economy is fully revealed and developed in his last eight Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, with the help of the Life-study Messages, we need to study these Epistles, especially Ephesians and Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Studying Paul s Epistles will enrich our experience of the propagating Christ in God s New Testament economy.</S>
