   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Rebuke</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are mainly three kinds of people with problems.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first are those with minor problems.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can point out their problems while we are alone with them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We can deal with these problems one on one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second kind are those with serious problems.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These problems have taken root in them and have become part of their constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to speak a strong word to them before they can turn.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we feel that one person is not enough, we should invite two or three experienced brothers to go with us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should speak a strong word to their face in the presence of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The third kind are those whose problems are so serious that it is hard to correct them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must then bring two or three brothers with us when we talk to such ones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When there is enough indignation within us and we are disgusted with the matter, we should rebuke them severely.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The indictment and the rebuke should have been brewing within us for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we meet with them, we should not only exhort them but rebuke them severely.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are representing God; we are not only speaking to them but rebuking them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we want to rebuke, we must have a proper indignation within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the listeners are willing to take our word, they will be saved, and their problems will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How can a man overcome his weakness?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How can he overcome his problems?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Intense light burns away problems and weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When God's light shines into us, we have no place to hide.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everything that is not of God dries up and wilts away.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The stronger the light, the faster the wilting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whether or not a brother can overcome his problem depends on the light he receives from us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everything that is not planted by God will be uprooted.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A hidden leprosy is not easily healed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But when it is exposed and proven to be leprosy, it can be more easily healed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we want to dispense great light to others, we ourselves must be delivered from personal feelings and interests; we should only be for the good of the other person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we have personal feelings of our own, we will not be able to deal with others' problems.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we have personal interests of our own, we will not be able to help others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we speak to others in a frank way and expose their weaknesses under God's light, they will crumple.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They will not be able to rise again, and their problems will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some may ask, "Why do we have to bring two or three people with us?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes the words of one person do not afford enough light and exposure.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Bringing two or three persons intensifies the light, precipitates the other's mistakes, and increases the exposure and shame of the matter in view.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this way he will break down immediately, and his problems will be taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The light of two or three people is stronger than the light of one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The only question left is whether or not the recipient will acknowledge the light.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why is there the need for rebuke?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Bible contains many words of rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why are we afraid of rebuking others in the church today?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is because we are wrong in the way we live; we are not qualified to rebuke others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As soon as we rebuke others, we are condemned in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who are full of personal feelings cannot rebuke others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order to rebuke others, we must be free from personal feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The rebukes found in the Bible are all free of personal interests.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They are all done for God, for the church, and for the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For the good of the brothers and sisters, we have to speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to rebuke someone concerning a matter, we have to hate that matter deeply enough and oppose it strongly enough.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There must be enough indignation within us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Unless we are such persons before the Lord, we cannot rebuke others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If our word is from God, light will come to the brother as we speak such a word soberly to his face, and he will be paralyzed by this light.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After two or three days, he will gradually see the light.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He will be cut, and there will be a wound in him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As a result, his problem will wither away.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I have a title for the subject of these messages.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I call it judgment or discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God's judgment is executed through His wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once He judges, everything is cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>One day, when God pours out His wrath, the world will be cleansed, and Satan's work no longer will exist.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is a good thing for a follower of Christ, who has been with the Lord for thirty to fifty years, to be able to express God's wrath upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The wrath of an elderly brother often helps other brothers overcome their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But young ones should never be tempted to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Your time has not come.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You can only learn to bear the cross and accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When you lose your temper, you lose it in yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After you have lost your temper, you must turn back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Some elderly brothers do not have to confess or repent when they lose their temper; they do not have to turn back to God for what they have done.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is a great difference between our own wrath and the wrath that comes from God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The wrath that comes from ourselves needs confession; without such confession we are cut off from fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The wrath that comes from God does not require a return to God; the fellowship is never cut off in such a case.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At most, an ordinary brother can exhort; he cannot rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Only an elderly brother with some inner assurance can condemn a brother's mistake in the wrath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We do not talk about these subjects frequently, because they are not ordinary practices.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Such matters must be practiced in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We need more training in the matter of judging men according to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Prayer: Lord, we have to offer special supplication for the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We pray that they would experience an inward deliverance and know themselves thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We pray that they would no longer indulge in self-love or be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We pray that they would be able to render help to many and bring many out of darkness to the path of light.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Day by day, may they live more in You and less in themselves so that they would receive more light through You and more discipline from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>May they learn to fear You, and may they learn to be delivered from themselves.</S>
