[1]  In the co-workers meeting in Hankow, we saw quite clearly that there was no need for a local church to maintain the Lord s Day message meeting, because this kind of meeting is not a church meeting.
[2]  If we need to maintain the Lord s Day message meeting, then there is the need for a worker to live in a place to do that work, since local brothers have no way of maintaining the Lord s Day message meeting.
[3]  The meetings for edification, the table meetings, the prayer meetings, and the gospel preaching meetings are all meetings of the church, but maintaining the Lord s Day message meeting is the behavior of the nations and not something of the church.
[4]  The Problem with Not Abolishing It The Outward Problem
[5]  The outward reason is that all the nations have a Lord s Day message meeting, and if we do not have one among us, we fear that without a message to listen to many brothers and sisters will go to other places to listen to messages.
[6]  If the churches in every locality cause all the one-talented members to rise up and to stand and work, it is very possible that we can return to the situation of the early church.
[7]  If the church does not endeavor until everyone in the church is working and everyone in the church is serving, then there is no church.
[8]  We could eliminate this manner of listening to messages and, instead, have the entire church serve according to God s word in the Bible.
[9]  When you can see that all the believers, once they are saved, are for the Lord, have the thought of saving others, and are working and caring for people, then you can really see the church.
[10]  If you are living, then these things will be living.
[11]  Today there are many localities where the Saturday night meetings cannot be strong because all the brothers are passive, even though many are gifted with a ministry.
[12]  If there is no pressure on them, as with the Lord s Day meetings which force them to go before God, then every Saturday night meeting will be a time to relax.
[13]  The supply of the apostles word is the supply of the ministers of the word.
[14]  The gospel preaching and the edifying of new believers in the regular meetings should be sufficient for the brothers to have the habit of serving in the gospel and edifying the new believers.
[15]  If we work in this way, I believe that the situation in every locality will be very balanced, and we do not know how many times the increase in numbers will be multiplied.
[16]  It is a great thing, a most wonderful thing, for the church to preach the gospel!
[17]  If we can have a breakthrough in the way of the Lord s recovery at this time, if the church can rise up to preach the gospel, there will be the dawning of a new day everywhere.
[18]  In Acts there are two different ways of preaching the gospel: one way is that of Antioch, sending apostles out to preach the gospel.
[19]  I believe that the local church at the center of the work also needs to have these several kinds of meetings.
[20]  Formerly, we preached the gospel once a month; now once a month we preach a message to the brothers, or if there is a strong ministry of the word, perhaps we will select one day out of the week and use it specifically for preaching a message.
[21]  The work in every place today has not been carried out well.
[22]  In order for there to be a local church, the church must preach the gospel and the church must serve.
[23]  Having already observed the difference between the work and the churches, between the apostles and the elders, between the basis of a scriptural church and sects, we can now proceed to see how a local church is organized.
[24]  According to the present-day conception, three things are regarded as essential to the existence of a church, apart from the group of Christians who constitute its members.
[25]  Another thing which is considered of vital importance to the existence of a church is a church building.
[26]  The thought of a church is so frequently associated with a church building, that the building itself is often referred to as the church.
[27]  But in God s Word it is the living believers who are called the church, not the bricks and mortar see Acts 5:11; Matt 18:17 .
[28]  We read of the church in the house of Prisca and Aquila Rom 16:5; 1 Cor 16:19 , the church in the house of Nymphas Col 4:15 , and the church in the house of Philemon Philem.
[29]  Before we consider the question of meeting, let us first say a few words concerning the nature of the Church.
[30]  That meeting has no place among the different gatherings of the church, for its nature makes it evident that it is an apostolic meeting, and being an apostolic meeting, it belongs to the sphere of the work, not of the church.
[31]  Meetings where activity is one-sided do not come within the scope of the church, for they lack the distinctive feature of all church gatherings; and where any attempt is made to fit them into the church program, much trouble is sure to result.
[32]  Where they are found in connection with a church, we must discourage them and help believers to see that church meetings are conducted by the church.
[33]  The reason the churches in China are still so weak, after a hundred years of Christian missions, is that God s servants have introduced into the local churches a type of meeting that really belongs to the work, and the church members have naturally concluded that if they attend such services and just passively receive all that is taught them there, they have performed the chief part of their Christian duty.
[34]  When God blesses our efforts in any place to the salvation of souls, we must see to it that the saved ones understand, from the outset, that the meetings which resulted in their salvation belong to the work and not to the church, and that they are the church and must therefore have their own church meetings.
[35]  In the earlier chapters of this book we have already seen what the ministry, the work, and the local churches are.
[36]  In this chapter we have seen the connection between the ministry and the local church, and also the difference between the church and the work.
[37]  In Acts 13 we saw that God had established one of His churches in a certain locality; then He gave gifts to a few individuals in that church to equip them to minister there as prophets and teachers, so that the church might be built up.
[38]  Apostles hold the highest office in the work, but in the local church they as apostles hold no office at all; elders, on the other hand, hold the chief office in the local church, but as elders they have no place in the work.
[39]  The church cannot go on without receiving the help of the ministry and without giving help to the work; the work cannot exist without the sympathy of the ministry and the backing of the church; and the ministry can only function when there is the church and the work.
