   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In His full salvation, God first forgives us of our sins and cleanses us of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we receive God s full salvation, the first items we enjoy are God s forgiveness of our sins and His cleansing away of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. FORGIVENESS OF SINS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1 Everyone who believes into Him receives forgiveness of sins Acts 10:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Forgiveness of sins is the first part of our redemption, and it is received by us at the moment we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our first problem before God is that there is a record of sin because of our sinful deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only when our record is cleared can the righteousness of God release us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Unless our sinful deeds before Him are eliminated, the righteous God cannot grant us the remaining items of His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, we first need to have God s forgiveness of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A. The Significance of Forgiveness of Sins</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1 Being delivered from the penalty of God s righteousness He who believes into Him is not judged John 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, forgiveness of sins means the elimination of our record of sin before God that we may be delivered from the penalty of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because we had a record of sin before God and were condemned, we should have suffered God s righteous punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when God forgave us, He delivered us from His righteous penalty and condemned us no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>2 Causing the sins to leave the forgiven ones Give...forgiveness of sins Acts 5:31 ; The Lord hath laid on him Christ the iniquity of us all Isa 53:6 ; Himself Christ carried up our sins in His body onto the tree the cross 1 Pet 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the New Testament the Greek word for forgiveness means causing it to leave and sending away.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When God forgives us of our sins, He not only eliminates our record of sin before Him but also causes the sins which we have committed to depart from us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is because, when God made the Lord Jesus our offering for sin on the cross, He laid all our sins on Him that He might carry them for us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, when God caused the Lord Jesus to carry our sins on the cross to suffer God s judgment and punishment in our place, He also caused all our sins to be laid on Satan that he should bear them forever.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is revealed in type in the atonement recorded in Leviticus 16.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sin came from Satan and was passed on to us, resulting in our having a record of sin before God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God put all our sins on the Lord Jesus that He might carry them all to suffer God s punishment for us and cancel our record of sin before God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Having done this, God gave all our sins back to Satan that he might bear them himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this way, God is able to forgive the sins of the forgiven ones and cause their sins to leave them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us Psa 103:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>3 Forgetting the sins of the forgiven ones I God will be propitious to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins I will by no means remember anymore Heb 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When God forgives the forgiven ones of their sins, He also forgets their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When God forgives our sins, He not only cancels our record of sin and causes our sins to depart from us, but in Himself He also forgets our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once He forgives us, He erases our sins from His memory and will by no means remember them anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>B. The Basis for Forgiveness of Sins</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>1 Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness Heb 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s forgiveness of sins is based on the shedding of blood for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because He is righteous, God cannot forgive men s sins without a cause.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His righteousness requires that all who sin must die Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>18:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Unless His righteous requirement is satisfied, His righteousness cannot allow Him to forgive sinners of their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But since the Lord Jesus died and shed His blood on the cross according to the righteousness of God, thus satisfying God s righteous requirement, God can legally forgive men of their sins according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus said, This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins Matt 26:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since the blood of the Lord Jesus was shed for men according to God s righteousness, thus fulfilling God s righteous requirement, it has become the basis upon which the sins of those who believe in Him may be forgiven.</S>
