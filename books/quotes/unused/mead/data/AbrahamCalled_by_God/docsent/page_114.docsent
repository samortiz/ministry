   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>26 HAVING NO MATURITY IN LIFE Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bare him no children: and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis 16:1-2, 15 And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Genesis 21:1-3 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Genesis 25:1-2</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible is a complete revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The content of this revelation is God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we have pointed out many times, God's eternal purpose is to work Himself into a corporate man so that He may have a corporate expression in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we would understand any portion of the Bible in a proper way, we must keep this matter in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this message we come to Genesis 25.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many years ago, I did not like the first part of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But since there are no wasted words in the Bible, this portion of Genesis 25 must be very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we do not keep before us the purpose of the revelation in the holy Word, we shall be unable to see the significance of this part of Genesis 25.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By His mercy, the Lord has shown us the depth of this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In both Genesis and Romans we are told clearly that Abraham was very old when he begat Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Romans 4:19 says that Abraham considered his body as good as dead.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet, forty years after Isaac's birth, Abraham married again 25:1 , and when he became one hundred forty years of age, he still begat six sons 25:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How can we explain this?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If he was as old as a dead person when he was a hundred years of age, he certainly must have been more like a dead person when he remarried at the age of one hundred forty.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In chapter twenty-three Sarah died and was buried, in chapter twenty-four Abraham obtained a wife for Isaac, and in chapter twenty-five he himself married again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Genesis 25 also includes a record of the birth of Jacob and Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why is such a wonderful record included in the same chapter which names the six sons of Abraham's concubine?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The record of Abraham's six sons is negative, whereas the record of the birth of Jacob and Esau is positive.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you were composing this chapter, would you put these two records together?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>None of us would have written this chapter in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, according to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, it must be very significant.</S>
