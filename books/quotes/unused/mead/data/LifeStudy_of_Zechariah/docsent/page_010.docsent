   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These four horns are the four kingdoms with their kings Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and the Roman Empire signified by the great human image in Daniel 2 and by the four beasts in Daniel 7:3-8, which damaged and destroyed the chosen people of God.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These four craftsmen are the skills, including the stone not hewn by man's hands, used by God to destroy the four kingdoms, with their kings, that destroyed the nation of Israel.</S>
