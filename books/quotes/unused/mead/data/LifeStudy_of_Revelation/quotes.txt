[1]  By the Lord s mercy, in this life-study we come to the last book of the Bible, the book of Revelation.
[2]  Due to the subtle enemy of God, the book of Revelation has been closed, and few Christians understand it.
[3]  Hardly anyone has seen something of life, of God s economy, and of the testimony of Jesus in this book.
[4]  If the book of Revelation were deleted from the Bible, there would be a great shortage, for there would be a beginning but no ending.
[5]  After having a good start and after passing through so many works, there is the need for God to have a consummation.
[6]  The believers redeemed by the blood of Christ have not only been born of God into His kingdom John 3:5 , but have also been made a kingdom for God s economy, which is the church Matt 16:18-19 .
[7]  As we pointed out in the life-study of John, the writings of the apostle John are of three categories: his Gospel, his Epistles, and his Revelation.
[8]  In John 10:10 Jesus said, I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly, and in John 12:24 He said, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.
[9]  Revelation is firstly a book of Christ, secondly a book of the church, and thirdly a book of God s economy.
[10]  Several aspects of Christ, such as the vision of Him as the High Priest in the midst of the churches, caring for them in love yet with a judging attitude 1:13-16 , the vision of Him as the Lion-Lamb in the midst of God s throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the twenty-four elders of the universe, opening the seven seals of God s universal administration 5:1 6:1 , and the vision of Him as Another Mighty Angel coming down from heaven to take possession of the earth 10:1-8; 18:1 have never been unveiled as they are in the book of Revelation.
[11]  In the book of Revelation we see God s universal and eternal administration which is for the carrying out of His economy.
[12]  As a result of the judgments in the first four trumpets, the earth will no longer be a suitable place for people to live in. The fifth trumpet, the first woe as judgment on men, will be the beginning of the great tribulation 8:13 9:11 . As we shall see, the great tribulation will be terrible.
[13]  It consists of the eternal kingdom of Christ, the third woe comprising the seven bowls, the judgment of the dead, the rewarding of the saints and of the God-fearing people, and the destruction of the earth s destroyers 11:14-18 .
[14]  Our Savior is the Lamb as well as the Lion.
[15]  Apart from Him, no one in the universe is worthy to open the secret, the mystery, of God s economy.
[16]  When we said, Lord Jesus, You are worthy, not many of us realized that He was worthy to open the seals of the secret of God s economy.
[17]  Nevertheless, we must realize that, according to Revelation 5, Christ s worthiness is a matter of His being worthy to open the secret of God s economy.
[18]  CHRIST IN HIS COMING BACK A. Secret as a Thief
[19]  This book reveals that Christ s coming back has two aspects a secret aspect and a public aspect.
[20]  Lastly, as God s Administrator, Christ will judge the dead 20:11-15 .
[21]  Do not think that if you die everything will be all right.
[22]  You may desire to die, but the Lord wants to make you alive.
[23]  If you are not willing for Him to enliven you today for salvation, at the end of the old creation He will resurrect you for judgment.
[24]  The book of Revelation firstly reveals Christ, and secondly the testimony of Jesus.
[25]  In other words, this book is concerned with Christ and the church.
[26]  In Revelation, Christ and the church are revealed in a unique and particular way.
[27]  In other books we are told that the church is the gathering of God s chosen ones, that it is the Body of Christ, and that it is the house of God.
[28]  In 7:9-17 we see the testimony of Jesus as the great multitude.
[29]  According to the record of chapter seven, this great multitude is the whole Body of God s redeemed ones, having been redeemed out of every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues 7:9 .
[30]  This portion of the Word reveals that while Christ is executing God s judgment upon mankind, He will take care of God s redeemed ones.
[31]  Now we come to the firstfruits and the harvest 14:1-5, 14-16 .
[32]  The church is not only the lampstand shining and the man-child fighting, but also a field growing a crop which must ripen and become mature.
[33]  Revelation 1:4 and 5 say, Grace to you and peace from Him who is, and who was, and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth.
[34]  Jesus Christ, who is to God the faithful Witness, to the church the Firstborn of the dead, and to the world the Ruler of the kings of the earth, is God the Son.
[35]  The seven Spirits of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb 5:6; Zech 3:9; 4:10 .
[36]  After studying the book of Revelation again and again, I have discovered that it contains twenty-six items of what the Son is.
[37]  Since there are twenty-six letters in the alphabet, we may say that Christ is every letter from A to Z. He is useful for composing any word.
[38]  G., H., and I. The First and the Last,
[39]  In 3:14 we are told that the Son is the origination of the creation of God.
[40]  Christ is the origination of God s action to create the universe.
[41]  Most Christians hold the concept that the book of Revelation is a book of Christ s second coming.
[42]  It is absolutely correct to hold this concept because Revelation does cover the second coming of Christ.
[43]  However, throughout the years, Christians have not been clear about the Lord s second coming.
[44]  The time of the Lord s secret coming is unknown 3:3; Matt 24:36, 42; 25:13 .
[45]  When Christ comes again, He will come as a Sent One.
[46]  Because of this, in Revelation He is called the Angel, One who is sent by God.
[47]  In His second coming, as in His first, Christ will come as One who has been sent by God.
[48]  Christ s secret coming will be a reward to the watching believers 2:28; Matt 24:42, 44 .
[49]  Revelation 2:28 says that Christ will appear as the morning star, and Malachi 4:2 reveals that He will appear as the sun.
[50]  C. The Place on the Cloud to the Earth
[51]  The place of the open aspect of the Lord s coming back is clearly revealed on the cloud to the earth 1:7; 14:14; Matt 24:30; Zech 14:4; Acts 1:11-12 .
[52]  According to Acts 1:11 and 12, the Lord shall come in the same way as He went up into heaven.
[53]  In this message we need to consider 1:9, which says, I John, your brother and joint partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
[54]  It is quite significant that this verse comes shortly after the mention of the Lord s coming in 1:7.
[55]  This indicates that if we would be those who are watchfully waiting for the Lord s coming back, we must be those who are joint partakers, not in outward blessing, but in the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance in Jesus.
[56]  When we talk about salvation, grace, enjoyment, and all the other good things, we say that we are in Christ, for this phrase refers to everything on the positive side of God s salvation.
[57]  Because we do not cooperate with religion, it persecutes us.
[58]  When Saul of Tarsus was traveling to Damascus with the intention of arresting all those who called on the name of Jesus, the Lord Jesus knocked him down to the earth, saying, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? v. 4 . When Saul said, Who are You, Lord? Jesus answered, I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting v. 5 . Saul never thought that he was persecuting Jesus.
[59]  The believers of Jesus have been born into the kingdom.
[60]  In this verse, Jesus said to Nicodemus, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
[61]  Apparently, the various points included in chapter one are unrelated to each other.
[62]  But if we approach them from the viewpoint of our experience, we shall see that they follow one another in a very good sequence.
[63]  In the last two messages, we covered the matters of the coming again of the Lord Jesus and of our waiting for Him by being joint partakers in His tribulation, kingdom, and endurance.
[64]  Let us now consider the progress of the divine revelation in the Scriptures in more detail.
[65]  In Genesis 1:26 God is revealed as Elohim, a Hebrew word meaning the mighty One.
[66]  The English word God is the translation of the Hebrew word Elohim.
[67]  There are many aspects of the revelation of the Spirit: the Spirit of truth or reality John 14:16-17 , the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , the Spirit of power Luke 24:49 , the Spirit of God Rom 8:9 , the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , the Spirit of Jesus Acts 16:7 , the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 , the Holy Spirit Acts 5:32 , and the seven Spirits Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 .
[68]  It is difficult to know the church because Satan, the subtle enemy, is not willing for Christians to see what the real church is.
[69]  God is embodied and expressed in Christ John 1:1, 14; 1 Tim 3:16; Col 2:9 , and Christ is realized and experienced as the Spirit John 14:16-17; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; Rom 8:10; Phil 1:19 .
[70]  The Spirit is the very constituent of the church which is the Body of Christ, His fullness Eph 1:22-23; 1 Cor 12:12 .
[71]  Now the Body of Christ is expressed in all the local churches, for the local churches are the expressions of the universal church 1:11-12 .
[72]  The local churches are the expression of the Body, the Body is the realization of Christ as the life-giving Spirit, and Christ is the embodiment of God.
[73]  Thus, in the local churches we have God, Christ, the Spirit, and the church.
[74]  Here in the churches we have God with His purpose, we have Christ with His riches, we have the intensified life-giving Spirit, and we have the proper church life.
[75]  To see God s revelation and to realize His manifestation, we need to be separated unto God.
[76]  He was also brought to the open door of heaven 4:1 and to a great and high mountain 21:10 , and thus saw God s revelation and realized God s manifestation.
[77]  Today, many Christians who are talking about the church do not see the local churches, mainly because they are not separated unto God.
[78]  The book of Revelation not only stresses the Spirit of God as the sevenfold intensified Spirit for God s intensified move, but also our human spirit as the organ for us to realize and respond to God s move.
[79]  Since nearly everything in the book of Revelation is based upon the Old Testament, most of the items mentioned in this book are not new.
[80]  Most of what this book reveals can be traced back to the Old Testament.
[81]  For example, the city of Jerusalem, a city with twelve gates, is found in Ezekiel 48, but at the end of Revelation we see the city of Jerusalem in a new way.
[82]  The lampstand in Exodus 25 was for the building of the tabernacle, the lampstand in Zechariah 4 was for the recovery of God s building, and the lampstands in Revelation 1 are for the building of the church.
[83]  The lampstand in Exodus 25 typifies Christ as the expression of God shining with the seven lamps, the seven Spirits of God.
[84]  OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES A. Symbolizing the Local Churches
[85]  Every local church is a lampstand shining forth the testimony of Jesus with the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God as the lamps in its locality.
[86]  LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE NINE THE SON OF MAN IN THE MIDST
[87]  In chapter one of Revelation there are eight crucial points: the revelation of Christ, the testimony of Jesus, the Triune God, the second coming of Christ, the joint partakers in the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance in Jesus, the local churches, the lampstands, and the Son of Man.
[88]  Having covered the first seven points, we come in this message to the eighth the Son of Man in the midst of the churches 1:12-20 .
[89]  The Head of the church is not only the Son of God but also the Son of Man.
[90]  That the Lord is still the Son of Man after His ascension indicates that He has not put off His human nature after resurrection and that His dealings with us are based upon His humanity.
[91]  Verse 13 says that Christ is clothed with a garment reaching to the feet.
[92]  This garment is the priestly robe Exo 28:33-35 signifying the fullness of Christ s divine virtues and human attributes cf.
[93]  Verse 15 says, His feet were like shining brass, as having been fired in a furnace.
[94]  In verse 16 we are told that out of His mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword.
[95]  In Song of Songs 5:16, His mouth is most sweet, and in the Gospels, words of grace proceeded out of His mouth Luke 4:22 ; but here out of His mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword.
[96]  Revelation 2:1 says, To the messenger of the church in Ephesus write: These things says He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands.
[97]  Each of these seven epistles begins with a description of the speaker.
[98]  Before the Lord says anything to the churches, He declares who He is.
[99]  In the first epistle, the Lord declares that He is the One who holds the seven stars in His right hand and who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands.
[100]  The messengers of the churches, the spiritual ones, signified by the shining stars, who bear the responsibility of the testimony of Jesus, are held in the right hand of the Lord, and the Lord is walking in the midst of the churches, signified by the seven golden lampstands.
[101]  While the Lord is sitting at the right hand of God as our High Priest interceding for us, the churches Heb 7:25 , He is holding the messengers of the churches and is walking in the midst of the churches to care for them.
[102]  Although the church in Ephesus had so many virtues, it was degraded because it had left its first love.
[103]  The first epistle to the Ephesians tells us that for the church life we need to be strengthened in our inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts, that we, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge, that we may be filled with all the fullness of God Eph 3:16-19 ; and that it is for the church life that grace is with all them who love the Lord Jesus Eph 6:24 .
[104]  The first part of 2:7 says, He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
[105]  At the beginning of each of the seven epistles in chapters two and three, it is the Lord who speaks 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14 .
[106]  This not only indicates that the Spirit is the Lord and the Lord is the Spirit; it also emphasizes the vital importance of the Spirit in the darkness of the church s degradation as indicated by the sevenfold intensified Spirit in 1:4.
[107]  Now we come to the promise to the overcomer: To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God v. 7 . To overcome in these seven epistles means to overcome the degraded situation of the churches.
[108]  In this epistle, it means to recover our first love toward the Lord and to hate the works of the Nicolaitans, the hierarchy which the Lord hates.
[109]  For the proper church life and the recovery of the church life, that is, for the proper growth in the Christian life, what we need is not merely the mental apprehension of teachings, but the eating in our spirit of the Lord as the bread of life John 6:57 .
[110]  Here it refers to the crucified implied in the tree as a piece of wood 1 Pet 2:24 and resurrected implied in the zoe life John 11:25 Christ who is in the church today, the consummation of which will be the New Jerusalem, in which the crucified and resurrected Christ will be the tree of life for the enjoyment of all God s redeemed people for eternity 22:2, 14 .
[111]  Because of religion s distraction and the church s degradation, the Lord in His wisdom makes the enjoyment of Himself in the coming kingdom a reward to encourage His believers to overcome religion s distracting knowledge of teachings and return to the enjoyment of Himself as the life supply in the church today for the accomplishment of God s economy.
[112]  As we have seen, the promise to the overcomers in the church in Ephesus was to eat of the tree of life.
[113]  If we know the Bible, we shall realize that the paradise of God in 2:7 is not the garden of Eden but the coming New Jerusalem.
[114]  But, as we have pointed out, the paradise of God in this verse is the New Jerusalem 3:12; 21:2, 10; 22:1-2, 14, 19 of which the church is a foretaste today, Adam was in the garden of Eden, and Abraham and all the dead saints are in paradise.
[115]  Strictly speaking, to eat of the tree of life...in the paradise of God in this verse refers to the particular enjoyment of Christ as our life supply in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom, because this is a promise of reward made by the Lord to His overcomers.
[116]  The enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will be the common portion of all God s redeemed people, whereas the particular enjoyment of Him as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom is a reward only to the overcoming believers.
[117]  The Lord was sovereign in selecting the churches to fulfill His purpose.
[118]  In verse 9 the Lord said to the church in Smyrna, I know your tribulation.
[119]  The Lord s purpose in allowing the church to suffer tribulation is not only to testify that His resurrection life overcomes death, but also to enable the church to enter into the riches of His life.
[120]  In verse 10 the Lord says, Do not fear what you are about to suffer.
[121]  Behold, the Devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried.
[122]  He is not only the enemy of God from without, but also His adversary from within.
[123]  V. THE PROMISE TO THE OVERCOMER A. The Crown of Life
[124]  In verse 10 we see the promise to the overcomer the crown of life.
[125]  As a sign, the church in Pergamos prefigures the church which entered into a marriage union with the world and became a high fortified tower, equivalent to the great tree prophesied by the Lord in the parable of the mustard seed Matt 13:31-32 .
[126]  The church in Pergamos also dwells where Satan s throne is.
[127]  The world is not only Satan s dwelling place, but also the sphere wherein he rules.
[128]  In verse 13 the Lord says, You hold fast My name, and you have not denied My faith, even in the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.
[129]  In verse 14 the Lord says, But I have a few things against you, because you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumblingblock before the sons of Israel, to eat idol sacrifices and to commit fornication.
[130]  In these epistles, the Lord desires, according to God s economy, that we should eat Him as the tree of life 2:7 , the hidden manna 2:17 , and the rich produce of the good land 3:20 .
[131]  But the worldly church turned from life to mere teachings, thus distracting the believers from the enjoyment of Christ as their life supply for fulfillment of God s purpose.
[132]  In verse 16 the Lord says, Repent therefore; but if not, I come to you quickly, and I will war with them with the sword of My mouth.
[133]  Here the Lord says that He will come quickly and war with the sword of His mouth against some in this worldly church.
[134]  This should not refer to the Lord s coming back, but to His coming to war with the Nicolaitan teachers in the degraded church with the slaying word out of His mouth.
[135]  The Lord also promised the overcomer, saying, I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it.
[136]  LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE CHURCH IN THYATIRA
[137]  The church in Pergamos had the teachings of Balaam and of the Nicolaitans, and these are continued in this apostate church.
[138]  Furthermore, the Catholic Church herself teaches, causing her people to listen to her rather than to the holy Word of God.
[139]  Her adherents are all drugged by her heretical, religious teaching, not caring for Christ as their life and life supply, as indicated by the tree of life and hidden manna promised by the Lord to the churches in Ephesus and Pergamos 2:7, 17 .
[140]  She helps God s people to worship Him, but she does not do so in God s way; she does it in her own pagan, heathen way.
[141]  In verse 21 the Lord Jesus said, I gave her time that she might repent, and she is not willing to repent of her fornication.
[142]  History proves that this is true of the apostate Catholic Church.
[143]  In verse 26 the Lord says, And he who overcomes, and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations.
[144]  The overcomers, the rest in Thyatira, do not have Jezebel s teaching v. 24 , have not known the deep things of Satan, hold fast the Lord s testimony until He comes v. 25 , and keep the Lord s works until the end v. 26 . My works in verse 26 refers to the things the Lord has accomplished and is doing, such as His crucifixion, resurrection, intercession, etc., in contrast to the works of the apostate church under the influence of Satan.
[145]  LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE FOURTEEN THE CHURCH IN SARDIS
[146]  It is truly sovereign of the Lord that the situation and condition of the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 match the stages of church history.
[147]  The history of the church from the first century to the present is clearly divided into seven stages: the initial stage, the suffering stage, the worldly stage, the apostate stage, the stage of Reformation, the stage of the recovered church, and the stage of the degradation of the recovered church.
[148]  The things which remain are the things lost and restored by the Reformation, such as justification by faith and the open Bible.
[149]  V. THE OVERCOMERS A FEW NAMES IN SARDIS A. Not Having Defiled
[150]  Firstly, the Lord promises the overcomer that he will be clothed in white garments.
[151]  As a sign, the church in Philadelphia prefigures the proper church life recovered by the brothers who were raised up by the Lord in England in the early part of the nineteenth century.
[152]  To the church of brotherly love, the Lord is the holy One, the true One by whom and with whom the recovered church can be holy, separated from the world, and true, faithful, to God.
[153]  Verse 7 also says that Christ is the One who opens and no one shall shut, and shuts and no one shall open.
[154]  Because the universal key, the key of God s economy, is in His hand, He opens and shuts.
[155]  As we have pointed out, nearly everything found in the book of Revelation is not new but a fulfillment of things revealed in the Old Testament.
[156]  If you consider the context of Isaiah 22 and if you read the context of the word regarding Christ as the One holding the key of David in Revelation 3, you will realize that Christ s holding the key of David is for God s house, for God s building.
[157]  THE CHURCH S CONDITION A. Having a Little Power
[158]  In 3:8 we see the condition of the church in Philadelphia.
[159]  In verse 8 the Lord said, Behold, I have put before you an open door which no one can shut.
[160]  As the One who has the key of David and who opens and no one can shut, the Lord has given the recovered church an open door which no one can shut.
[161]  Since the recovery of the proper church life began, in the early part of the nineteenth century, until now, a door has always been wide open to the Lord s recovery.
[162]  In verse 11 we see the Lord s charge: I come quickly; hold fast what you have that no one take your crown.
[163]  However, if she does not hold fast what she has in the Lord s recovery until the Lord comes back, her crown may be taken away by someone.
[164]  This promise of the Lord, like His promise in Luke 21:36, indicates that the saints who have kept the word of the Lord s endurance will be raptured before the great tribulation, implying that those who have not kept the word of His endurance will be left in the great tribulation.
[165]  To overcome in the church in Philadelphia is not to get anything or to overcome other things; it is to keep what we have received in the Lord s recovery to the end. If you do this, the Lord will make you a pillar in God s temple.
[166]  Firstly, the Lord says that He will write on the overcomer the name of God.
[167]  This does not mean that we become God; it means that God has been wrought into us and that we are one with Him.
[168]  This refers to the Lord as the origin or source of God s creation, implying that the Lord is the unchanging and ever-existing source of God s work.
[169]  In verse 17 the Lord says, You say, I am rich and have become rich and have need of nothing.
[170]  The degraded recovered church assembly boasts of her riches mainly in the knowledge of doctrines .
[171]  In verse 18 we see the Lord s counsel to the church in Laodicea: I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined by fire that you may be rich, and white garments that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested, and eyesalve to anoint your eyes that you may see.
[172]  Secondly, the Lord counseled the church in Laodicea to buy white garments that they may be clothed and that the shame of their nakedness may not be manifested.
[173]  White garments here refer to conduct approvable to the Lord, which is the Lord Himself lived out of the church, and which is required by the degraded recovered church to cover her nakedness.
[174]  If she is willing to take it, the Lord s rebuke in love will be an eyeopener to the degraded church.
[175]  When we become lukewarm and feel rebuked by the Lord, we need to look to Him for His mercy that we may be willing to be humble to receive His rebuke in love.
[176]  In verse 20 the Lord also said that, after He comes in to him who opens the door, He will dine with him and he with Him.
[177]  According to the Greek, the word dine signifies the principal meal of the day at evening.
[178]  If we have an overall view of the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3, we shall see that the Lord exalts the eating of Himself, the taking in of Himself as our life supply, that we may grow, be transformed, and be the same as He is.
[179]  However, not many are familiar with the scene in heaven after Christ s ascension.
[180]  The rainbow around His throne signifies that God is the covenanting God, the faithful God, who will keep His covenant while executing His judgment upon the earth in that He will not judge mankind again with a flood nor destroy all mankind, but will keep some to be the nations of the earth for His glory 21:24, 26 .
[181]  In verse 5 we are told that out of the throne come lightnings and voices and thunders.
[182]  All these signify God s wrath in His judgment.
[183]  In the Epistles, out of the throne of grace come the mercy and grace of God for anyone who approaches Him through the redeeming blood of Christ.
[184]  All the believers who are participating in God s mercy and grace today by approaching God s throne of grace will enjoy the river of life and the tree of life out of God s throne as their life supply for eternity, while the unbelievers, who will be judged by God s throne of judgment, will have no share in the eternal enjoyment issuing out of God s eternal throne.
[185]  The elders in this verse are not the elders of the church, but the elders of the angels, because here, before the Lord s second coming, they are sitting on thrones already cf.
[186]  That they are clothed in white garments and have a harp and golden bowls full of incense 5:8 indicates that now they are also priests before God, whereas, in the millennial kingdom, the reigning overcomers will be the priests of God and of Christ 20:6 .
[187]  Verse 8 says, And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings.
[188]  In appearance, the four living creatures resemble the cherubim in Ezekiel 1:5-10 and 10:14-15.
[189]  The head of the creeping things is the serpent, a symbol of God s enemy, Satan, who, having been cast into the lake of fire, will have no place in the new heaven and the new earth; and the living things in the water are in the water of God s judgment which will no longer be in the new heaven and the new earth 21:1 .
[190]  LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE EIGHTEEN THE WORTHY LION-LAMB
[191]  In chapter four we see the scene in heaven after Christ s ascension.
[192]  The throne of God is the center of the scene in chapter four, and God is sitting on the throne ready to execute His universal administration for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.
[193]  In chapter five we have the same scene after Christ ascended there.
[194]  THE WORTHY LION-LAMB A. The Lion of the Tribe of Judah
[195]  While John was weeping, one of the elders said to him, Do not weep; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome to open the scroll and its seven seals.
[196]  This refers to Genesis 49:8-9, where Christ is portrayed as a lion, which is a symbol of Him as a strong fighter against the enemy.
[197]  Although the angels do not need redemption, they need someone to defeat the enemy of God, for one among them became God s enemy.
[198]  As far as redemption is concerned, Christ sat down after His ascension at the right hand of God in heaven Heb 1:3; 10:12 , whereas, regarding the carrying out of God s administration, He is still standing in His ascension.
[199]  E. Worthy to Open the Scroll and Its Seven Seals
[200]  God s purpose needs someone to carry it out who can solve all the problems of God.
[201]  As the Lion, Christ has defeated the rebellious Satan, and as the Lamb, He has taken away the sin of fallen man.
[202]  As the redeeming Lamb, Christ has seven observing and searching eyes for executing God s judgment upon the universe to fulfill God s eternal purpose, which will consummate in the building up of the New Jerusalem.
[203]  LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE NINETEEN WORLD HISTORY FROM CHRIST S ASCENSION
[204]  Through His incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, Christ is fully qualified in His ascension to open the mystery of God s economy which is contained in the seven seals.
[205]  LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE TWENTY THE CRY OF THE MARTYRED SAINTS
[206]  The seven seals are firstly divided into four and three, and secondly into six and one.
[207]  The number three signifies the Triune God, and the number one the unique God.
[208]  Hence, both four plus three and six plus one indicate that the seven seals, through God s judgment, bring God s creation with all the creatures to God.
[209]  Verse 11 says, And to each of them was given a white robe; and it was said to them that they should rest yet a little while, until the number of their fellow slaves and their brothers who are about to be killed even as they were should be completed also.
[210]  The white robe here signifies that their martyrdom has been approved by God.
[211]  While some people have blasphemously said that they are God, the Lord will shake the earth and the heaven as a reminder to them that He is God.
[212]  LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE GOD S PRESERVATION OF HIS PEOPLE
[213]  In the book of Revelation there are a number of insertions, and chapter seven is the first of them.
[214]  It is an insertion between the sixth and seventh seals, showing how God cares for His people while He is about to execute His judgment upon the earth.
[215]  As we have seen, the fifth seal is the cry of the martyred saints for revenge, and the sixth seal is God s answer to this cry, which is also a warning to the dwellers on the earth that the tribulation will soon come.
[216]  Revelation 7:1 says, After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding fast the four winds of the earth, so that no wind should blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree.
[217]  The winds here are for God s judgments Jonah 1:4; Isa 11:15; Jer 22:22; 49:36; 51:1 .
[218]  In the Old Testament Christ was called the Angel of the Lord, who was God Himself Gen 22:11-12; Exo 3:2-6; Judg.
[219]  In addition to the chosen remnant of Israel, God has another people the redeemed saints of the church 7:9-17 .
[220]  In this insertion we see a vision revealing how God preserves His redeemed saints throughout all the tribulations.
[221]  The way God preserves the chosen remnant of the children of Israel is to seal them and to leave them on earth.
[222]  God s rapture of His redeemed saints will continue with the two witnesses in 11:12, the late overcomers in 15:2, and the harvest in 14:14-16 the majority of the believers who will pass through most of the great tribulation , until all the saints will be raptured to participate in God s care and the Lamb s shepherding for eternity.
[223]  John 12:13 , which they have undergone for the Lord s sake v. 14 . Palm trees are also the sign of satisfaction through watering Exo 15:27 . Palm branches were used for the feast of tabernacles, in which the people of God rejoiced for the satisfaction of their enjoyment Lev 23:40; Neh 8:15 . The feast of tabernacles was a type which will be fulfilled by this great multitude of God s redeemed ones enjoying the eternal feast of tabernacles.
[224]  Standing before the throne indicates that the great multitude of the redeemed ones must have been raptured to the presence of God.
[225]  LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO THE SEVEN EYES OF THE LAMB
[226]  Many Christians realize that, according to Revelation 5, Christ, the slain Lamb, is worthy, and a number of Christian hymns praise the Lord for His worthiness.
[227]  However, most hymns on the worthiness of the Lamb praise Christ for being worthy because of His redemption.
[228]  However, according to Revelation 5, the worthiness of the Lamb is not mainly due to His redemption, but to His being able to open the secret of God s economy.
[229]  Christ is worthy to open the seals of God s economy because He has defeated the enemy and has redeemed us.
[230]  As the One who has brought God s authority to the earth, He is the victorious, overcoming Lion of the tribe of Judah and the Lamb who has accomplished a full redemption for God s chosen people.
[231]  Another major point in Revelation 5 is that Christ as the Lion-Lamb has seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God v. 6 . These seven eyes are also the seven lamps burning before the throne of God 4:5 . Hence, in these chapters we have the seven lamps, the seven eyes, and the seven Spirits.
[232]  Zechariah 3:9 says, For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
[233]  This verse reveals that the seven eyes are not only the seven eyes of the Lord, but also the seven eyes of the stone.
[234]  The engraving of the stone was its being dealt with by God s righteousness on the cross for our redemption.
[235]  The accomplishment of God s building requires His judgment.
[236]  God s judgment is carried out by Christ s being the One with seven flaming eyes to burn, enlighten, search, purify, and refine us.
[237]  Eventually, these flaming eyes infuse us with all that He is, metabolically transforming us into His being.
[238]  The whole city of New Jerusalem will have the same essence and appearance as God.
[239]  As we have pointed out several times, the appearance of God sitting on the throne in chapter four is of jasper 4:3 , and the appearance of the New Jerusalem, especially its wall, in chapter twenty-one is also of jasper 21:11, 18-19 .
[240]  The revelation of Christ in chapter one is for the building; the seven epistles to the seven churches in chapters two and three are for God s building; and the scene in heaven after Christ s ascension and the vision of Christ as the Lion-Lamb in chapter five are also for God s building.
[241]  In 8:1-2 we see the seven trumpets brought in as the answer to the saints prayer in the fifth seal.
[242]  But in the administration of God s judgment upon the earth, Christ is the Angel standing on the position of One who has been sent by God.
[243]  The prayer of the saints in this chapter must be for the judgment of the earth which opposes God s economy.
[244]  The answer to the saints prayers is the execution of God s judgment upon the earth by the following seven trumpets.
[245]  If you read Luke 18, you will see that the Lord Jesus says that at a certain time the saints on earth will cry to God to come in to deal with the situation and to vindicate Himself.
[246]  This will take place at the opening of the seventh seal when Christ, the other Angel, will minister as our High Priest to bring to God our prayers mingled with His incense, and will be the One sent to execute God s judgment on earth.
[247]  In verses 8 and 9 we see the second trumpet: And the second angel trumpeted: and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea; and the third part of the sea became blood, and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea and which had life died, and the third part of the ships were destroyed.
[248]  That part of the sea which is defiled by evil against God will be damaged by God s judgment.
[249]  My burden in this message concerns the great tribulation.
[250]  Revelation 8:13 says, And I saw, and I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to those who dwell on the earth because of the remaining sounds of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to trumpet.
[251]  With this as a background, we come now to the fifth trumpet.
[252]  Speaking of the locusts, verse 11 says, They have a king over them, the angel of the abyss: his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.
[253]  Apart from the introduction 1:1-8 and the conclusion 22:6-21 , the book of Revelation has three main sections.
[254]  In 1:19 the Lord said to John, Write therefore the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which are about to take place after these things.
[255]  In chapter one, there are the seven golden lampstands with Christ in their midst, which are the things seen, and in chapters two and three there are the seven churches, which are the things present.
[256]  As chapter five reveals, Christ comes into this scene as the unique One worthy to open the secret of God s economy.
[257]  The voice which comes out of the four horns of the golden altar indicates that God s judgment upon man is based on the redemption of Christ; it is because men do not believe in Christ s redemption that God sends His judgment.
[258]  Since it is at the fifth trumpet that Satan falls from heaven to earth to damage the earth and persecute the people of God for three and one-half years 12:10, 12-17, 6 and that at the same time the last three and one-half years 13:5-7; 11:7 , Antichrist comes up out of the abyss to collaborate with Satan to torment people, persecute the saints, and blaspheme God, and since it is also in the same last three and one-half years that the holy city Jerusalem is given to the Gentiles for destruction 11:2 , the woe of the fifth trumpet must be the beginning of the great tribulation Matt 24:21 .
[259]  Verse 16 says, And the number of the cavalry troops was two hundred million.
[260]  In the past several messages we have been considering the content of the seven seals.
[261]  In the book of Revelation, the number seven is composed two ways: four plus three and six plus one.
[262]  God s creature man will also be brought to the unique God.
[263]  The purpose of God s move is to bring His creatures, signified by the number four, to the Triune God, and to bring man, signified by the number six man was created on the sixth day , to the unique God.
[264]  In chapter one there are the seven lampstands with Christ walking among them; in chapters two and three the seven churches; in chapter four the heavenly scene; in chapter five Christ as the One worthy to open the scroll; in chapter six there are the six seals; in chapter seven an insertion showing two visions regarding God s preservation of His people; in chapter eight there are the first four trumpets; in chapter nine the fifth and sixth trumpets; in chapter ten Christ coming to take possession of the earth; in chapter eleven the two witnesses; in chapter twelve the man-child; in chapter thirteen the beast; in chapter fourteen the firstfruit, the worship of the beast, the harvest, and the winepress; in chapter fifteen the overcomers on the glassy sea; in chapter sixteen the seven bowls; in chapter seventeen the religious Babylon; in chapter eighteen the material, political Babylon; in chapter nineteen the wedding feast of the Lamb and the war at Armageddon; in chapter twenty the binding of Satan, the millennial kingdom, the last rebellion of mankind, and the judgment at the great white throne; and in chapters twenty-one and twenty-two the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem.
[265]  Let us now consider the details of 10:1-11.
[266]  In this portion of the Word we have a clear vision of Christ coming to take possession of the earth.
[267]  In this chapter Christ is another strong Angel, like the One in 7:2; 8:3; and 18:1.
[268]  Verse 2 also says that He placed His right foot on the sea and the left on the land.
[269]  Only He is worthy to open the scroll of God s economy, and only He is qualified to possess the earth.
[270]  Based upon the same principle, Christ, as another Angel sent by God, will come to tread upon the sea and the earth, for the earth and the sea have both been given to Him as His inheritance Psa 2:8 .
[271]  When the seventh angel is about to trumpet, the mystery of God will be finished.
[272]  In the dispensation from Adam to Moses, and from Moses to Christ, everything was unveiled, manifested, and there was no mystery.
[273]  It will be the same in the dispensation of the millennial kingdom and in the new heaven and the new earth everything will be unveiled and there will be no more mystery.
[274]  Christ Himself Col 2:2 , the church Eph 3:4-6 , the kingdom of the heavens Matt 13:11 , the gospel Eph 6:19 , the indwelling of Christ Col 1:26-27 , and the coming resurrection and transfiguration of the saints as the ending of this dispensation of mystery 1 Cor 15:51-52 are all mysteries which were hidden in times of the ages Rom 16:25; Eph 3:5; Col 1:26 .
[275]  Chapter ten and the first part of chapter eleven are an insertion between the sixth and seventh trumpets.
[276]  In chapter ten we have a clear vision of Christ coming back to take possession of the earth.
[277]  The length of time covered in this vision is forty-two months v. 2 . These forty-two months are twelve hundred and sixty days v. 3 . Undoubtedly, this is a reference to the verses in the book of Daniel where there is mention of the three and a half years, the second half of the last of the seventy weeks Dan 12:7; 7:26; 9:27 . In Revelation we have the fulfillment of what is mentioned in Daniel.
[278]  THE TESTIMONY OF THE TWO WITNESSES A. The Two Witnesses
[279]  In the church age, the churches are the lampstands for God s testimony 1:20 , but in the last three and a half years of this age, the two witnesses will be the lampstands for God s testimony.
[280]  Verse 3 says, And I will give authority to My two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth v. 3 . Sackcloth is a symbol of mourning 2 Sam 3:31 . These two witnesses will wear funeral clothes as a warning to people.
[281]  They will not preach the gospel of gladness, but will warn people to stay away from God s judgment and from the worship of Antichrist.
[282]  Verse 11 says, And after the three and a half days, the spirit of life out of God entered into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those beholding them.
[283]  LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT THE SEVENTH TRUMPET
[284]  Without the seventh trumpet, God s economy and His move cannot be finished.
[285]  By reading chapters eight through eleven, we see that the seven trumpets are truly a great thing.
[286]  This trumpet will sound for a period of time, and it will last for eternity, declaring, announcing, and proclaiming God s eternal plan.
[287]  The negative things are the wrath of God, which consists of the last plagues of the seven bowls 15:1; 16:1-21 as the last woe to the dwellers on the earth 8:13; 9:12; 11:14 , and the destruction of the destroyers of the earth, which transpires at the Lord s coming back to earth 17:14; 18:1-2; 19:19 20:3 .
[288]  The positive things are the eternal kingdom of Christ, which is the kingdom in its manifestation 11:15, 17 ; the judgment of the dead, which occurs before the resurrection of the saints v. 18 ; and the giving of rewards to the prophets and to the saints, which transpires at the judgment seat of Christ 2 Cor 5:10 after the resurrection and rapture of the saints 1 Cor 15:23, 52; 1 Thes 4:16-17 , and at the throne of Christ s glory Matt 25:31-34 , to those who feared God s name 14:6-7 . Hence, the seventh trumpet comprises all things from the end of the great tribulation to eternity future: the last plagues of the seven bowls ch.
[289]  16 ; the resurrection and rapture of the saints; the rewarding of the saints; the coming back of Christ to the earth; the destruction of the great Babylon 17:1 19:6 ; the marriage of the Lamb 19:7-10 ; the destruction of Antichrist, the false prophet, Satan, and their followers 19:11 20:3 ; the millennial kingdom 20:4-6 ; the final judgment upon the earth and Satan 20:7-10 ; the final judgment of the dead 20:11-15 ; and the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem for eternity 21:1 22:5 .
[290]  CONSISTING OF: A. The Seven Bowls of the Wrath of God
[291]  The seventh trumpet will include the seven bowls of the wrath of God as the third woe 11:14,18; 15:1, 7-8; 16:1-21 .
[292]  At this time, the twenty-four elders will fall on their faces and worship God, saying, We thank You, Lord God the Almighty, He who is and who was, because You have taken Your great power and have reigned v. 17 .
[293]  These God-fearing people are those who heed the eternal gospel to fear God and worship Him, and not to worship the beast or his image 14:6-7 , and to care for the Lord s needy people Matt 25:33-40 .
[294]  Then, after Christ comes back to earth and establishes the throne of His glory in Jerusalem, the center of His kingdom, He will judge the nations, all the living unbelievers.
[295]  Therefore, in Matthew 25:34-36, the King shall say to those on His right hand, Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was hungry, and you gave Me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger, and you took Me in; naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me. When these righteous ones shall ask the Lord how they could have done this to Him, He shall answer, Truly I say to you, in so far as you did it to one of these, the least of My brothers, you did it to Me Matt 25:40 . These sheep will then be transferred into the kingdom to become the nations during the millennium 2:26; 12:5 . During these thousand years, the overcoming Christians will be Christ s co-kings, the saved Jews will be the priests, and these righteous ones will be the people over whom the overcomers shall rule.
[296]  If we would understand prophecy, we must be familiar with the entire content of the seventh seal.
[297]  When the temple of God in heaven is opened and the ark of His covenant is seen in His temple, there are lightnings, voices, thunders, an earthquake, and great hail v. 19 . This is the same as what will transpire after the pouring out of the seventh bowl 16:17-21 . Lightnings, voices, and thunders are solemn declarations of God s wrath in His judgment.
[298]  During the past one and a half centuries, the rapture of the saints has been a troublesome matter for many seeking Christians.
[299]  Mainly, there are three schools of understanding concerning the rapture: the school of pre-tribulation, the school of post-tribulation, and the school of the so-called partial rapture.
[300]  Let us firstly consider the need of the rapture of the overcomers.
[301]  LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE THIRTY THE RAPTURE OF THE BELIEVERS 2 I. THE RAPTURE OF THE OVERCOMERS C. The Facts 1.
[302]  The One Being Taken and the Other Being Left
[303]  In Matthew 24:39-42 we see the fact of the rapture.
[304]  The place to which the overcomers will be raptured is before the Son of Man in the heavens Luke 21:36 .
[305]  At the time of the rapture of the overcomers, Christ will not yet have left heaven and have come down to the air.
[306]  A third condition is to love the Lord s appearing.
[307]  In 2 Timothy 4:8 Paul said, Henceforth, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me in that day; and not only to me, but also to all those who have loved His appearing.
[308]  Paul said that the crown of righteousness is laid up for all those who love the Lord s appearing.
[309]  This portion of the Word clearly says that before the saints are raptured, the man of sin, Antichrist, will be revealed and that he will sit in the temple of God proclaiming himself that he is God 2 Thes 2:4 .
[310]  Genesis is the field into which nearly all the seeds of the truths were sown.
[311]  In Revelation we have the harvest of the truths sown in the beginning of the Bible.
[312]  Therefore, the Bible not only gives us the doctrine but also the experience, not only the revelation of God, but also the manifestation of God.
[313]  As we consider Exodus 25, Zechariah 3 and 4, and the book of Revelation, we see four aspects of the lampstand that we must experience.
[314]  However, it is not adequate merely to have a large quantity of gold.
[315]  We may have a thousand talents of gold and not yet have the lampstand, for we may just have the substance without the form.
[316]  Because God s desire is for the building, we have given message after message saying that we need God in Christ as our very substance that we might be built together.
[317]  LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE THIRTY-TWO EXPERIENCING THE TRANSFORMING
[318]  In 1925 I began to read, study, and research the book of Revelation.
[319]  One of the most difficult verses is 3:12, where the Lord said, He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God and My new name.
[320]  The Lord will not only make us into pillars, but He will write three names upon us: the name of God, the name of the New Jerusalem, and His new name.
[321]  To write a name on something is to give it a designation.
[322]  If I were to ask you your name, what would you say?
[323]  Would you have the boldness to say, My name is God ?
[324]  Suppose I am the one on whom the Lord has written God s name, and you ask me my name.
[325]  When the apostle John ate the little scroll, it was sweet in his mouth but bitter in his stomach 10:10 .
[326]  Even among us who are so close to the Lord s ministry there are many who do not care for God s building.
[327]  The reference to engraving the stone indicates that this stone is Christ.
[328]  In brief, it means that the Lord Jesus, as the building stone, was engraved, dealt with, by God on the cross for the iniquity of God s people.
[329]  In one day, by that engraving on the cross, the Lord Jesus took away all the sins of God s people.
[330]  The stone and the lampstand are mentioned in Zechariah at the time when Zerubbabel was rebuilding the temple.
[331]  In Revelation, we firstly have the seven lampstands symbolizing the seven local churches.
[332]  Verse 1 says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and verse 14 says, And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.
[333]  When Peter was brought to this wonderful One, He changed his name from Simon to Cephas, which means a stone v. 42 . When Nathanael met Him, He said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, you shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man v. 51 . This word reminds us of Jacob s dream, the center of which is Bethel Gen 28:10-22 . John chapter one, extending from eternity past to eternity future, covers a great deal.
[334]  Let us now consider further some of the crucial terms found in the Gospel of John and in the book of Revelation.
[335]  Firstly, in John 1:1, we have the eternal Word.
[336]  As this verse makes clear, the Word was God.
[337]  Before I came into the church, I was saved and was loving the Lord.
[338]  Rather, I was a clean, young Christian who sought the Lord, studied the Bible, and prayed every day.
[339]  The first section of the book of Revelation, composed of the first eleven chapters, covers all things to eternity.
[340]  The second section, comprising the last eleven chapters, gives details of the important things and crucial matters from the last three and a half years of the present age, which will be the period of the great tribulation, to the eternal age of the new heaven and new earth.
[341]  When this seal is opened, the thousands of martyred saints who have been slain for the Lord s testimony will cry to God for vengeance, beseeching Him to intervene and deal with rebellious mankind.
[342]  However, since mankind has continually disappointed God, rebelling against Him, God will eventually declare that His toleration has come to an end. The great earthquake and the shaking of heaven in the sixth seal will be a warning to earth s dwellers.
[343]  The seventh trumpet, which continues into eternity, includes many significant things: the last part of the great tribulation, the resurrection and rapture of the majority of the believers, the reward to the saints, the fall of Babylon the great, the marriage of the Lamb, the seven bowls, Christ s descent to the earth with His overcomers as His army to fight Antichrist at Armageddon, the binding of Satan, the millennial kingdom, the last rebellion of mankind, Satan s being cast into the lake of fire, the judgment at the great white throne, the new heaven, the new earth, and the New Jerusalem.
[344]  It is difficult to understand the book of Revelation.
[345]  If we would rightly interpret this book, we need all the other sixty-five books of the Bible.
[346]  But in 12:5 and 6 we are told that the man-child will be raptured to the throne of God and that, following this, the woman will be nourished for a thousand two hundred and sixty days v. 6 . These twelve hundred sixty days are three and a half years or forty-two months 12:14; 11:2-3; 13:5 , which will be the period of the great tribulation.
[347]  After the patriarchs, we have the children of Israel, symbolized by the moon, reflecting the sun Christ and shining collectively in the light of Christ.
[348]  The woman in chapter twelve is not only universal both in time and in space, but is also bright in celestial light.
[349]  LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE THIRTY-FIVE THE WOMAN AND THE MAN-CHILD
[350]  One of them is Jacob s dream at Bethel Gen 28:10-22 .
[351]  In that dream Jacob saw heaven opened and a ladder set up on earth extending from earth to heaven.
[352]  Fornication is to have a husband and to submit yourself to another man.
[353]  We commit fornication when, on the one hand, we admit that Christ is our husband, while, on the other hand, we submit to so many other things.
[354]  Now we can see that this life-study of Revelation is not accidental; it was planned and timed by God that we all might see that we must be the unique woman submitting ourselves only to Christ, not to anything or anyone else, and that we must only receive what is of Christ.
[355]  Do not understand the man-child in just a doctrinal way as consisting of the dead overcomers resurrected.
[356]  We have seen that the woman in Revelation 12 is not an individual woman, but a collective, universal woman symbolizing the totality of God s people.
[357]  In Genesis 3:15 the woman was local and individual; the seed, Christ, was also individual; and the serpent was a small snake.
[358]  But in Revelation 12 the woman is universal and collective, symbolizing all of God s people: the patriarchs represented by the twelve stars; Israel represented by the moon; and the church, the New Testament believers, represented by the sun.
[359]  They also overcame the enemy by the word of their testimony.
[360]  This is their word testifying that the Devil has been judged by the Lord.
[361]  Whenever we sense the Devil s accusation, we should verbally testify how the Lord has already dealt with him.
[362]  We need to testify not only to men but also to the demons, saying, Demons, you must be reminded that Satan, your king, has been defeated by my Lord Jesus Christ.
[363]  The brothers also overcame the enemy by not loving their soul life.
[364]  Due to Adam s fall, Satan has joined himself to man s soul life, man s self Matt 16:23-24 .
[365]  This single entity, the stronger part of God s people, will be raptured before the great tribulation, not to the air, but to the throne of God.
[366]  According to 17:3 and 10, these ten horns will be the ten kings under Antichrist.
[367]  Whenever the Bible speaks of the serpent, it denotes the subtle one Gen 3:1 .
[368]  The Devil accused Job Job 1:9; 2:4-5 and Joshua Zech 3:1-2 and is now accusing the believers before God, even day and night v. 10 . The Devil not only accuses us to God, but he also slanders God to us.
[369]  HIS PERSECUTION A. Being Cast down from Heaven to the Earth
[370]  Verse 13 says, And when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the man-child.
[371]  GOD S PRESERVATION OF THE WOMAN A. Giving Her the Two Wings of the Great Eagle
[372]  The great eagle signifies God, and the two wings signify His strength to rescue Exo 19:4; Deut 32:11-12 .
[373]  As God brought the children of Israel out from Pharaoh s persecution, so will He bring His people away from Satan s persecution in the great tribulation.
[374]  I am burdened that we would all see the vision in Revelation chapter twelve.
[375]  Do not think that the portrait here is a small picture showing a few insignificant matters.
[376]  The woman in this vision has been representing the people of God since the fall of man in Genesis 3.
[377]  A. The Overcomers Having Fought unto Death against Satan on Earth
[378]  Verse 7 says, And there was war in heaven.
[379]  Immediately after the man-child is raptured to heaven, a war commences with Michael and his angels against Satan.
[380]  What we need to do is to take the covenant, the word of God, and preach to Satan regarding what the Lord has accomplished for us.
[381]  This is what Paul meant when in Ephesians 6:12 he spoke of wrestling, not with flesh and blood, but with principalities, powers, and spiritual wickedness in the heavenlies.
[382]  THE ARCHANGEL MICHAEL AND HIS ANGELS WARRING WITH THE DRAGON
[383]  Gabriel is a reporter bringing news to God s people Dan 8:16; 9:21-22; Luke 1:19, 26 , whereas Michael is a fighter contending for God s people Dan 10:13,21; 11:1; 12:1; Jude 9; Rev 12:7 .
[384]  After the dragon and his angels are cast out of heaven, there will be a loud declaration in heaven.
[385]  Verse 10 says, I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, Now is come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ, for the accuser of our brothers has been cast out, who accuses them before our God day and night.
[386]  But when the kingdom of God comes, we shall enjoy God s salvation in full.
[387]  When I was young, I was told that there were at least one hundred different expositions of the book of Revelation.
[388]  What is between these two ends of the second section of Revelation?
[389]  In chapters twenty-one and twenty-two we have the New Jerusalem as the Lamb s wife, and in chapters nineteen and twenty we have the bride and the wedding feast of the Lamb.
[390]  Let us use, once again, the illustration of the Jewish people today.
[391]  There may be thirteen or fourteen million Jews on earth, but less than three million of them are in the nation of Israel.
[392]  Chapters twelve and thirteen seem to stand alone, and for many years I did not know the connection between them.
[393]  Both in Daniel and in Revelation the beast out of the sea refers not only to the Roman Empire but specifically to Antichrist.
[394]  The fourth beast has a little horn Antichrist coming up among the ten horns Dan 7:8, 20, 24-26 .
[395]  Now we come to chapter eight of Daniel, where we see the little horn vv.
[396]  C. Growing Great Even to the Host of Heaven
[397]  The little horn will not only grow great to the south, to the east, and to the beautiful land, but even to the host of heaven.
[398]  Antichrist will do great things and prosper Dan 8:12, Darby; v. 24 . The Hebrew word rendered did great things Darby is a specific word indicating a marvelous and wonderful practice.
[399]  Antichrist will do great things, things which have never been done before, and he will prosper.
[400]  LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE FORTY-ONE THE BEAST OUT OF THE SEA 2 III.
[401]  THE PRINCE IN DANIEL A. Both Titus and Antichrist
[402]  Daniel 9:27 also says, And for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate.
[403]  The Lord Jesus referred to this when He said, Ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place Matt 24:15 .
[404]  Daniel 11:36 and 37 reveal that this king, Antichrist, shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvelous things against the God of gods....
[405]  H. Coming to His End and None Helping Him
[406]  Eventually, He shall come to his end, and none shall help him Dan 11:45 .
[407]  This means that Christ will terminate him at the war of Armageddon and that no one will help him to escape.
[408]  As we consider all these points regarding Antichrist, we see what kind of person he will be and even where he will come from.
[409]  In the two previous messages we have seen that Antichrist is the fourth beast in Daniel 7, the little horn in Daniel 8, the prince in Daniel 9, and the king in Daniel 11.
[410]  In this message we need to consider some other characteristics of Antichrist.
[411]  THE ANGEL OF THE ABYSS A. Coming up out of the Abyss
[412]  This man of sin is described as the lawless one 2 Thes 2:8, Gk.
[413]  Second Thessalonians 2:7 says, For the mystery of lawlessness is already operating; only there is one who restrains now until he comes out of the midst.
[414]  When as a young man I studied the great image Nebuchadnezzar saw in his dream Dan 2:28-35 , I became fully convinced that the Bible is a divinely inspired book.
[415]  The parts of the great image the head, the breast and arms, the belly and thighs, and the legs with the ten toes match the development of the worldly powers throughout the centuries.
[416]  Besides God Himself, who could have given us such an illustration?
[417]  We must believe that God has been and still is sovereign over all the world powers, having sovereignly prepared them in a certain way.
[418]  Satan probably will give his power and authority to Antichrist before he is slain.
[419]  Revelation 13:7 says, And it was given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them.
[420]  The saints here are the rest of the woman s seed in 12:17, which consists of the God-fearing Jews and of the believers in Christ.
[421]  Antichrist will persecute the God-fearing Jews and the Christ-believing Christians.
[422]  He will war against God s people on earth and overcome them.
[423]  In this message we come to the second beast, the beast out of the earth 13:11-18 .
[424]  Revelation 13:11 says that the beast out of the earth had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon.
[425]  Revelation 13:12 says of the false prophet, He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his sight.
[426]  The false prophet will not only exercise the power of Antichrist, but also the authority of Antichrist.
[427]  In this message I would like to point out the correspondence between the vision in Revelation 12 and the book of Ephesians.
[428]  In Revelation 12 we all have been impressed with the vision of the woman with her stronger part, the man-child, fighting against the enemy by means of the word.
[429]  In John 6:57 the Lord said, He who eats Me shall also live because of Me, and in 6:63 He said, The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.
[430]  THE WAY TO PUT ON CHRIST AS OUR ARMOR
[431]  If we hold to our opinions, we shall not be able to put on Christ as our armor.
[432]  In order to put on the whole armor of God, our opinions must be killed.
[433]  In chapter twelve we have seen a clear vision of a universal woman bearing a man-child and confronting a great dragon.
[434]  We all have been deeply impressed with this sign.
[435]  In chapter thirteen we saw two beasts Antichrist and the false prophet, both of whom collaborate with the dragon, Satan, to oppose God and to hinder the completion of God s economy.
[436]  I. THE FIRSTFRUIT A. Firstfruit to God and to the Lamb
[437]  The firstfruit to God and to the Lamb mentioned in verse 4 are the ones of God s crop who mature the earliest.
[438]  These early overcomers will be the first ripe ones in God s field.
[439]  Hence, they will be reaped before the harvest as firstfruit to God and to the Lamb.
[440]  Verse 3 says that the one hundred forty-four thousand have been purchased from the earth.
[441]  This proves that they are no longer on earth, but had been raptured to the heavens.
[442]  At the time of verses 1 through 5 the firstfruit are no longer on earth because they have been purchased from the earth.
[443]  Verse 4 says of the firstfruit that they were not defiled with women, for they are virgins.
[444]  Just as there has been a debate about whether the number one hundred forty-four thousand is literal or figurative, there has also been a debate regarding the understanding of virginity mentioned in this verse.
[445]  In this message we shall cover the things that follow the rapture of the firstfruit 14:6-13 .
[446]  The basic content of the gospel of grace is repentance toward God and faith in the Lord Jesus Acts 20:21 that men may be forgiven of their sins and be born again as children of God Luke 24:47; John 1:12 ; while that of the eternal gospel is that men should fear God and worship God that they may not be deceived to follow Antichrist, but be brought back to the genuine worship of God, who has made the heaven and the earth v. 7 . Only man is privileged to preach the gospel of grace on earth today Acts 10:3-6 . But the eternal gospel will not be preached by men on earth, but by an angel in mid-heaven at the close of this age.
[447]  If, by fearing God and worshipping Him, they have treated God s people well, that is, they have taken care of the Christians and Jews, the Lord s brothers suffering poverty and imprisonment under Antichrist s persecution during the great tribulation, they will be justified by the Lord so that they may enter into the earthly part of the millennium to partake of the kingdom prepared by God for them from the foundation of the world Matt 25:34 .
[448]  The second event to follow the rapture of the firstfruit will be the fall of religious Babylon.
[449]  Verse 8 says, And another, a second angel, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, who has made all the nations drink of the wine of the fury of her fornication!
[450]  The modifying clause, who has made all the nations drink..., indicates that Babylon here refers to the religious, mysterious Babylon, which is the Roman Catholic Church, as in 17:2-6, not the material Babylon, as in 18:2.
[451]  LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE FORTY-EIGHT THE HARVEST AND THE GREAT WINEPRESS
[452]  The harvest will be the reaping of God s people, and the winepress will be the reaping of the evil-doers.
[453]  Verse 14 says, And I saw, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud One sitting like the Son of Man, having a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand.
[454]  The harvest will be reaped by Christ as the Son of Man.
[455]  He came as the Son of Man to sow the seed, and He will come again as the Son of Man to reap what He has sown.
[456]  As the Son of Man He is qualified to execute God s judgment on everyone John 5:27 .
[457]  Verses 18 and 19 say, And another angel came out of the altar, having authority over the fire, and he cried with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripened.
[458]  And the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the fury of God.
[459]  In the Bible the Jews are likened to the fig tree Matt 24:32 , the believers to wheat Matt 13:25, 30 , and the wicked Gentiles to the grapevine Rev 14:19 , which is a false vine, the counterfeit of the true vine made up of Christ and His members John 15:1-6 .
[460]  THE SEVEN BOWLS 1 THE LATE OVERCOMERS I. HAVING SUFFERED AND PASSED THROUGH
[461]  Revelation 15:2 says, And I saw as it were a glassy sea mingled with fire, and those who had come off victorious from the beast and from his image and from the number of his name, standing on the glassy sea, having harps of God.
[462]  God will prepare these harps for them that they might praise Him.
[463]  The song of Moses indicates God s triumphant judgment over the enemy of His people, whereas the song of the Lamb indicates Christ s redemption experienced by God s people in the presence of their enemy.
[464]  In their praises to God, the late overcomers will declare to the whole universe that they are above God s judgment on His enemies and that they have participated in the redemption of Christ.
[465]  Now we come to the seven bowls 16:1-21 .
[466]  This scene indicates that God on the throne is administrating His economy through the worthy Lion-Lamb, the One who is qualified to open God s hidden economy.
[467]  Verse 6 says, And the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in pure bright linen, and girded around the breasts with golden girdles.
[468]  LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE FIFTY THE SEVEN BOWLS 2
[469]  Before we consider the outpouring of the seven bowls, I want to say a further word concerning God on the throne and God in the temple.
[470]  It is rather easy to know God as the One on the throne because this fits our natural concept.
[471]  Throughout the Old Testament, God s people gradually realized that God is the mighty One on the throne.
[472]  Verse 3 says, And the second poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like that of a dead man; and every living soul that was in the sea died.
[473]  I do not believe that this will include all the seas.
[474]  The men who are burned with great heat, who blaspheme the name of God, and who refuse to repent must be mainly the citizens of the Roman Empire who follow Antichrist to persecute God s people and to rebel against God.
[475]  Verses 13 through 16 are a vision inserted between the sixth and seventh bowls.
[476]  Verses 13 and 14 say, And I saw, out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs; for they are spirits of demons, doing signs, which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth, to gather them to the war of the great day of God the Almighty.
[477]  In this message we come to Revelation chapter seventeen, where we see a woman sitting on a scarlet beast v. 3 . It is important that we all have a clear understanding of what is revealed here.
[478]  One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls spoke to the apostle John, saying, Come here, I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters 17:1 .
[479]  In verse 3 the apostle John says, And he carried me away in spirit into a wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
[480]  In verse 5 we see the name of the great prostitute: Mystery, Babylon the Great, The Mother of the Prostitutes and the Abominations of the Earth.
[481]  The title Mystery here indicates that Babylon the Great in this chapter is not the material one in chapter eighteen, but the religious one.
[482]  The religious Babylon, the apostate church, is truly mysterious in what she is, in what she practices, and in what she teaches.
[483]  The apostate church is also the mother of the abominations of the earth.
[484]  According to verse 4, this woman is clothed in purple and scarlet.
[485]  In the previous message we considered the great prostitute.
[486]  Now we shall consider the scarlet beast upon which the prostitute rides, as described in Revelation 17.
[487]  This indicates that Antichrist will perish, as indicated in 19:20 and 20:10.
[488]  Verses 16 and 17 say, And the ten horns which you saw and the beast, these shall hate the prostitute and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh and shall burn her utterly with fire; for God has put it into their hearts to do His mind, and to come to one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God shall be accomplished.
[489]  In this message we shall consider the material Babylon 18:1-24 .
[490]  The Bible reveals three aspects of Babylon: the literal, ancient Babylon, the religious Babylon, and the material Babylon.
[491]  Therefore, Babylon became evil not only because of her idolatry, but also because she destroyed God s temple and carried away into captivity God s people and the holy vessels.
[492]  Christ will appear at the time of the destruction of material Babylon.
[493]  Revelation 18:1 says, After these things I saw another Angel coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was illumined with His glory.
[494]  This Angel is Christ, coming down out of heaven, with whose glory the earth is illumined.
[495]  In His appearing Christ will come as an angel sent by God.
[496]  As we study the context of all these references to the angel of the Lord, we see that the angel of the Lord is actually the Lord Himself.
[497]  In the book of Revelation Christ is revealed at least three or four times as an angel sent by God to fulfill God s commission 7:2; 8:3; 10:1; 18:1 .
[498]  In verses 9 through 19 we have the weeping over Babylon.
[499]  Verse 9 says, And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her, shall weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning, and verse 11 says, And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargo anymore.
[500]  The international merchants who have made great profit from this wealthy city will weep when they see it under God s judgment.
[501]  After God s judgment upon all the negative things revealed in chapters sixteen, seventeen, and eighteen, we have the marriage of the Lamb and the marriage dinner 19:5-10 .
[502]  Perhaps you have never realized that, as the Lamb, Christ needs a wedding.
[503]  Although this concept of the marriage of God and man is foreign to religion, we emphasize it in the Lord s recovery in order to show that our position is that of the Bride, and that the position of the coming Christ is that of the Bridegroom.
[504]  Now we come to a very crucial matter, the matter of the readiness of the Bride.
[505]  Verse 7 says, Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife has made herself ready.
[506]  His wife refers to the church Eph 5:24-25, 31-32 , the Bride of Christ John 3:29 .
[507]  However, according to verses 8 and 9, the wife, the Bride of Christ, here consists only of the overcoming believers during the millennium; whereas the Bride, the wife, in 21:2 is composed of all the saved saints after the millennium for eternity.
[508]  These two garments are also seen in Psalm 45.
[509]  In this message we come to the war at Armageddon 19:11-21 .
[510]  After His wedding feast, Christ will come as a fighting General with His Bride, the overcoming believers who are His army, to fight Antichrist, the kings under him, and their armies at Armageddon.
[511]  Although the third party, the great prostitute, will have been annihilated, the Lord will still have three enemies: Satan, the dragon; Antichrist, the beast out of the sea; and the false prophet, the beast out of the land.
[512]  Verse 11 says, And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sits on it called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war.
[513]  Verse 13 also says, His name is called The Word of God.
[514]  The Word of God is the definition, the explanation, and the expression of God.
[515]  Even as the Lord fights, He speaks for God and expresses God.
[516]  Verse 14 says, And the armies which are in heaven followed Him on white horses, dressed in fine linen, white and pure.
[517]  The war mentioned in this chapter is the war at the valley of Jehoshaphat Joel 3:9-12; Zech 14:2-3, 12-15 .
[518]  In this message we come to the millennial kingdom.
[519]  In the Old Testament there are many verses concerning the millennial kingdom Psa 2:6, 8-9; Isa 2:2-5; 11:1-10; 65:20-25; 30:26; Zech 8:20-23; Psa 72:1-17; Isa 4:2-6; 9:7; 12:1-5; 16:5; 32:1-2; 40:9-11; 61:4-9; Zech 14:16-21 .
[520]  Revelation 20:4 says, And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them.
[521]  Verse 4 also says, And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and who did not worship the beast nor his image, and did not receive the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
[522]  The first resurrection will also be the resurrection of reward.
[523]  Luke 14:14 says, And you will be blessed, because they do not have anything with which to repay you; for it will be repaid to you in the resurrection of the righteous.
[524]  In this message we shall consider the last rebellion of mankind 20:7-10 and the judgment at the great white throne 20:11-15 .
[525]  Because God foreknew that even restored mankind would still have this problem, He will keep Satan in the abyss during the millennium so that He may use him to test mankind after the thousand years are over.
[526]  If we are immature and imperfect in God s eternal life, we are a shame to God.
[527]  The immaturity of God s people is truly a shame to Him, and during the millennium God will rid His people of this shame.
[528]  I. THE LAST REBELLION OF MANKIND A. Satan Loosed out of His Prison
[529]  As we have seen, after the thousand years, Satan will be released from his prison and used by God to test mankind.
[530]  The nations will go up over the breadth of the earth and surround the camp of the saints and the beloved city v. 9 . Here we see that Satan will deceive the nations to rebel against God.
[531]  C. Satan Being Cast into the Lake of Fire
[532]  Verse 10 says, And the Devil who deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where also the beast and the false prophet were; and they shall be tormented day and night forever and ever.
[533]  The lake of fire is prepared for the Devil and his angels Matt 25:41 .
[534]  Verse 13 says that the sea gave up the dead which were in it.
[535]  Since the dead unbelievers who were drowned in the sea are included among those in Hades, the dead given up by the sea must not be any unbelieving human beings; they may be the spirits of the living beings of the pre-Adamic age, the demons in this age Matt 8:31-32; 12:43 .
[536]  This may indicate that today s demons will be judged at the great white throne along with the unbelieving human beings.
[537]  LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE FIFTY-EIGHT THE NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH
[538]  Whenever we come to Revelation chapters twenty-one and twenty-two in our reading of the Bible, we immediately sense that we are entering another realm, another sphere.
[539]  The reason for this is that in these chapters the entire universe is renewed.
[540]  Not only the believers in Christ, but also the heaven and the earth are renewed.
[541]  Because God s dispensations are not completed until chapter twenty-one, the new heaven and the new earth do not appear before that time.
[542]  Although the dispensation of the kingdom will be the dispensation of restoration, it will still transpire in the old heaven and old earth, because God s perfecting and completing work in His chosen people will not be accomplished until the end of that dispensation.
[543]  When God finishes this work, by the dispensation of the kingdom, the old heaven and old earth will pass away through fire and be renewed into the new heaven and new earth 2 Pet 3:10-13 , where the New Jerusalem will come for God s eternal expression.
[544]  The fourth dispensation is the dispensation of the kingdom, the dispensation of restoration.
[545]  This dispensation will begin at Christ s second coming and last until the end of the millennium 11:15; 20:4, 6 .
[546]  During the dispensation of the kingdom, God will perfect the remnant of Israel and the immature believers.
[547]  After these dispensations, the perfection of God s people will be wholly accomplished, and God will have a perfect and complete universal woman, the New Jerusalem.
[548]  The sea is the result of the waters of judgment, the waters which God used to judge the pre-Adamic world.
[549]  The work of God s re-creation was to recover the land by restricting the waters which were the result of this judgment Gen 1:9-10; Jer 5:22 .
[550]  This city will also be the tabernacle of God for His dwelling with man v. 3 . To Christ, this new city will be the Bride for His satisfaction; to God, it will be the tabernacle in which He will dwell and through which He will express Himself.
[551]  Verses 5 through 7 speak of the sons of God in eternity.
[552]  Verse 7 says, He who overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be God to him, and he shall be a son to Me. The meaning of overcome here differs from its meaning in chapters two and three, where it is used seven times.
[553]  The overcoming in chapters two and three qualifies the overcoming believers for participation in the enjoyment of the millennial kingdom as a particular reward in God s dispensational administration, whereas the overcoming here qualifies all believers for participation in the New Jerusalem with all its enjoyment as a common portion of God s eternal salvation.
[554]  In this message and in the six following messages we shall consider the various aspects of the New Jerusalem 21:9-27 .
[555]  B. To Be on a Great and High Mountain
[556]  When John saw New Jerusalem, he was both in spirit and also carried away onto a great and high mountain.
[557]  The great and high mountain is in contrast to the wilderness in 17:3.
[558]  We need to be uplifted to a high mountain that we may see God s dwelling place for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.
[559]  As the holy city of God, the New Jerusalem is holy, sanctified, fully separated unto God, and thoroughly saturated with God s holy nature to be His habitation.
[560]  That type was firstly fulfilled in Christ as God s tabernacle among men John 1:14 , and eventually it will be fulfilled in the fullest way in the New Jerusalem, which will be the enlargement of Christ as God s dwelling place.
[561]  The New Jerusalem will also be the paradise of God.
[562]  To the thief who asked the Lord to remember him when He came into His kingdom, the Lord Jesus said, Truly I tell you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise Luke 23:43 .
[563]  The meaning of Revelation 21 and 22 has been hidden from Christians for centuries.
[564]  Many have understood these chapters in a very natural way and have considered them a description of a material city.
[565]  The thought that God s people are a living building is not first found in the book of Revelation.
[566]  In the Old Testament we see that God s people were considered material to be built together as His dwelling place.
[567]  After Peter received the revelation that the Lord was the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord said, And I also say to you that you are a stone, and on this rock I will build My church Matt 16:18, lit.
[568]  The city of New Jerusalem is built with treasures.
[569]  It is built with three kinds of precious materials, signifying the building by the Triune God.
[570]  This signifies the Spirit s work of transforming the redeemed and regenerated saints into precious stones for the building of God s eternal habitation that they may express God corporately in His permeating glory.
[571]  If we see the vision of the New Jerusalem built with God s divine nature, we shall renounce everything that does not belong to God s nature and reject anything that does not match it.
[572]  In this message we shall consider some further characteristics of New Jerusalem, namely its measurements and its wall.
[573]  In verse 16 we have the measurements of the city proper.
[574]  And the city lies foursquare, and its length is the same as the breadth.
[575]  Verse 18 says, And the building material of its wall was jasper.
[576]  Jasper is a transformed precious stone 1 Cor 3:12 that bears the appearance of God.
[577]  This message is the continuation of the previous one.
[578]  As we have already pointed out, jasper is the appearance of God.
[579]  The fact that the building material of the entire wall is jasper indicates that New Jerusalem, as the corporate expression of God in eternity, bears the appearance of God.
[580]  Although the wall is mainly for expression, spontaneously it also becomes a separation and a protection.
[581]  It separates us from everything common 21:27 , protects us, and keeps us in the realm of God s appearance.
[582]  Verse 19 says, The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone.
[583]  This verse and the next list the names of twelve precious stones, which are the twelve apostles of the Lamb, each of whom is signified by a precious stone.
[584]  When Peter, the first of the twelve apostles, was brought to the Lord, the Lord changed his name to Cephas, which means a stone John 1:42 .
[585]  Later, the Lord called him by this name when He spoke concerning the building of His church Matt 16:18 .
[586]  In this message we shall cover two very crucial aspects of New Jerusalem its gates and its street.
[587]  Undoubtedly, the city proper, the wall, and the foundations are very important.
[588]  The three gates on each side signify that the Triune God Father, Son, and Spirit work together to bring people into the holy city.
[589]  This is indicated in the three parables in Luke 15 and implied in the Lord s word in Matthew 28:19.
[590]  The fact that the Triune God is working to bring people into the holy city is also implied in the Lord s word in Matthew 28:19.
[591]  Verse 21 says, And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was, respectively, of one pearl.
[592]  We have seen that gold signifies the divine nature and that the precious stones signify what is produced by the transforming work of the Spirit.
[593]  This depicts Christ as the living One coming into the death waters, being wounded by us, and secreting His life-juice over us to make us precious pearls for the building of God s eternal expression.
[594]  Twelve is the number of absolute perfection and eternal completion in God s administration.
[595]  Hence, twelve gates indicate that the communication in the New Jerusalem is absolutely perfect and eternally complete for God s administration.
[596]  In God s eternal economy, angels are ministering spirits rendering service to those who inherit salvation and participate in the eternal blessing of the New Jerusalem, the center of the new heaven and new earth.
[597]  The angels at the twelve gates observe the enjoyment of those who enter in. In Luke 15:10 the Lord said, In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting.
[598]  Verse 21 says, And the street of the city was pure gold as transparent glass.
[599]  The entering into the city is through Christ s death and resurrection, whereas the daily walk, the daily living in the city, is according to the divine nature, signified by the street being pure gold.
[600]  In previous messages we have considered the city proper, the foundations, the wall, the gates, and the street.
[601]  Revelation 21:22 says, And I saw no temple in it, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.
[602]  In the Old Testament the tabernacle of God was the precursor, or the forerunner, of the temple of God.
[603]  New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of God v. 3 will be the temple of God.
[604]  This inner temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb, signifying that God and the Lamb will be the place in which we serve God.
[605]  Verse 23 says, And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.
[606]  The sun and moon will be in the new heaven and new earth, but they will not be needed in New Jerusalem; for there God, the divine light, will shine much more brightly.
[607]  We have pointed out that in the first section of this book 1:1 11:19 the throne of God is the center and that in the second section 12:1 22:21 the temple of God is the center.
[608]  The throne in New Jerusalem is on top of the golden mountain.
[609]  The one street in this city eventually leads to the throne.
[610]  The Lord Jesus came down to earth from His throne that He might bring God into man.
[611]  This is the Triune God coming out of Himself to reach mankind.
[612]  The throne of God and of the Lamb in the center of New Jerusalem symbolizes the divine authority of God s headship in Christ.
[613]  Proceeding out of the Throne of the Lamb-God
[614]  We have seen that the river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of the Lamb-God.
[615]  This river is nothing less than the flowing Spirit of God as the life-giving Spirit.
[616]  The water of the river of water of life is absolutely free 22:17; 21:6 .
[617]  Verse 2 also says that the tree of life produces twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month.
[618]  The fruits of the tree of life will be the food of God s redeemed for eternity.
[619]  The fact that there are twelve fruits means that the fruit of the tree of life is rich and sufficient for the completion in God s eternal administration.
[620]  Although the number which represents the church is seven, signifying that God is added to man, His creature, in His present dispensation, twelve is the number of the New Jerusalem, signifying that God is mingled with man in His eternal administration.
[621]  LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE SIXTY-SIX THE ENJOYMENT AND BLESSING
[622]  The basic numbers in New Jerusalem are the numbers twelve and one.
[623]  There is one God, one city, one throne, one street, one river, and one tree of life.
[624]  Hence, the number one is the basic number of the church and of God s building in His economy.
[625]  This is not my concept; it is Paul s concept in Ephesians 4:3-6, where he speaks of one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father.
[626]  The second item of our enjoyment in eternity is the tree of life 22:14, 19 .
[627]  The tree of life is nothing less than Christ, the Son of God, the redeeming Lamb, as our life supply.
[628]  This verse may be considered a promise for the enjoyment of the tree of life, which is Christ with all the riches of life; and the second half of verse 17 may be considered a call to take the water of life, which is the life-giving Spirit.
[629]  Through Christ s redemption, which has fulfilled all the requirements of God s glory, holiness, and righteousness, the way to the tree of life is opened again to believers Heb 10:19-20 .
[630]  It is difficult to determine whether the throne of God in Revelation 21 and 22 is the throne of authority or the throne of grace.
[631]  Revelation 22:3 also says, His slaves shall serve Him.
[632]  In this message we shall consider the various items found in this conclusion.
[633]  Verse 6 says, And he said to me, These words are faithful and true; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show to His slaves the things which must swiftly take place.
[634]  Verse 12 says, Behold, I come quickly, and My reward is with Me to render to each one according to his work.
[635]  I come quickly is the Lord s repeated warning that we may consider His reward at His coming back.
[636]  At the Lord s coming, this reward will be rendered to each one of the believers, after their rapture, at the judgment seat of Christ 2 Cor 5:10; 1 Cor 4:5; Rom 14:10; Matt 16:27 .
[637]  Verse 13 says, I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the beginning and the end. This is the Lord s declaration at the close of this book, corresponding to what God declared in the opening of this book 1:8 . This indicates that the Lord Jesus is the very God.
[638]  Verse 17 also says, He who wills, let him take the water of life freely.
[639]  Verses 18 and 19 say, I testify to every one who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to them, God shall add to him the plagues which are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city, which are written in this book.
[640]  LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE SIXTY-EIGHT EXPERIENCING THE SEVEN LAMPS,
[641]  In eternity past, the unique Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, existed by Himself.
[642]  Genesis 1:26 reveals that God came in to create man in His image.
[643]  As we read through the entire Bible from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22, we see that after many dispensations, generations, and centuries have passed, God will still be there in eternity future.
[644]  Although He will still be the Triune God, pictured in 22:1 as God, the Lamb, and the flowing river the symbol of the Spirit , at that time He will be the center of the New Jerusalem.
[645]  The lampstand was a very crucial item in the tabernacle because it directed people to the ark in the Holy of Holies.
[646]  Consider the arrangement of the furnishings in the tabernacle and the outer court.
[647]  The lamps are for enlightening, searching, exposing, judging, and burning.
[648]  Today, God is administering His government by means of enlightening, searching, exposing, judging, and burning.
[649]  Anything that does not correspond to God s nature will be burned by His fire.
[650]  Everything that is not of God or according to God, whether it be a so-called church, a Christian work, or even gospel preaching, will be counted by God as wood, hay, and stubble, and it will be burned by fire.
[651]  For this reason, the book of Revelation, which covers God s building in an ultimate way, includes these two chapters unveiling that God s building is accomplished through the seven lamps, the seven eyes, and the seven Spirits.
