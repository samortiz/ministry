   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN BY CHRIST SINGING IN OUR PRAISING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The highest point and peak of prayer is praise.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Praise is much better than prayer; so we must go on from prayer to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When you pray and pray until you reach the highest point, then prayer is over and praise begins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You are on the top of prayer, and the top of prayer is praise.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do you think that we will still pray in the New Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I tell you, in that day we will sing all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We will sing, It is done, it is done; prayer is over, praise begun!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must have the foretaste of the New Jerusalem now.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we must learn something deeper concerning praise; we must see something not just in a general way, but in a deeper way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have never been so concerned regarding the utterance as I am when we come to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now we are touching something very deep and tender.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is easy to speak concerning something superficial, but really difficult to convey a matter so deep and precious as this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I look to the Lord that you will exercise your spirit with your understanding to follow me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>DECLARING THE FATHER S NAME</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Have you ever heard a message telling of the Lord Jesus singing praises to God?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have one verse v. 12 in Hebrews chapter two, a quotation from Psalm 22:22, which says, I will declare Thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto Thee.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the Lord Jesus speaking, and He says, I will declare Thy name.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That means the Father s name.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He goes on to say, In the midst of the church will I sing praise unto Thee.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At what point of time did the Lord declare the Father s name to His brethren?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And at what time did the Lord sing hymns of praise unto the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Have you ever considered this?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let us look at Psalm 22, where these words are first recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first part of the Psalm deals with the crucifixion of Christ: My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me? v. 1 . When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He cried these very words Matt 27:46 , and His cry amazed all those who heard.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was quoting and fulfilling Psalm 22:1.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verse 16 of that Psalm we read, They pierced my hands and my feet, and in verse 18, They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These verses relating to the Lord s death are fulfilled and recorded in the four Gospels Luke 23:34; Matt 27:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then we come abruptly into the second part of this Psalm in verse 22, where the Lord says, I will declare Thy name unto my brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was fulfilled in the Lord s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After the crucifixion in the first part of Psalm 22, we have the resurrection in the second part.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>While He was on the cross He cried, My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But later in His resurrection He declared the Father s name unto His brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the morning of the resurrection day, as recorded in John 20:17, Jesus said to Mary, Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God and your God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Jesus did not tell Mary, Go to my disciples, or Go to my friends, but Go to my brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before the day of resurrection, no human being was a brother to Christ as a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was by His resurrection that all the disciples, all the believers in Him, became His brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>So He said to Mary, Go to my brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By His resurrection God has begotten us 1 Pet 1:3 , God has regenerated us as His sons; so we have become the brethren of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was at that time that He declared the name of the Father to His brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>SINGING PRAISE IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then when is the time when in the midst of the church the Lord sang praise unto the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the day of resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church was not formed on the day of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was not till the day of Pentecost that the church actually came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But here we have a difficulty, for on the day of Pentecost Jesus was in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How then could He sing praise to the Father in the midst of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the day of Pentecost, Peter told the people that this Jesus hath God raised up, saying to Him, Sit Thou on my right hand Acts 2:32, 34 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If Jesus is at the right hand of God, how can He sing hymns of praise to the Father in the midst of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the day of Pentecost, when the Lord Jesus was in the heavens at the right hand of God, the church came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On that day there were one hundred and twenty disciples plus three thousand new believers, making a total of three thousand one hundred and twenty constituting the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For simplicity s sake let us consider only fifty believers meeting in a locality as a church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How could Jesus sing praises to the Father in the midst of that church?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Have you ever been in a meeting where you saw Jesus singing in the midst of the church?</S>
