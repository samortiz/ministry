   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By reading chapters eight through eleven, we see that the seven trumpets are truly a great thing.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The positive things are the eternal kingdom of Christ, which is the kingdom in its manifestation 11:15, 17 ; the judgment of the dead, which occurs before the resurrection of the saints v. 18 ; and the giving of rewards to the prophets and to the saints, which transpires at the judgment seat of Christ 2 Cor 5:10 after the resurrection and rapture of the saints 1 Cor 15:23, 52; 1 Thes 4:16-17 , and at the throne of Christ s glory Matt 25:31-34 , to those who feared God s name 14:6-7 .

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>16 , is a part of the negative contents of the seventh trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet is recorded after the vision concerning the destruction of Jerusalem for the last three and one-half years 11:2 , and since the seven bowls will be the last plagues of the consummation of God s wrath 15:1; 16:1 , the woe of the seventh trumpet must be the end of the great tribulation Matt 24:21 .</S>
