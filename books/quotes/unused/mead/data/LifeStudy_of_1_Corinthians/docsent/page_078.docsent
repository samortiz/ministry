   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Gold Signifying the Nature of God the Father</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What does it mean in a practical way to build with gold?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Suppose a certain brother contacts you for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This brother is humble, kind, and loving.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, you realize that he is natural and that all his virtues are natural.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It will not help to give him doctrine by saying, Brother, you are natural.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Your virtues and your behavior are all natural.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead of speaking to him like this, you need to minister to him in such a way that he realizes that his virtues are natural, something obtained from birth, and that they do not contain anything of the element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Look to the Lord for His leading and for utterance that you may know how to minister to him in the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, this brother will be helped to see that there is not anything of the nature of God in his good virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He will realize that his love, kindness, and humility do not contain the divine gold, but are simply the wood of his natural humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before we can minister to others in this way, we must have adequate experience ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then we shall be able to minister the gold, the divine nature, into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After a brother has been ministered to in this way, he will begin to condemn his natural virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever he is humble or kind in a natural way, he will say, This is my natural virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I condemn it because there is nothing of God in it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This understanding, of course, is altogether different from that found among most Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Religion encourages believers to develop their natural virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But for God s building we need gold; we need the divine nature added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>C. Silver Signifying the Redemptive Work</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>of God the Son</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Silver signifies the redemptive work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We also need to understand this in an experiential way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more genuine experience we have, the more we shall know what is true gold and what is true silver.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we seek the Lord, we shall eventually come to realize that, no matter what we may be like in our natural being, we are fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is a sinful element even in our goodness and love.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates that we are altogether fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whatever we are and whatever we have is fallen in nature and needs God s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the New Testament, God s redemption first terminates us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Christ died on the cross to redeem us, He terminated us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whatever Christ terminates, He also redeems, brings back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, being brought back to God comes after termination.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, whatever Christ terminates and redeems He then replaces with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Redemption, therefore, involves termination, being brought back to God, and being replaced with what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a proper, adequate, and complete definition of redemption according to the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Christ redeems us, He terminates us, brings us back to God, and then replaces us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is Christ s redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have seen that all that we have and are is fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But now that we have been terminated and brought back to God, the work of replacement is taking place within us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ as the life-giving Spirit has come into us and is gradually replacing us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the reason Paul says in Galatians 2:20, I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, Who loved me and gave Himself for me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this one verse we see the three matters of termination, replacement, and being brought back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we have the adequate experience of Christ s redemption, in our contact with the saints we shall impart the reality of redemption to them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way silver will be added to them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is what it means to build with silver.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This kind of building will gradually eliminate death from the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every local church is troubled by death, which comes from gossip, negative talk, and even from the natural virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How can this death be swallowed up?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It can be swallowed up only by the building with gold and silver.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever you minister gold and silver to the saints, the negative germs within them are killed, and the saints are nourished in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The silver is a divine antibiotic to kill all germs.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then, spontaneously and automatically, death will be swallowed up by life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Life includes gold and silver, the nature of God and Christ s redemptive work.</S>
