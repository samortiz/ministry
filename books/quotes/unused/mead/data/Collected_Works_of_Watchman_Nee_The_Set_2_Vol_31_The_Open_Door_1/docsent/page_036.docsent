   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Tsi-yi:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I received and read your letter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Dr. Qu has moved to Ch'ang-Teh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The rest are staying in Yuan-Jiang.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are all well.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brother Lo's private school has more than ten students, and more are signing up as time goes by.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We still meet in Brother Feng's home.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We hope that God will prepare another meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>May He begin working here.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Please pray much for us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Six of Brother Lo's students are willing to walk in this way with us and seem to be very zealous!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>May they have not only a good beginning but also a good continuation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I ask the Lord that they be deeply rooted in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When they set out, the school gave them money to flee with; they do not need to worry about clothing or food yet.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are doing our best to arrange a place for them, but we have not found anything yet.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I want to return to Yuan-Jiang before the Chinese New Year, but I have not decided yet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Fu-sheng</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>January 13</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Address omitted</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Two Letters from Brother Chen Hsi-wen One</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Dear Sister X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When I started out on my journey, it was not for the purpose of escaping the war.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If it were, I would have escaped to Peking or Tientsin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Tientsin I had the opportunity to study for awhile French and spiritual books while learning to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But I felt that I could not stay in Tientsin for too long.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I left Tientsin, I wandered aimlessly, not knowing where I was going.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I went to the co-workers' conference with the original intention of receiving more spiritual truth and of dealing with my life's work before God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I wanted to see what God really wanted me to do before I decided where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For the past four years, I have had a question that cannot be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Should I serve the Lord while continuing in my occupation, or should I come out to serve the Lord full-time?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although I heard the call, I did not dare to acknowledge and answer it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This last summer I became completely clear; I should leave my job to serve the Lord full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, it seems that there are two roads that I can follow in serving the Lord full-time which I realized long ago .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One is helping with the publications, while the other is preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am not clear what the Lord wants me to do.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before I left Tientsin, one or two brothers and sisters asked me about the aspect of my work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I answered that if I did not help with the publications, I would go to the distant regions and learn to preach the gospel there.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It seems that I have a burden to do both, but practically, it seems that I must choose one because it is difficult to care for both at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It seems that, according to the Lord's present arrangement, I should take care of the publication work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brother Nee once asked me where I planned to go.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I only told him that I would temporarily go to Ch'ang-sha and then consider.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I dared not tell him about going into the distant regions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Later, Brother Nee suggested that I join Brother Weigh in Yunnan.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This was just according to the inward leading I had received, so I agreed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>My parents have sent several letters to me and have provided the money for traveling because they want me to come home.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If I return to Fukien province, I must go to Nan-ch'ang where there is a bus that passes through northern Fukien to southern Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>My inward feeling is that it is not God's will for me to return home right now.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If I return home, I will be surrounded and incarcerated by my family's love.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It will be difficult to leave if I want to.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Returning home would give me a little of my own enjoyment, but I would not be able to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, I cannot go home this way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am almost certain now that I should move away from home.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Please pray for me often.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In my travels with the other brothers and sisters, I learned many lessons and discovered many of my own shortcomings through quiet conversations.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once we have seen ourselves, we will never dare to raise our head to look at God or man again.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But thank God, He always has a way of deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>May the Lord save me from my natural life of the old creation so that I would desire and pursue Him more and no longer do things loosely according to my own will, thus bringing shame to myself and failing to glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Brother Nee has already finished polishing The Normal Christian Church Life and has prepared a clean copy of the first seven chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There are still three chapters which Brother Nee will work on in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>May the Lord bless this book.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whenever I read the Bible, I only see a few matters related to the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But if it is something related to the objective truth like prophecies, the truth of the church, etc. , I am afraid to get into it because I am afraid of wrong interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This time while I was listening to the messages and preparing the manuscripts, I finally became clear about the differences between terms like teachers, prophets, shepherds, elders, and apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This was also the first time I had heard anything concerning the truth of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Before I had only seen something concerning the meeting life, but even that was not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I thank the Lord for it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When I get to Ch'ang-sha, I will report to you of the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>May the Lord's love be with you, and may the Lord lead you in your way ahead, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Please greet Brother Chang, Sister Chang, and Sister Wang.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Chen Hsi-wen</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>December 29, 1937</S>
