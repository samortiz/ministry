   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPENDING TIME TO ENTER INTO THE TRUTHS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A young person who is sloppy at age fifteen will be a foolish person at age eighteen.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, if he is willing to study hard during high school, he can learn many things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If he continues with another four years of college, by age twenty-two he will be more enlightened inwardly and able to teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The difference between those who are learned and those who are unlearned is very great.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today those who have a college education are distinguished in society.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, even if you are no longer a young person, it would be best for you to go back to school to get a college education if possible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Otherwise, it will be difficult to convince others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are certainly happy to see the elderly saints, but it is very difficult for us to demand that they spend more effort to pursue the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They love the Lord and also His word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They know Genesis 1:26, realizing that God created man in His own image.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They understand Ephesians 1:4, knowing that God chose us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are clear about Proverbs 9:10, recognizing that the fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom and that the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are able to testify to others, saying, The Bible is very good; it tells us that God created us in His image, that He chose us in Christ, and that today He has become our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is more than sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot ask for more.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, if the young people among us were to study the Word in the same way, this would be very disappointing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why should an eighteen year old study the Word like a sixty-eight year old?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That way of studying is not bad, but only for an elderly saint.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>An eighteen year old must study the Bible utilizing a more in-depth method, just as Solomon said that we should remember our Lord in the days of our youth Eccl.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The young people must learn the highest truths while they are in their youth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Concerning God s Creation</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, the Bible reveals God s creation Gen 1 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In God s creation there are two important points one is the creation of life, and the other is the creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The creation of life is the most unusual aspect of God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>People today promote the building up of their countries, but no matter how much building work they do, they can never produce life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At best they can build some robots that resemble man but do not have man s life within.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Regardless of how far technology has advanced in producing more and more sophisticated computers, it still does not have the ability to create a living brain.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only God can create life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Genesis chapter one shows us that God firstly created the inanimate objects and then the living things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When He created the living things, God started from the lowest form of life and then progressed to the higher forms of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the process of God s creation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The highest form of the created life is the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Human life is the highest life among the lives created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This life is one that resembles the life of God; it is a life created according to God s image.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God s image is love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since the human life has God s image, it also has love, light, holiness and righteousness, making it the highest created life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Of course, in the universe there is still a higher life the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the entire universe the highest life is God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, in Genesis chapter two the tree of life depicts God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man was placed before the tree of life, indicating that God wanted man to take Him as the highest life so that man would live out God s life in the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the truth concerning God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Concerning Man s Fall</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Second, the Bible speaks about the fall of man, which is recorded in Genesis chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are also two important points concerning the fall of man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First, when man fell, there was a charge of sin against him before God, and man became a sinner condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Second, man now had the sinful nature within him as the result of Satan s coming into man s flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Satan tempted man to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This fruit denotes Satan, just as the fruit of the tree of life denotes God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If man had eaten of the tree of life, he would have gained God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, receiving Satan into his flesh, issuing in the sinful nature being in man s flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This sinful nature is called sin in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, when man fell, not only was there a charge of sin against him before God, but also the sinful nature was in his flesh.</S>
