   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HOLY SPIRIT CONVEYING THE LORD'S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE LORD HIMSELF TO US</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we must see how the Holy Spirit conveys the work of the Lord to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord's work includes all that He has done on the cross, in His resurrection, in His ascension, in His second coming, and in everything that He bestows upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We cannot go into detail concerning all these items.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is too much to say about them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To speak of them, we would have to mention the work of the Holy Spirit in the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Tonight we can only mention it in brief.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The coming of the Holy Spirit is not merely for conveying the Lord's work to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is also for conveying the Lord Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The purpose of the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is to convey the Lord Jesus and His work to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a man has not received the work of the Lord, the Holy Spirit conveys this work to him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a man has not received the Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit conveys the Lord Himself to man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the time we were saved, the work of the Holy Spirit was to convey the work of the Lord to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later His work is to convey the Lord Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The ministry of the Holy Spirit is to manifest the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A week ago, two sisters came to me asking me how to translate the English phrase to minister with Christ into Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a difficult phrase to translate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It means to serve others with Christ, like serving someone with a cup of tea or a bowl of rice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The work of the Holy Spirit is to serve the Lord Jesus to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we received the Lord, the Holy Spirit transferred the Lord's work to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, all the work that the Lord has accomplished, such as the gift of repentance, forgiveness, cleansing, justification, sanctification, and joy, are accomplished by the Holy Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Matters such as regeneration or the receiving of eternal life are accomplished in us through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The work of the Holy Spirit is to convey the life of the Lord Jesus to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is similar to a wire conveying electricity from the power plant at Willow Tree Creek to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through the Holy Spirit, we receive a new life, a new heart, and a new spirit cf.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>36:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we receive a new spirit and a new heart, the Lord Jesus is able to abide in us through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, regeneration is the Holy Spirit preparing a new temple for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since we are of the flesh, the Lord Jesus cannot dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are like the world under judgment at the time of Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After the water subsided, Noah released a dove from the ark Gen 8:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the dove found no place of rest; it could not abide anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the same way, we are full of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus can find no place to abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That being the case, God gave to us the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord accomplished everything objectively.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now the Holy Spirit gave us a new spirit subjectively, so that the Son of God can abide in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Holy Spirit came first to prepare a dwelling for the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then the Lord came to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the one hand, the Holy Spirit gave us a new life within.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the other hand, day by day He conveys God's truth and purpose into us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why the Lord says that when the Spirit of reality comes, He will guide us into all reality John 16:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, there is another item of the work of the Holy Spirit, which is to communicate to us the gifts, such as prophecy, tongues, healings, miracles, revelations, words of wisdom and words of knowledge, faith, and all kinds of other gifts.</S>
