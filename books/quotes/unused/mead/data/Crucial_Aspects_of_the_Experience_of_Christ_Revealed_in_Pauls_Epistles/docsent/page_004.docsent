   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO BEING FILLED WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO LIVE AND EXPRESS CHRIST Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 13:14; Col 1:27; Gen 1:26; Rom 9:21; Gal 1:14-16; 2:20; Phil 3:7-14; 1:20-21 THE CENTRAL LINE AND GOAL OF THE BIBLE BEING THE DISPENSING OF GOD INTO MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible reveals to us that God had a good pleasure in eternity past Eph 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to His good pleasure, He made a purpose in eternity v. 9 . To fulfill His eternal purpose, He planned to dispense Himself into a group of human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible calls this dispensing the economy of God Eph 1:10; 3:9; 1 Tim 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A kitchen is a place of dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, the cook must consider how many people need to be fed and what to feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When these matters have been decided, a plan will be formed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To feed people is to dispense food into them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The dispensing of food implies not only that food enters into a person but also that the food is digested and assimilated by the person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In less than one day, the food that we eat becomes part of our tissues and cells.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may be familiar with the saying, You are what you eat.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that we become what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For instance, a man who eats fish every day will eventually be constituted with fish.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He becomes fish by eating fish.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We eat, digest, and assimilate food until we are constituted with the food.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In eternity past God set up the universe as a great kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is the food in this kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In John 6:35 Jesus said, I am the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church is a dining room; we come to the meetings to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God s economy is God s dispensing of Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The central line and goal of the entire Bible are the Triune God dispensing Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to know the Bible, we must see that God wants to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>GOD BEING TRIUNE FOR HIS DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word triune, which comes from Latin, means three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Triune God is the three-one God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is three, yet He is one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is only one unique God, yet this God is three, for He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit are one God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God is triune in order to dispense Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the source, the course, and the flow, the Triune God flows into us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This flow is His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once we are saved, the Triune God flows in us every day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 2 Corinthians 13:14 Paul says, The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit are not three separate matters but three aspects of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The fellowship of the Spirit is the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When this flow is in us, the grace of Christ and the love of God are also in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, the entire Triune God is flowing in us, and we are in the central line and goal of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>CHRIST, THE MYSTERY OF GOD, BEING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the previous chapter we saw that Christ, who is the mystery of God Col 2:2 , is in us as a mystery 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ is God John 1:1, 14 , the Father Isa 9:6 , the Son Matt 3:17 , and the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because Christ embodies the entire Triune God Col 2:9 , when Christ is in us, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why Christ in us is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before a brother was saved, he may have lost his temper whenever he became upset with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He may have even enjoyed losing his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, once he is saved, the Triune God is flowing in him even when he becomes upset with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He may begin to speak something in anger but then suddenly will become silent, go to his bedroom, and begin to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Later he may repent to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>She may not understand this radical change in his conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is a mystery the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A sister may have liked to go shopping before she was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After being saved, however, she may sense a speaking within as she is browsing through a department store.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As she considers what to buy, a speaking within may tell her not to purchase certain items; it may even prompt her to leave the store.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to realize that the mystery of God is a person, Christ, who lives within us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since Christ lives in us, we are persons of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A Christian is a Christ-man, a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God desires not good men or bad men but God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A God-man is a man who has God living in him and who lives God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God wants us to live Christ, who is the mystery of God.</S>
