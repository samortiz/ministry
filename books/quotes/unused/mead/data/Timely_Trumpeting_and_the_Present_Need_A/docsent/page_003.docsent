   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE BASIC QUALIFICATIONS OF AN APOSTLE A. Having Received the Revelation concerning</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ and the Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Throughout the ages many have studied the matter of the qualifications of an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This morning we will give a simple conclusion based on the views held by various groups and according to the revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Altogether there are four qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first of these is that an apostle must be one who has received the revelation of God s New Testament economy concerning Christ and the church Matt 16:16-18; Gal 1:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first qualification of an apostle is that he must have revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He must not only have read the Bible and learned the truth; he must also be one who has received revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Bible there are many kinds of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are revelations concerning prophecies and types.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are also revelations concerning the dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But what is required of the apostles is not these kinds of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All these are secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What an apostle needs is revelation concerning the central point of God s New Testament economy, which is Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, let us see how Peter received the revelation concerning Christ and the church from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One day, while the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He took the disciples to the region of Caesarea Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There He asked the disciples, Who do you think I am?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Peter answered and said that He was the Christ, the Son of the living God Matt 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Peter received the revelation concerning Christ from the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He saw that Jesus was the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After this, the Lord gave him a further vision concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He said, On this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it v. 18 . This rock is not just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It also signifies the revelation Peter received from the Father concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church is built upon Christ and the revelation concerning Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Peter saw this complete revelation, it qualified him to become an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Again, let us see how Paul received the revelation concerning Christ and the church from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul was originally one who opposed Christ and persecuted the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One day on his way to Damascus, a great light suddenly shone on him from above.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He fell down as dead and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Acts 9:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul thought that he was persecuting the followers of Jesus, who walked in the way of the heretics.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He did not realize that to persecute these people was to persecute Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Saul could have never imagined that to persecute those ones on earth was to touch the Lord in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To Saul this was the most unique revelation in the whole universe!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By this he saw that the Lord Jesus was one with His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This vision certainly gave him a deep impression.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It affected his future ministry concerning the great mystery of God, Christ and the church, and it established a firm foundation for his unique ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although Peter received the revelation concerning Christ and the church before Paul did, what Paul saw was richer and higher than what Peter saw.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Paul s case, we also see this one indispensable qualification of an apostle: he must receive the revelation concerning Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>B. Preaching the Gospel of Christ and</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Leading to Him the Chosen and Called Sinners</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Based on the revelation that he has received, an apostle goes out to preach the gospel of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today in Christianity there are thousands of preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What they preach is mostly a gospel for sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Under this kind of gospel many of us were brought to confession, repentance, believing into Christ, and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After a while, the Lord led us to see the gospel recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not so shallow or limited; rather, it is the gospel of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This gospel is on a high standard; it is far-reaching, and even unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Through this gospel of Christ, the apostles led to Christ the sinners who were chosen from before the foundation of the earth and who are called in this age Gal 1:16a; Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Second Corinthians 11:2 says, For I betrothed you to one Husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, the gospel that the apostles preached is not merely a gospel for saving sinners, but one that brings the saved sinners to Christ in order to satisfy Him.</S>
