   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LIVING STREAM MINISTRY OFFICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Living Stream Ministry office is only a business office to serve my ministry for two things: to publish the messages in book form and to distribute these messages in both video and audio tapes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That is all the ministry office should do and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I did not have much time to check on everything related to the office in the past, but the ministry office has always had this specific function and no other function.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This little office is a Levitical service serving my ministry to put out the word of God in print and through video and audio tapes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>GOING ON UNDER THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>BY SPEAKING THE SAME THING</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>AND BY KEEPING THE ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our going on should be according to what we have seen from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There should not be any control, and the leadership is not in one controlling person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The teaching of the apostles must be the very leadership among us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all must be under the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I came to the United States, many brothers can testify that I never showed myself as a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The leading ones in the churches can testify that I never controlled any church or any saint.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I never controlled anything, and I would never control anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, I would do as much as I can to withdraw from the so-called leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I do not mean that I am withdrawing from the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have a burden from the Lord, and I must be faithful to Him and to His commission, His charge.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But be assured that I will try the best to stay away from the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all need to endeavor to speak the same thing by the Lord's mercy and grace 1 Cor 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is absolutely no heresy among us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not have any basic problems among us, so it should be easy for us to avoid speaking differently and speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Also, by His mercy, we do not have any organization.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No one can control the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No one can control anything because we do not have organization among us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not control, and the Living Stream office would not control.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Mistakes may have been made in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But let us live in today and forget about yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do not even have tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We only have today in which to live.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What happened yesterday is over.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If anything was wrong in the past, we need the cleansing blood of Christ as the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Past mistakes that have been confessed to the Lord are under the cleansing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to forget the past and go on.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not even have any expectation about what will happen tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We do not need to worry about tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We live today.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No one controls you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the local churches have the full freedom to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As long as you do not do anything against our New Testament constitution, no one would bother you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Among us in the Lord's recovery, there is nothing worth worrying about because basically we do not have any heresy or any kind of organizational control.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Everyone in every church has the full freedom to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I hope that we would be so faithful and loyal to the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should mean business with the Lord that the Lord's recovery will be prevailing and even flourishing on this earth for the Lord's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Concerning practices among us such as head covering, baptism, or preaching the gospel, we should let these things be as they are among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If some of the sisters want to wear a head covering, let them do it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If others do not, give them the liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should have this attitude with all the practices in the church life that are outside our common faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If some feel that they are burdened to visit people for the gospel, let them do it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those saints who are burdened to visit people for the gospel should not insist on this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should try to avoid different kinds of terms, slogans, and sayings, and try our best to keep the oneness in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must avoid anything that damages the freedom of the saints or the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is altogether wise and profitable that we do not expect all the churches to be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even twelve brothers within a local church cannot be the same in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If a local church has a burden to visit people in their homes for the preaching of the gospel, they should carry out this commission.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They do not need to say that others do not preach the gospel in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If others do not feel to preach the gospel by visiting people in their homes, that is not your business.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not talk about who is for this or who is for that.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should not talk in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should not label ourselves or label others.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we want to practice a certain thing, we can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If others do not want to practice it, they have the liberty not to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should not question who is for a certain thing and who is not for a certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This does not help you or anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We all must endeavor to keep the oneness of the Spirit so that the Body of Christ can build up itself in love Eph 4:3, 16 .</S>
