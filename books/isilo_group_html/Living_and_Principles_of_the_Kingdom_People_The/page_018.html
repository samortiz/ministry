<p>Prayer represents the righteous deeds of the people of the kingdom of the heavens toward God. Concerning prayer, the Lord mentioned five key points.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Praying in Secret</h2>
<p>Our prayer should be in secret. In Matthew 6:5 the Lord said, &ldquo;When you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners, so that they may be seen by men.&rdquo; To want our prayer to be seen and heard by men is of the flesh and the self. Hence, the Lord said, &ldquo;Enter into your private room, and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret&rdquo; (v. 6). Some people say that to enter into the private room and shut the door is for us to be absorbed in quiet prayer. However, the Lord&rsquo;s emphasis in verse 6 is that we should not make a show of our prayer. The kingdom of the heavens rules over us not only for us to be absorbed in prayer but for us to pray without making a show, without the flesh and the self. Many people in the church do not know the central point of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching on the mountain. His teaching emphasized the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens over us. This ruling causes us to have no flesh and no self. The Lord&rsquo;s word in verses 5 and 6 shows that even in divine things such as prayer, our flesh and self can be involved. If we can be delivered from our flesh and self in prayer, then it will be easy for us to be delivered from the flesh and self in other things.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Praying with Repeated Words</h2>
<p>People pray with repeated words because they have an intention to make a show of themselves. If a person does not want to make a show of himself, his prayer is always simple. A certain saint may pray only for two or three minutes at home, but in the meetings he stands up and prays with many words for more than ten minutes. This is proof that he has the element of making a show. There is an element of making a show in a long and repetitious prayer, because the person who prays wants to make a display before others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Principles of Prayer</h2>
<p>In verses 9 through 13 the Lord said, &ldquo;You then pray in this way: Our Father who is in the heavens, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.&rdquo; Here the Lord presented a pattern of prayer. Although many people use this as a script for prayer, reciting it whenever they need to pray, this was not the Lord&rsquo;s intention. The Lord&rsquo;s intention was to show the principles of prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Asking on God&rsquo;s Behalf</h2>
<p>The first principle of prayer is to pray on God&rsquo;s behalf. The beginning sentence in this prayer says, &ldquo;Our Father who is in the heavens, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth&rdquo; (vv. 9-10). This is a prayer offered on God&rsquo;s behalf. We need to see that the first thing in prayer is not to ask on behalf of ourselves or others but to ask on God&rsquo;s behalf. Genuine prayer asks on God&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
<p>God wants us to ask on His behalf because He still has important things that have not been accomplished on the earth. There are three things that still need to be accomplished. First, God&rsquo;s name has not been sanctified on the earth. Today people still reject and mistreat God&rsquo;s name, ranking many other gods&rsquo; names equal to God&rsquo;s name, without sanctifying His name as the uniquely holy name. Second, the kingdom of God has not yet come upon the earth, and the authority of God has not yet been brought to the earth. Today God rules in heaven but not on earth. People do not honor God&rsquo;s authority on earth. His authority will not be brought to the earth until the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ (Rev. 11:15). Third, the will of God has not yet been done on the earth, because the authority of God has not yet been brought to the earth. The will of God can be done in the heavens, but how many people on the earth care about God&rsquo;s will? How many people are obeying God&rsquo;s will?</p>
<p>These three things cannot be fulfilled on the earth because Satan is hindering and undermining them. Therefore, God needs a group of people to pray on His behalf. Such a prayer, actually, is a prayer of warfare, because this group of people rises up to deal with Satan&rsquo;s authority so that God&rsquo;s authority may be brought to the earth, that God may return to the earth to establish and reign in His kingdom, and that God&rsquo;s name may be sanctified on the earth. These can only be accomplished through warfare.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Living and Principles of the Kingdom People &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
