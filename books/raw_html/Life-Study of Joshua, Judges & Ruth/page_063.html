<h2 class="head1">I. PROMOTED BY HER MOTHER-IN-LAW</h2>
<p>In 3:1-5 we see that Ruth&rsquo;s seeking for her rest was promoted by her mother-in-law Naomi.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. To Seek Some Resting Place for Ruth</h2>
<p>In verse 1 Naomi said to Ruth, &ldquo;My daughter, I must seek some resting place for you, that it may go well with you.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Instructing Ruth What to Do</h2>
<p>Naomi instructed Ruth what to do (vv. 2-4). She told Ruth to wash herself, anoint herself, put on her best clothes, and go down to the threshing floor where Boaz, their relative, was winnowing the barley. She further instructed Ruth not to make herself known to the man until he had finished eating and drinking. Then Naomi told her to notice the place where he lies down and go there, uncover his feet, and lie down. Naomi concluded by telling her that Boaz would tell her what she should do.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Ruth&rsquo;s Obedience</h2>
<p>Ruth was obedient to her mother-in-law, saying to her, &ldquo;All that you say, I will do&rdquo; (v. 5).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. CARRIED OUT BY RUTH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. According to Her Mother-in-law&rsquo;s Charge</h2>
<p>Ruth went down to the threshing floor and did all that her mother-in-law had charged her (v. 6).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Approaching Boaz Based upon the God-ordained Way</h2>
<p>Verses 7 through 9 give an account of how Ruth approached Boaz. Her approaching him was based upon the God-ordained way (4:5; Lev. 25:25; Deut. 25:5-10).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. ACCEPTED BY BOAZ</h2>
<p>In Ruth 3:10-15 we see that Ruth was accepted by Boaz.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Boaz&rsquo;s Promise</h2>
<p>When Ruth identified herself and asked Boaz to spread his cloak over her, he said, &ldquo;Blessed be you of Jehovah, my daughter. You have shown your latter kindness to be better than your first by not going after the choice young men, whether poor or rich&rdquo; (v. 10). Then he promised to do all that she had said. He continued by explaining that although he was a kinsman, there was a kinsman closer than he. Boaz went on to say that if that other kinsman was not willing to do the kinsman&rsquo;s duty for Ruth, then he would do it for her.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Boaz&rsquo;s Generous Care</h2>
<p>In verses 14 and 15 we see Boaz&rsquo;s generous care for Ruth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. RUTH&rsquo;S REPORT TO HER MOTHER-IN-LAW</h2>
<p>According to verses 16 through 18 Ruth gave a report to her mother-in-law.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Good News</h2>
<p>Ruth reported the good news concerning all that Boaz had done for her. In particular, she spoke of the six measures of barley that he had given to her.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Mother-in-law&rsquo;s Faith</h2>
<p>Verse 18 reveals the mother-in-law&rsquo;s faith. Naomi had the faith that Boaz would not rest until he had sought rest for Ruth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. FOR THE CONTINUATION OF THE GENEALOGY<br />
TO BRING IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>If we consider Matthew 1:5-6 and 16, we will see that Ruth&rsquo;s seeking for her rest was actually for the continuation of the genealogy to bring in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE EVALUATION OF BOAZ</h2>
<p>Chapter three of Ruth presents a high evaluation of Boaz. This chapter indicates that he was high in morality (vv. 8-11), that he was pure in conduct (v. 14), that he was wise in decision (vv. 12-13), and that he was faithful in keeping God&rsquo;s ordination (Lev. 25:25; Deut. 25:5-10).</p>
