<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in 1952 in a training for all the churches in Taiwan. These messages present the proper understanding we should have and pay attention to for the meetings in the church life, particularly the proper preparation and exercise needed for the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting. They also give general guidelines for the pursuit in life. These messages were not reviewed by the speaker.</p>
