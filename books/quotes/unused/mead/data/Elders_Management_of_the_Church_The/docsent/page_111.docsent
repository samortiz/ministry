   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>M. Leading Others to Accept the Cross</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is an absolutely necessary lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is a reason for me to put this point as point number thirteen.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Up to this point, you have to help the brothers and sisters to practically, seriously, and deeply learn the lesson of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The things to deal with are the carnality, the flesh, the ambition, the haughty aspirations, and the desire to accomplish something for oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is the need for the cross to break the desire for greatness in a person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By this point, a person has somewhat become a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is a certain amount of danger and a great temptation in being a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is easy to go from being a vessel to becoming famous.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On a larger scale, a person can become renowned in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On a smaller scale, that one can become the pivotal figure in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He can manipulate the situation and can influence the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By that time, you have to help such a one to learn the lesson of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The carnality, the flesh, the ambition, the aspirations, the self-interest, and the desire to be great must all be terminated on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brothers, I have been severely taught in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I know that there is such a need here.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not do this, all the labor we have exerted in the past will again go to waste.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without the cross, points one to twelve will all be wasted, and the person will be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He will be damaged by greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You have spent so much energy and effort to perfect such a one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the end, his ambition and aspirations will cause your labor to disappear into thin air.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In addition, you will end up with one more problem in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This one has learned something; he is able to manipulate the situation and can influence everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Consider this pride, this striving for self-interest, this desire to be great, to be superficial, and to be famous.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Will it damage such a person alone?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Will it hurt him alone?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This will damage the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, up to this point, you have to learn this lesson, and you have to help him learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Otherwise, the coordination will be affected.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If there is no cross in the coordination, the church will be without any protection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As far as you are concerned, you may have the mercy to supply others the grace despite whether they are great or small.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But as far as they are concerned, they are damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And as far as the church is concerned, the loss is even greater!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, for their sake, for the church's sake, you have to help them learn the lesson of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>N. Leading Others to Learn Brokenness</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A person who has accepted the cross is not necessarily one who is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The cross solves the problems of man before man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brokenness solves the problems of man before God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our natural strength must go through God's breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The problems before men are the carnality, the flesh, the ambition and aspiration, the desire for achievement, fame, and greatness in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But even if you have solved these problems, you have to remember that the natural strength in serving the Lord must be broken by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You have to allow God to touch you deeper, to touch the hollow of your thigh, so that you would fall down.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You have to help the brothers to this stage.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Otherwise, the coordination will not be long-lasting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They can coordinate with you, but very soon they will be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For this reason, you have to help the brothers to accept the breaking and to be a person subdued before God.</S>
