<h2 class="head1">NOURISHING AND CARING FOR OTHERS<br />
BEING CRUCIAL</h2>
<p>If the people listening to our gospel are materialistic and despise spiritual things, we should not press them. When we go out to preach the gospel, unless we have much assurance, the power of the Holy Spirit, and the Lord&rsquo;s leading, it is best not to force people. The worldly people know that material things are worthless, and some religions even teach separation from the world. Hence, there is no need for us to teach this. The people we speak to may have a successful business, or they may be mature and already know that material things are worthless and that they should not be occupied by them. Hence, it is best if we do not speak about these matters.</p>
<p>Even if we have a clear leading and the spiritual authority to speak a serious word, we still must be careful how we express things. For this reason, it is best to be positive and preach the Lord Jesus. With a new one we can read Philippians 3:8, which says, &ldquo;I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ.&rdquo; There is no need to touch the fact that the new ones are materialistic and not spiritual. We should simply speak the truth to them and give the word of the truth the opportunity to shine in them and enlighten them. This will help them.</p>
<p>We should not consider saving people through knocking on doors as the most important item in our work. Instead, we should consider that visiting people to care for them and to nourish them is the most important item. We should not think that when we baptize a person, we have gained him. Baptizing a person is the same as giving birth to a child. We cannot say that our job is finished after a child is born. We must keep him alive by nourishing him. Hence, we must consider caring for people and nourishing them as the crucial items in our work. Wherever we go to spread the gospel, we must pay attention to these items.</p>
<p>If the new ones have the time, we should do our best to spend much time to speak to them. The more time we can spend with them, the better. In principle, those who work for the Lord should have time for the new ones. We should not be in a situation where we do not have enough time, especially since we are going to the towns and villages to speak to people. If a new one is available, we should be happy to spend the time to speak to him, even if we end up speaking to people from six o&rsquo;clock in the morning until six o&rsquo;clock in the evening. The people in the towns and villages are usually not very educated, but we should not despise them and think that the truth is too deep for them to understand. We must not have such a concept. It is also wrong for us to teach only deep truths. In speaking the truth, we must be progressive and not despise anyone. We must respect everyone. In order for people to be edified when we speak, we should speak normally, without adding deep points or speaking shallowly.</p>
<p>When a person says that he is already a Christian, we should learn how to use one or two sentences to find out if he is really saved. If he is genuinely saved, we should check to see if he is open to receive us. If he is not open, we should let him go. If he is open, we should meet with him, just as we meet with a new one in order to nourish and care for him. If we feel that he is not genuinely saved, we should treat him like a gospel friend and help him receive salvation.</p>
<p>We must also strengthen the Lord&rsquo;s Day meetings. If the entire team of twenty people is exercised in a meeting, the meeting will be strong. If we are not strong, we should not expect the new ones to be strong. Hence, whether or not the meetings are strong depends on us. This is very important. In a period of twenty-five days we will have at least three Lord&rsquo;s Day meetings with the new ones. We should be a pattern to the new ones in every meeting to help them function in the meetings in the future. We must not be loose in any meeting, and we should bear the responsibility in the meetings. When every team member functions, the meetings will be strong.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING THE LORD&rsquo;S WITNESSES<br />
IN JERUSALEM, JUDEA, SAMARIA, AND<br />
UNTO THE UTTERMOST PART OF THE EARTH</h2>
<p>In addition, when we go out to knock on doors, we are the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses. In Acts 1:8 the Lord said, &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; We are the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses. When we preach the gospel, we must begin with Jerusalem as our center, pass through Judea and Samaria, and then go to the uttermost part of the earth. We begin with the center and gradually make our way to the circumference. This means that when we knock on doors, we should take the meeting hall as our center and begin in the areas around the meeting hall. We should not skip the homes that are nearby and look for people who live farther away. Only after we preach the gospel in the areas around the meeting hall, which is our Jerusalem, should we go to Judea, then to Samaria, and finally to the uttermost part of the earth. In this way we will preach the gospel to every part of a town or village.</p>
