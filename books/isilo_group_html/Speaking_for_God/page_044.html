If they are not willing to read with us, then we should read a portion to them. For example, we may read to them Romans 8:2: &#8220;For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.&#8221; After the reading, we can point out to them that this verse speaks about two laws: one is the law of the Spirit of life and the other is the law of sin and of death. They might respond by saying, &#8220;I do not care for either law; neither do I understand such things.&#8221; At this moment we should not be discouraged. Although they may say something in this way, the Lord&#8217;s word has already been &#8220;injected&#8221; into them. After we leave, it is very possible that they would think, &#8220;The Bible says that the law of the Spirit of life has freed me from the law of sin and of death; this is quite marvelous.&#8221; The Lord will give them the light as they recall the word.<p>However, maybe when we see them again, they are still acting stubborn, showing no sign that they agree with us. We should nonetheless give them another &#8220;shot&#8221; of the Lord&#8217;s word, perhaps reading to them John 5:24, where the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life.&#8221; Most people do not like to hear such words as &#8220;judgment&#8221; and &#8220;out of death into life,&#8221; but we can tell them that the Lord Jesus said that if we would believe in Him, we would have eternal life and would not come into judgment but would pass out of death into life. People may seem to refuse to listen, but at least these divine words have already entered into them. If the person hearing these words is your father, he might think, &#8220;It does not seem too bad that my child believes in such a religion. It&#8217;s incredible that he can actually speak such words as &#8216;the law of the Spirit of life,&#8217; &#8216;the law of sin and of death,&#8217; and &#8216;eternal life.&#8217;&#8221; Once he begins to consider in this way, he affords the Holy Spirit the opportunity to work in him.<p>If you go to speak to your father the third time, it is quite likely that this time he will have a turn and say, &#8220;Every time you have come home, what you have spoken to me has not been bad. It seems that this Bible has some real things in it after all.&#8221; This then would open the door for him to believe. Then you have to bring out more treasure. For example, you may introduce to him the booklet titled Three Lives and Four Laws and ask him to read it. Do not think that it is too deep and not suitable for the preaching of the gospel. We have to see that the whole Bible is the gospel. If your father would read the booklet, the Holy Spirit would have the opportunity to take a further step in him, causing him to feel that what the Bible teaches is something wonderful which he had never heard before. He would discover that when man was created, he received the life of man; when he became fallen, he received the life of Satan; and when he was saved, he received the life of God. Furthermore, there are four laws. In addition to the law of God, every life has a law in it. When your father reads this, his heart will be softened and will change its direction. At that moment you can lead him to pray.<p>Do not just tell people, &#8220;Believing in Jesus is so good! Everyone is sinful, and he who does not believe in Jesus will go to hell.&#8221; If we only speak such things, then people will be disgusted and will have a negative reaction; besides, these things are too low and shallow. Therefore, we have to learn the truth so that we can speak God&#8217;s word outside of the meetings to the unbelievers. This depends on whether or not we have the burden and whether or not we have the heart to do it. If we have the heart, then the more we do it, the more we will have the burden. The more burden we have, the more results we will have, and the more results we have, the more we will be encouraged. To preach the gospel and bring people to salvation is not too difficult a matter. This requires us to learn the truth and to learn to speak outside of the meetings to the unbelievers.<p>The working saints all have many colleagues, so they have many opportunities to speak. Therefore, it is best for them to have in their pockets a small Bible, some gospel tracts, some gospel booklets, or some simple spiritual booklets, so that whenever there is a need, they can be used. We should not simply say that the Lord Jesus is wonderful, and that believing in the Lord Jesus will give people peace. Rather, we must begin with the truth. We should use the truth as the starting point and show people the truth. The truths in the Bible are the highest. No human philosophy can compare with the Bible. However, we have to learn to dig out these treasures from the Bible. Then in our daily living when there are suitable opportunities, perhaps during the noontime break or maybe after office hours, we can speak to one of our colleagues, and we can also open our Bible and read a portion to him. If he is receptive, we can give him a small booklet to read at home. We should not ask him about it the very next day; rather, we should wait for three or five days and then give him a Bible verse, again in a relaxed manner. If we work in this way persistently, people will believe in the Lord.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Speaking for God &nbsp; pg 44</div><br></body></html>
