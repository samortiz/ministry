(Gal. 5:25)<p>But I say, Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these oppose each other that you would not do the things that you desire. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. (vv. 16-18)<p>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control; against such things there is no law. (vv. 22-23)<p>Here the fruit of the Spirit is singular. There are not nine kinds of fruits but one kind of fruit with nine aspects.<p>For he who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life. (6:8)<p>Brothers, even if a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness. (v. 1)<p>However, brothers and sisters, how can Christ live in us? And how can He be formed in us? This is altogether a matter of the spirit and is carried out by the Spirit of life in us. We have been born of the Spirit. By this birth God caused the Spirit of His Son, the Spirit of Christ, even Christ Himself, to come into us. Since we have been born of the Spirit, we should live and walk by the Spirit. In this way we afford the Spirit the opportunity to spread from within us so that every part of our being is filled with the Spirit. Hence, Ephesians 4:23 uses the phrase the spirit of your mind. This means that the Spirit has entered our mind to become the Spirit in our mind. Since the mind, which is the leading part of the soul, has the Spirit, the emotion and will also will have the Spirit. In this way the Spirit is being formed in our entire being. This is altogether the story of the Spirit.<p>Therefore, the key to Galatians lies with walking by the Spirit. When you walk by the Spirit, you give the ground to Christ. When you walk by the Spirit, you allow Christ to possess you. When you walk by the Spirit, your inward being is given over to Christ little by little. You cannot simply say that Christ lives in us and is being formed in us; this is just a doctrinal truth. How does Christ live in you? How is He being formed in you? The subjective experience lies with the spirit in you. You must know how to follow this Spirit and how to apply this Spirit. Therefore, sometimes in Galatians this Spirit is not called the Holy Spirit but simply the Spirit, because this Spirit in us is in our spirit formed of two spirits. At this time this spirit is, on the one hand, the Holy Spirit, and on the other hand, our spirit.<p>The apostle said that if we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. As we live by the Spirit, the Spirit lives in us, and out of this Spirit comes fruit in many aspects. This fruit is Christ Himself. Nine aspects of this fruit are mentioned in Galatians. Actually, there are more than just nine aspects, but only nine aspects are listed as illustrations.<p>The apostle also exhorted us that since this is the case, we should learn to sow unto the Spirit. Whatever we do, we should do it unto this Spirit. Eventually, we will reap life. We do not have to wait until the future, in eternity, to enjoy eternal life. Rather, today we can reap eternal life. However, if we sow unto the flesh, we will reap corruption, which is death. The utterance of Galatians 6:8 is very similar to that of Romans 8:6.<p>Galatians 6:1 gives us an illustration. It says that when we try to restore a brother, we should exercise a spirit of meekness. In Greek it says that you should restore your brother &#8220;in a spirit of meekness.&#8221; Hence, at this time, your mind is in the spirit, your action is in the spirit, your fellowship with the brothers and sisters is in the spirit, and even your restoration of a brother is in the spirit. As a result, you are a spiritual man.<h2 class=head1>DEALING WITH THE FLESH BY THE CROSS THAT THE SPIRIT MAY HAVE GROUND</h2><p>The book of Galatians shows us, on the negative side, that we should not keep the law, that we have died to the law. On the positive side, it shows us that Christ lives in us and is being formed in us. The law is joined to the flesh, whereas Christ is joined to the Holy Spirit. Whenever you keep the law, that is in the flesh; whenever you live out Christ, that is in the Holy Spirit. Therefore, Galatians also refers to the cross. The cross is for us to deal with the flesh and live in the Holy Spirit. They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts. This is not merely a doctrine but an experience. I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live. I have been terminated. Not only in committing sins there is no &#8220;I&#8221; and there is no ground for &#8220;I,&#8221; but even in doing good there is also no &#8220;I&#8221; and there is no ground for &#8220;I.&#8221; This &#8220;I&#8221; has died on the cross; this self is on the cross; this flesh is on the cross. I know the cross; the cross deals not only with the bad &#8220;I&#8221; but also with the good &#8220;I.&#8221; I have been crucified with Christ. They who are of Christ have crucified the flesh.<p>The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me&#8221; (Matt. 16:24). To deny the self is to put your self on the cross. Whenever your self wants to do good, you should put your self on the cross. Whenever your self tries to be patient, you should put your patient self on the cross. As long as you are willing to put your self on the cross, the Lord Jesus as the living Spirit will have the ground in you.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Spirit in the Epistles &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
