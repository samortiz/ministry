   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BAPTISM Scripture Reading: Mark 16:16; Acts 2:37-38; 22:16; Rom 6:3-4; Col 2:12; 1 Pet 3:20-21; 1 Cor 10:1-2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must consider the matter of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In general, people have a wrong concept concerning believing in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They think that believing alone is sufficient for salvation and that baptism is of little importance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nevertheless, the Bible shows that baptism and salvation are related.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>SEEING THE IMPORTANCE OF BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>FROM THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible regards the matter of baptism very highly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord clearly said, He who believes and is baptized shall be saved Mark 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order for a person to be saved, he needs to believe and be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At Pentecost, when the people heard the word of Peter, they were pricked in their heart, and they asked what they should do.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Peter answered, Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit Acts 2:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Baptism is related to the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Later Ananias said to Paul, Rise up and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on His name 22:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shows that baptism is related to the washing away of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the matter of Paul s baptism, the Bible confirms that Paul rose up and was baptized 9:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, according to Romans 6:3-4, we are baptized into the Lord s death and are buried and resurrected with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First Peter 3:20-21 and 1 Corinthians 10:1-2 both associate salvation with water, not merely with blood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, baptism is related to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the Bible, whenever someone receives the Lord through the preaching of the gospel, we need to tell him to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>BELIEVING AND BEING BAPTIZED</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>MAKING SALVATION COMPLETE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let me give an example to show that salvation is related to baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A believer who had a university education once questioned me, saying, I have been told that I was only half saved because I have not been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How can we have only a half salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I answered, The salvation we obtain depends on the salvation we receive.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I then asked him what led him to realize his need for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He said that he realized that he had a problem with sins and with the weakness of his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He indicated there were other problems, but he could not articulate them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I mentioned such matters as the world, culture, and customs, he admitted that they also were problems.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then I told him that he needed salvation from sins, the flesh, and the world, and only when these problems were dealt with would his salvation be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I asked him which of these problems had been solved, he could only say that his sins had been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The problems related to the weakness of his flesh and the world had not been solved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I said, In this case, you are not even half saved, but merely one-third saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I told him that he had received only a minimal salvation and that he needed to receive more of the Lord s provision for salvation in order for his salvation to be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Receiving the forgiveness of sins by believing is the first step in salvation, but receiving salvation from the flesh and the world by being baptized is a further step.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not sufficient to receive salvation merely by believing, we still need to receive the salvation that is related to baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Just as there is an aspect of salvation related to believing, there is an aspect related to baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only through these two steps can we have a complete salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>BAPTISM BEING A BURIAL</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THAT SEPARATES US FROM THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In God s salvation there is an element related to death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only a dead person does not sin because death terminates his ability to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Death is the termination of sin just as death is the termination of debt.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although death is terrifying to many, it is truly wonderful in God s salvation because our death in Christ terminates all our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>People are enslaved to sin and experience various sufferings because they are alive.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But with death, everything is terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, death completely solves their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Death is a part of God s salvation in order to deal with all our unsolvable problems.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God saves us not only by the life of Christ but also by the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Romans 6:3-4 says, Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ s death solves our problems, and the meaning of baptism is death, that is, burial.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because we have believed into the Lord, we have died with the Lord Jesus, and because we have died with the Lord, we need to be buried with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Baptism is our burial with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When a person dies and is buried, he is spontaneously freed from the darkness of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Baptism is not a ritual; rather, it is a burial.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The waters of baptism forever separate us from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>BAPTISM BEING THE GREATEST</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>AND THE MOST THOROUGH DELIVERANCE</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Baptism is the greatest and the most thorough deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>With the blood we escape God s wrath, and with the water we are separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The blood of the Passover lamb enabled the Israelites to escape God s wrath, but they were freed from the usurpation of Egypt and Pharaoh, that is, the bondage of the world and Satan, only when they crossed the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we receive the Lord by confessing our sins and repenting, we receive salvation by the blood; when we are baptized, we are delivered from the bondage of the world and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Noah was saved by being in the ark, but his whole family also was moved from a world that opposed God to another kingdom through the flood waters.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Noah was saved by the ark and also by the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Those who have been baptized are the same as Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Having passed through baptism, we have been delivered from numerous forms of bondage, whether these forms involve sins, weaknesses, sicknesses, habits, frustrations, or anxieties.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Complete deliverance involves both death and burial; this is the significance of baptism.</S>
