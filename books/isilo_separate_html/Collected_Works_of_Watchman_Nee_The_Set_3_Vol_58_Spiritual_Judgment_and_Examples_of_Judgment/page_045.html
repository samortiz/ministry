S.</h2><p>I was raised in a non-Christian family. First, my mother heard the gospel and believed in the Lord. Then, I was saved through a sister who preached John 3:16 to me. Later a sister introduced me to the publications of the Shanghai Gospel Book Room. After I read them, I realized that denominationalism is wrong, and I left the Baptist Church. I worked in the villages for eight years and brought some people to the Lord. Later I became sick from a tumor in my belly. A doctor operated and told me that I was in grave danger. At that time I felt lonely, and I wanted to die. I did not want to wait to be raptured. When a person is about to die, he loses all desire for anything. In desperation I gave up on myself and committed myself to the Lord. He was merciful to me. I stayed in the hospital for fifty days. The day I was discharged from the hospital, I was like a person walking out of the grave. The glory of God was manifested. During the past few years I have suffered much but have not learned enough lessons. Although I have covered my head outwardly, my head is not covered inwardly. By nature I am an active and outgoing person. Recently, the Lord arranged for me to come to Foochow, Fukien, and I handed myself over. When I found out that I could participate in this training, I seemed to find my support and my trust once again.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>You have wasted too much time in the past. I hope that from now on, you will take the straight course. If you want to receive God's grace directly and definitely, you have to follow the footsteps of the flock. This will do you good and will save you much time. If a man only contacts the Lord directly and will not receive any help from the church, his pathway is individualistic. Those who take an individualistic pathway often end up with curses. Of course, as long as one learns some lessons, his time is not wasted entirely. You have to remember Moses' word, that a curse can be turned into a blessing. You have to ask the Lord to turn the curses into blessings. It is the Lord's mercy that you are preserved up to this day. In the coming days if you will give yourself to serve in the church, your pathway will be shortened and you will be spared many unnecessary detours. The church is the Body of Christ, and you have to submit to it. Otherwise, you still will have a long way to go. You have to learn to accept the judgment of the Body.</p><p>The judgment of the Body is much more trustworthy than our own judgment. When we fall into darkness individually and are short of light, we can find light in the Body and in the Holy of Holies. To many people the knowledge of the Body is nothing more than a doctrine; there is little practical testimony. We, however, have to learn the lesson of submission in the Body. We are all middle-aged now. We can no longer waste our time on inconsequential things. We have to accomplish much within a short time. We need the Lord as much now as we did the first day we met Him.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> </body></html>
