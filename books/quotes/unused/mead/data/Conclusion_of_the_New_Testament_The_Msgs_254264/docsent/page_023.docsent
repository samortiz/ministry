   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being the Foundation for the Building Up of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to Ephesians 2:20 the apostles, along with the prophets, are the foundation for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse says, "Being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The foundation of the church is Christ 1 Cor 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since the mystery of Christ has been revealed to the apostles Eph 3:5-6 , the revelation they received is considered the foundation upon which the church is built.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This corresponds to the rock in Matthew 16:18, which is not only Christ but also the revelation concerning Christ, upon which Christ will build His church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, the foundation of the apostles and prophets is not the apostles and prophets themselves but the revelation they received for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is in contrast to Revelation 21:14, where the foundations are the very persons of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Being Twelve Precious Stones</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The foundation of the holy city consists of twelve precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation, jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst" Rev 21:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Precious stones are not created but transformed from things created.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the apostles were created pieces of clay, but they were transformed into precious stones for God's eternal building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This regeneration and transformation is required for every believer who will be a part of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The colors of the twelve precious stones of the foundation, which signify the twelve apostles, are as follows: the first is green, the second and third are blue, the fourth is green, the fifth and sixth are red, the seventh is yellow, the eighth is bluish-green, the ninth is yellow, the tenth is apple-green, the eleventh and twelfth are purple.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The twelve layers of the foundation in the above colors give the appearance of a rainbow, signifying that the city is built upon and secured by God's faithfulness in keeping His covenant Gen 9:8-17 . a. Produced by the Transforming Work of the Lord the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was through the transforming work of the Lord the Spirit that Peter and then the other apostles were transformed into precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When Peter, the first of the twelve apostles, was brought to the Lord, He changed his name to "a stone" John 1:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Later, the Lord called him by this name when He spoke to him concerning the building of His church Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Gradually, Peter and the others were transformed by the Lord the Spirit into the embodiment of God's all-inclusive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul speaks of the Lord the Spirit in 2 Corinthians 3:18.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord the Spirit may be considered a compound title like Jehovah God, Father God, Lord Jesus, Jesus Christ, and Lord Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord the Spirit is the One who does the work of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we have not seen that today the Lord Jesus is the life-giving Spirit as the Lord the Spirit, we will not experience His transforming work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, if we know that our Lord Jesus Christ is the life-giving Spirit and call on Him, saying "O Lord Spirit," we will enjoy His transforming work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we would experience transformation, the Lord must be subjective to us as well as objective.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The three matters of enjoying, experiencing, and expressing the processed Triune God are all subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Enjoying Christ as the bread of life is also a subjective matter, for this involves eating the Lord, and eating is surely subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The enjoyment of Christ as the bread of life is a matter that is altogether subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord the Spirit makes everything of Christ subjective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we contact Him by calling on Him, He transforms us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He transforms us by dispensing His divine element into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The result of this dispensing is not an outward, corrective change but an inward, metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even though our experience may be limited, we can testify from experience to the reality of the transforming work of the Lord Spirit.</S>
