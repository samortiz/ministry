   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now we come to the topic of the Sabbath day and the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a great topic in the church, and for many years the saints have contended concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We will first look at the Sabbath day and then the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We will examine these two days together because one replaces the other.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although these days are related to one another in the Bible, they are two different days, just as the law and grace are two different matters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to consider the two days together in order to see the distinction between them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE SABBATH DAY</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to look at some important portions of the Scriptures concerning the Sabbath, which can be divided into eleven categories.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Creation</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the seventh day God finished His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it Gen 2:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After God created all things in six days, He rested from His work on the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He also blessed and sanctified the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God rested on this day, and He blessed and sanctified this day because His work in creation was complete.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since He had obtained what He wanted, His heart was satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, He rested from His work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In His rest and satisfaction He blessed this day and separated it from the other days, making it a special day, a sanctified day.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, He made the seventh day a day of rest, blessing, and separation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God especially obtained rest and satisfaction on the seventh day because of the creation of man, who is at the center of His heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God s eternal heart s desire and purpose are to obtain a man to express Him and to exercise His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>With the creation of man in His image and likeness, God had such a man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, His heart was satisfied, and He could rest; consequently, He blessed this day to make it holy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When God rested on the seventh day, He was not the only one who was resting; the man whom He created to express Him was resting as well.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This day of rest was the seventh day for God, because God worked for six days and rested on the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, it was the first day for man, because after man was created on the sixth day, he immediately entered into rest on the Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God worked for six days and rested on the Sabbath, but man did not need to do any work because God s work was done, and he could simply enter into God s enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To enjoy His rest, God had to work, but man did not have to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Man could simply enjoy the rest obtained through God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In His rest God enjoyed the man whom He created, and man enjoyed God and all the things God created.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This was a rest for God after His labor, but it was simply rest to man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Man obtained rest as the result of God s labor.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the significance of the rest in creation and also the implication of the Bible s first speaking concerning the Sabbath day rest.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This speaks forth God s original will for man, which does not require man to labor before he can enjoy rest; rather, God wants man to enjoy the rest that is produced as the result of His labor.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This reflects the principle of grace, which is very different from the principle of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The principle of the law is that man must first work before he can rest; the principle of grace is that man needs to rest before he can work.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Sabbath ordained in creation shows this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Man does not have to do anything, and he can enjoy God s rest because God has accomplished everything.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When man was created, everything he needed was provided.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God created and prepared everything that man needed, whether it was air, light, water, or food.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Man did not need to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When he was created, everything was ready for him to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This was God s original intention for man, and it was completely according to the principle of grace.</S>
