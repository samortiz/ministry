   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Everything related to us has to be turned: our study, schooling, marriage, family life, relationships with friends, relationships with relatives, spending of money, clothing, thinking, decisions, motives, intents, and every other thing.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Everything related to us within and without must be turned to God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the real meaning of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must have a thorough change in our life, a U-turn in our whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the preaching of the gospel, we all have to learn the lesson to help people take this kind of U-turn.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How much we repent depends on how much we have turned.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some Christians indeed have a certain kind of repentance, but they turn only a little; they have only a little change.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A brother may have some change, but to what degree?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Has he turned 45 degrees, 90 degrees, or 180 degrees?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some turn a full 360 degrees, turning around to be the same as before.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need a 180 degree turn, a real U-turn back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How much we are able to help others depends on how much we have turned, that is, how much we have repented.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not complain if the new converts are not strong in the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to criticize ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is hard for weak parents to bring forth strong children.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The health of the children depends very much on the parents.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the matter of gospel preaching, we all have to learn and be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I worship the Lord in these days because I realize that not only are the brothers and sisters doing the work of preaching, but they are being dealt with by the Lord and learning the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a brother quarrels with someone, can he go out after that to preach the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a brother lies to someone during the day, can he preach the gospel in the evening?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His power will be gone, and his mouth will be shut up by his lie.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His conscience knows, and the evil spirit knows.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When he goes to open his mouth to testify for Jesus, the enemy will say, "You are a liar," and his mouth will be shut.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to preach, you have to confess your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You have to deal with your lies, and you have to be dealt with by the Lord in this very specific matter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then your conscience will be clean.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You will have the freedom, and you will have the boldness to say something for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To preach the gospel requires us to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is easy to be used by the Lord to speak a word of edification, but it is not easy to speak a word of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you are going to preach the gospel, you have to be dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How can you help someone to repent with a 180 degree turn if you do not turn in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is impossible to have only a 45 degree turn and ask people to have a 180 degree turn.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we ourselves have not turned to such a degree, how can we help people to repent?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, if we cannot help people to turn 180 degrees back to God, we have done a poor job of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to help people to have a full, thorough repentance toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many people when they repented have said, "Lord, from this day my thoughts turn to You.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>My family life turns to You.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>My business, my job, my schooling, my friendships, even my driving, and everything turn to You.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whatever I have, whatever I do, whatever I can do, and whatever I am, I turn all these to You."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As a person believing in Christ, you have to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Otherwise, something dirty or sinful in the eyes of God still remains in you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That poisons the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You have to clear up what you have been, what you have been doing, and how you have been living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a real and thorough repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This kind of repentance is an uprooting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It uproots you from this sinful world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our life and living have been too rooted in this sinful world.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now we have to uproot our living out of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Real repentance is an uprooting out of this earth, out of this sinful world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need such a repentance toward God, and we need to help others to realize such a repentance.</S>
