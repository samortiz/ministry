   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Swatow, Kwangtung Province</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since last month the political situation has been tense at times and relaxed at times.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Swatow was bombed last month, and the brothers and sisters were scattered to inland areas.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are still about thirty people remaining in Swatow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord has preserved them, and they are safe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The prayer meeting and the Lord's Day morning meeting are as usual, but the number is significantly smaller.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to mention one particular incident of the protection of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A sister named Liu was on a steamboat that was shot by machine guns from an airplane.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that time there were two brothers, the one sister, and many other people on the boat.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One brother saw stray bullets falling into the water beside him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Another brother's clothes were pierced by bullets.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet all of them were safe, and the people in the boat were also safe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During the past one or two years God has been stretching His gracious hand to protect His children everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are full of thanksgiving and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Enclosed please find X dollars, which are a cumulative amount received from the offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Please distribute it for us according to need.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It has been distributed to needy saints in other provinces Editor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brothers in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Chai Gi-chen, Hsie Tse-shun, Chen Wen-kwang, and</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Chen Fang-ching</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>June 13</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>1 "The Dynamics of Service" column is still suspended in this issue.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are too many obstacles in mail delivery, and it is hard to get anything thick through.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In some places we can only send a copy as an ordinary letter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2 From the news in this issue, we find that Brother Ji Dun-wu of Ch'ang-sha and Brother Zhang Gun-jih of Tung-Ping have slept in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The two of them have indeed left the world to be with the Lord and have rested from their labor.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There are two less Christians on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We cannot help but feel sad at such a thought!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although Brother Ji has passed away, his family is still able to manage itself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But Brother Zhang has left behind a widow and orphans living in strange lands.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is the need of brothers and sisters in the Lord to care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"This is pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>May we sympathize with God's heart!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>3 We have found ways to send money to northern Kiangsu now.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In some places we can even wire money.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>4 Presently, only Brothers Hsu Jung-jieh and Hu Yi-min are working at the border of Yunnan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I can say that many have paid attention to their work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But as far as I know, the hardship of the work and the struggles of the workers in northern Kiangsu, west Hunan, east Chekiang, and the border regions between Chekiang and Fukien are no less strenuous than the work in the frontier regions.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I hope that our attention would not be turned to one direction alone.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our offering and prayer should not be directed by reports alone but by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>5 I have said again and again that I am only distributing money for the work or for needy saints in a fiduciary capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although the money passes through my hands, it has nothing to do with me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to make this more clear, let me state: It is not my money but the Lord's money.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The giver and the receiver are related to the Lord alone.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May both sides receive blessing from the Lord.</S>
