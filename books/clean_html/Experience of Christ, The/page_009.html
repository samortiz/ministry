<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ONE IN SOUL BY THE SPIRIT OF JESUS</H2><P>The first two chapters of Philippians are related to the Spirit of Jesus, and the last two are related to the Spirit of Christ. Chapters one and two are related not to resurrection, but to Jesus. But chapters three and four are related to resurrection. For example, Philippians 3:10 says, "To know him and the power of his resurrection" (Gk.). Furthermore, Philippians 4:13 says, "I can do all things in him who empowers me" (Gk.). This is the Spirit of Christ, who is related to resurrection. In the first chapter of Philippians we have the preaching of the gospel. To preach the gospel we need the Spirit of Jesus. The Spirit of Jesus is clearly portrayed in the first two chapters. The Spirit of Jesus does not strive, and it has no rivalry or enmity. When Jesus, the Nazarene, was on earth, He did not have any envy, strife, or rivalry. These three negative things are mentioned in chapter one. In this chapter there are also some positive things, such as the fellowship and the matter of being in one spirit and one soul. How can we have one spirit and one soul? This is not possible by our spirit, for our spirit is a spirit of envy. When we see others taking the lead, we are envious. Then we begin to strive in the spirit of rivalry. Although our spirit is like this, the Spirit of Jesus is not. Consider the life of Jesus as presented in the Gospels. His life was a life without envy, strife, or rivalry. To be one in spirit and in soul is possible only in the Spirit of Jesus.</P><P>To be one soul mainly means to be one mind. The reason Christians cannot be one soul is that each desires to be first and that no one is willing to be last. But it is possible for us to be one soul by the Spirit of Jesus. If we say, "I want to be in the Spirit of Jesus," we shall immediately have the experience of Christ and be one spirit and one soul with others. Then we shall strive together for the gospel. The word "together" in Philippians 1:27 means that we are coordinated and that we are not individualistic, but corporate. When we are all in the Spirit of Jesus and are in one soul, we shall strive together.</P><P>Although the first chapter of Philippians is rather long, it may be outlined quite simply. This chapter is concerned with the fellowship in the gospel by the Spirit of Jesus without envy, strife, or rivalry. It is in this way that we experience Christ. It is not simply a matter of clearing the past, consecrating ourselves, or caring for the inner anointing. That is not the way from the Body to the Head. In order to reach the Head, we need the fellowship in the gospel by the Spirit of Jesus without envy, strife, or rivalry. In our gospel-preaching life there should be no envy, strife, or rivalry, not even with the opposers. Instead, we should simply preach the gospel by the Spirit of Jesus. But as long as there is the slightest bit of rivalry, we cannot be in the Spirit of Jesus. Moreover, if we are not in the Spirit of Jesus, we are not in the fellowship of the gospel, and we are through with the experience of Christ. To experience Christ we need the fellowship in the gospel by the Spirit of Jesus without envy, strife, or rivalry.</P>
