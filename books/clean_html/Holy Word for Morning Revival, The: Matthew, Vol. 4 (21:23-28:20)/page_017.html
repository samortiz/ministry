<p class="bold">WEEK 18 — DAY 2</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 25:6-13</h2><p class="bold">6 &nbsp;But at <sup>1</sup>midnight there was a <sup>2</sup>cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Go forth to <sup>3</sup>meet him!</p> <p class="bold">7 &nbsp;Then all those virgins <sup>1</sup>arose and <sup>2</sup>trimmed their own lamps.</p> <p class="bold">8 &nbsp;And the foolish said to the prudent, <sup>1</sup>Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are <sup>2</sup>going out.</p> <p class="bold">9 &nbsp;But the prudent answered, saying, Perhaps there will <sup>1</sup>not be enough for us and for you; go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.</p> <p>10 &nbsp;And as they were going away to buy, the bridegroom came; and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast. And the door was shut.</p> <p>11 &nbsp;And later the rest of the virgins came also, saying, Lord, lord, open to us!</p> <p>12 &nbsp;But he answered and said, Truly I say to you, I do not know you.</p><p>13 &nbsp;Watch therefore, for you do not know the day nor the hour.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>6<sup>1</sup> Midnight signifies the darkest time of this dark age (night). That time will be the end of this age, the time of the great tribulation.</p><p>6<sup>2</sup> This cry signifies the voice of the archangel (1 Thes. 4:16).</p><p>6<sup>3</sup> A word different from meet in v. 1. The word in v. 1 refers to meeting someone alone and in secret, whereas the word here refers to meeting someone openly according to plan and ceremony.</p><p>7<sup>1</sup> Arose signifies resurrection from the dead (1 Thes. 4:14). This is the resurrection predicted in 1 Thes. 4:16 and 1 Cor. 15:52.</p><p>7<sup>2</sup> Lit., adorned. Trimmed their own lamps signifies the virgins’ dealing with the testimony in their living. This indicates that after we are resurrected, our living for the Lord’s testimony still needs to be dealt with if it has not been perfected before we die.</p><p>8<sup>1</sup> This word implies that even after they are resurrected, the foolish believers will still need the filling of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>8<sup>2</sup> Going out proves that the lamps of the foolish virgins were lighted; they contained some oil but did not have an adequate supply. The foolish virgins represent the believers who are regenerated with the Spirit of God and indwelt by the Spirit of God, but who have not been filled with Him sufficiently to have their whole being saturated with Him.</p><p>9<sup>1</sup> No one can obtain the filling of the Holy Spirit for others.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>The prudent virgins told the foolish ones to go to those who sell and buy for themselves [v. 9]. Those who sell oil must be the two witnesses [Moses and Elijah] who appear during the great tribulation, the two olive trees and the two sons of oil (Rev. 11:3-4 and notes; Zech. 4:11-14). [They] will come to help God’s people.</p><p>Buy [in verse 9] indicates that a price must be paid. Having the filling of the Holy Spirit is at a cost, such as giving up the world, dealing with self, loving the Lord above all, and counting all things loss for Christ. If we do not pay this price today, we will have to pay it after we are resurrected. Those who do not pay the price do not have the extra portion of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>The word came [in verse 10] refers to the Lord’s coming to the air (1 Thes. 4:16), a part of His coming (parousia). Those who are ready must be those who are invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb (Rev. 19:9 and note 1).</p><p>Not know [in verse 12] carries the sense of not recognize, not approve, as in Luke 13:25. The foolish virgins had their lamps lighted, went forth to meet the Lord, died, and were resurrected and raptured, but were late in paying the price for the filling of the Holy Spirit. Because of this the Lord would not recognize them, approve them, for participation in His wedding feast. They miss this dispensational reward but do not lose their eternal salvation.
