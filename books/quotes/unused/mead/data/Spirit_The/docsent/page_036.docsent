   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>For Inscribing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul told the Corinthians in 2 Corinthians 3:3 that they were a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This shows that the Spirit is for inscribing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit is not the person who inscribes, but the ink with which the apostles inscribed Christ into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we write with ink, the ink is applied to the paper and becomes one with the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit is the ink with which the servants of God are inscribing us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that the divine element is being added to our being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are receiving more heavenly, divine ink every day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have the consciousness that while I am ministering to the saints, I am inscribing Christ in their hearts, and they are receiving more of the Spirit as the ink.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we receive the Spirit as the ink, all the things compounded in the Spirit Christ s divinity, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension are added into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All of these elements are compounded in the divine ink, and the divine ink as the divine element is applied to us by the servants of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Ministering</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to 2 Corinthians 3:6 and 8, the Spirit has the function of ministering.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This function is similar to the function of a waiter who ministers food to people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Holy Spirit today is ministering the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is the very food which the ministering Spirit ministers to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Giving Life</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The ministering of Christ to us gives us life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Spirit functions to give life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Second Corinthians 3:6b says, The Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First Corinthians 15:45b says, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The last Adam is the person of the resurrected Christ to give life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit gives the divine life, the compounded Triune God as life, to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Being the Lord and Freeing the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>from the Veil of the Law</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, The Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Spirit s function is to be the Lord and also to free us from the veil, the covering, of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The veil of the law is the law itself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As long as we keep the law, the law is a veil that covers us from seeing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit functions to free us from the covering of the law that we may have an unveiled face to behold Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Transforming</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second Corinthians 3:18 reveals that the Spirit is the transforming Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Spirit functions to free us from the covering of the law that we may have an unveiled face to look at the very Christ face-to-face so that we might be transformed into His image of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>While the Spirit, who is the Lord Himself, is freeing us from the covering of the law to help us to have an unveiled face, He is also transforming us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Spirit adds Himself to us, and this addition of the Spirit, through a divine and spiritual metabolism, transforms us into another form.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we were under the law, we were in our old being, an old and natural form.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the freeing Spirit adds the new element of the divine Being into our being, causing a divine metabolism within us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the one hand, the new element of God is being added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the other hand, the old element of our old being is being discharged from us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we are transformed into the glorious image of Christ, and this transformation is from the Lord Spirit 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Mingling</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Second Corinthians 4:13 says that we have the same spirit of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This spirit is God s Spirit mingled with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, another function of the Spirit is to mingle Himself with the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The thought of the mingled spirit is very strong here and in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Paul tells us to walk according to the spirit in Romans 8:4, he is referring to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Both Dean Alford and M. R. Vincent point out that the spirit of faith in 2 Corinthians 4:13 is the mingling of the Holy Spirit with our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The compounded, consummated Spirit of God today has the function of mingling Himself with the human spirit.</S>
