   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>STRESSING THE CHILDREN S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we open our homes, we should also preach the gospel to the children, because almost every household has children.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are not enough children in the children s meeting in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are only four to five hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The elders said that the children have either grown up, or they are still too young.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, this is not a good reason.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not neglect the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We fellowshipped about the children s work eighteen years ago in 1966.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If there were ten thousand children between the ages of six and twelve at that time, today there should be ten thousand young adults between the ages of twenty-four and thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If they are not all saved, at least six thousand of them should be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our labor in the church life is a long-term endeavor.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to lead our children to salvation, and we also need to gain the children of our relatives and neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This requires the coordination and participation of many saints.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We cannot rely on the meeting halls; rather, we must labor in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The saints with large homes can have a meeting with twenty children.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The saints with smaller homes should have fewer children.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If there are not enough adults to teach the children, the saints who are in high school and college can help.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may need fifty homes in order to gain one thousand children.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the number of children increases to four thousand, we will need two hundred classes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even though the parents of some of the children may not be in our meetings, they may like to have their children join the children s meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This will give us the opportunity to gain the parents through their children.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we practice this, after a few years we may have ten thousand children in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After eight to ten years these children will be seeds for the spread of the gospel in junior high and high school and even in college.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the way for us to multiply and gain thousands of new ones every year.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The gospel work among the children needs the cooperation of the families and the young saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We also need some co-workers to coordinate the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>EXPANDING THE GOSPEL TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Another way to gain people is through the gospel work on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This depends on the participation of the full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It would be good to have three hundred full-timers, who are between the ages of twenty-five and forty, to preach the gospel on various campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Taipei there are around 120,000 university students, 80,000 technical college students, 60,000 high school students, and over 100,000 junior high students.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a total of over 400,000 students.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need many full-time servings ones to labor on the students.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a good source to gain new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>SPREADING THE GOSPEL TO ALL PEOPLE IN SOCIETY</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The recovery has been in Taiwan for almost thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We now have brothers and sisters who work in every aspect of society.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They work in factories, businesses, hospitals, and even government institutions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, we should encourage all the saints to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is another way to gain new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>RECOVERING THE DORMANT SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In addition, the church in Taipei has information cards for thirteen to fifteen thousand saints, but only five thousand come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that at least eight thousand are not in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is worthwhile for us to labor on these eight thousand saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can restore them to the church life by fellowshipping with them, visiting them, and inviting them to our homes for meals.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>PROMOTING THE GROUP MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even though five thousand saints attend the meetings in Taipei, there are only three to four thousand saints in any given meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The brothers and sisters have a heart for the Lord, but they have not been helped to function.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, we must arrange them into groups, with twelve saints in a group.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The five thousand saints in the church life will form four hundred groups.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should group the saints according to their geographic location, not according to their spiritual growth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It may be that fifty to sixty groups will then form a district.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There may be seven or eight districts in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some co-workers, who can care for and lead the groups, should be assigned to every district.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The saints in a group should decide whether to meet once a week or once every two weeks for mutual fellowship and mutual visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The people they lead to salvation can later be added to a small group that is located near them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the number of saints in a group increases to twelve or sixteen, that group should split.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There will then be eight or nine saints in both groups.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the groups increase further, they can split again.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The brothers and sisters will not lose contact with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the past many people were baptized but not many remained.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The groups will function to maintain the fellowship among the saints and to care for the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, we need to organize the information cards so that we will know who is in the church life and who is not attending the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The saints who are not in the meetings can be assigned to groups in their districts.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The saints in a group meeting should pray for the dormant ones who are assigned to them and consider how to fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is easy to visit the dormant saints who are in our neighborhood or to invite them to our home.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even though we may not be able to recover every saint initially, we can gradually recover at least one or two thousand saints.</S>
