   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AROUND JUDAH IN RELATION TO ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The prophecy in Zechariah 9 concerns the nations around Judah in relation to Israel.</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The prophecy in verses 1 through 7 concerns the destruction carried out on the nations around Judah by Alexander the Great, king of the Grecian Empire 336-323 B.C., with the influence of his four successors up to 44 B.C. , prophesied by Daniel in his book as the abdomen and the thighs of the great human image in 2:32c, as the third beast in 7:6, as the male goat in 8:5, and as a mighty king in 11:3.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>B. The Lord Protecting Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>with Its Temple as His House</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Zechariah 9:8 says, "I will encamp around My house because of an army, / Because of him who passes by and returns; / And no oppressor will pass over them any more; / For now I see with My eyes."</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>as the King into Jerusalem in a Lowly Form</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The two verses in chapter nine that are concerned with Christ, verses 9 and 10, are an insertion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that verse 11 is actually the continuation of verse 8.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 9 says, "Exult greatly, O daughter of Zion; / Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>/ Now your King comes to you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>/ He is righteous and bears salvation; / Lowly and riding upon a donkey, / Even upon a colt, the foal of a donkey."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This reveals that Christ would come in a righteous way with salvation for us and that He would ride upon a donkey, even a colt of a donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This verse was fulfilled in the four Gospels when Jesus Christ came into Jerusalem the last time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He came as a King, but as a lowly King, a humiliated King, riding not on a majestic horse but on a colt.</S>
