[1]  2 Pet 1:2, 8; 3:18 Chapter 1 of 1 Peter, especially verses 2 and 3, reveals the energetic operation of the Triune God to bring God s chosen ones into the participation in the Triune God and into the full enjoyment of Himself: The Triune God passed through a process to do many things for us and become everything to us so that we may partake of Him for our enjoyment vv.
[2]  In this stage God justified us through the redemption of Christ Rom 3:24-26 and regenerated us in our spirit with His life by His Spirit John 3:3-6 ; thus we received God s eternal salvation Heb 5:9 and His eternal life John 3:15 and became His children 1:12-13 , who shall not perish forever 10:28-29 .
[3]  In this stage God will redeem our fallen and corrupted body Rom 8:23 by transfiguring it into the body of Christ s glory Phil 3:21 ; conform us to the glorious image of His firstborn Son Rom 8:29 , making us wholly and absolutely like Him in our regenerated spirit, transformed soul, and transfigured body; and glorify us v. 30 , immersing us in His glory Heb 2:10 that we may enter into His heavenly kingdom 2 Tim 4:18; 2 Pet 1:11 , into which He has called us 1 Thes 2:12 , and inherit it as the topmost portion of His blessing James 2:5; Gal 5:21 even that we may reign with Christ as His co-kings, participating in His kingship over the nations 2 Tim 2:12; Rev 20:4, 6; 2:26-27; 12:5 and sharing His royal, kingly joy in His divine government Matt 25:21, 23 . In this way our body will be freed from the slavery of corruption of the old creation into the freedom of the glory of God s new creation Rom 8:21 , and our soul will be delivered out of the realm of trials and sufferings into a new realm, one that is full of glory, and will share in and enjoy all that the Triune God is, has, and has accomplished, attained, and obtained 1 Pet 1:6; 3:14; 4:12-13; 5:9-10 . The salvation in 1:5 is full salvation, ultimate salvation; it refers specifically to the salvation of our souls from the dispensational punishment of the Lord s governmental dealing at His coming back: This is the salvation the salvation of our souls which is ready to be revealed to us at the last time, the grace to be brought to us at the revelation of Christ in glory; the salvation of our souls is the end of our faith vv.
[4]  Message Five Life and Building in 1 and 2 Peter Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:8; 2:1-5, 9; 2 Pet 1:3-4 The central thought of Peter s Epistles and of the entire Scriptures is life and building 1 Pet 1:23; 2:2-5; 2 Pet 1:3-4: Life is the Triune God embodied in Christ and realized as the Spirit dispensing Himself into us for our enjoyment, and building is the church, the Body of Christ, God s spiritual house, as the enlargement and expansion of God for the corporate expression of God Gen 2:8-9, 22; Matt 16:18; Col 2:19; Eph 4:16.
[5]  Christ, as the seed of life, is the power of life within us that has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness for the building up of the church as the rich surplus of life and the expression of life through the growth and development of life 2 Pet 1:3-4; cf.
[6]  Message Seven Grace in 1 and 2 Peter Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:2b, 10, 13;
[7]  2:19-20; 3:7; 4:10; 5:5, 10, 12; 2 Pet 1:2; 3:18 Grace is Christ Himself as our enjoyment grace is the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit giving Himself freely to us, being everything to us, and doing everything in us, through us, and for us John 1:14, 16-17; Isa 55:1; 2 Cor 1:8-9, 12; Gal 2:20; cf.
[8]  The multiplication of grace is the grace that multiplies in our daily life in the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord; the grace of God in His economy is rich, multiplying, and abounding 1 Pet 1:2b; 2 Pet 1:2; John 1:16; Eph 1:6-8; 2:7; Rom 5:17, 21; 1 Tim 1:14; Rev 22:21: Grace is multiplied to us through our sufferings, limitations, and weaknesses; grace is Christ as our Burden-bearer; the more burdens we have, the more opportunities we have to experience Christ as grace 2 Cor 12:7-9; cf.
[9]  Message Eight The Christian Life and Its Sufferings Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:11-12, 18-25;
[10]  3:15; 4:1-4, 7, 12-16; 5:1-4 The purpose of 1 Peter is to establish and strengthen the suffering believers; their sufferings are used to arm them with a mind against the flesh that they may live not in the lusts of men but in the will of God 4:1-2 , that they may share the sufferings of Christ and rejoice at the revelation of His glory vv.
[11]  Christ as the first God-man with His suffering life is a model for us; we need to live a life which is a copy, a reproduction, of the life of Christ that comes from enjoying Him as grace in our sufferings, so that He Himself as the indwelling Spirit, with all the riches of His life, reproduces Himself in us 2:18-25: In His suffering life the Lord was a man of prayer Matt 14:23; Mark 1:35; Luke 5:16; 6:12; 9:28; cf.
[12]  When the Lord offered up Himself as a sacrifice on the cross, He bore up our sins in His body on the cross, the true altar for propitiation; in His resurrection as the pneumatic Christ in our spirit, He is now the propitiation place where God meets and speaks with us and the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls to guide us to walk on the paths of righteousness, that is, to live to righteousness by walking according to our spirit Rom 3:25; 1 Pet 2:24-25; Psa 80:1; 23:3; Rom 8:4: Christ was our Redeemer in His death on the tree 1 Pet 2:24 , and now He is our soul s Shepherd and Overseer in the resurrection life within us v. 25 ; as such, He is able to guide us and supply us with life that we may follow in His steps according to the model of His suffering v. 21 . It is by our holy and excellent manner of life as the reproduction of Christ s life in the midst of trials that the unbelieving ones see our good works with their own eyes and glorify God in the day of His visitation the day on which God will look upon His sojourning people, as a shepherd looking upon his wandering sheep, to become the Shepherd and Overseer of their souls; when God pays us a visit, that is the day of visitation vv.
[13]  in 1 and 2 Peter Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:7, 19; 2:4, 6-7; 3:4; 2 Pet 1:1, 4 The believers in Christ should have a change in their concept of value Matt 23:16-26; 1 Sam 16:7; Luke 16:15; 9:54-56; 1 Pet 3:4: The proper concept of value for the believers can be seen in their estimation and assessment of the following aspects of Christ and His full salvation: Their valuation of the Lord Jesus Psa 118:22; 1 Pet 2:7.
[14]  Message Eleven The Present Truth and the Way of the Truth Scripture Reading: 2 Pet 1:12; 2:2, 15, 21;
[15]  Apostasy was the background of 2 Peter, and the burden of the writer was to inoculate the believers against the poison of apostasy 2:1: God s salvation is to impart Himself in His Trinity into the believers to be their life and life supply; this is God s economy, God s plan 2 Cor 13:14; Eph 1:10; 3:9; 1 Tim 1:4.
