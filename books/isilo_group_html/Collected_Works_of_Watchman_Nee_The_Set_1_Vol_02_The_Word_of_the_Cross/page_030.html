Now for the sake of the weakness of God's children, we will say a few more words. Most of the time, the prompting of the Holy Spirit gives us an assurance. This means that when we are about to do something, God will give us the assurance that what we are about to do is according to His will. This kind of assurance comes in a calm way. When He gives us this assurance, He will put a calm peace in our heart and refresh our heart. This kind of assurance should be maintained by faith. If there is faith to maintain it, we will see this assurance always abiding; it will not change through time and place, and we will not doubt if this is God's will. In the initial stage of our Christian life, we should always remember that the prompting of the Holy Spirit is powerful, yet calm; it is gradual, yet never compelling. It always waits for the consent of our own will; it waits for us to act on our own and never oppresses or overrules us by some kind of force. We must also always remember that the prompting of the Holy Spirit operates from within; it works from the center to the circumference. It works within the spirit and then enlightens the mind, so that the mind understands. Only after we have given our consent, will it work itself out through our bodies.</P><P>Soulish stirring is a work of the emotion. Sometimes, for no reason at all, we feel very happy and elated. At such times, we may have many plans to do this and that. Furthermore, the power in our emotion seems to be very strong, as if we cannot rest until we finish what we have resolved to do. If we want to distinguish between the stirring of the soul and the prompting of the Holy Spirit, we have to remember a few things: the stirring in the soul is mainly caused by the environment. Sometimes when we are alone, we feel like sighing. Soulish stirrings cause us to have sudden feelings. It is as if a power within us is trying to subjugate us and dominate us. It is not calm; there is a kind of burning and confused urge within. If we stop immediately and wait for the emotional stirring to subside, we will find that what we considered as the Spirit's prompting and what we considered as a necessary thing to do was not according to God's will. One thing we know: what we "feel" to do when we are stirred up is merely an impression we have in our feelings; it does not result in any assurance on our part. God is patient; He is not hasty to accomplish what He wants to do. This is why He spoke through the prophet Isaiah, "He who believes will not hasten away" (Isa. 28:16). Therefore, He takes time to prompt us. Nine times out of ten, sudden feelings are not His will.</P><P>Impulses from Satan are in reality very different from the prompting of the Holy Spirit; the two are actually opposite each other. Outwardly, it is difficult for believers to differentiate between the two because Satan will not cause us to completely fall into sin; he will only turn us away from God's will. Sometimes he holds us back so that we fall short; at other times, he urges us on, so that we become too much. He disguises himself as the angel of light and speaks to our ears, confusing the small voice of the Holy Spirit. God's children should be experienced in distinguishing the suggestions of Satan from the revelations of the Holy Spirit. Satan's impulses always come suddenly. His way with Christians is to come in the way of a blitz. The prompting of the Holy Spirit, on the other hand, first gives us a revelation and then enlightens our mind. Satan's impulses put many reasons and methods into our mind before asking us to actually perform some tasks. His initial work is to inject seeds of thoughts into the believers' mind. These thoughts are sudden and always come with many reasonings. Many times, we think that this is the prompting of the Holy Spirit. The work of the Holy Spirit spreads out from within, while Satan's work breaks in from the outside. Therefore, as God's children, we should never consider sudden thoughts to be His will. We should be careful, steady, and wait until everything is settled before we do anything. As to outward sudden stirrings and promptings, we should be particularly careful, because nine times out of ten they are not promptings of the Holy Spirit.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 02: The Word of the Cross &nbsp; pg 30</div><br></body></html>
