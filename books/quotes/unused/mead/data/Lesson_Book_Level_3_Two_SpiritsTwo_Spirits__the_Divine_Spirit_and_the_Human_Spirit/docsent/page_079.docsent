   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Lesson Twenty-Three THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND OUR REGENERATED SPIRIT Scripture Reading Eph 1:17; 2:22; 3:16; 4:23; Rom 8:6; Col 1:19; 2:9; Eph 6:18.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Outline The Body of Christ and our regenerated spirit in Ephesians A spirit of revelation to see the Body Built together in spirit Strengthened in the inner man Renewed in the spirit of the mind Filled in spirit Praying in spirit Text</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The reason there is virtually no church life in Christianity today is that most Christians do not know the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, most of today's Christian teachings are concerned with the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The book of Ephesians, however, is not focused on the mind, but on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our spirit must be a spirit of wisdom and revelation, the place of God's building, the organ in which God reveals His mystery to us, and the inner man strengthened by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, we need to be renewed in the spirit of our mind and to pray in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through proper exercise, our spirit will eventually be filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the mingling of God and man that produces the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I. THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>AND OUR REGENERATED SPIRIT IN EPHESIANS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First of all, we need to see that the Body is a matter absolutely in the spirit, in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our regenerated spirit is indwelt by the Holy Spirit, but the emphasis with the Body of Christ today is on our human spirit rather than on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, in every chapter of the book of Ephesians there is something mentioned about our regenerated human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ephesians is a book on the Body, and every chapter contains a verse concerning the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to pray-read these verses again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A SPIRIT OF REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>TO SEE THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul prayed that the Father of glory "may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation" Eph 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The spirit here is our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is necessary for you to see the Body, but you could never see the Body unless you are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you do not have the vision in your spirit, if you do not have a spirit of revelation, a seeing spirit, you could not see the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If your eyes do not have sight, you could not distinguish one color from another, and you could not view the scenery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Body of Christ is something different from all the scenes we could see, something different from all the colors we could see naturally.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is a heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we need a spirit of revelation, a spirit of seeing, a seeing spirit, to see the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do not mean that we need a clever mind to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What we need is a spirit transparent to see, a spirit of revelation, a seeing spirit to see the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The spirit of revelation to see the Body is the first point concerning our spirit in this book on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To use our mind to try to understand the matter of the church instead of turning to our spirit to see the revelation of the church can be compared to trying to see a particular color with our eyes closed instead of opening our eyes to see that color.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With your eyes closed, without the faculty of vision, you cannot see any of the colors.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The faculty of understanding does not work for the colors.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But if you open your eyes, all the doubts are gone, all the questions are gone, and you do know what the particular color is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You may not be able to explain what you see, but your eyes can substantiate the colors and can distinguish one color from another.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To see the colors, we need to open our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To see the church, we need to turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to turn to our spirit and respect the fact that our spirit is a spirit of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To see the church is simple when you use the proper organ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the spirit the matter of the church is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The local church is different from all the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You may not be able to explain the difference, but when you turn to the spirit and see the church, you will know the difference, and you will know that you have seen the church.</S>
