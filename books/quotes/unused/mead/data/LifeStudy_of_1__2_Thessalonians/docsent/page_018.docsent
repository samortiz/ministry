   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE FIVE THE TRIUNE GOD EMBODIED IN THE WORD TO PRODUCE A HOLY LIFE FOR THE CHURCH LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 1:1-10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is accurate and correct to say that the books of 1 and 2 Thessalonians are on the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although the expression "the church life" cannot be found in these Epistles, the church is mentioned emphatically at the beginning of each book.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Thessalonians opens with these words: "Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second Thessalonians opens in almost exactly the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The only difference is that 1 Thessalonians 1:1 says "the Father" and 2 Thessalonians 1:1 says "our Father."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both 1 and 2 Thessalonians were addressed to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE CHURCH OF THE THESSALONIANS</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Each of the fourteen Epistles written by Paul opens in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The beginning of every Epistle matches the contents of that particular Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, Romans 1:1 says, "Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, a called apostle, separated to the gospel of God."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First Corinthians begins in a somewhat different way: "Paul, a called apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God" 1 Cor 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In contrast, the opening of both 1 and 2 Thessalonians is quite simple.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul does not use any titles to refer to himself; he does not speak of himself as a slave of Christ or as an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead, he simply says, "Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The expression, "the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ," is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand, the church is of certain persons; on the other hand, it is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This way of referring to the church is very different from that found in 1 Corinthians 1:2.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There Paul says, "To the church of God which is in Corinth," describing the church as being in a particular place.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in 1 and 2 Thessalonians Paul speaks of the church not as being in a certain place, but as being of certain persons, the Thessalonians, who are in God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In these Epistles the church is of the Thessalonians and in the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to history, Thessalonica was an immoral place.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the most part, the people of that city were not moral.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, according to 1:1, the church in that city was "of the Thessalonians."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It does not seem possible that a church could be composed of people who lived in a city like Thessalonica.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is very positive to say that the church is in God the Father, but it is not positive to say that the church is of the Thessalonians.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 1:1 we have the church of the Thessalonians in God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The prepositions "of" and "in" here are very important.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church in Thessalonica was of people from an evil city, but it was in God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is similar to speaking of the church in San Francisco as being the church of the San Franciscans in God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>San Francisco has a world-wide reputation for being an evil, immoral city.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, there is a church in San Francisco today, the church of the San Franciscans in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
