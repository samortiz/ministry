   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Exposed because of the Lack</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Heavenly Life Supply</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we shall now see, our flesh is exposed because of the lack of nourishment, because of the lack of Christ as the heavenly life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the reason that the mention of manna both in Exodus 16 and in Numbers 11 is in relation to the murmuring of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that the heavenly manna is given to deal with our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a work cannot be accomplished by the springs at Elim; it can only be done by the heavenly manna.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The people murmured against Moses and Aaron because of their lust in the matter of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, their murmuring actually was against the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The people had drunk a great deal of water, but they were still hungry because they had nothing to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Their hunger could not be satisfied by the water from the twelve flowing springs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No matter how much water we may drink, our hunger remains.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the one hand, we need our thirst to be quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But on the other hand, we need our hunger to be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The twelve springs can only quench our thirst; they cannot satisfy our hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Christian experience has different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many Christians, however, think that there is only one aspect, the aspect of the baptism of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to them, the experience of the baptism is all-inclusive and satisfies a believer s every need.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But according to the pictures in Exodus, this kind of experience cannot be everything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yes, at Elim there are twelve springs, but there is no mention of food.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason, the people were still hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Within, they were short of the necessary life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This shortage of the life supply caused the flesh to be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever we lack the supply of life, it is not possible for our flesh to remain hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you check your experience, you will see that the very day after you have had an exciting experience at Elim, you have had the sense of dissatisfaction within.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This dissatisfaction comes from the shortage of the heavenly life supply, from the shortage of Christ as the heavenly manna.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In your experience, you have not yet partaken of Christ as your life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every believer has problems with the flesh and with the lust of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do you know when the flesh is dealt with?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is dealt with only when Christ truly becomes our daily life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Christ fills us and satisfies us, this satisfaction will cause our flesh to be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In principle, this is the experience of every believer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After we enjoy the Lord at Elim, we discover that we still have a problem with the flesh and with the lust of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This problem is caused by hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Deep within, we are undernourished.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have a hunger that has not been satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In our Christian experience we have not come to the place of experiencing Christ daily as our life supply to fill us and to satisfy us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, when we daily enjoy Christ as our heavenly life supply, we are fully satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At that time our flesh is subdued, and our lust is dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nevertheless, the flesh with its lust is not dealt with once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever we are undernourished and are short of Christ, we shall become hungry again.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This will cause the flesh and the lust to reappear and to become active once more.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our flesh will remain until we are in resurrection and have a glorified body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although I have been in the Lord for so many years, I must testify that the flesh is still with me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If I am not filled with Christ and satisfied by Him, my flesh will still be active.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not think that a person who has been in the Lord for many years will reach the point where he is no longer troubled by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although the flesh may be dealt with repeatedly, even hundreds of times, it is still with us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, whenever we are satisfied by Christ as the heavenly life supply, the flesh with its lust is conquered.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But whenever we are short of Christ as our nourishment, the flesh will be exposed once again.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>My burden in this message is simply to make this matter clear to all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we see that the flesh is always exposed when we are short of Christ as our daily life supply, we shall be enlightened concerning our experience with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Perhaps you have wondered why even after you have had certain glorious experiences in the Lord, you discovered that your flesh was the same as ever.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By now we should realize that we need the heavenly manna as well as the twelve springs at Elim.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If the apostle Paul were still on earth, even he would need to be satisfied by Christ as the daily life supply, for he would yet be troubled by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although we need to experience the twelve springs at Elim, we also need our hunger to be satisfied by Christ as the heavenly manna.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Day by day we need to experience Christ as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What helps us the most in our daily living with the Lord is not the drinking of the twelve springs at Elim; it is the eating of Christ as the heavenly manna.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The experience at Elim comes occasionally.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As the record indicates, it was not a continual experience of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, the people partook of manna daily for a period of forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>With the exception of the Sabbath days, they had to gather manna every morning for all these years.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This indicates clearly that the experience of manna is daily and continual.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we have the adequate experience of eating Christ daily as our heavenly manna, our flesh and lust will be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But whenever we are short of manna, the flesh with its lust will appear again.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the reason the negative experience recorded in Exodus 16 follows the positive experience at Elim in 15:27.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The negative experience of Exodus 16 is repeated in Numbers 11.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have pointed out that when the people complained at Marah, the Lord was not angry with them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When they murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness between Elim and Sinai, the Lord was somewhat displeased.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But in Numbers 11 when the people complained, it was evil in the ears of Jehovah: and Jehovah heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of Jehovah burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp v. 1, Heb . When the people complained this time, there was no need for Moses to say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In His anger the Lord came in as a burning fire.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Verse 2 says, And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto Jehovah, the fire was quenched Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Verse 3 goes on to say that the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of Jehovah burnt among them Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We need to see that this negative experience is related to the experience of manna.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Once again we see that whenever we are short of Christ as our life supply, the flesh will be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Lust appears because we are undernourished.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Do not place your trust in your past experience with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Do not think that because you have been in the Lord for such a long time, you can no longer be troubled by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I can testify that although I am an elderly man and have been in the Lord for years, I still need the Lord to be my present life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Remember that the manna was sent every morning and had to be gathered every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This indicates that we cannot store up the supply of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Christ we experienced yesterday is not sufficient for today.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If you attempt to preserve yesterday s manna, you will find that it will not nourish you or satisfy you.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Rather, it will breed worms and stink Exo 16:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>May we all be impressed with the need to experience Christ daily as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is crucial to see that the shortage of the heavenly supply of Christ is what causes our flesh to be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>No matter what exciting experiences we have had in the Spirit, we still need to partake of Christ daily as our heavenly manna.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we are undernourished, our flesh will rise up, and our lust will disturb us and hinder our fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Day by day we need to be filled with Christ as the heavenly manna and satisfied by Him.</S>
