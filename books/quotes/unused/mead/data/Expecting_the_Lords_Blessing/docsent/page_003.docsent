   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brothers, if God brings us to the point of seeing that everything in God's work depends upon His blessing, it will bring about a basic change in our labor for God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We would not consider how many people, how much money, or how much bread we have.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We would say we do not have enough, but the blessing is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The blessing meets the need that we cannot meet.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although we cannot measure up to the size of the need, the blessing is greater than our lack.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we see this, the work will have a basic change.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In every matter we must look at the blessing more than we consider the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Methods, considerations, human wisdom, and clever words are all useless.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In God's work we should believe in and expect His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many times we are careless and damage the work, but this is not a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the Lord gives us a small blessing, we can get through any problem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We truly hope that we would not make mistakes or speak and act loosely in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we have the Lord's blessing, however, it seems that we cannot err even when we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sometimes it seems that we have made a serious mistake, but with God's blessing the result is not really an error.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I once said to Brother Witness that if we had the Lord's blessing, the things we did right would be right and the things we did wrong would be right as well.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nothing could damage the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The basic concern today is that we must learn to live in a way that does not hinder God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some habits force God to withhold His blessing, and these must be eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some temperaments keep God from blessing, and these must be done away with.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must learn to believe in God's blessing, rely on it, and eliminate the barriers which prevent us from receiving it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us take Sian as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the brothers were divided into two parties, this definitely hindered God from blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If their problem had continued to exist, God's blessing would not have come in. In another example, there have been some difficulties in Szechuan recently.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, we cannot expect Szechuan to have any special blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I merely mention these matters as examples.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must see that the Lord withholds no good thing from us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the work is not going well, if the brothers and sisters are in a poor condition, or if the number of saved ones is not increasing, we should not use the environment or certain people as an excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We cannot blame the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am afraid that the real reason lies with our harboring of some frustrations to the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the Lord can get through in us, the Lord's blessing will be greater than our capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once God said to the Israelites, "Prove Me, if you will, by this,...whether I will open to you the windows of heaven and pour out blessing for you until there is no room for it" Mal 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God is still saying this today.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The normal life of a Christian is a life of blessing, and the normal work of a Christian is a work of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do not receive blessing, we should say, "Lord, perhaps I am the problem."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With the passing years it becomes more and more evident that some brothers receive God's blessing while others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Of ourselves, we are not able to form any judgment about this matter, but over the years this fact has become so evident that we know beforehand that there will be fruit if one brother goes out but none if another brother goes out.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We seemingly can forecast the result.</S>
