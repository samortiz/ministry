   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 Ham, the Father of Canaan,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Received the Curse by Exposing the Failure</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Noah made a mistake and had a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Noah woke up, he did not make a confession.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He immediately cursed the one that exposed his nakedness 9:22, 24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I was young, I was somewhat unhappy with Noah about this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I said, "Noah, don't you realize that you were wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You should have confessed to God and then confessed to Ham, the son who saw your nakedness exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead of confessing, you cursed."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I was really bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Noah cursed the exposing one and blessed the covering ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He cursed whomever was not for him and blessed whomever was for him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Probably some of you have also had a problem with this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Maybe you do not understand why this happened.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Spiritually speaking, it was easy for a person like Noah to be humble and to confess.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do you not think that this is easy?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But it would be very difficult for one who has failed and has been exposed to curse and to bless.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Noah was the father of the family and the leader of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everyone looked to him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He failed and was exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He could have been humble, confessed, and admitted that he had failed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, since God had established him as the leader, he had to speak, not according to his convictions, but according to God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Which is easier to do to be humble and confess, or to speak according to God's government?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is easy for anyone to be humble, admit the failure, and confess it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if Noah had been like that, what would have become of God's government on this earth?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What about his descendants?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What about God's economy, God's administration?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It would have been all right for Noah to make such a confession, but it would have meant the ruin of God's government on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Besides Noah, who could have represented God to speak in a governmental way?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No one but Noah could have done that work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was difficult for Noah, as one who had failed, to represent God by speaking governmentally.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>While he was speaking in such a way, his conscience might have troubled him and the Devil might have accused his conscience, saying, "How can you speak this way, since you have had such a failure?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sometimes when the leaders in the church fell into this kind of situation, they gave up and did not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So, there was no divine government.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not judge Noah according to the human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In God's government, Noah was a good example.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Though he failed, he was still so strong to represent God in speaking governmentally.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was difficult for Noah to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not look at Noah from his side, from the side of his failure.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You must look at the situation from the side of the government of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Undoubtedly Noah was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was loose, careless, drunken, and naked.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nevertheless, we must look at Noah from the perspective of God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What should we do when the leader is wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This matter affects God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are two things here: the divine government and the human failure.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are going to understand this portion of the divine Word, we must see what is the divine government.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not merely a matter of human failure.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whether the leader is right or wrong, God's government has to be taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Ham, who exposed Noah's nakedness, neglected God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To expose a leader's failure is to be involved with the divine government.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We all must see this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Suppose Noah was not the leader and not God's deputy authority on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then what people did when he failed would not have been so serious.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whatever they did would not have affected God's government or involved them with God's governmental dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But Noah was the leader, and God's deputy authority on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What should be our attitude towards such a leader's failure?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This involves us in God's governmental dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Moses was wrong in marrying an Ethiopian woman Num 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Miriam spoke against him and suffered the curse of leprosy Num 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>She was cursed because she neglected God's government and touched God's deputy authority in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Why does the Bible say strongly that whoever despises or dishonors his parents shall be cursed?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Deut 27:16, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Because this involves God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God is a God of order, a God with His government.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you look at God's creation, you will see that everything is in good order.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This order is related to God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In God's universal government, the parents are God's authority over the children.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When children dishonor their parents, they are rebellious against God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They dishonor the deputy authority of God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When they do this, they receive a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>David was seriously wrong in killing Uriah and taking his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>His son, Absalom, rebelled against him and suffered the curse of death 2 Sam 15:10; 18:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Today, so many young people despise and dishonor their parents and miss God's blessing as a result.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Look at the way they live and act it is just like the lower animals.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They have missed the blessing that God destined for mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Why have they missed God's blessing?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Because they have been cursed for dishonoring their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Bible says clearly that the one who honors his parents will receive the blessing of long life Eph 6:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Young people, if you honor your parents, you will be blessed with a long life, living normally.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You will know how to be wise and how to behave.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You will know what is the right way to have a normal life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You will not be under the curse, living like the lower animals.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>To have a wrong way of living is a sign of the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Why was Ham cursed?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Because he touched God's authority and became involved with God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Noah was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But, as far as Ham was concerned, he should have considered his position and God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The failure of the leader always becomes a test to us.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Are we truly under God's government?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If we are, we shall be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If not, we shall lose the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Noah's failure was a test to his sons.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>From the same test, one received a curse and two received a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Whether you receive a curse or a blessing from such a test depends on how you involve yourself with God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Although Noah's failure was bad, it was a good opportunity for Shem and Japheth to receive the blessing.</S>
