<h2 class="head1">CREATION BEING ACCORDING TO GOD&rsquo;S PLAN</h2>
<p>In order to fulfill His plan, the Triune God created all things. His creation of all things was according to His plan. Concerning creation, Revelation 4:11 says, &ldquo;Because of Your will they were, and were created.&rdquo; In Greek the phrase <em>because of</em> also means &ldquo;through.&rdquo; All things were not created by chance, accidentally, or haphazardly. Rather, they were created through God&rsquo;s will, according to His plan. God in His plan determined that He would fulfill His purpose through all things; therefore, He created all things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CREATION BEING TO GAIN MAN</h2>
<p>The purpose of God&rsquo;s plan is to gain some people to be the brothers of Christ. Hence, man was the goal of creation. God created all things in order to gain man. Before creating man, God created the heavens, the earth, and all things in them. He prepared the heavens, the earth, and all things for man. The things on the earth are for man to enjoy, and even the angels, as ministering spirits, are sent forth for service for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation (Heb. 1:14).</p>
<p>Many people envy angels, but they do not know that man is higher than the angels. God did not determine to fulfill His purpose with angels. God did not determine that angels would receive the sonship to be brothers of Christ. Rather, He determined that angels would be messengers, not sons with His life. God determined to give the sonship to man. God wants to fulfill His purpose through man. He wants man to have His life and become the many brothers of Christ.</p>
<p>Man is the goal of creation because God&rsquo;s purpose is with man. Everything that God created is for man. Although the angels dwell in the heavens, they exist for man. Some of the things in the heavens and on earth are for man to enjoy, some things are for man to appreciate, and other things are for man to have dominion over. All things were created and prepared for man&rsquo;s existence so that man could be gained by God to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan and fulfill His purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CREATION BEING IN THE ORDER OF LIFE</h2>
<p>God created all things in the order of life. He created non-living things before He created the living things. When He created living things, He created lower forms of life before creating higher forms of life. He first created life without consciousness, that is, the plant life, such as grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees (Gen. 1:11). Unlike soil and rocks, which are lifeless, plants have life, but the plant life does not have consciousness. Hence, the plant life is the lowest form of life. After the plant life God created the animal life, and He again started with the lower forms of animal life. He first created fish and birds (vv. 20-21). These animals have consciousness, but this consciousness is not very subjective. Then God created animals with a higher level of life, such as cattle (vv. 24-25). These life forms are higher than plants, fish, and birds because they have more of a subjective consciousness, but they are not the highest form of created life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HUMAN LIFE BEING THE HIGHEST CREATED LIFE</h2>
<p>After creating the animal life, God created man (vv. 26-27). God created man last. Man is the highest form of created life. Not only does the human life have consciousness, but this consciousness is very subjective. The consciousness of the human life surpasses that of the animal life. In relation to emotions, intelligence, and skill, the human life surpasses every other form of life. Therefore, man can have dominion over every creature (v. 26).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD CREATING MAN IN HIS IMAGE AND<br />
ACCORDING TO HIS LIKENESS</h2>
<p>God did not only create man with the highest form of created life; He also created man in His image and according to His likeness (v. 26). Man is the only creature that looks like God, because only man was created in God&rsquo;s image and according to His likeness. Hence, man is the highest creature created by God. God prepared man as a vessel for His plan (Rom. 9:23). In His plan God determined that we would have His life to be the many brothers of Christ; hence, God made man in His image and likeness.</p>
<p>Image refers to our mind, emotion, and will. Our mind, emotion, and will, our so-called metaphysical person, are created in God&rsquo;s image. Hence, our thoughts, feelings, intentions, and preferences are similar to God&rsquo;s. Man is higher than every other creature because he was made in God&rsquo;s image.</p>
<p>Likeness refers to outward form. Our body, our outward form, was created according to God&rsquo;s likeness. We are God&rsquo;s likeness. In the Old Testament, God appeared to people in man&rsquo;s likeness before He became flesh (Gen. 18:1-8; Judg. 13:3-21). Man was created according to God&rsquo;s likeness; therefore, man has God&rsquo;s likeness.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s bodily form is more beautiful than the form of other creatures. Flowers, trees, beasts, and cattle are beautiful, but they are inferior to man. Man is beautiful because he resembles God and thus surpasses all other creatures. Man was created in God&rsquo;s image and according to God&rsquo;s likeness; therefore, he can represent God with His dominion over all creation.</p>
