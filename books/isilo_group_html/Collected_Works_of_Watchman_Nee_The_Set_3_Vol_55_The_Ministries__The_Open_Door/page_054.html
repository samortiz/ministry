He has led us to peacefully and joyfully perform the first group wedding of six couples. Everything was filled with God's presence! Friends from this region also attended. We did not accept any gifts. We preached the gospel in the afternoon, and ten people confessed the Lord and accepted Him. May the Lord save them.</p><p>Shangrao wants us to go there. After we finish the arrangements for a few farms, we will see how the Lord leads us.</p><p>He-ren<br />March 3, 1950</p><h2 class="head1">BEING RAISED UP IN THE LORD'S MERCY<br />(MANCHURIA)</h2><p>In 1933 God's servant came to Ch'ang-ch'un in Manchuria, and the meetings started. Later, some were raised up in Shenyang and Jilin. In the past ten years the number of assemblies has increased to more than twenty localities.</p><p>In 1942 God's servant, our brother Philip Luan, came to Manchuria to make some arrangements. Because of the change in the world situation and the cruel attack of the Japanese, we passed through many trials and tribulations, but we all came through safely.</p><p>We were not able to fellowship with the elder brothers and sisters in the inland for some time because communication was blocked. Because of our immaturity and uncertainty in our direction, many brothers and sisters received teachings that appeared to be truth but were not. This occurred because we were starving and had no choice of food. These ones departed from the proper way. With the exception of Jilin and Ch'ang-ch'un, almost every locality was carried away by this deception. These brothers and sisters suffered much for their moment of blindness!</p><p>Last summer, the church in Peking sent a brother to visit the churches in Manchuria. He passed through the localities of Ch'ang-ch'un, Shenyang, Jilin, and Harbin, and he met with the saints for forty days. The assemblies in all the localities were much blessed by the Lord.</p><p>The brothers and sisters in Harbin suffered much for four or five years because they left the proper way. They turned this time and all were released. They are now very fresh. The Lord's presence is with them in a special way. The Lord is also gradually adding saved ones to the church. The meeting place was too small, and a larger place has been rented which can hold three to four hundred people. The population of Harbin is almost one million. It is an important point in the water and land transportation network in the area north of the Songhua River. It is at present full of needs.</p><p>There is also Mudanjiang, a locality along the northeastern border of the country. It is a center of transportation: east to Vladivostok; west to Manzhouli; north to Jiamusi, the mines in the Heligang mountains, the forest regions, and the Heihe border; southeast through Tunhua to Tumen and on to North Korea; southwest to Harbin, Ch'ang-ch'un, and Shenyang. Its produce is abundant, and life is easy. It has a population of almost three hundred thousand. It used to be a Baptist region, and there are many people who love the Lord. Although they are in tribulation, their testimony is strong. They have been reading books from the bookroom for many years. Those who have a heart for the Lord are looking for the way to go on. Once a brother from Ch'ang-ch'un visited them, and everyone was helped through the fellowship in the Lord.</p><p>In January of this year, Peking sent a brother to visit all the local churches in Manchuria. He went to Shenyang, Harbin, Mudanjiang, and Ch'ang-ch'un. There were meetings for two months. By the Lord's grace and mercy, every locality received much blessing. There are now thirty localities. Some already have assemblies; others do not have as many people, but they do have prayer in one accord. Only Ch'ang-ch'un, Shenyang, Jilin, and Harbin have the Lord's table. All the churches in Manchuria are now one. The Lord has led us to the way of righteousness for His name's sake. We can only give thanks and praise to Him.</p><p>Dalien was not able to send people to visit these places because of barriers to transportation. The brothers sent letters of invitation, and Brother Yuan Zhu-wu and Brother Chin Jia-ye came to attend the meetings. They fully received the Lord's truth and expressed the desire to stand with all the churches on the ground of oneness to serve the Lord. They also consecrated themselves and are willing to follow the footsteps of the flock. After they returned to Dalien, the brothers and sisters willingly received the Lord's truth and obeyed all the Lord's arrangements. They hope some brothers will go and visit them.</p><p>The brothers and sisters in Manchuria spiritually have lost much over the past few years. Since the Lord has brought them back to the way of oneness, He will indeed multiply His blessings to them. We ask the brothers and sisters in every locality to pray for them!</p><p>On the following page is a map of the churches in Manchuria. Please forgive us if it is not detailed enough!</p><p>Fang Ai-guang<br />March 20, 1950</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_053.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_055.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 55: The Ministries & The Open Door &nbsp; pg 54</div><br></body></html>
