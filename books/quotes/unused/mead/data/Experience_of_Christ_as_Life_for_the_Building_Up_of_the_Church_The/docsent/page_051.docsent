   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The dimensions of the tabernacle are also full of the numbers three and five.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As an example of this, Exodus 27:1 speaks of the dimensions of its altar: "And thou shalt make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height thereof shall be three cubits."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Again we see the numbers five and three because they are the numbers of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now let us read Exodus 25:10 concerning the dimensions of the ark in the Holy of Holies: "And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Two and a half is half of five, and one and a half is half of three.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The altar is five by three, and the ark is two and a half by one and a half.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The altar is a complete unit, but the ark is half the size of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The ark typifies Christ, and Christ has been split.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The "halved" Christ is the crucified Christ for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Again we see the basic numbers of five and three for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The tabernacle was of three sections: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to Exodus 27:13, the width of the outer court on the east side was to be fifty cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then verses 14 and 15 say that the hangings on either side of the gate were to be fifteen cubits with three pillars and three sockets.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, verse 18 says that the height of the linen curtains of the outer court was to be five cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, each curtain of the enclosure in the outer court measured five cubits by five cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The above illustrations should prove to us that the numbers three and five are the numbers for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This also shows us that the compound ointment is for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God charged Moses to anoint the tabernacle and all the utensils of the tabernacle with this ointment Exo 30:26-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moses also was to anoint Aaron and his sons with the compound ointment v. 30 . This means that the all-inclusive Spirit is also for God's priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the tabernacle with everything related to it had not been anointed with the ointment, it would have been a secular building, not a holy building, not God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The tabernacle could never have been a divine building until every part of it was anointed with the holy compound ointment.</S>
