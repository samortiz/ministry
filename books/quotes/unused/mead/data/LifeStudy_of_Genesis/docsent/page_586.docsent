   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CONSUMMATION WITH NAPHTALI</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although Asher is wonderful, he is still not the end of Jacob's poetic prophecy with blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After Asher comes Naphtali 49:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How good it is that Jacob had twelve sons!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This number is truly sufficient, even eternally sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When Jacob needed someone to represent sinners, he had Reuben.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When he needed someone to expose the evil, cruel disposition, he had Simeon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When he needed someone to express the victory of Christ, he had Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He also had Dan to represent apostasy, Gad to signify recovery, and Asher to portray sufficiency.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now we come to Naphtali.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A. Experiencing the Resurrected Christ</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>and Uttering the Beautiful and Pleasant</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Words of Life</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Genesis 49:21 says, "Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth beautiful words" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In his prophetic blessing Jacob used many animals as figures: a lion, a lioness, a donkey, a foal of a donkey, a serpent, a horned snake, and a hind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Naphtali is neither a lion nor a donkey, but a hind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We thank God both for His creation and for Jacob's poetry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A hind is a lovely animal, so living and active.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although a hind is not proud or especially large, it is quite strong, able to skip upon the mountaintops.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the Hebrew text, the title of Psalm 22 speaks of the hind of the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Years ago I heard a message by Brother Nee in which he said that the hind of the morning signifies the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Psalm 22 firstly speaks of Christ's death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then, beginning with verse 22, it proceeds to His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Psalm 22:22 says, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the assembly will I praise thee" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that in His resurrection Christ declared the name of the Father to His brothers and praised Him in the midst of the assembly, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, this psalm eventually issues in the resurrection of Christ as the hind of the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Resurrection surely is a morning, and Christ in His resurrection is the hind of the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Genesis 49:21 says that as a hind Naphtali gives beautiful words.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I was young, I could not understand the relationship between the hind and the beautiful words.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It seemed that these things were absolutely unrelated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But now we can see the significance of this in our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When you experience Christ as the resurrected One, you will be filled and bubbling over with pleasant words.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead of gossip, out of your innermost being will flow living waters through the words you speak.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that all your words will be rivers uttered out of the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Matthew 28 and Acts 2 we see that the speaking of the pleasant words is intimately related to the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After Christ was resurrected, He told His disciples to come to Him on a certain mountain, and there He charged them to go forth to speak not with their natural words, but with the resurrected Christ as their words Matt 28:16, 18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, on the day of Pentecost Peter stood up to speak beautiful words Acts 2:32-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Peter's message that day was a proof that he had been experiencing the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because he had been experiencing this resurrected Christ, his teeth were white.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rich words, pleasant words, beautiful words, words of joy and life all these come out of the experience of the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more we experience Christ as the resurrected One, the more we have something to say.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We could never be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Everyone who experiences Christ as the resurrected One will be bubbling over with beautiful words.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This does not mean that we shall be talkative.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No, it means that because we are filled with Christ, we are bubbling over and always have something to say.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ is the word of God, the word of life, and the word that is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am filled with this resurrected Christ; thus, I have many words to utter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The principle here is that we always utter what is filling us within.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The word we speak comes out of the abundance of our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When our inner being is filled with Christ, we must speak lest we burst.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now we can understand why Naphtali, a hind let loose, gives beautiful words.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because he has experienced Christ, he is filled with beautiful words.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>B. Satisfied with God's Grace</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>and Full with God's Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Deuteronomy 33:23 says, "O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full with the blessing of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The favor and blessing here link Naphtali with Asher, who is more blessed than the sons and favored among his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the Lord's recovery we are daily satisfied with rich grace and full of God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This blessing does not refer to the material blessing, but to the blessing in the spirit, the blessing in life, the blessing in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What grace we have tasted and what blessing we have enjoyed since coming into the church life!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We all can testify that in the Lord's recovery we are satisfied with the rich grace and full of the rich blessing 1 Cor 15:10; 2 Cor 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>C. Taking the Earth for the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Deuteronomy 33:23 also says of Naphtali, "Possess thou the sea and the south" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Naphtali will possess the west, the sea, the Gentile world, and the south, the land, the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This means that Naphtali will take the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is the resurrected Christ experienced by us who will take the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At the end of Psalm 22 we see that the resurrected Christ will gain the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Psalm 22:27 says, "All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All the nations will submit to Him, obey Him, and worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Naphtali, the one who experiences the resurrected Christ, will possess the sea and the land.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we truly experience Christ in resurrection, we become those who will take the earth by preaching Christ Matt 28:19; Acts 1:8; Rom 15:19 .</S>
