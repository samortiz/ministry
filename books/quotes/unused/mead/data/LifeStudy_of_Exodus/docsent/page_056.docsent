   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE SIXTEEN GOD S DEMAND AND PHARAOH S RESISTANCE 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Exodus is a book of pictures, not a book of philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The pictures in the first part of Exodus present a portrait of life in the world under Satan s usurpation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By means of these pictures the nature of such a life is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The pictures in this book also unveil the desire of God s heart with respect to His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God said to Pharaoh, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s people had fallen into a worldly life under Satan s usurpation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the book of Exodus reveals, God delivered them from this and brought them into the wilderness and to the mountain, where they received a heavenly vision of the pattern of God s dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God wanted the tabernacle to be His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was the desire of His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to expose the real situation of life in the world under Pharaoh s usurpation, the book of Exodus describes twelve conflicts between Jehovah and Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the first conflict there were no miracles, plagues, or judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, there was simply the negotiation between Jehovah and Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God demanded that Pharaoh let His people go into the wilderness a three days journey to hold a feast unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But Pharaoh refused to acknowledge Jehovah or to hearken to His demand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the second conflict there was a miracle, but no plague; there was exposure, but no judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 7:9 the Lord said, When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Show a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The purpose of this miracle was to expose the actual situation of life in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For this reason, the second conflict involved exposure, but not judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After the first two conflicts, the plagues began to come upon Pharaoh and his people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Exodus there are two groups of ten items: the ten plagues that came upon the Egyptians and the Ten Commandments that were given to God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The ten plagues can be grouped into four categories.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first group includes the plagues of blood, frogs, and lice; the second group, the plagues of flies, murrain, and boils; the third group, the plagues of hail, locusts, and darkness; and finally, the plague of the killing of the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Each plague was more severe than the one before.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The plagues in the first group were troublesome, but they were not injurious.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The plagues in the second group caused harm both to beasts and to men.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The plagues in the third group destroyed the environment, and the last plague terminated the worldly life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the last plague, all the firstborn in the land of Egypt died, from the firstborn of Pharaoh to the firstborn of the maidservants 11:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Revelation 16 we see the seven ultimate plagues that God will send upon the earth, plagues that will come toward the end of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These seven plagues will be the seven bowls of the fury of God Rev 16:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In many respects, the seven plagues in Revelation are similar to the ten plagues in Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By means of the ten plagues God was able to accomplish the exodus of His chosen people from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>During the great tribulation, the seven plagues will enable God s people to make their final exodus from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the end of this age, most of God s people will still be in Egypt, that is, in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In their time, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had no need of an exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In like manner, the overcomers at the end time will have no need of an exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, they will be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The majority of Christians, however, will need an exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By the seven last plagues, God will bring His people out of the world.</S>
