   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE BRIDEGROOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>COMING FOR THE BRIDE Scripture Reading: Matt 9:15; 25:1, 6; 28:19-20; John 3:29; 14:17-20; 15:5; Gal 3:27; 1 Cor 12:13</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the past two chapters we have seen some exhaustless matters concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is why we have four Gospels, or four biographies, to tell us who Christ is, and what kind of person He is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first Gospel is by Matthew, and the last is by John.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we will not cover anything from the Gospels of Mark and Luke, but we will look a little into the first and last Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>IN THE BEGINNING</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Scriptures are the breathing out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, we must realize that not only the composition of the Scriptures is God s breathing, but also the arrangement of the books.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For Matthew to be first and John last is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every book in the Scriptures opens in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For instance, Genesis commences with In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, Matthew opens another way: The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham Matt 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John opens with: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Matthew says that Jesus was the son of David and the son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That is, He was the son of some human being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But John tells us that Jesus Christ was the One from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Matthew started from Abraham, and then David, and then Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But John says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Matthew goes back, and John comes forth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Matthew goes back from Jesus to David and then to Abraham, whereas John comes forth from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When was the beginning?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many Christians today like to study the Bible, but not one can tell us when the beginning started.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all desire to know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I began to study the Bible fifty years ago because I loved the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once when I was reading the Bible, I came to John 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the beginning was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Immediately my young mentality attempted to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is the beginning?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I looked into a concordance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It referred me to Genesis 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There I read, In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I still could not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>So it is better not to be too concerned about our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, we should pray-read the Word: In the beginning...Amen Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the beginning was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the best way to receive God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After trying to understand the beginning, I tried to understand what the Word is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was very difficult for me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, it said that the Word was with God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Immediately I was clear.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There were two, the Word and God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But then it continued by saying that the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then I asked, Are there one or two?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>NOT TO UNDERSTAND, BUT TO ENJOY</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do you think that you can understand the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I can tell you that you do not even understand yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do you know how many hearts you have?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You have two hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One is your physical heart, and the other is your psychological heart.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Jeremiah 17:9 says, The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I would tell Jeremiah that my heart is in good condition.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have just had a medical examination.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But this is not what Jeremiah means.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He is not talking about the physical heart, but the psychological heart.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is this that is corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You see, you do not understand yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Tell me, where is our heart, and where is our conscience?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We cannot say.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>So we really do not understand ourselves well.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In a much greater way, the Bible is far beyond our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But the Bible is like food.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We may not understand it, but we can eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the Far East, they do not have what you call in this country grapefruit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When I first heard this term, I simply did not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then I thought that it must mean some kind of fruit of the grape.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>One day, however, I ate some grapefruit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then I realized that it was not something of the grape.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I really did not know what it was, but I ate it and enjoyed it!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Even today, my mind does not fully comprehend it, but my body benefits from it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The same principle applies to the reading of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is not so much to be understood as it is to be enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When we open to John 1:1, we should not try merely to understand it, but rather enjoy it by pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the beginning was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the beginning, Amen, was the Word, Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>And the Word was with God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Oh, the Word, Amen, the Word was with God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>And the Word was God!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Amen, the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Oh, the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When we take the Bible in this way, it is similar to our eating of food.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We may not understand much, but we really enjoy something.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>And we will be nourished within.</S>
