   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONTACTING THREE WORLDS BY THE THREE PARTS OF OUR BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because we humans are of three parts, we can contact three worlds, the physical world, the psychological world, and the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In our body we have a seeing sense, a hearing sense, a smelling sense, a tasting sense, and a touching sense.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With these five senses we contact the material things in the physical world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Besides the physical world, there is also the psychological world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The psychological world includes joy and sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot touch or contact the psychological world with our five senses.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may be full of joy, but we cannot see, hear, smell, taste, or feel joy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is something psychological, not physical.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The English word psychological comes from the Greek word psuche, meaning soul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some Christian teachers use the word soulish as the adjective form of the noun soul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The psychological world is simply the soulish world, the world of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Besides the physical world and the psychological world there is a third world, which is the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God and the angels do not belong to the physical world or even to the psychological world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is a spirit, not a soul, so He belongs to the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We contact, or touch, the physical world by the physical part of our human being, the five senses of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Likewise, we contact the psychological world by the psychological part of our being, which is our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We realize that someone has joy or sorrow by our mind and emotion, which are parts of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Similarly, we contact the third world, the spiritual world, by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John 4:24 says, "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is clear that we worship not by the body or the soul, with the mind and emotion, but by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because God is the divine Spirit, we must contact this divine Spirit by or in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is our spiritual part, by which or through which we contact the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may illustrate the three different kinds of contacts physical contact, psychological contact, and spiritual contact by the way we contact a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we come together, we shake hands; this is to contact the physical world by our physical part, our body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, we contact the brother not only by our physical part but also by our psychological part.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The brother may have had some problems at home, so while we shake his hand, he appears to not be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This may cause us to suspect that he is not happy with us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This kind of suspicion is not in the hand, that is, in the body, but in the mind of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then when we two kneel down to pray, he may utter something from his deepest part, his inward part.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that time we sense what is in his deepest, inmost part; we sense in our spirit what is in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this way, we come to realize that he was not actually unhappy with us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First we shake hands with the brother; this is the physical contact.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we suspect something about him; this is the psychological contact.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Finally, we pray together and sense something in our deepest part about what is in his deepest part; this is the spiritual contact.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now we can discern the three different parts of our being spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The spirit is absolutely different from the soul just as the soul is absolutely different from the body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes we have only physical contact with a brother with no psychological contact and, even the more, no spiritual contact.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At other times we may have physical contact and some sort of psychological contact as well, and sometimes we may have too much psychological contact with nearly no spiritual contact.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have been taught by the Lord very much for many years; so many times when I contact the brothers and sisters, I simply do not like to contact them much by the psychological part.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I mostly contact them by the spiritual part.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we contact the saints, we should try our best not to contact them by our psychology, by our soul, our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Rather, we should try to contact them by our spirit, although we may contact them a little by our body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a brother says, "Let me shake your hand," we should not refuse him, saying, "I do not want to contact you by the body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I will only contact you in the spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should contact people a little physically, but we must try to contact them mostly in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must learn the lesson to exercise our spirit to contact others' spirit.</S>
