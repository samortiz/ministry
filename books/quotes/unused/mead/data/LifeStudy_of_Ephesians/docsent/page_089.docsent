   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. In Shadows</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Along with the types, there are the shadows and figures of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although types and shadows are similar in certain respects, they are like human faces in that they not only share similarities, but also differ from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Types are mainly persons or things that signify Christ, whereas shadows mainly refer to rituals and practices in the Old Testament that portray Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to Colossians 2:16 and 17, eating regulations, rituals, and holy days were shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By this we see that the laws, ordinances, and ceremonies in the Old Testament were shadows portraying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But Adam, Aaron, and Moses were not shadows; they were types.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Sabbath day and the new moon, on the contrary, were shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although the Sabbath was a rest, it was not the real rest, for the real rest is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Likewise, the law as a testimony of God described what God was like.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As a description and explanation of God, the law was a testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this it was a shadow of Christ as the real explanation, definition, and testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>C. In Figures</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A figure mainly refers to a situation that presents a certain picture.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, the wandering of the children of Israel in the wilderness is a figure, a picture, of our experience in the Christian life today, which is often a life of wandering.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Passover is another figure.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although the Passover lamb is a type of Christ, the Passover itself is a figure depicting how Christ, our Passover, saves us from God s judgment and feeds us with what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the picture of the Passover is a figure of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is so rich that He needs not only types, but also shadows and figures to portray Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the types, shadows, and figures of Christ in the Old Testament are descriptions, explanations, and definitions of what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to study all these matters in the Scriptures in order to know the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>D. In Prophecies</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The riches of Christ are also seen in prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Bible the first prophecy concerning Christ is Genesis 3:15, a verse which predicts that Christ as the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This implies that Christ had to become a man born of a virgin, for He was to be the seed of woman.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is not the descendant of a man; He is the seed of a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This one verse reveals much of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Isaiah 9:6 is another prophecy regarding Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This verse gives us seven titles of Christ: Child, Son, Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Old Testament, there are a great many other prophecies of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even the short book of Zechariah contains many detailed prophecies concerning Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>E. In Fulfillment</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The riches of Christ are also seen in the fulfillment of the prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sometimes in the fulfillment of a prophecy in the New Testament something further is added.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, the Old Testament reveals that Christ will be the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But in the Old Testament, Christ is never called the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nevertheless, in the fulfillment of the prophecy regarding Christ as the lamb, He is called the Lamb of God John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What an addition this is!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When I was young, I was troubled by the fact that sometimes the New Testament writers added certain things when quoting the Old Testament prophecies concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I thought that they should not have gone beyond what was written in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Later I came to see that Christ could not be limited by the prophecies concerning Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When He came, He fulfilled more than what had been prophesied.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, our experience of Christ surpasses the fulfillment of the prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Actually, this is not adding something; it is experiencing the unlimited Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In our experience Christ is not only the Lamb of God, but the Lamb of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, the prophecy is short, the fulfillment is longer, and the experience is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we experience Christ in the fulfillment of the prophecies concerning Him, we do not add anything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rather, we enter into the eternal experience of the inexhaustible riches of Christ.</S>
