   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE SEVENTEEN COMMUNICATING SPIRITUAL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY SPIRITUAL WORDS TO SPIRITUAL MEN Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 2:11-16, 7, 10 LIVING CHRIST FOR THE EXPRESSION OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s intention is to make man His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to accomplish this, God desires to come into man to be his life so that man may live Him out.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For this, God became a man through incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually Christ, God incarnate, died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Through His crucifixion He terminated the entire old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, Christ s crucifixion involved not only the death of the Lord Jesus, but the termination of everything of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By means of this all-inclusive death, the divine life, which is actually God Himself, was released and imparted to God s predestinated, redeemed, and called people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By believing in the crucified and resurrected Christ, they have received the divine life and the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God s expectation is that they will now live by this life and walk by this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is to live Christ for the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, such a living should not be individualistic; on the contrary, it should be corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, God desires that His people be built together into His habitation, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is God s intention.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The believers at Corinth, most of whom were Greeks, received the initial gifts, the divine life and the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But after receiving these gifts, they did not live by them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They did not live by the divine life or walk by the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a result, they did not live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They failed to take Christ as their life, their content, and their everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead, they remained in their Greek culture and exulted in their wisdom and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was their situation at the time Paul wrote this Epistle to them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>LIVING CULTURE INSTEAD OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In writing to the Corinthians Paul seemed to be saying, You believers there in Corinth should drop your Greek culture, wisdom, and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead of being Greeks, you should now be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You should no longer live your Greek culture, exult in your philosophy, and boast in your wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You have received Christ, and God has put you into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now that God has made you Christians, you should take Christ as your life, content, and everything, and you should live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, this Christ is God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Greek wisdom is shallow, and it is foolishness in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But God s wisdom, the genuine wisdom, is deep and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is far beyond philosophical people to comprehend this wisdom, for it is a wisdom hidden in God and is even the depths of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This wisdom, the depths of God, is the very Christ in whom you have believed and whom you have received.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I urge you to exalt this Christ, take Him as your life and everything, and live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we understand this underlying concept, it will be much easier for us to understand the first two chapters of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Both Catholicism and Protestantism have departed from the revelation of Christ in these chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Catholicism has assimilated many pagan, demonic, satanic, and devilish things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The practice of Catholicism is to take in and absorb heathenism and paganism.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is documented in the book The Two Babylons and in the writings of G. H. Pember.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Protestantism has followed the practice of adapting to local culture.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As long as the elements of a culture are not sinful or idolatrous, they will be taken in by Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For example, in China many Protestant missionaries adopted Chinese ethics, and in India, they followed certain aspects of Indian culture.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As a result, the so-called church in China and in India became a cultural mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In China I saw that the missionaries were happy when the Chinese adopted western culture.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The missionaries were also willing to take in the local culture.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, Christianity in China became a mixture of Chinese culture and western culture.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Apparently such a mixture is not as demonic or satanic as the paganism in Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In principle, however, both are the same, for both preach Christ, but do not help people to live Christ, to take Him as their life, living, content, and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What kind of living did you have when you were in organized Christianity?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Instead of living Christ, did you not live according to your culture?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Surely no one taught you to live Christ, to take Christ as your life and content.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Did anyone tell you to breathe Christ, drink Christ, and eat Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All this is foreign to most of today s Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In principle, the situation among believers today is the same as that among the believers in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Corinthian believers received Christ, but they did not live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They did not have the concept that Christ should be their life, their living, and their content.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Instead, their thoughts were focused on Greek culture, wisdom, and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Furthermore, they exulted in their wisdom and boasted in their philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This caused them to think differently from one another and to have different preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some preferred Paul, others preferred Cephas, and still others preferred Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As a result, they were divided.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This division was the root of the evil and confusion among them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The situation among Christians today is the same as that of the church at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, all Christians, including us, need this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to be helped by this book to drop everything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>No matter what your culture or nationality may be, you need to drop it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We all must forsake our culture, philosophy, ethics, and traditions and center on Christ as our unique portion.</S>
