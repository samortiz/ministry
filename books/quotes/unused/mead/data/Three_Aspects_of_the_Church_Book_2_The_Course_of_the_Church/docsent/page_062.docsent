   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN OUR ATTITUDE IN THIS AGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we want to know what attitude we should have toward today s Christianity, we must understand God s attitude toward Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should have God s attitude toward Christianity in the present age.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>GOD S ATTITUDE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The light and prophecies in the New Testament show God s heart s desire and His attitude toward Christianity in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On one hand, God is dissatisfied with the desolated, confused, and transmuted condition of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God condemns divisions, mixture with the world, human organization by human will, falling into Babylon, and affording opportunities to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the other hand, although God condemns these things, He does not intend to eliminate these things in this age or even to forbid them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It seems that God not only allows these things to exist but also to continually increase.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, the number of sects in Christianity will increase over time, and Christianity will become more and more worldly and confused.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God dislikes and condemns these situations, but He seems to allow them to continue.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God does not intend to eliminate them immediately, and He does not even limit them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It seems as though God does not control them but allows them to go on freely.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>OUR ATTITUDE On the Negative Side Not Participating,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not Interfering, Not Criticizing, and Not Mentioning</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Based on God s attitude, we should have two attitudes toward Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, if we receive mercy from the Lord, we should not participate in the confused, deformed situation in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although God does not eliminate or forbid such an improper condition, He does say, Come out of her, My people Rev 18:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Simply stated, one who lives before God, cares for God s heart s desire, has inner light, and is willing to pay the price cannot remain in organized Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am not exhorting people to leave the denominations; this is not a matter of whether a person is in a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, it is a matter of avoiding mixture with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second, we are foolish if we think that we can alter the condition of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Such thinking assumes that we are greater and more capable than God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some people say, The churches are divided; let us make them one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Twenty-five years ago I also felt this way; however, I now feel that to say such a thing would indicate that I do not know myself and that to try to do such a thing would be to try to do what God Himself will not do.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To hope to correct Christianity and eliminate its mistakes is to be foolish and proud.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Who can reform Christianity?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We cannot do it because God is not doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Of course, if God wanted to do it, He would have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, God s Word shows that He is not reforming Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since He is not doing it, why should we try?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, on the one hand, we should not participate in Christianity, and on the other hand, we should not try to intervene in its situation; we should not even criticize Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not our place to criticize Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we understand correctly, we should not even mention the condition of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we preach the gospel, give messages, and visit or fellowship with people, we should not mention Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christianity is not our topic, and we should not intervene in, criticize, or even mention it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christianity should not be in our eyes and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This does not mean that because of pride we do not look at anyone else; rather, to have Christianity in our thoughts is a waste of our time because we have no way or ability to do anything helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the Positive Side</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ministering Life and Preaching the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the positive side, we should learn to know life and the Lord s way, how to live in God s presence, and how to be practically joined to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In addition, we should seize every opportunity to minister life to others and to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The word of the gospel and the word of life should fill our mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The one thing we should do in this age is receive mercy from the Lord to stand in the breach and carry out the things the church should do but has not been doing Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>22:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church is the Body of Christ and the place where God is mingled with man; the church is the dwelling place of God for His expression on earth and the place where Christ manifests His victory among men.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church should be these things, but it has fallen short.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is our responsibility to stand in the breach and carry out these things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we receive more grace, we should learn to fight for God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church should fight for God, but it has not been doing so.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church s greatest commission is to preach the gospel to the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should give our all to go everywhere spreading the gospel of God under the leading and by the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, wherever we go, we should not speak of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not mention it when preaching the gospel or edifying the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christianity is not our topic.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord does not want us to speak of Christianity; instead, He has commissioned us with the gospel and with life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We preach the gospel to the world and minister life to the believers.</S>
