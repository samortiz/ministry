   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DEGRADED CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why is there the need of the sevenfold intensification of the one unique Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is because at the time of the writing of the book of Revelation, the church had become degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the day of Pentecost the church was initiated, and for the accomplishing of the proper church life there was the need of elders and deacons, as well as certain regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, the sisters practiced the headship in a living way by wearing a head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But not long after the church life was established, it became another religion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Jews did the same thing with the commandments in the Old Testament given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They systematized everything and put it together to make a dead religion called Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The living Christ is against any kind of dead, systematized religion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When He came, He behaved in a way that denied, rejected, and renounced everything of religious Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While they were keeping the regulations and forms, offering sacrifices on the altar, and worshipping God in the temple according to scriptural instructions, the Lord Jesus never joined them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Who was He?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was the very God whom they presumed to worship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the very God was not in the temple anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While they were praying and worshipping in a formal and religious way, Jesus went into a common house in Bethany John 12:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that time, where was God?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Was He in the temple or in that common house?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is certain that He was in that common house.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The religious people thought they had the proper worship according to their Scriptures, yet they did not know that they missed God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God had no intention of keeping all those religious regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He purposely did things to break their religious Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Gospel of Matthew tells us that He did things again and again on the Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He led His disciples to eat in the cornfield on the Sabbath day Matt 12:1 , and the religious Sabbath patrol caught them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They caught a Sabbath breaker, and the Sabbath breaker was God incarnated as a man!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God came to break the regulations of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>MISSING THE REALITY OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do you think that God cares for religion?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I can tell you that He does not.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why when we come to the book of Revelation, there is the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not long after its establishment, the church became a religion, with positions, regulations, and forms, having little that was living or real.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the first three chapters of Revelation, the churches, with the exception of the church in Philadelphia, had become degraded and had missed the reality of Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They worshipped an objective Christ, One who was sitting in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They had very little if any experience of Christ as the life-giving Spirit indwelling them as a spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They had degraded into religion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why in the book of Revelation it is difficult to find any kind of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no doctrine of justification, holiness, foot washing, head covering, or baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There are absolutely no forms or positions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no mention of elders or deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this book there is nothing but the sevenfold Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ as the life-giving Spirit today must be intensified!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not need to talk so much about doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need the intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How poor it is to degrade into a religion and leave the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In today s Christianity, nearly everything is forms, regulations, doctrines, and positions.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even the singing has become formal.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All of this must be cast into the lake of fire!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We do not need all these formal, religious things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need the living Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>So many sisters cover their head in the meetings, but when they get home, they cover the head of their husband.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is no spirituality, just a form.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord hates this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>With our headcovering we need the sevenfold intensified Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everything in the church life must have the sevenfold Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The leading ones in the churches in Revelation are not called elders, but angels.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These angels are the shining stars in the Lord s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is no position; they are just the shining ones.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But in today s Christianity there are all kinds of positions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the church life we do not need positions; we need the shining ones burning with the sevenfold Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the book of Revelation, the Lord denounces all forms.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is only the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is another change in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Matthew 28:19, the Spirit is ranked third in the mentioning of the Triune God: ...baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But in Revelation 1:4-5, the order is changed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Here we see that the seven Spirits are listed second.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I did not change the one Spirit to the seven Spirits, and I did not make the Spirit second instead of third.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is all mentioned by John in the book of Revelation.</S>
