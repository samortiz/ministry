<p>The saints who serve full time in the Lord&rsquo;s work and the responsible brothers who take the lead in the churches should set aside a substantial amount of time every day in order to study the Bible. They must treat this matter seriously and be consistent. There have been times when a saint came to fellowship with me, but I told him that I did not have time because I was reading the Bible. I regard reading the Bible to be more important than anything else. In our daily living we should have a time to read the Bible. We should not consider reading the Bible as a pastime or think that other things are more important. Reading the Bible is indispensable and cannot be put aside. We must keep the time to read our Bible. There are letters that I have yet to reply to because I must spend time to read the Bible. I cannot put my Bible aside simply to reply to these letters. If our Bible reading is always being interrupted for various reasons, sooner or later we will discover that we have suffered a great loss. This is true especially for those who minister the word. If they do not spend an adequate amount of time to read the Bible, they should not expect their speaking to be rich and strong.</p>
<p>When we read Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, we sense that he was well versed in the Old Testament; hence, he was able to quote it skillfully and with ease. This is not our condition; hence, our messages are poor. Sometimes we do not have anything to say because we do not have a thorough knowledge of the Bible. Sometimes we see situations in the church, but we do not have the words to meet the need; we are not able to cause the saints to be open and vital. If our Bible reading is thorough, we will not only be able to meet every need; we will also be able to bring vitality to the church life through the enlightenment and revelation that we receive from the Bible. This is the way to lead the churches forward. For example, we should be able to spend three months to speak concerning the worship of the church as portrayed in Deuteronomy. As a result of such speaking, the saints would be led to pursue this kind of worship.</p>
<p>We must always use our spirit to contact the Spirit. As we learn the meanings of words in the Bible and study the allegories, deal with our heart, our mind, and our emotion, and receive some training, we will touch the Lord whenever we read the Bible. When we read the Lord&rsquo;s Word, using our spirit to contact the Spirit, we will be fed and satisfied; we will be inwardly watered and refreshed. Moreover, we will have the ability to experience this any time of the day.</p>
<p>When we use our spirit to contact the Spirit, we will gain a deeper understanding of the Bible. We will touch the desire of God&rsquo;s heart and receive fresh revelations. Reading the Bible by studying it and using the Bible to touch the Spirit are interdependent and support each other. If we consistently practice to study the Bible and to touch the Spirit in the Bible, we will gain a substantial understanding of the Bible. We will discover that the sections we never understood will become clear to us. We will be skilled in reading the Bible, and our mind will be trained to understand the sense in our spirit. Thus, the Bible will be an open book to us.</p>
<p>Not only so, the Bible will be a living book. We are not superstitious, but we will be able to say that whenever we contact the Bible, we touch God. Furthermore, we will not touch God in a superficial way; we will touch the desire of God&rsquo;s heart as well as His thoughts. He will open Himself to us through His words. This is the way to be persons who know the Bible and who receive the benefit of the Bible.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_030.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
