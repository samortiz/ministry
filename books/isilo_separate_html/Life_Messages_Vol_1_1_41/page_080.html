When I was studying to be a preacher of the gospel in an organization, it was drilled into me that I had to have a burden for souls. I would feel guilty if I didn&#8217;t say something about the Lord to every one I met on the street, or at least give him a tract. We have to fulfill the Great Commission, &#8220;Go ye and teach all nations&#8221; (Matt. 28:19), but can I go without being sent (Rom. 10:14-15)?</I><p>Drop all these complications, even though they are based upon the Scriptures. Come back to the simplicity of Christ. Enjoy Him day by day. Live Him, grow Him, and produce Him. He will lead us on.<p>Let me give you my personal testimony. I was saved in 1925. I had a heart of love for the Lord and for His Word. After seven and a half years the Lord raised up a church in my home town, mainly through me. I had no plan. The Lord sent people to me. News was spread about the meeting, and people came and were attracted. They realized Christ was there. In less than one year the number went from two to about one hundred.<p>Our leading from the Lord was to be His testimony in China. We had no intention to come to the Western world to spread His recovery throughout the whole world. However, when the time came, the Lord scattered us and I was sent to this country. Is it not ironic that a Chinese from a heathen country should be sent by the Lord to this most advanced country where Christianity has held sway for so many years? This was surely not by my design. Yet the Lord&#8217;s recovery has spread, not only throughout the United States, but also to Europe, South America, Africa, and Australasia.<p>This is a strong testimony that if we love the Lord, contact Him, live Him, and grow Him, He will spread Himself through us. We are branches of the vine, branching out the very Christ, not by our plans or activities, but just by our living. This is the way of life.<p><I>How can I know the Lord&#8217;s leading in the matter of preaching the gospel? I often have the feeling when I&#8217;m alone with someone that I should say something to him about the Lord, but on the other hand I feel ridiculous approaching total strangers.</I><p>Here is another case of one of the Lord&#8217;s seekers having become complicated either by Christianity or by himself. To get out of this entanglement, drop all your consideration. In a simple way contact the Lord and live Him day by day. It may be that, as you spontaneously seek His leading, you will have a burden to say a word to someone concerning the Lord; if so, do it. Another time the Lord may bring someone to you. Then, just speak according to your inner sense. Don&#8217;t analyze. Don&#8217;t make a decision that from now on you will speak to a certain number of people every day. Don&#8217;t decide to speak to someone at work about the Lord. Just abide in Him. The Lord may lead you to someone or may lead someone to you. You can then spontaneously say something. Be delivered from your endeavoring and striving. The Christian life is an easy yoke, a pleasant burden. Consider the clusters of grapes on a vine. Without any decision, schedule, or plan, these clusters come forth, according to the inner life of the branches. As the inner life grows, the clusters spontaneously appear.<p>Be at peace and rest in the Lord. Whatever comes to you as a problem, reject. The Lord does not send complications, but only life, peace, and rest.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_079.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_081.html">Next</a> </body></html>
