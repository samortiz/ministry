We have to fear the Lord as our Head. In the church life, we all have to learn to be subject one to another. Not only should the young ones be subject to the older ones, but also the older ones should be subject to the young ones in the fear of Christ (Eph. 5:21; 1 Pet. 5:5). This means that we should honor and regard Christ as the Head. In the church, we are not the head. He is the Head, and we should be careful not to offend Him.</P><P>We need to be aware of the seriousness of being in the eldership. The young ones should hate their pride; the middle-aged ones should hate the thinking that they are heroic; and the old ones should hate their opinions. We should try the best to fulfill our duty in this way under His economy. Due to our past history, I feel that what I have spoken here as a warning is needed. If we remain in the recovery in our pride, our thought of being a hero, or our opinions, we will be the first ones to suffer, and we will cause the church to suffer.</P><P>Some middle-aged brothers wear a mask in the eldership. A mask is a falsehood; it is hypocrisy. To appear in a way other than what you really are is to wear a mask. In front of one person, you may act one way. Then in front of another person, you will act in another way. This kind of pretense is hateful in the eyes of the Lord. The Lord likes to see truthfulness, sincerity, and faithfulness. In the eldership one of the most important lessons to learn is to be truthful, faithful, and sincere. We should not be two-faced. We should be one person with one genuine face. To be hypocritical cuts off your future in the recovery. The Lord knows our heart. The ones who last in the eldership are those who are honest, faithful, truthful, and sincere.</P><P>My burden in this elders' meeting is to try my best to fellowship with you all concerning the real problem among us today. Pride, the thought of being a hero, and opinions are the factors working something out secretly to damage one thing&#151;the Body of Christ. As long as I am proud, the Body of Christ is through with me. As long as I am thinking that I am the one who is a hero, the Body of Christ is gone. If opinion is here, the Body of Christ is frustrated. If we are in any of these three items, the Body is annulled.</P><P>In fact Christ does have a Body, but in practicality this Body has been crippled, annulled, and to some extent destroyed. Christ does have a Body, but where is the proper Body? Where is the Body that functions? If you have one of these three problems&#151;pride, the thought of being a hero, or opinions&#151;in practicality the Body is absent in your locality. When your problem is present, the Body of Christ is absent.</P><P>Now we want to see two crucial points concerning knowing the Body. We need to know the Body in the Spirit and in practice.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_067.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_069.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 11: The Eldership and the God-Ordained Way (3) &nbsp; pg 68</div><br></body></html>
