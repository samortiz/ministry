   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In Babylon there was no temple, only shrines.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It was the place of origin for idols.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was also the place where idols were most prevalent.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All idol worship in this world originated in Babel, which is Shinar and Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From the first chapter of Daniel, we can see that the whole world was under the authority of the king of Babylon; they all served the god of Babel, were under Satan's dominion, and were even worshipping Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The whole earth was under this kind of condition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Among them there was a people, the Israelites, who should have been separated.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Israelites did not belong to Babylon; they should not have been under Babel's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They should not have worshipped the gods of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They lived originally in the land of Canaan, a place away from Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Among them they had only the temple and no shrines.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They worshipped only God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, by the time of Daniel 1, even the Israelites were carried away to the world of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The people separated by God were carried away to follow Satan's current.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, by then everyone, including the Gentiles and the Israelites, was under Babel's ruling and was worshipping the Babylonian gods.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, they all fell under Satan's ruling and were following Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the picture that Daniel shows us from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This picture clearly shows us that the whole world was under Babylon's ruling and was worshipping the god of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Consequently, God's authority was laid aside and God's glory was not expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the contrary, Satan had dominion and was ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was expressed and was worshipped by men.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the picture in Daniel 1.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At this time, although Daniel and his three friends were still very young, they stood up to be an anti-testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This anti-testimony is a separation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As soon as they stood up, there was clearly a separation from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was as if others were waving a black flag and they were waving a white one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we read Daniel 1, we must grasp the meaning of this picture.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These men did not follow the tide of Babylon at all.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They were the separated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They could not eat what others could eat.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They could not drink what others could drink.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They could not do what others could do.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They were clearly different from others in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I do not know if the young people have ever realized by reading Daniel that even in his old age, Daniel was still a separated person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He did many things that no one who was in the world would do.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, he did not do the things that the world did.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There was always a separation between him and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Young people, you must realize that today s age is the same as Daniel's age; they are not at all different.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not only the Gentiles are under the ruling of Babylon; even the so-called people of God, so-called Christianity, are also in captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is especially true during Christmas, when the whole of Christianity is carried away!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everyone in the world is walking on the same road, and everyone is swept into the same current.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not only do we see the whole world dancing, even those in Christianity are also dancing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Dancing has even come to Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, everyone in the world, Gentiles and God's people alike, has been swept into this current; they have all fallen under the same authority and are worshipping the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Israelites in those days were only Israelites outwardly; in reality they were not much different from the Babylonians.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They ate what the Babylonians ate.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They drank what the Babylonians drank.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They worshipped whatever idols the Babylonians worshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The situation is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many are Christians outwardly, but actually they are demon worshippers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They do what the Gentiles do.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They worship whatever the Gentiles worship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They highly esteem what the Gentiles highly esteem.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For this reason, the tide of the whole world has come under Satan's ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today, Satan has taken everyone captive and has made it impossible for God to do anything on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Unless Satan gains man first, he cannot damage God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Unless God gains man first, He cannot accomplish His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Man indeed occupies an important position between God and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since Satan today has carried away everyone on earth, the first characteristic of a person used by God to turn the age must be that of a strong standing and a clear separation from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Such a person must stand up and declare, "I cannot do what the world does.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I cannot eat and drink what others eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I cannot walk the way they walk.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I cannot have a part in the kind of life that they live.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I am always somewhat different from them."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The first characteristic of those who turn the age is an absoluteness in standing on God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Such a person sees through everything that belongs to the tide of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Not only will he not follow those things, but his heart grieves and burns because of them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>With respect to many things, he stands in a position of separation and becomes an anti-testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Young people are most susceptible to follow others in their manner of living.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, the first things Daniel overcame were in the matter of living, things related to eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Many times young people feel that since others can do something, they can do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They feel that since everyone else is doing it, it is all right for them to do it also.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Please remember that if we do this, we will become completely useless in God's hand in the matter of turning the age.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is because we do not stand on God's side, but rather on Satan's side.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we do this, we can never be used by God to turn the age.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hence, we must have a separation from those in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must stand up and be an anti-testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although the tide around us is downward, inwardly we are standing up against the tide.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Others may play and amuse themselves, but we will not do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Others may have all kinds of cravings, but we cannot have the same.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Of course, I am not suggesting that we be peculiar persons.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>That is not what I mean.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Nevertheless, we must remember that in an age where the tide is downward, to be used by God as a person to turn the age, we must be separated persons; we must be able to stand up as an anti-testimony for God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is the first necessary characteristic.</S>
