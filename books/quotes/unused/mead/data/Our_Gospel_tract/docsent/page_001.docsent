   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Our Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before the Lord Jesus ascended into heaven, He charged His disciples to go forth and preach the gospel everywhere Matt 28:19; Mark 16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We, His believers, bear this burden joyfully, for God s power to save everyone who believes is contained in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man s highest honor is to proclaim the gospel to men.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The gospel we proclaim is abundantly rich and extensive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is the gospel of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Apostle Paul says it most clearly: To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, our gospel is simply Jesus Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ s Person</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ is God, from eternity past to eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of the Three of the Triune God, He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was the Creator of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All things came into being through Him John 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In time, He became a man and partook of our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is the perfect man, having our created nature but without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He died on the cross as a man to fulfill all the righteous requirements placed on us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, He has become our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But even further, He is our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet His salvation is not only from punishment, but much more it is a salvation in the divine life Rom 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When He was born to be a man, He was named Jesus, which means Jehovah the Savior or Jehovah the salvation Matt 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is the Christ, the Messiah John 1:41 , the One anointed by God to accomplish God s plan or economy Eph 3:11; 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He was on this earth, He was called the Lord Luke 2:11; Matt 3:3 because He is eternally God; and after He resurrected and ascended, He, as a man, was made Lord of all Acts 2:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is the last Adam, who became a life-giving Spirit in resurrection 1 Cor 15:45 to enter His believers and give them life 1 John 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today He is their life and their resurrection John 11:25; 3:15; Phil 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ s Accomplishments</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is not only a wonderful Person but also One who has accomplished so much.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His accomplishments are just as much a part of our gospel as His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His first major accomplishment was His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit in the womb of a human virgin Matt 1:18, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When He was born, He was fully God and fully man, a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a man, He experienced human living for over thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He lived as a lowly man cf.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Isa 53:2 and touched all kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He experienced human sufferings, sorrows, despisings, rejections Isa 53:3 , trials, and temptations Heb 2:18; 4:15 .</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Indeed, He was fully man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After experiencing a full human living, the Lord Jesus accomplished an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He died as the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the cross He was lifted up as the bronze serpent, just as Moses lifted up the bronze serpent in the wilderness and the children of Israel lived John 3:14; Num 21:4-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Though He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin Rom 8:3 , He did not possess the sinful, serpentine nature Heb 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was made sin on our behalf 2 Cor 5:21 , and He died to deal with our sinful nature as well as with the source of our sin, the old serpent, who is the devil Satan Rev 20:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His death was also as a grain of wheat falling into the earth and dying John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It not only dealt with all the negative things in the universe but also released the divine life to His believers that they might be His many fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By such an all-inclusive death He accomplished His eternal redemption for us Heb 9:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ accomplished resurrection 1 Cor 15:4 as well.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His resurrection was God s vindication and approval of Him and of His work and becomes the proof of our justification before God Rom 4:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By His resurrection He triumphed over Satan, death, Hades, and the grave Heb 2:14; Acts 2:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, after nullifying death through His death, He brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel by His resurrection 2 Tim 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In resurrection Christ came back to the disciples and breathed into them that they might receive the Holy Spirit as their life essentially John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then He ascended and sat at the right hand of God, far above all in the universe Mark 16:19; Eph 1:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After His ascension He poured out the Spirit of power upon His believers that He might be their power economically Acts 2:4; 10:44-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By this, He baptized all the believers once for all into the Spirit and into His one Body 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ s Attainments and Obtainments</S>

   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As the God-man, with both the divine and the human natures, He has attained to the peak of divine attributes and human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In His human living He lived out the divine attributes in His human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then in His resurrection and as the exalted God-man in ascension, He uplifted the human virtues to their highest degree so that the divine attributes may be expressed in humanity for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This glorified God-man has obtained the throne Heb 12:2 , glory and honor Heb 2:9 , a name which is above every name Phil 2:9-11 , the Lordship Acts 2:36 , and the Leadership Acts 5:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ s Work</S>

   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is the High Priest to the believers Heb 4:14 , interceding for them before God that they may be saved to the uttermost Heb 7:24-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In Him the believers have an Advocate before the righteous God; He pleads our case and offers Himself as our propitiation 1 John 2:1-2 , the offering that appeases God for us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When Christ returns, He will transfigure the body of our humiliation Phil 3:20-21 , thereby redeeming our bodies that we may enjoy the full sonship Rom 8:23 .</S>
