<P>Please do not misunderstand the teaching of the Bible. Although the Bible has never taught us that a man must be ordained before he can preach and teach and before he can administer the bread or baptize others, it has never annulled the works that Christians have been set apart to do. The work of preaching is established by God. This is a distinctive feature of the church. It does not mean that since the Bible has no record of any ordination that leads to a clerical class that transcends over other brothers, there is, therefore, no such thing as the ministry of preaching in the Bible. Actually, the Bible, on the one hand, opposes the establishment of a hierarchy in the Lord's church and the division into the ordained and the unordained ones. Yet on the other hand, the Bible strongly upholds the importance of the work of preaching. It is true that all Christians should be witnesses, but the Bible clearly tells us that there is a group of people who are set apart especially for this work. God gives the gift of preaching to some and not to all. Yet the purpose of this giving is for all. No one who truly understands God's word can say that every Christian is an evangelist, a shepherd, or a teacher. There is only a minority among all Christians who can do these works. The Bible regards the work of preaching to be more important than man regards it today. The Bible teaches us that everyone who preaches for the Lord does so by receiving the gift from the Head of the church, who takes care of His people under His direction. These workers receive their ministry from God and are responsible to God and God alone. However, the present organizational way as practiced by many serves only to make a person the servant of man. God's honored servants have been greatly despised by His people! Although on the one hand, these servants have been placed on a high pedestal and have been assigned the oversight of a congregation or a chapel, they, on the other hand, have been bound from acting according to the Bible and must instead follow man's tradition and organization and must deal with man with an "artificial" conscience, while coming short in their own conscience towards God! Under such circumstances it seems that for a servant of God to be faithful to man's tradition, organization, and definition is equivalent to being faithful to the Lord!</P><P>The work of preaching that I am talking about is the work of evangelizing, teaching, or shepherding done by those who are working exclusively for the Lord. According to the Bible, this kind of preaching work is very ordinary. The church of God is the Body of Christ. In the Body, every member is a member of Christ. Other than this, the Bible does not know of any "church membership." There is only one Body of Christ; it is not many bodies. In the same way, there is only one church and not many churches. Everyone belongs to this unique church. We are not constituents of a sect or members of a denomination. Other than being members of this Body, we have no other title of membership or affiliation. As members, we belong to Christ. Those who do not belong to Christ are not His members. The church is composed of all the individual members together. All those who are not the members of the Lord do not belong to the church. All titles of membership and affiliation are vain and worthless and are invented by man. The Bible is only concerned with the question of being a member or not being a member. Since every individual is a member, and since the members do not have independent works, no two works of any two individuals can be the same. It is impossible for everyone to be the ear or to be the eye. Rather, everyone should serve one another and help one another. In addition to being faithful in one's own work and helping those members who are related to him, every member must also work for the benefit of the whole Body.</P><P>The apostle taught us clearly that every member has its gift. "For just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, so we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. And having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us..." (Rom. 12:4-6). Following this Paul mentioned the functions of many gifts. In 1 Corinthians 12 Paul mentioned these gifts again. He said that these gifts are the "manifestation of the Spirit" (v. 7). Hence, a person who has a gift is a person who has in him the manifestation of the Holy Spirit for the profit of others. If he has the gift, he should exercise it and should be responsible to the Lord for it. The Lord does not give gifts to man in vain. When one has the gift, he has to do the work of preaching and has the authority to do such a work. What I have, I should use for the benefit of others. If others receive my help, they do not need to ask if I have been commissioned to do such a work.</P><P>This is the nature of the work of preaching as taught by the Bible. It is very simple and straightforward. Each individual member serves the other through love and by the power received from God for the benefit of all and for the building of the whole Body, without ostracizing anyone or cutting off anyone. All the gifts are put into the same common bank, and everyone becomes richer from these deposits. The manifestation of the Holy Spirit and the blessing of the Lord is God's mark of approval. Given these things, there is no need for any suggestion from fleshly opinions. Although not everyone is a teacher and not everyone can teach the word of God before others, those who are the teachers are but members of the whole Body. Their works are to teach the Bible and to edify others with God's word. In all other things, they still have to receive the help and edification of the other members. Everyone is useful, and everyone is a member. If we disproportionately uplift the gift of the teachers, the evangelists, or the shepherds and regard their works as the whole work, or if we exalt those works done in public more than those services done in private, we do not understand the function of the Body of Christ in the church of God. There may be a difference in importance among the different works and gifts, but we must know that everyone has his realm, and that despite the difference in importance, no one can take over another's work, and no one can say that the less weighty ones are the useless ones.</P><P>Other than the above groups of people, is there no other group? Is there no one else who is ordained? Is that all there is, or should there be others who are ordained? Here we are on a completely different question, one that is separate and isolated from the previous one. It is true that in the ancient church, there were two kinds of officers commissioned (or ordained) to their specific tasks. One was the deacons. The deacons were the ones who managed the fund for helping the poor. They were selected by the saints and were ordained, or commissioned, by the authority of the apostles. The second kind was the elders. As the name implies, they were naturally the ones who were mature both in age and in virtue. They were the ones who served as "overseers" in the separate churches, overseeing the condition of the people. If we read Titus 1:5, 7 and Acts 20:17, 28, we will realize that the elders are the overseers. The term "elder" refers to the person, and the term "overseer" refers to the work.</P>
