The belief in two life-giving Spirits is contrary to the truth. In 1977 I put out a booklet entitled What a Heresy-Two Divine Fathers, Two Life-giving Spirits, and Three Gods! In this booklet we point out that according to 1 Corinthians 15:45, the last Adam, who is Christ, became a life-giving Spirit. Some twist this verse, saying that it speaks of &#8220;a life-giving Spirit,&#8221; not &#8220;the life-giving Spirit.&#8221; But besides the Holy Spirit who gives life, is there another Spirit who gives life? To say that there are two Spirits giving life is to teach a great heresy. Whether the article is definite or indefinite, the last Adam, who is Christ Himself, became a Spirit who gives life. At this point we must refer to John 6:63, where the Lord says, &#8220;It is the Spirit who gives life.&#8221; In this chapter the Lord Jesus said that He was the bread of life to give life to people. Eventually, He indicated that in order to be life as the bread of life, He must be the Spirit, for it is the Spirit who gives life. Furthermore, 2 Corinthians 3:6 says, &#8220;The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.&#8221; Is not the Spirit in this verse the Holy Spirit? Can we say that besides this Holy Spirit who gives life there is another Spirit who gives life? No, we should not say this.<p>A second way of twisting 1 Corinthians 15:45 is to say that the life-giving Spirit here is not the Holy Spirit, but the spirit of Christ as a person. Those who twist the verse in this manner say that just as we have a spirit, so Christ also has a spirit. Then they proceed to say that the Spirit here is the spirit of Christ, not the Holy Spirit. Certainly, the Spirit in this verse is the Spirit of Christ. But do you believe that besides the Holy Spirit there is another Spirit who is the Spirit of Christ? To put the matter another way, do you believe that besides the Spirit of Christ there is another Spirit called the Holy Spirit? I do not think that anyone with an enlightened understanding would believe this.<p>Those who twist 1 Corinthians 15:45 in this manner may not know that the Holy Spirit today is not only the Spirit of God, but also the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9) and even the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7, lit.). Romans 8:9 testifies that the Spirit of God today is the Spirit of Christ, and Philippians 1:19 testifies that the Spirit of Christ is also the Spirit of Jesus Christ. In his book, The Spirit of Christ, in a chapter entitled, &#8220;The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus,&#8221; Andrew Murray says that after Christ&#8217;s ascension the Holy Spirit did not come as before. In the Old Testament He came only as the Spirit of God, but after the resurrection and ascension of Christ, the Spirit came not only as the Spirit of God, but also as the Spirit of the Man, Christ. Furthermore, John 7:39 says that prior to Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection this Spirit was &#8220;not yet.&#8221; However, the Spirit of God was already there. Today the Holy Spirit is not only the Spirit of God, but also the Spirit of Christ. This Spirit, who is the Spirit both of God and of Christ, is the life-giving Spirit. After His resurrection, through His resurrection, and in His resurrection, Christ became such a life-giving Spirit. Undoubtedly, this is the life-giving Holy Spirit.<p>Paul was careful in writing 1 Corinthians 15:45. He did not say, &#8220;The last Adam became a spirit.&#8221; He added the modifier, &#8220;life-giving,&#8221; saying, &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&#8221; This modifier leaves no ground for argument. Who is the Spirit who gives life? Do you believe that besides the Holy Spirit, there is another divine Spirit who gives life? The truth is that there is only one divine Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of Christ, who gives life. The immeasurable Spirit in John 3 is the very life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45.<p>The Bible is profound, but what is conveyed in the ancient creeds is incomplete and too simple. For example, the ancient creeds do not speak of the seven Spirits, a very important matter in the New Testament. In the last book of the Bible, the book of Revelation, the seven Spirits are spoken of emphatically (Rev. 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6). However, there is no mention of the seven Spirits in any of the ancient creeds. Because these creeds are not complete, some Christian groups declare that the only creed they hold to is the Bible. We would follow them to make the same kind of statement. We do not have any creed except the Bible. Because no creed is complete, we take the entire Bible as our only creed.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John &nbsp; pg 52</div><br></body></html>
