<h2 class="head1">THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF MORALITY<br />CONSTITUTING THE QUALIFICATION<br />AND THE BASIC FACTOR<br />FOR THE MAN-SAVIOR&rsquo;S DYNAMIC SALVATION</h2><p>The highest standard of morality constitutes the qualification for the Man-Savior&rsquo;s dynamic salvation. Only the Man-Savior has this qualification; no other person, including Confucius and Plato, is so qualified. In the Gospel of Luke there are a number of cases illustrating that the Man-Savior&rsquo;s standard of morality qualifies Him for dynamic salvation. The best illustration is the parable of the good Samaritan (10:25-37). This Samaritan lived the highest standard of morality, and He saved the fallen one by His standard of morality.</p><p>The highest standard of morality also constitutes the basic factor for the Man-Savior&rsquo;s dynamic salvation. We see this in the case of Zaccheus (19:1-10). Because of the Man-Savior&rsquo;s dynamic salvation, Zaccheus became another person immediately after coming into contact with Him.</p><p>When the Man-Savior came to the house of Zaccheus, He came with the Spirit of power (Luke 4:18) and with the indestructible eternal life (Heb. 7:16) to impart into him at his believing in Him (John 3:15). The Spirit of power and the eternal life were both conveyed in the highest standard of His morality. When He, as such a dynamic Man-Savior, looked at Zaccheus and said to him, &ldquo;Zaccheus, hurry and come down; for today I must stay in your house,&rdquo; Zaccheus responded.</p><p>We may compare Zaccheus to an electrical toy that responds as soon as electricity flows into it. What made Zaccheus respond as he did? It was the Spirit with the eternal life, as the divine electricity, that flowed into him from the Man-Savior. Without the Spirit, there would have been no way for Him as the eternal life to get into Zaccheus. His humanity in the highest standard of morality was the &ldquo;wire&rdquo; conveying the &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; of the Spirit with the eternal life. The Spirit with the eternal life as the divine electricity was within the Lord&rsquo;s humanity of the highest standard. When He looked at Zaccheus and talked to him, the Spirit with His eternal life entered into him.</p><p>During the years of His ministry on earth, the Lord Jesus was like a great magnet drawing people to Himself. Attracted by Him, the disciples left everything to follow Him. We know from the four Gospels that great crowds went after Him. We also have been drawn to Him by His powerful Person. The reason we spend so much time in meetings is that we have been attracted to the Man-Savior. We have been drawn by His dynamic saving power. The Man-Savior&rsquo;s dynamic saving power is constituted of His highest standard of morality in which His powerful Spirit and eternal life are.</p><p>The Triune God is a mystery, and the incarnation of Christ is also a great mystery. Furthermore, the Man-Savior&rsquo;s living on earth was mysterious. First, He was a magnet attracting His followers. Eventually, He came into His followers and made each one of them a mystery. This is the reason that, as believers, we are a mystery to our relatives and friends. They do not understand what we are doing day by day and why we are doing it. Actually, we are all living a mysterious life.</p><p>Our being a mystery is altogether due to the Man-Savior, the God-man, whose divine attributes fill His human virtues to produce the highest standard of morality. As we have emphasized in this message, the Man-Savior&rsquo;s highest standard of morality constitutes the qualification for His dynamic salvation; it also constitutes the basic factor for this salvation. How marvelous!</p><p>What we have been covering in this message is not merely a doctrine. We have been considering a living Person, the God-man with the highest standard of morality as His saving power. We should not be content with teachings&mdash;we need the Man-Savior with His dynamic salvation. I encourage you to bring to the Lord this matter of the Man-Savior&rsquo;s highest standard of morality constituting His qualification and the basic factor for His dynamic salvation. If you bring this to the Lord in prayer, I believe that He as the Spirit will speak more to you concerning His highest standard of morality.</p>
