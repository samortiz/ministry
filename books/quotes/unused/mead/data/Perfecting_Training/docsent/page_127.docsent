   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SIN IN OUR MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to Romans five, six, seven, and eight, sin is nothing less than God s enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If Satan were outside of us, he would have little to do with us, but we all know that since man s fall Satan entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Satan entered into man, right away he became sin or the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Romans 7:23 says clearly that sin is in our members.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means sin is in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We become tired because sin is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our body is disabled because sin is in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are dying because sin is in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do you realize that all the human beings are dying persons?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Apparently everyone is living; actually everyone is dying because sin is in their bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even to say we are dying is not so accurate because it is our body which is dying.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our soul is not dying nor is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our body is dying because sin is in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Romans 7:18 and 23 make it very clear that this sin which is God s enemy is in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because of this sin, your body is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Your body is dead because Satan is in your body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What then is the righteousness spoken of in verse 10?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Righteousness is just God Himself getting into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Satan gets into man s being, sin is within man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When God gets into our being, we have righteousness in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In John 16:8-11 the Lord said that when the Spirit comes He would convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He would convict concerning sin because they would not believe in the Lord Jesus; He would convict concerning righteousness because the Lord Jesus goes to the Father; He would convict concerning judgment because the ruler of this world would be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From these verses we can see that the very righteousness which counts in God s eyes is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When God Himself in His Son through His Spirit gets into our being, that is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Romans 5:18 and 21 say that through one righteous act there is justification of life and that we may reign through righteousness unto eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means righteousness results in life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why is our spirit life?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is because the Triune God as righteousness is right within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So the Triune God is righteousness in our spirit, and the enemy of God, Satan, is in our body, making our body dead.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have God in us, in our spirit, as our righteousness, making us life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And we have Satan, God s enemy, as sin in our flesh, making our body dead, disabled, and stinking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not a small thing to see that in this universe the two persons in the spiritual world are both within us; one is evil and the other is good.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The evil one in our body becomes sin, and the good one in our spirit becomes righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The sin in our body makes our body dead, and the righteousness in our spirit makes our spirit life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here we enjoy the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We enjoy God, we enjoy Christ, and we enjoy the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We enjoy the Triune God as our righteousness resulting in life.</S>
