   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I have said that baptism refers to a man's coming out of Adam and into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On one side is Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the other side is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to get out of Adam and into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How do we get out?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We were a part of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How can we now come out of Adam and into Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let me first ask one question: How did we get into Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If I ask how we can get out of Adam, some would say that they do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That is why I ask how we got into Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The way we enter in will be the way we get out.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How did we get into Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus said in John 3:6 that that which is born of the flesh is flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How did I become a part of Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I was born into him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now that you know how you got in, you will know how you can get out.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you got into him by birth, you have to get out of him by death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is quite obvious.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But how do we die?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God crucified us when the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, in Christ we have died to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How then do we get into Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord goes on to say that that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I get into Christ by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Peter said that we are regenerated through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, it is His resurrection that has regenerated us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here we see two things: through the death of the Lord, we are delivered from the family of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through resurrection, we have entered into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through death, we are delivered from the first Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through resurrection, we have entered into the second Man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All of these are accomplished by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He has died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a result we also have died.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He has resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a result we have entered into the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The death is spiritual, and the resurrection is also spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But our baptism is physical.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What then is baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Baptism is our acting out.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Through His servants, His apostles, the Lord Jesus told us of His work: When He died on the cross, we were also included in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What should we do after we have heard this?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to history, this happened two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We were already crucified two thousand years ago on the cross of our Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His word is now preached to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It tells us that we have died.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What then should we do now?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I once asked a village woman this question.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She answered, "If the Lord Jesus has crucified me, then I need to buy a coffin."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is altogether right!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord Jesus has crucified me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Why should I not buy a coffin?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since He has crucified me, I must hurry to bury myself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Baptism is my request to be buried in the water because I have been crucified by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Baptism is a response to God's crucifixion of us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God has preached the gospel to you and told you that you are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Your response is that since you have been crucified, you will find someone to bury you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, baptism means that we are dead in Adam already.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Others are taking me out to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now we are on the ground of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hence, death is our exit from Adam, and resurrection is our entrance into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Baptism is our burial.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Death is the termination of Adam, and resurrection is the new beginning in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Baptism is the bridge between these two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Through baptism we pass from death to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>My friends, the Lord Jesus has accomplished everything.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There is no condition required for us to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All we have to do is to simply believe.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To believe is to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I need only to receive because the Lord has done everything.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I no longer have to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Baptism is through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is an acting out.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Let me ask: If there is no plot, how can we perform?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Do we have a plot first and then an act, or do we have an act first and then a plot?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All plays exist because there was a plot already.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Because there is a spiritual fact before God already, we can act it out through baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>May the Lord be gracious to us and show us that nothing other than faith can be a condition for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Baptism has absolutely nothing to do with salvation or condemnation before God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We come out of condemnation before God through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Our acting out at baptism is only for our salvation before man.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>May the Lord be gracious to us and make us clear about our salvation.</S>
