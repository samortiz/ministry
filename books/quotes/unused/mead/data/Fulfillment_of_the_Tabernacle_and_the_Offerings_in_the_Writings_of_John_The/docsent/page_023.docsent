   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE SIGNS OF REGENERATION, THE BRASS SERPENT, AND THE BRIDE 1 Scripture Reading: John 3:1-8, 9-16, 22-36 MYSTERIES AND SIGNS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In these messages on the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the writings of John, it is not our intention to review the Life-study of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our intention is to concentrate on the extract of every chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The way to get the extract of each chapter is to pay attention to the signs in this mysterious book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Gospel of John is a book of mysteries and also a book of signs.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A mystery points to something that is beyond our natural understanding, and a sign points to something deep.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, I would emphasize the importance of these two matters mysteries and signs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the mysteries in the Gospel of John are divine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For instance, many Bible students know that the Gospel of John is a book on life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be sure, this life is neither physical life nor psychological life, not even merely spiritual life; it is divine life, the very life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, this divine life is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the eternal life revealed in this Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The divine life in the Gospel of John is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not only is the life of God a mystery; every kind of life is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is true of our physical life, and it is also true even of plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The life of a fruit tree, for example, is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Gospel of John there are many divine matters, and each of these matters is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everything divine is mysterious and difficult to define.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although the mysterious divine things cannot be fully understood, they are facts nonetheless.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may not be able to define the mysterious matter of the divine life, the life of God, but this life exists, and it is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The divine life is not only a mystery; it is also a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may use our physical life as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose a certain brother stands up to speak in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Within him there is the mysterious matter of his physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That life is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, that mysterious and invisible life can be expressed through the gestures he uses when he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The brother's gestures will signify certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In like manner, the mysterious, divine life may express itself in signs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In every chapter of the Gospel of John there are signs that point to the divine mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have seen that in chapter one of John there are six signs: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These six signs give us a complete picture.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In chapter two there are two signs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first sign, the changing of water into wine, sets forth the principle of life, which is to change death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The second sign, that of rebuilding the destroyed temple, shows us the goal of life, which is to build up God's dwelling place on earth.</S>
