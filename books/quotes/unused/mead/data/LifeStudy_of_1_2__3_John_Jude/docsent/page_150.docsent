   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JUDE MESSAGE FOUR THE BASIC STRUCTURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE EPISTLES OF PETER AND JUDE 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:2-3, 11; 2:1-3.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>9; 3:4; 4:14; 5:10; 2 Pet 1:14:3:18; Jude 3, 20-21</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message I would like to give a further word concerning the central thought of the Epistles of Peter and Jude.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is very surprising, even astounding, that an uneducated fisherman from Galilee such as Peter could write the two Epistles of 1 and 2 Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In his writings Peter embraces all the matters of God s eternal economy, the same matters that Paul covers in his Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul, of course, was highly educated.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He had been trained in the Scriptures of the Old Testament, and he also had been educated in Greek and Roman culture.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Peter, however, did not have this learning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, he wrote his two Epistles in a marvelous way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Peter even used certain terms and expressions that Paul did not use.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, Peter speaks about being partakers of the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This profound expression cannot be found in the writings of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not only does Peter use deep and profound expressions, but in his Epistles he also covers a number of significant details.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In quantity Peter wrote much less than Paul wrote, but in certain points he may be richer than Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we need to spend adequate time to study the two Epistles of Peter to see the crucial points and the details.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE TRIUNE GOD AS OUR PORTION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first basic matter covered by Peter in his writings is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Peter indicates that the God in whom we believe is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the opening words of Peter s first Epistle we can see the Triune God: According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ v. 2 . Here we have the foreknowledge of God the Father, the sanctification of the Spirit, and the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God the Father has regenerated us 1 Pet 1:3 , Christ has accomplished redemption with His precious blood, and the Spirit applies God s full salvation to His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here we see the Triune God in the accomplishment of full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peter also unveils to us the fact that this Triune God is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This fact is indicated by the word partakers in 2 Peter 1:4.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to this verse, we have become partakers of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that the Triune God is now our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If God were not our portion, we could not partake of His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE MEANS FOR US TO PARTAKE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In his writings Peter also reveals the way for us to partake of the Triune God as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The way involves the hidden man of the heart, and this hidden man is our spirit 1 Pet 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In his Epistles Paul has much to say concerning our spirit, but he does not use the expression the hidden man of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This hidden man, our human spirit, is the means by which we enjoy the Triune God as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although Peter speaks of God s Spirit only a few times, his terminology is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 1 Peter 4:14 he says, If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Literally, the Greek here means the Spirit of glory and that of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit of glory is the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Peter also speaks concerning the Spirit of Christ 1 Pet 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our human spirit as the hidden man of the heart and God s Spirit as the Spirit of glory and as the Spirit of Christ are the means for us to partake of God as our portion.</S>
