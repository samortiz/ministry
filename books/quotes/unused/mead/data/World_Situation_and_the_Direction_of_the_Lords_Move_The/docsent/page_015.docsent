   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE WAY TO SPREAD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:25; 11:25; Matt 18:19-20; Acts 12:12; Rom 15:16; John 21:15; 1 Thes 2:7; Heb 10:24-25; Eph 4:12; 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 31; Rom 14:1, 3; 15:7; Eph 4:1-6; 1 Cor 1:10-13; Rom 16:17; Titus 3:10; Matt 20:25-27; 23:8-11; 1 Pet 5:5</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous chapter, we saw our responsibility for the spreading of the divine truths.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A great part of the divine truths we have received from the Bible are based upon the light the Brethren received in the nineteenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who know the Bible recognize that the best theology is Brethren theology.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The notes in the reference Bible written by Dr. C. I. Scofield are mostly from the teachings of the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This Bible was very popular in the early part of this century.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Based upon the help we received from the Brethren, the Lord has gone on in His present recovery to show us many more divine truths.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to pick up the burden to spread these truths to the crucial parts of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this chapter we want to see the way to spread the Lord s recovery in the countries of Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A recent article in The San Francisco Chronicle quoted Dr. J. Gordon Melton s word which said, New religious movements are finding fertile soil in Europe where low church attendance and a changing world order have led to a search for spiritual alternatives.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This shows that some need to go to Europe to meet the real need of the seeking ones with the divine truths from the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After the four-day, four-hour war with Iraq, I received a burden to invade Europe with the divine truths of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>NOT BY A WORK NOR BY A MOVEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>BUT BY EMIGRATION</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to see how to carry out the spread of the Lord s recovery in the countries of Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our going to Europe should be neither by a work nor by a movement but by emigration.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Europe has changed, and the people there are looking for something new.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, we should go there in an absolutely new way with nothing traditional.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Recently, I was wondering why we have had to pass through so much opposition, persecution, and even rebellion in these past seven and a half years since 1984.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I believe that I received the answer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord has prepared us during these seven and a half years to get a new way to meet the new need in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before 1984 we would not have been able to go to Europe with something new in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We could only have gone there with the old, traditional way of meeting and serving.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In these recent years, I have put out many messages on the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, while the Lord has been preparing Europe, He has used the same period of time, the last seven and a half years, to prepare us in His way of meeting and service as revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Due to the recent changes in Europe, the people there are ready to receive something new from the West.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not go there with our old philosophy, our old way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the previous chapter, I begged us to have a change in our philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The young people there do not want any old element of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They want something new.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to go to Europe with the Lord s new way, the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should go to Europe by emigration, not by a work or by a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We will be warmly welcomed because the people there want to receive new things from the Western world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some of the young people in eastern Berlin begged the brothers to send people there to teach them the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some Emigrating There to Live the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>and Serve the Lord Full-time</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some can emigrate to Europe to live the Lord and serve the Lord full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should go there to live Christ and serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some Emigrating There to Take a Job or</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do a Business and Serve the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some can emigrate there to take a job or do a business and serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One brother reported that one of the best businesses for the American brothers in Eastern Europe is the remodeling of old houses.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is because the houses there are very old and in need of much work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some Emigrating There</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>to Study in a School and Serve the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some can emigrate there to study in a school and serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I would recommend that some go there to be professional students.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In other words, those who go to school should plan on remaining in school for the Lord s work on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The longer they stay in school, the better it is.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is because they can spend their time contacting the students for the Lord s interest.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I hope that many young people among us would go to the universities in Europe to be professional students teaching the divine truths.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is glorious and worthwhile to be such a student, contacting other students daily with the Lord s truths.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I believe that some students who go to Europe can bear new fruit monthly like the tree of life in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All Being Burdened by the Lord and</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Having a Clear Guidance from the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All those who want to go to Europe should be burdened by the Lord and have a clear guidance from the Lord.</S>
