[2]  CHAPTER ONE MAN AS THE CONTAINER Scripture Reading: Rom 9:21, 23; Zech 12:1; Gen 2:7; Prov 20:27 THE MYSTERIES IN THIS UNIVERSE
[3]  If you do not believe this, I would like to ask you a few questions which I believe none of you can answer.
[4]  Now we need to see what the Word says we are.
[5]  According to Zechariah 12:1 it seems that God created only three prominent things: the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man.
[6]  This shows that only these three things are important and vital in this universe.
[7]  The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man has a spirit for God.
[8]  In the previous chapter we saw that we are the vessels of God, the containers of God.
[9]  The Gospel of John shows that the Lord Jesus is the very God who is the Spirit.
[10]  Jesus is the living water, the living water is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of God is God Himself, and God becomes Jesus in the flesh.
[11]  After making it clear to His disciples that He is both the Son and the Father, He told them something more.
[12]  He said, "I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.
[13]  I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.
[14]  It was as if the Lord said, "Now I am among you, but My intention is to get into you.
[15]  I will come as the Spirit to abide with you and be in you because you are My container and I am your content.
[16]  Christ is the treasure, and He is the hope of glory 2 Cor 4:7; Col 1:27 .
[17]  Whenever you think about Him, mention Him, or call on Him, you have a sweet sense within you.
[18]  Regardless of whether you are young or old, if you have never been crazy with Jesus, you are not that qualified to be a good Christian.
[19]  Some of the Pharisees, the "reasonable" ones, the "logical" ones, the "uncrazy" ones, came to Jesus and told Him to rebuke His disciples v. 39 . Jesus said, "If these shall be silent, the stones will cry out" v. 40 . Matthew 21 tells us that when the children were crying out and praising the Lord, the chief priests and scribes were indignant.
[20]  CHAPTER THREE CRAZY LOVERS OF JESUS Scripture Reading: John 3:6b; Gal 1:16a; 2:20; 4:19; Eph 3:16-17a, 19b; 5:18; 2 Tim 1:7 OUR NEED TO BE BROUGHT BACK
[21]  When we called on the name of the Lord, He came into our spirit to be our life.
[22]  By telling the Lord that you love Him, you will spontaneously give more space, more room, within you to Jesus.
[23]  When He makes His home in your heart, He is now not only revealed in your spirit, but also taking full possession of your whole being.
[24]  There is no need for you to pray, "O Lord, come in and take me over."
[25]  Simply call on Him and tell Him you love Him.
[26]  Do not think that you need more teachings from the Bible.
[27]  Do not think that you need some training about how to serve the Lord, how to preach the gospel, and how to work for the Lord.
[28]  I am desperate to cause you all to be crazy lovers of Jesus.
[29]  I care for only one thing that you have to love Jesus in a crazy way.
[30]  But I do know that if the Lord Jesus shows Himself to you with His beauty, His fairness, you will be fully taken over by Him.
[31]  CHAPTER FOUR CALLING ON HIS NAME Scripture Reading: Rom 8:9-10, 16; 10:4-13
[32]  The book of Romans is a sketch of the Christian life and the church life.
[33]  The verses from Romans 10 in the Scripture reading at the beginning of this chapter show us the way to take in Christ.
[34]  If you desire to take in Christ, you surely have to realize this.
[35]  In Romans 10 Paul said, "Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven?' that is, to bring Christ down; or, Who will descend into the abyss?' that is, to bring Christ up from the dead" vv.
[36]  You do not need someone to bring Christ down from the heavens for you or to bring Christ up from the abyss for you.
[37]  Paul said that He is in your mouth v. 8 . Many say that we have to believe in the Lord Jesus in our heart.
[38]  Romans 10 says you have to confess, "Lord Jesus," with your mouth v. 9 . You should not merely exercise your heart; you also have to use your mouth.
[39]  You may say that you have prayed much, but have you ever shouted, calling on Jesus with your mouth?
[40]  It says that the Lord is rich to all who call upon Him v. 12 . Have you ever called upon the Lord? I am sharing something with you that is missed by Christianity.
[41]  CHAPTER FIVE TRANSFORMATION FOR BUILDING Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:2, 5; 1 Cor 3:2a, 6, 9b, 10, 12a; Col 2:19; 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 12:2a, 4-5; Eph 2:21-22 TRANSFORMATION BEING THE ISSUE
[42]  The best way to take the Lord in is to eat Him John 6:57 .
[43]  Second Corinthians 3:18 says, "But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."
[44]  We were pieces of clay, but after being transformed by Jesus, we become stones.
[45]  In Revelation 2:17 the Lord Jesus promised those who overcome that He would give them to eat of the hidden manna and then give them a white stone.
[46]  This means that by eating Jesus, we will become transformed stones for the building of God.
[47]  We all are pieces of clay, but by drinking Jesus, by eating Jesus, by taking Jesus in, we will have a metabolic, organic change.
[48]  CHAPTER SIX EATING AND DIGESTION Scripture Reading: John 6:57b, 63; 7:37-39a; Isa 55:1, 6; 1 Cor 12:13b; Rev 2:7, 17b; 3:20; 22:1-2a, 14a, 17 DRINKING AND EATING BY CALLING
[49]  We need to eat Jesus by calling on the name of the Lord.
[50]  After calling on the Lord Jesus, if you have any sense within you, any feeling within you, that means the Lord Jesus is moving, and that means the digestion within you is going on.
[51]  By eating we have digesting; by digesting we have the assimilation; and by this assimilation we get the practical nourishment of the riches of Jesus into our being.
[52]  All the riches of Christ eventually will grow into our organic tissues.
[53]  When you say, "For me to live is Christ," the Lord Jesus would say, "For Me to live is you."
[54]  CHAPTER SEVEN BABYLON Scripture Reading: Gen 11:4, 7, 9; 2 Chron 36:6-7; Ezra 1:11; Rev 17:3-5; 18:2a, 4 THE PRINCIPLE OF BABYLON
[55]  In this chapter and the next, we want to see two cities in the Bible: Babylon and Jerusalem.
[56]  We have seen that God's intention is to have a universal, corporate vessel to contain Himself, and this vessel will be the New Jerusalem.
[57]  I have my opinion, you have your thought, and we all are different; I do not understand you, nor do you understand me.
[58]  The Bible tells us that God chose Jerusalem as the place to put His name and build up His habitation.
[59]  God told His people that when they got into the good land, they had no right to choose the place in which they would worship Him.
[60]  Eventually, Babylon is called "the great harlot" 17:1 and "THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS" v. 5 . Out of her, many harlots were produced.
[61]  CHAPTER EIGHT JERUSALEM Scripture Reading: Deut 12:5, 8; Psa 122:1-3, 6; 133:1-3; Rev 21:2; 22:1-2a ONENESS IN TODAY'S JERUSALEM
[62]  You may be very unhappy with certain things in the local church, but if you exercise your spirit to say, "O Lord Jesus, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah," for fifteen minutes, you will feel happy with everything in the local church.
