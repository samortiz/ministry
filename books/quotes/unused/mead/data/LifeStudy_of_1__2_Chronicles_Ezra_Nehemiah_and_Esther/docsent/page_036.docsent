   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EZRA MESSAGE ONE THE NEED OF A RETURN FROM CAPTIVITY Scripture Reading: 2 Chron 36:14-23; Ezra 1:1-5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to the last three books of history in the Old Testament Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A BRIEF SURVEY OF THE HISTORY OF ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I believe that in eternity past God determined that, after the confusion of Babel, He would choose a man by the name of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After calling Abraham God spent many years to train him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually, Abraham produced a son, Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Isaac had two sons Esau, whom God hated, and Jacob, whom God loved Mal 1:2-3; Rom 9:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For many years Jacob was dealt with under God s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jacob produced twelve sons, and these sons became the twelve tribes of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When God called Abraham out of Chaldea, the land of Babel, He promised to give him the good land, the land of Canaan Gen 12:1, 7 , and He brought Abraham into this land.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Abraham, therefore, was the first one of God s chosen people to enter into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later, the twelve tribes drifted away from the good land to Egypt, where they remained for hundreds of years Exo 12:40-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During this time in Egypt, the twelve tribes of Israel became a nation of about two million people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They were usurped, enslaved, and persecuted by Pharaoh, king of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They cried out to God, and He sent Moses to deliver them out of that land of slavery into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God brought the people of Israel to Mount Sinai to train them and to give them the covenant, the testament, which included both the moral law and the ceremonial law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In giving Israel the law, God s intention was that they would be a nation of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the people of Israel were about to enter into the land of Canaan, God charged them through Moses to slaughter all the Canaanites.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He also charged them to destroy all the idols and everything related to idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Joshua took this charge and he was faithful to it, but he was not faithful absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead of slaughtering all the Canaanites, he allowed some to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the law given on Mount Sinai, God commanded the people of Israel concerning how to behave in relation to Him and in relation to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He did not want them to forsake Him, the fountain of living water, and hew out cisterns idols which are broken and which cannot retain water.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He wanted them to love one another and not to murder, not to commit adultery, not to steal, not to lie, and not to covet.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They were to take care of others, even returning lost things to their owner.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was the kind of life that was ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was a heavenly life lived by earthly people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A people with such a living could surely be called the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, after Israel entered into the good land, they were not faithful to God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The people of Israel failed God and eventually were divided into the kingdom of Judah and the kingdom of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The kingdom of Israel became apostate; they forsook God and set up other worship centers in addition to the unique center at Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The kingdom of Israel was captured by the Assyrians, and later the kingdom of Judah was captured by the Babylonians.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At that time the city of Jerusalem was captured and was not returned to Israel until 1967.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>GOD GIVING UP THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>TO CAPTIVITY AND PROMISING</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>TO BRING THEM BACK FROM CAPTIVITY</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the end of 2 Chronicles, in God s eyes the condition and situation of Israel were miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The land was usurped and taken over by pagans, and the people of Israel were given by God as captives to the heathens.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, the temple was burned and the wall of Jerusalem was torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The entire good land, the so-called holy land, was devastated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Jeremiah saw all this, sitting on the top of Mount Zion and looking down at Jerusalem, he lamented bitterly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the leading ones and all the noble ones of his countrymen had been taken away to captivity in Babylon, and only the poorest of the people were left to keep the land.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is no wonder that Jeremiah lamented.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, he himself was taken captive to Egypt and there he was put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What a pitiful situation!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such a condition lasted for seventy years, as Jeremiah himself had prophesied.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>While Jeremiah was lamenting, God came in to comfort him with the word that the captivity would not be forever but would last only seventy years Jer 25:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God assured him that the miserable situation of his country and his people, of the temple and the city, would last for just seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some of the captured ones, such as Daniel, would still be alive at the expiration of the seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When Zerubbabel led the first return from Babylon to Jerusalem, Daniel was still alive there in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, God comforted Jeremiah by assuring him that just as He gave the people up to captivity, He would also bring them back from their captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God would bring them back, not as captives but as triumphant warriors.</S>
