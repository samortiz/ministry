[2]  CHAPTER EIGHTEEN WITNESSING Scripture Reading: Acts 9:19-21; 22:15; 1 John 4:14; John 1:40-45; 4:29; Mark 5:19 I. THE MEANING OF WITNESSING
[3]  How long will the light of a candle last?
[4]  Brothers and sisters, do you want your light to continue, or do you want to see it end when your candle is extinguished?
[5]  In Mark 5:1-20 we see a person who was demon possessed.
[6]  After the demon possessed man was saved, the Lord said to him, "Go to your house, to your own people, and report to them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had mercy on you" v. 19 .
[7]  After you are saved, the Lord wants you to tell your family, neighbors, relatives, friends, and colleagues that you are now a saved person.
[8]  You should tell them not only that you have believed in Jesus but also what great things the Lord has done for you.
[9]  If you realize how great the discovery you have made is and how important and wonderful your discovery is, you surely will tell others immediately, "I have met the Son of God."
[10]  When Peter told the Lord, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God," the Lord Jesus told him, "Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens" Matt 16:16-17 .
[11]  A person needs not only to go to the city, to his home, and to the synagogues to witness to others about his faith in the Lord, but also to bear a special testimony to lead others to the Lord one on one.
[12]  The moment Andrew believed in the Lord, he led his brother Peter to the Lord.
[13]  Although he did not have any special gift and did not know how to lead many people to the Lord, the Lord was gracious to him and opened his eyes to realize that he could lead at least one person to the Lord.
[14]  THE IMPORTANCE OF WITNESSING A. Being a Great Joy
[15]  The two happiest days in every believer's life are the day he believes in the Lord and the day when, for the first time, he leads another person to Christ.
[16]  However, the joy of leading another person to the Lord for the first time may be greater than the joy experienced on the day of his own salvation.
[17]  Many Christians do not have much joy because they have never spoken anything for the Lord; they have never led a person to the Lord.
[18]  CHAPTER NINETEEN LEADING MEN TO CHRIST Scripture Reading: Rom 1:16; 10:14; 1 Tim 2:1, 4; Mark 16:15
[19]  In the previous chapter we said that once a person believes in the Lord, he has to witness for the Lord.
[20]  In this chapter we want to talk about the ways to lead men to Christ.
[21]  If we do not know how to lead people to Christ, I am afraid that much of our witnessing will be in vain.
[22]  There are several things which we must do and learn if we want to lead men to Christ.
[23]  The first thing that we must do is ask God for people, asking Him to give men to the Lord Jesus and to add them to the church.
[24]  Prayer is a test; it exposes your spiritual condition before the Lord.
[25]  If your spiritual condition is proper and normal, others will be saved one by one.
[26]  As you intercede continuously before the Lord, you may find one or two persons saved after a few days or half a month.
[27]  If your prayers are not answered for a long time, it must mean that you are sick before the Lord.
[28]  Isaiah 59:1-2 says, "Behold, Jehovah's hand is not so short that it cannot save;/Nor is His ear so heavy that it cannot hear./But your iniquities have become a separation/Between you and your God,/And your sins have hidden His face/From you so that He does not hear."
[29]  When a person sins, no matter what he says to himself, how much he reads the Bible, how many promises there are in the Word, how much grace God has, and how much He accepts him, his conscience will be weakened and bound.
[30]  We need to have the ambition to be a praying person, a person with power before God.
[31]  Some people are powerful before God, while others are not.
[32]  You have only to tell others that you felt happy and peaceful after you believed in the Lord Jesus, that you sleep well now, and that even meals are becoming tastier.
[33]  The key to leading men to the Lord is to emphasize the facts, not the doctrines.
[34]  Just recall what it was like when you were saved.
[35]  You did not believe because you understood the doctrines.
[36]  You may think that it is difficult to talk to someone, but if you pray for him, the Lord will give you the opportunity to speak to him, and he will change.
[37]  We mentioned earlier that you must pray before you speak to a person.
[38]  This, however, does not mean that you cannot speak if you have not prayed.
[39]  You have to speak to men even if you are seeing them for the first time.
[40]  During the past two to three hundred years, the Lord has used tracts in a particular way to save many people.
[41]  If you try to testify with your mouth, you are restricted by time and personnel.
[42]  CHAPTER TWENTY HOUSEHOLD SALVATION I. GOD'S PROMISE OF SALVATION
[43]  Genesis 17:12-13 says, "Every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.
[44]  He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant."
[45]  God called Abraham and made a covenant with him, saying, "I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee" v. 7 . The sign of the covenant between God and Abraham was circumcision.
[46]  All who were circumcised belonged to God, and all who were not circumcised were not of God.
[47]  God also told Abraham that his whole household needed to be circumcised, including those who were born in his house and those who were bought with his money.
[48]  Verse 11 says, "This also is yours, the heave offering of their gift, all the wave offerings of the sons of Israel; I have given them to you, and to your sons and daughters with you, as a perpetual due; every one who is clean in your house may eat of it."
[49]  Second Samuel 6:11 says, "And the ark of Jehovah remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months; and Jehovah blessed Obed-edom and all his household."
[50]  But even if you are not the head of your household, you can still speak in faith as Rahab, saying, "Lord, turn my household to You to receive Your grace and blessing."
[51]  Deuteronomy 12:7 says, "There you shall eat before Jehovah your God, and you and your households shall rejoice in all your undertakings, in which Jehovah your God has blessed you."
[52]  Deuteronomy 14:26 says, "You shall exchange the money for anything that your soul desires, for oxen, for sheep, for wine, for strong drink, or for anything that your soul would like; and you and your household shall eat there before Jehovah your God and rejoice."
[53]  Acts 10:2 says that Cornelius was "devout and one who feared God with all his household, giving many alms to the people and beseeching God continually," and 11:14 says, ".. who will speak words to you by which you shall be saved, you and all your house."
[54]  Cornelius's entire household was saved; it was not just one person who was saved.
[55]  Acts 16:31 says, "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household."
[56]  God's Word does not say that if you believe on the Lord Jesus, you and your household shall receive eternal life.
[57]  Acts 18:8 says, "Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with his whole household..and were baptized."
[58]  In the Bible there are individuals who believed in the Lord and there are households which believed in the Lord.
[59]  Acts 2:39 says, "For to you is the promise and to your children, and to all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God calls to Himself."
[60]  Once we see this, we will take a stand for our household and declare that our household is for the Lord.
[61]  Thus says Jehovah, I will now raise up trouble against you from within your house; and I will take your wives before your eyes and will give them to your companion, and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun."
[62]  We will consider one last portion which illustrates our point quite clearly.
[63]  Deuteronomy 11:6 says, "And what He did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben, when the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up and their households and their tents and all their substance that went with them, from the midst of all Israel."
[64]  When Dathan and Abiram sinned, God opened the earth and swallowed not only Dathan and Abiram, but also their households.
[65]  In the Bible, both on the positive side and on the negative side and both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament, all records show clearly that God deals with man by households.
[66]  Brothers, we need to take care of how we live before God, because what we do individually can affect our whole household.
[67]  You need to take your stand as the head of your family to declare that your household will believe in the Lord and that you will not tolerate anyone who will not believe.
[68]  Even if the little children do not believe, you can still say that your household will believe in the Lord, because this household is yours and not your children's. You are responsible for your household, not your children.
[69]  CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE IF ANYONE SINS Scripture Reading: John 5:14; 8:11; Rom 6:1-2; Num 19:1-10, 12-13, 17-19; 1 John 1:7 2:2
[70]  John 5 records the incident of the Lord Jesus healing one who had been sick for thirty-eight years near the pool in Bethesda.
[71]  After the man was healed the Lord met him in the temple and said to him, "Behold, you have become well; sin no more so that nothing worse happens to you" v. 14 . John 8 speaks of the Lord Jesus forgiving a woman who had committed adultery.
[72]  He said to her then and there, "From now on sin no more" v. 11 . Once we are saved, we are charged by the Lord to sin no more! As saved ones, we surely should not continue in sin.
[73]  To take care of this matter, we must first realize that the Lord Jesus has borne all our sins on the cross.
[74]  All the sins which we have committed, as well as those we are committing and will commit during our whole life, were borne by the Lord on the cross.
[75]  However, on the day we believed in the Lord, under God's light we only saw the sins that we had committed before we had believed.
[76]  A man can only be conscious of the sins which God shines His light upon; he cannot feel the sins which he has not yet committed.
[77]  However, at the time of your forgiveness, the number of sins that you were conscious of was actually much less than the actual number of sins which the Lord bore for you.
[78]  After the red heifer was killed, it was burned.
[79]  The skin, the flesh, the blood, and the dung were all burned.
[80]  We have covered the side of the Lord's work, which is redemption and the removal of our sins.
[81]  First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
[82]  When we sin and when we know our sin and acknowledge it as sin, God will forgive us our sin and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[83]  First John 2:1 says, "My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin."
[84]  These things refer to the forgiveness and cleansing from our sins through God's promise and work.
[85]  John wrote these things to us so that we may not sin.
[86]  It shows us that the Lord has forgiven our many sins and that, as a result, we do not sin.
[87]  When we find out that we are forgiven, we do not become free to sin; rather, we will not sin.
[88]  When a child of God sins and does not confess his sin but instead remains in his sin, he loses his fellowship with God.
[89]  CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO CONFESSION AND RECOMPENSE Scripture Reading: Lev 6:1-7; Matt 5:23-26 I. A CONSCIENCE VOID OF OFFENSE
[90]  After we have believed in the Lord, we must build up a habit of confessing and recompensing.
[91]  If we have offended anyone or have come short of anyone, we should learn to confess or to recompense.
[92]  On the one hand, we have to confess to God, and on the other hand, we have to confess to and recompense man.
[93]  If a man does not confess to God nor apologize or recompense man, his conscience will easily become hardened.
[94]  Leviticus 6:2-7: "When a person sins and acts unfaithfully against Jehovah," All sins are ultimately trespasses against Jehovah "and lies to his fellowman in regard to a deposit or a security, or through robbery, or if he has extorted from his fellowman, or has found what was lost and lied about it, and has sworn falsely concerning any of the things a man may do to sin thereby then it shall be, when he sins and is guilty, that he shall return what he took by robbery, or what he got by extortion, or the deposit which was deposited with him, or the lost thing which he found, or anything about which he swore falsely; he shall make restitution for it in full and add to it one-fifth more; he shall give it to whom it belongs on the day he is found guilty.
[95]  Then he shall bring to the priest his trespass offering to Jehovah, a ram without blemish from the flock, according to the valuation, for a trespass offering.
[96]  And the priest shall make propitiation for him before Jehovah, and he shall be forgiven for whatever he may have done by which he has become guilty."
[97]  Brothers and sisters, if there is any dishonesty in anything you do, if you have acquired anything at the expense of others, or if you have acquired anything by means of these six ways, you have sinned.
[98]  Our manner of life has to be righteous, and our conscience must be void of offense before God.
[99]  God's Word says, "Then it shall be, when he sins and is guilty, that he shall return what he took by robbery" v. 4 . The word return is very important.
[100]  Matthew 5:23-26 says, "Therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
[101]  Be well disposed quickly toward your opponent at law, while you are with him on the way, lest the opponent deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.
[102]  Truly I say to you, You shall by no means come out from there until you pay the last quadrans."
[103]  If you are offering a gift at the altar, that is, if you are offering something to God, and suddenly remember that your brother has something against you, this remembering is God's leading.
[104]  If you remember that your brother has something against you, this means you have transgressed against him.
[105]  When you have offended and transgressed against your brother, when he is disturbed and feels that you are unrighteous, and when you have caused him to sigh before God, your spiritual fellowship with God is interrupted; your spiritual prospects are gone.
[106]  You may not have the slightest feeling that you are in darkness, and you may feel that you are all right, but the gift you offer at the altar has become void.
[107]  First, the scope of your confession should be as wide as the scope of your offense.
[108]  You should do everything according to God's Word and should not take the extreme way.
[109]  If you offend many people, you must confess to many people.
[110]  Sometimes you have offended one individual, but because you want to testify to the brothers and sisters, you tell them about it.
[111]  CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE FORGIVENESS AND RESTORATION Scripture Reading: Matt 18:21-35, 15-20; Luke 17:3-5
[112]  What should we do if a brother offends us?
[113]  What should we do when it is not we who have offended others but others who have offended us?
[114]  When we examine the above three portions of the Lord's Word, we find that we should not only forgive a brother who has offended us but we should also restore him.
[115]  Matthew 18:21-22 says, "Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him?
[116]  And if he sins against you seven times in a day and turns again to you seven times, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him."
[117]  God expects to see one thing from us: Whoever wants to receive grace must first learn to dispense grace.
[118]  If a man receives grace, God expects him to share this grace with others.
[119]  Matthew 18:28-29 says, "But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, and he took hold of him and began to choke him, saying, Repay me what you owe.
[120]  Then his fellow slave fell down and begged him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you."
[121]  Here the Lord shows us that we owe Him ten thousand talents, while others only owe us only a hundred denarii.
[122]  When we say to the Lord, "Be patient with me and I will repay you all," He not only releases us but also forgives our debt.
[123]  It is not sufficient for us to just forgive our brother.
[124]  Matthew 18:15 says, "If your brother sins against you, go, reprove him between you and him alone.
[125]  If it is just a matter of hurt feelings, if the issue does not pose a problem to you, and if you think you can get over it, you do not need to speak to your brother or anyone else.
[126]  If our intention is pure, we will know how to do this step by step.
[127]  Next, the words we speak, the way we speak them, including our attitude, countenance, voice, and tone, must all be right.
[128]  If we are simply trying to rebuke him, our rebuking may be right, and the strong words we use may be justified, but our attitude, tone, and countenance may never achieve the goal of gaining him.
[129]  You should realize that the Lord allows a brother to offend you because He has shown favor to you and has chosen you.
[130]  If a brother offends you in a small matter and you forgive him, the matter is settled; there is no need to do anything further.
[131]  But if a brother offends you to such an extent that it becomes an issue, you cannot close your eyes and say that there is no problem.
[132]  If you go to him by yourself and speak to him with a proper motive, a good attitude, and gentle words, and he still does not hear you, then go and tell others about it.
[133]  Verse 17 says, "If he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church."
[134]  If we cannot deal with the problem by ourselves, we should bring one or two with us to deal with it.
[135]  If the other person still refuses to hear them, we have to tell it to the church.
[136]  Telling the church does not mean that we publicize the matter when the whole church is gathered together.
[137]  If the offending brother is one who walks before God, he should lay aside his own view and accept the witness of two or three.
[138]  CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR BELIEVERS' REACTIONS Scripture Reading: Matt 5:38-48
[139]  More than half of our life is spent in reactions.
[140]  When we feel happy about what others are saying, we are reacting.
[141]  When we feel angry about what others are saying, we are reacting as well.
[142]  Following this it says, "For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?" v. 46 . If others love you, your natural reaction is to love them.
[143]  If more than half our life is occupied with reactions and if our reactions are Christian-like, we can expect God to be pleased with us.
[144]  If someone wants my tunic, it is perfectly all right if I do not give it to him.
[145]  Some who are ignorant of the Bible think that the teachings on the mountain in Matthew 5 7 have to do with the law.
[146]  Why do we have to turn our left cheek when others strike our right cheek?
[147]  When the Lord grants us sufferings through man's hand, we should rather enhance His work than annul His work.
[148]  Finally, we need to pay attention to two things concerning this life's reaction.
[149]  We have to ask the Lord to deliver us from temptations and from the evil one.
[150]  It is possible for a person to be free from sin immediately after he has believed in the Lord.
[151]  However, this may not be the common experience of all believers.
[152]  After believing in the Lord, many people fall back into sin instead of being freed from sin.
[153]  Romans 7:15-25 says, "For what I work out, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do...For to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not.
[154]  But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that work it out...I find then the law with me who wills to do the good, that is, the evil is present with me.
[155]  For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man, but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members...So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh, the law of sin."
[156]  Afterwards, you may feel that as a Christian you should not have lost your temper, and you may resolve to control your temper the next time.
[157]  Afterwards, you realize that you were wrong again, and you ask the Lord for forgiveness, promising Him that you will never lose your temper again.
[158]  If you have not seen that sin is a law and that your will can never overcome this law, you are trapped in Romans 7; you will never arrive at Romans 8.
[159]  Once you experience this, you will realize that only the indwelling Spirit can keep you from sin; you do not have to will not to sin.
[160]  Many Christians have a wrong concept about the Lord Jesus.
[161]  They think that the Lord set up a good pattern for us while He was on earth and that we should imitate this pattern.
[162]  It is true that the Bible charges us to imitate the Lord Rom 15:5; 1 Cor 11:1; etc. . But the Bible does not tell us to do this by ourselves.
[163]  Some Christians think that they can ask the Lord to empower them simply because the Bible says, "I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me" Phil 4:13 .
[164]  If a Christian does not know what is meant by Christ our life, and what is meant by for to me, to live is Christ, he will not experience the Lord's life on earth; he will not be able to follow the Lord, to experience victory in Him, or to proceed on the course before him.
[165]  There are many Christians who have greatly misunderstood Philippians 1:21.
[166]  If you make it your goal and hope to attain such a state, if you aspire to be crucified, that is, to no longer be the one who lives but instead to have Christ living in you, you will wait forever before seeing your aspiration fulfilled, because you are hoping for something that is impossible to achieve.
[167]  Perhaps some will ask, "How can we experience it is no longer I who live?
[168]  If I am not crucified with Christ, I am still I. How can I say, "It is no longer I"? Only those who are "crucified with Christ" can say, "It is no longer I."
[169]  He has crucified you, and it is futile for you to try to be patient by yourself.
[170]  Even though you still try to be patient, God considers you hopeless.
[171]  Even though you think that you can make it, God says that you cannot make it and that you should die.
[172]  Instead, we should bow down our head and say, "Lord, You have said that I am crucified, and I will say the same thing; You have said that I am useless, and I will say the same thing; You have said that I cannot be patient, and I will no longer try to be patient; You have said that I cannot be humble, and I will no longer try to be humble.
[173]  CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN SEEKING GOD'S WILL Scripture Reading: John 7:17; Matt 10:29-31; 18:15-20; Rom 8:14; Psa 119:105; 1 John 2:27 I. THE NEED TO OBEY GOD'S WILL
[174]  Before we were saved, we did everything according to our own will.
[175]  At that time we served ourselves and did everything to please ourselves.
[176]  We would do anything as long as it pleased us or made us happy.
[177]  However, now we have believed in the Lord and have accepted Christ Jesus as our Savior.
[178]  Luke 12:6 says, "Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria?"
[179]  God's will is not only revealed through the environment and made known through the indwelling Spirit; it is also revealed to us through the Bible.
[180]  Suppose someone has invited you to work, and you have the intention to do a certain thing, or someone has advised you to reconsider your future, etc. How can you know whether these things are according to God's will? First, you should look at the teaching of the Bible.
[181]  As much as it is possible, you should also fellowship with those who know God in the church to see whether they will say amen to your guidance.
[182]  They will consider your condition in the church, and they will sense whether or not they can say amen to what you have seen.
[183]  If the other members of the church think that the "guidance" you have is not reliable, you should not insist on your opinion.
[184]  The Lord Jesus says, "Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven" v. 18 . Because the church is God's habitation and the beacon of God's light, we need to believe that God's will is revealed in the church.
[185]  He saw the great light on the way to Damascus, fell to the ground, and heard what the Lord said to him alone: "Rise up and enter into the city, and it will be told to you what you must do."
[186]  First John 2:27 says, "And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things.."
[187]  We should note one other point: This way of seeking God's will should be applied only to important matters.
[188]  As to the trivial affairs of daily life, we do not need to resort to such a method.
[189]  We can make judgments according to our common sense.
[190]  God wants us to make our own judgments concerning things that we can manage with our common sense.
[191]  If you have an intense and absolute desire to do God's will, God will make known His will to you even when you know nothing about the methods.
[192]  If your heart is completely inclined toward the Lord and you say, "Lord, I want Your will; I really want it," God will show you His will.
[193]  CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT MANAGING ONE'S FINANCES Scripture Reading: Luke 6:38; 1 Tim 6:7-10, 17-19; 2 Cor 9:6; Mal 3:10; Prov 11:24; Phil 4:15-19 I. MANAGING ACCORDING TO GOD'S PRINCIPLES
[194]  In this chapter we will cover monetary offering and giving.
[195]  After a person has sold everything, he will still receive income; money will still find its way back to his hand.
[196]  Even after a person has offered up all of his money, we should not think that money will no longer have an influence on him.
[197]  I have seen a few brothers and sisters who fell into dire need because they were unfaithful in the matter of giving.
[198]  Throughout his life, he experienced wants and trials many times, but because he knew Luke 6:38, he would tell his wife whenever he was in need, "There must be something wrong with our giving lately."
[199]  As soon as I entered his house, his wife said, "Mr. Nee, when you left Foochow, why did you give my husband twenty dollars? Why did you walk away immediately after handing him the money?" I said, "There was only one reason: I had prayed for a whole day, and the Lord told me to give it to him.
[200]  The Christian way of managing money is not to hold on to money.
[201]  The tighter you hold on to your money, the more it dies.
[202]  The more you grasp it, the more it disappears; it will evaporate like vapor.
[203]  But the more you give away, the more you will have.
[204]  If God's children would learn to give more, God would have many ways to work out His miracles.
[205]  If you see a brother or sister in difficulty, and you remember him or her, God will cause that money to grow and harvest thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and even a hundredfold.
[206]  In the Old Testament, God said to the Israelites, "Bring the whole tithe to the storehouse that there may be food in My house; and prove Me, if you will, by this, says Jehovah of hosts, whether I will open to you the windows of heaven and pour out blessing for you until there is no room for it" Mal 3:10 .
[207]  Now read Proverbs 11:24: "There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth;/and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty."
[208]  Many people have not scattered, and they are left with nothing.
[209]  But let me tell you, if you take your little flour and oil and make bread for the prophet, you will find the bottle of oil feeding you for three and a half years cf.
[210]  If one chooses a wrong occupation, he will not be able to go on in a positive way.
[211]  From these God-approved occupations in the Bible, we can see a basic principle: Man must receive or take from nature, or he must earn his wages in exchange for his time and labor.
[212]  I hope you can differentiate between pure commerce and production.
[213]  If you labor on something and then sell what you have labored on, this is something that can be blessed by God.
[214]  But if you buy something and then sell it, hoping in your heart that you will make money in the process, you are engaging in the lowest occupation, not only from a Christian's point of view, but also from a Gentile's as well.
[215]  I do not wish to see anyone taking the extreme way.
[216]  Do not condemn those who are engaged in commerce as soon as you meet them.
[217]  If you wanted him to buy something for you, he would try to make some money in the process.
[218]  In order to be a good Christian, one needs to deal with all the basic issues in a thorough way.
[219]  If there is one basic issue that is not settled, whether it be the family or one's occupation, problems will eventually come back.
[220]  As long as there is one unresolved issue, a Christian will not be able to take a straight path before the Lord.
[221]  BASIC ELEMENTS OF A MARRIAGE A. Rendering Mutual Help
[222]  Moreover, on the sixth day, God did not say that "it was good"; in fact, He even said that something was not good after He created man.
[223]  If a man constantly committed the sin of pride, Paul could not have said, "Since you always commit the sin of pride, you can be proud at home so that you will not be proud elsewhere!
[224]  You should not say, "Since you like to steal, I will allow you to steal the things which belong to Brother So-and-so so that you will not steal from others."
[225]  In his first Epistle, Peter said that the wives are "fellow heirs of the grace of life" 3:7 .
[226]  In other words, God delights to see husbands and wives serving Him together.
[227]  Those who keep their virginity have much to gain before the Lord.
[228]  Paul's word in the New Testament is clear enough.
[229]  In 1 Corinthians 7:39, he told the widows to marry those who were in the Lord.
[230]  Some brothers and sisters have another problem: They are engaged to unbelievers.
[231]  According to this principle, we can say that the best thing for a brother to do is to marry a sister in the Lord.
[232]  In the Bible there is no command telling man to separate himself from his concubine.
[233]  Nowhere in the Bible does God ask man to send his concubine away.
[234]  C. Such a One Not to Be an Elder
[235]  There is only one portion of the Word that addresses the matter of concubines in the New Testament.
[236]  In reading the Bible, we love to see a certain matter that is mentioned only once.
[237]  If it is mentioned three or more times, we need to integrate the different portions before we can arrive at a conclusion about God's teaching.
[238]  In the Bible God acknowledges the validity of sex.
[239]  In Matthew 5:28 the Lord Jesus said, "But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart."
[240]  CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE CHOOSING A MATE Scripture Reading: Gen 2:18 I. THE IMPORTANCE OF CHOOSING A MATE
[241]  When God created man, He considered Adam to be one half and Eve to be another half.
[242]  Man was not a complete man until the two halves were put together.
[243]  If you do not like his company, or if it is not something of an enjoyment to you, you should not marry him, because you are short of one basic factor of marriage.
[244]  Fourth, one has to pay attention to the family of the other party.
[245]  There is a familiar expression in the West, which says, "I am marrying So-and-so, not her family."
[246]  Generally speaking, women mature and age faster than men.
[247]  In a marriage, the man should generally be five, six, or even seven to eight years older than the woman, as far as physical age is concerned.
[248]  Some people are not only affectionate but also kind.
[249]  They do not want to hurt or offend anyone and are always considerate of others.
[250]  If one chooses a husband or a wife who is also kind and considerate, who is happy to preserve the pride of others, and who never wants to embarrass others, he or she will always feel happy and optimistic.
[251]  Some people are very exact in what they say.
[252]  If you put these two kinds of people together, one may criticize the other for telling lies while the other may say that it is better to keep quiet than to speak as the other one does.
[253]  Here is a word of reminder: Do not presume that those with similar weaknesses can get along with one another.
[254]  Many people think that those with different weaknesses cannot get along with one another, and that those with similar weaknesses can.
[255]  There is another aspect of personality and human consideration that we have to take care of.
[256]  When you contemplate marrying a person, you must ask whether that person can get along with others.
[257]  Marriage means a living together, and it is a big question whether or not a person can live together with others.
[258]  If a brother is at odds with his father, mother, brothers, and sisters, you can only expect an unhappy marriage if you marry him.
[259]  If a sister cannot get along with anyone and is always in conflict with others, you can be sure that there will be little happiness if you take her for your wife.
[260]  If you wait until you are married, you will see that he also will have no respect for you.
[261]  CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO HUSBAND AND WIFE Scripture Reading: Col 3:18-19; 1 Pet 3:1-7; Eph 5:22-23
[262]  We have already covered the subject of choosing a mate.
[263]  After a person is married, he should learn to close his eyes so that he does not see.
[264]  You have to learn before the Lord to close your eyes the day you are married.
[265]  In a family we need to learn to close our eyes to each other's faults and accommodate each other on the one hand, and we need to learn to appreciate each other's virtues on the other hand.
[266]  But if you ask his wife about him, she will tell you that he is hopeless.
[267]  Before she died, her husband said to her, "If you die, I do not know what I will do because you have done so much for me.
[268]  It is repugnant for anyone to be impolite to others.
[269]  You should treat everyone politely, no matter who he or she may be.
[270]  No matter how familiar you are with a friend, you should never give up your manners.
[271]  No matter how close you are to others, you will lose them the moment you give up your manners.
[272]  There is another factor crucial to our manner our voice.
[273]  We may say similar things, but the way we say it may be different.
[274]  If you spoke in the office with the tone of voice you have at home, you would be chased out of your office in two days.
[275]  There is another consideration which is very important for the family: One must not be selfish.
[276]  If you are married, you must live like a married person.
[277]  If you expect your wife to give up all her freedom to you, this is the same as saying that you want her to fear or hate you.
[278]  What should we do when there are disputes between the husband and the wife?
[279]  However, since both are adults and are children of God, they must learn to know what the other person's problem is, and where they differ.
[280]  Do not expect one party to endure to the end. One out of ten Christians may endure to the end. But the other nine will not able to endure to the end. If a solution is not fair, sooner or later the problem will come back again.
[281]  Between the two persons in the family, there must be confession and forgiveness.
[282]  Many mistakes need to be confessed, not just ignored.
[283]  Do not be careless about your own faults; you must always confess them.
[284]  Apart from the book of Proverbs, the Old Testament does not seem to give us much teaching concerning parenting.
[285]  If we try to summarize the words in the Bible concerning parenting, the main thing parents should do is nurture their children in the teaching and admonition of the Lord and not provoke them to anger or discourage them.
[286]  The day your son is born is the day you should consecrate yourself.
[287]  You must set a high standard for what is ideal, and you must also set a standard for yourself in spiritual matters.
[288]  Otherwise, you will have problems for yourself, and you will spoil your children.
[289]  When you do not have children, you can do whatever you like when you are happy and give up and forget about everything when you are unhappy.
[290]  Second, parents must not only realize their responsibility and sanctify themselves for the sake of their children; they must also walk with God.
[291]  One sanctifies himself for the sake of his children.
[292]  But this does not mean that he can be loose and careless when he is by himself.
[293]  No matter how much zeal you show in your children's presence, they can easily see through you if you are not genuinely zealous.
[294]  If you are a careless person and you try to act in a discreet way before your children, they will easily detect your carelessness and pretension.
[295]  You must not only sanctify yourself before them for their sake, but you must also be genuinely holy in yourself, walking with God as Enoch did.
[296]  Third, the father and mother must be of one mind in order for a family to be healthy.
[297]  They must be of one mind in sacrificing their own freedom for God's sake and in raising up a strict moral standard.
[298]  If you are the wife and your children ask for something, you first should answer, "Have you checked with your father?
[299]  But we treat our children as if they are our personal property, forgetting that they also have a spirit and a soul and that they are gifts from God.
[300]  Fifth, Paul showed us an important thing that parents should not do they should not provoke their children to anger Eph 6:4 .
[301]  He may say, "If you do not obey me, I will not give you any money.
[302]  You must not only be a pattern to your children but also realize that your words are very important to them.
[303]  Do not promise them something if you do not have the ability to fulfill your promise.
[304]  If your children want you to buy something, you have to consider your financial ability.
[305]  Seventh, you must nurture your children in the discipline and admonition of the Lord Eph 6:4 .
[306]  The discipline of the Lord is telling a person how he should behave himself.
[307]  I hope that we will pay attention to this matter.
[308]  In many aspects we have to teach our children according to the discipline of the Lord.
[309]  Eighth, we must lead them to the knowledge of the Lord.
[310]  You must pay attention to the matter of their repentance and then bring them to the Lord.
[311]  In this way you will lead your children to the knowledge of God.
[312]  When a child has done something wrong, he or she must be punished.
[313]  Brothers and sisters, when your children do something wrong, and you beat them in your anger, you should realize that you also should be beaten.
[314]  CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR FRIENDS Scripture Reading: James 4:4; 2 Cor 6:14-18; Psa 1; 1 Cor 15:33 I. THE BIBLE
[315]  One thing special about the Bible is that it does not say much about friendship among God's children.
[316]  This does not mean that the word friend is never used in the Bible.
[317]  But the friendship spoken of in the Bible primarily refers to friendship outside of Christ; the Bible does not say much about making friends with those who are in the Lord.
[318]  God, however, has ordained that we terminate our friendships after we have believed in the Lord Jesus.
[319]  If you have just accepted the Lord, you must replace your friends.
[320]  For we are the temple of the living God, even as God said, I will dwell among them and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.'
[321]  Therefore come out from their midst and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean; and I will welcome you'; and I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to Me, says the Lord Almighty'" 2 Cor 6:14-18 .
[322]  If you serve the Lord faithfully and bring the Lord to your friends in this way, sooner or later they will either turn to the Lord or forsake you.
[323]  First, "For what partnership do righteousness and lawlessness have?"
[324]  You have believed in the Lord and you know what righteousness is.
[325]  First Corinthians 15:33 says, "Do not be deceived: Evil companionships corrupt good morals."
[326]  But many times we feel that we do not need to be so stifled when we are among them; we feel that if we loosen up a little, they will welcome us more.
[327]  Each time you communicate with unbelievers, you may need three or five days before you will be recovered to your proper standing, because unbelievers can affect your appearance, habits, and moral conduct before men.
[328]  You must tell all your friends what has happened to you.
