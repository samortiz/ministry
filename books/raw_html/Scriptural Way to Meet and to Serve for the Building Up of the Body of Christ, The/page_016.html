 <h2 class="head1">FITTING MAN&rsquo;S NATURAL AND FALLEN CONDITION</h2>
<p>The traditional way to meet and to serve fits man&rsquo;s natural and fallen condition. When people attend the traditional and natural worship service, there is no need for them to have any preparation. I had a classmate who was a Christian. After our graduation from school, we both went to work. Then the Lord raised me up to establish the church life in my hometown, and we had the Lord&rsquo;s table in my home. My classmate felt that since we had the Lord&rsquo;s table in my home, he could do the same thing in his home. The table in his home that they used for the Lord&rsquo;s table was used for three purposes. On Sunday they used that table to eat breakfast and lunch. In between breakfast and lunch, they used the same table to have the Lord&rsquo;s table. Then in the afternoon they used that table to play mah-jong. So that one table was used for three purposes: for dining, for having the Lord&rsquo;s table, and for gambling. This way of meeting fit their fallen condition.</p>
<p>In the Sunday morning meeting of today&rsquo;s Christianity, there may be many persons in attendance who are living in a sinful condition. They may come to the Sunday morning worship service in peace despite having quarreled with their spouse or having done some evil things the previous night. Some might have even gained some money in an unrighteous way and they would give some of it to the church as a gift. They could worship God in the traditional way in their fallen condition. There is no need of any kind of change in the attendants&rsquo; lives for the traditional way of meeting. But if we Christians are going to take the biblical way as seen in 1 Corinthians 14:26, we all have to get ourselves prepared. We have to confess our sins and pray to receive the infilling of the Spirit. We have to accumulate some experiences from enjoying the Lord through the Word. Otherwise, when we come to the meeting, we will not be able to speak because our conscience will bother us. Even if our conscience does not bother us, we still will not have anything to speak if we do not get ourselves properly prepared.</p>
<p>To have Christian meetings according to the biblical way requires a revival. We have to live a victorious life. Some of the saints often may not function in the meetings because they quarreled with their spouse at home. A brother&rsquo;s small quarrel with his wife is good enough to kill his functioning spirit. If a brother quarrels with his wife without confessing to the Lord and to her concerning his sin, his conscience will condemn him, and he will not be able to utter anything of Christ. He will not have the peace, the joy, and the anointing within him that gives him the boldness to say something for the Lord. He may have something to say about the Lord, but he will not have the peace within until he makes a thorough confession. After this confession, he will be released. He will have the peace, the joy, the anointing through the cleansing of the blood, and thus the freedom in the Spirit to speak. To meet in a natural way does not require us to repent or be filled with the Spirit; we do not need the blood, the anointing, the word, or even the Lord. But if we want to worship God in the biblical way, we have to be dealt with, cleansed, washed, forgiven, and filled with the heavenly wine.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT REQUIRING MAN<br />
TO BE LIVING AND IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The traditional way to meet and to serve does not require man to be living and in the spirit. A person can be dormant and dull and still come to a traditional meeting. But to come to a biblical meeting which is the very Holy of Holies requires us to be living and in the spirit. We need to be forgiven, cleansed, and washed. We need to make a thorough confession to receive the infilling of the Holy Spirit. We need to accumulate the experience of the enjoyment of the Lord through His holy Word. We have to accumulate this experience day after day; then we will have a storage of the riches of Christ that we can speak in the meetings. The natural way to meet does not require anything. A person could steal during the week, and still come to a natural worship service on Sunday.</p>
