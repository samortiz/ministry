Revelation 11:2</H2><P>"And the court which is outside the temple cast out and do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months." </P><P>"The court which is outside the temple" is the temple on the earth. The heavenly temple is the temple itself. In ancient times, the Jews had a central holy temple. Even though the kings established great high places to worship God, all the other kings who revived the kingdom abolished these great high places. God does not want what man establishes. Even during the transitional period, when the Gentiles were called unto the Lord, the Jews who became Christians still went up to the holy temple to worship God (Acts 2:46; 3:1; 5:20).</P><P>In the Old Testament age, there was one central holy temple. But in the New Testament age, there is no physical sanctuary, for in the New Testament we are to worship God in spirit and in truth (John 4:23-24). It is in the heavenly Holy of Holies that one worships God (Heb. 10:19-22). How did God destroy the temple on the earth in order to make people worship Him in the heavenly temple? The Lord Jesus offered Himself as a sacrifice to God. Once He died, the offering of sacrifices stopped (Heb. 10:5-18), and furthermore, a number of years later the Romans destroyed the holy temple. Hence, there is no longer a holy temple on the earth. But here there is a temple on the earth again; thus, it is a return to the Old Testament. Matthew 24:15 refers to "the abomination of desolation...standing in the holy place." The "abomination" refers to an idol. "The holy place" will have idols during the time of the great tribulation (2 Thes. 2:2-4; Rev. 13:14).</P><P>"The holy city" is Jerusalem (Matt. 4:5). Those who worship in the heavenly temple are the people spoken of in Revelation 7:9-17. "Trample" is the same as what is mentioned in Luke 21:24. The Gentiles will trample Jerusalem for forty-two months.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Two Witnesses<br>(Revelation 11:3-12)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Revelation 11:3</H2><P>"And I will cause My two witnesses to prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth." </P><P>Who are these two witnesses? Some say that they signify Christendom, some say that they signify a certain sect, and some say that they signify the gospel preached by Christians. None of these have sufficient justification for the following reasons:</P><P>(1) These two witnesses wear sackcloth. Is it possible that they signify a group?</P><P>(2) Their miracles in Revelation 11:5-6 are for self-defense and result in killing. They are not like the miracles performed during the gospel age, which are for saving people.</P><P>(3) Revelation 11:9 speaks of their corpses. One cannot say that these corpses signify a group; much less can they refer to the gospel.</P><P>These two witnesses are simply two witnesses because: (1) witnesses have to be men (Acts 1:8); (2) they wear sackcloth; (3) they are killed; (4) they have corpses; and (5) they are prophets.</P><P>Who then are these witnesses? Some say they are Elijah and Moses. They say this because Revelation 11:6 says that they can cause the heaven to stop raining, as was done by Elijah (1 Kings 17:1), and they can turn water into blood, as was done by Moses. But this interpretation is based only on what these two persons have done. Hebrews 9:27 says that it is reserved for men to die once. Moses died once already. How could he die again? Thus, Moses cannot be included here.</P><P>In the original text, "two witnesses" is preceded by the definite article. This seems to indicate that one would know who these two people are immediately upon reading it. The words in Revelation 11:4 are quoted from Zechariah 4:2-3, 5, 11, and 14. "Stand" in Revelation 11:4 signifies living. When a man is tired, he sits down; when he is sick, he lies down; and when he dies, he falls down. These two persons stand before the Lord of the earth. The whole Bible mentions only two persons who did not die; they are Enoch and Elijah. These two alone stand before the Lord. (It is said that an apocrypha written by John states that Enoch and Elijah will come back.) "Two witnesses." Two is the number specified in the Bible for witnessing (Deut. 17:6; 19:15; Matt. 18:16). "Sackcloth" has the meaning of bitterness. The New Testament does not command us to wear sackcloth, but in the Old Testament there was such a commandment (Isa. 22:12; Joel 1:13). What the two witnesses preach is judgment, not the gospel. Enoch preached judgment (Jude 14-15), and Elijah was a prophet who wielded a sword (1 Kings 18:40; 2 Kings 1:10, 12). They preach sad news, not glad tidings.</P><P>In the three and a half years of the great tribulation, even if Christians remain, it will be impossible for them to preach the gospel because they will no longer be able to escape tribulation.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 16: Study on Revelation &nbsp; pg 36</div><br></body></html>
