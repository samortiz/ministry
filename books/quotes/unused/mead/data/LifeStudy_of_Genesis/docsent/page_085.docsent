   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 The Tree of the Knowledge</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of Good and Evil</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The second choice was the tree of knowledge Gen 2:17 , which was the opposite of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Note that this tree was called the tree of knowledge of good and evil, not simply the knowledge of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Both the knowledge of good and the knowledge of evil come from the same tree.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It does not matter whether knowledge is the knowledge of good or of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As long as it is knowledge, it does not belong to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It belongs to the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>a Signifying Satan</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>and All Things apart from God</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan, it does not signify him directly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It firstly signifies everything apart from God and then it signifies Satan indirectly, because Satan is hidden at the back of the things that are apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Satan likes to conceal himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, the tree of knowledge represents him indirectly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Satan is not as frank as God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God is very frank and always comes to the front.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Satan, however, is subtle, always staying at the rear.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If Satan wants to trouble you, he will not do it openly and frankly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He will do it subtly, acting through your wife or through a part of the world, such as a department store.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes, Satan even utilizes the Bible, operating through the letters of the Scripture to harass you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Remember how the Jewish religionists, the Pharisees and the scribes, used the Bible to condemn the Lord Jesus to death John 19:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because Satan is subtle, the tree of knowledge does not signify him directly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It signifies everything apart from God, including good things, scriptural things, and religious things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Regardless of whether a thing is good or evil, as long as it is not God Himself it can be utilized by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The things apart from God fall into three categories: knowledge, good, and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose you have the intention of doing a certain good thing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Deep in your spirit, however, you have the sense not to touch it and not to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You are not convinced by this inner sense which forbids you to do it and you go to one of the elders saying, "Brother, look at this good thing I have in mind to do.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why don't I have the peace to do it?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The elder may say, "It does not matter whether or not you have the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You should do it because it is good."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the elder gives such a reply, he will certainly be an elder of knowledge, not knowing the principle of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every proper elder should say, "Brother, we should never go along with the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our principle is not good and bad, right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our principle is life."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not employ the principle of good and bad, but cooperate with the principle of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you do not have peace within, it means that the Spirit of life does not agree with what you intend to do.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You need to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you do, you will receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Have you not had this kind of experience repeatedly in the past?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever you acted according to the good, you were killed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You experienced death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, when you acted according to the inner life, you received more life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The tree of knowledge firstly signifies everything utilized by Satan, regardless of whether it is good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It does not signify Satan directly, because he likes to hide.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When Satan first entered into man, he did not do it in a frank way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He came in the form of a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the beginning of the Bible, the serpent was very cunning and apparently was quite attractive Gen 3:1 , unlike the ugly serpents under God's curse.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As Eve conversed with the serpent, she did not realize that Satan was in it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Herein lies the principle of Satan's appearing: he never appears frankly, but subtly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We find another example of Satan's subtle appearing in the case of Peter in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Peter was an honest, faithful disciple, and he loved the Lord Jesus very much.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When the Lord spoke of His coming crucifixion, Peter said, "God be merciful to You, Lord; this shall by no means happen to You!"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Matt 16:21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord Jesus turned to Peter and said to him, "Get behind Me, Satan!"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Apparently, Peter was the speaker; actually it was Satan in Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Satan was also in Judas when he betrayed the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Judas was filled with Satan and called "a devil" John 13:2, 27; 6:70 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By all these examples we can see that Satan never acts frankly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is always subtle, using others as a covering.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You may say, "That is not Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>That is my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>That is my dear husband."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Nevertheless, the wife and the husband have been used by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, we must be careful.</S>
