The matters covered are comprehensive, ranging from man's sinful condition before salvation to his destiny in the coming age
For both issues Watchman Nee presents persuasive reponses from the Scriptures to various understandings current among Christians
The messages in this series were spoken by Watchman Nee in Chinese and were transcribed by hand as they were being given
These messages demonstrate the Lord's commission to our brother and His equipping of him with the revelation in His Word
Some have even said that though they were actually sitting here, they did not know how to leave from here after the meeting
Some brothers and sisters may be very clear about the gospel; they may already know what we are speaking about
In this first meeting, our subject is one which most people do not like to hear about, but one which is unavoidable
If someone is not clear about the difference between sin and sins, even if he is saved, his salvation is probably an unclear one
If we want to differentiate clearly between sin and sins, there is one portion of the Scriptures which we must consider
In these eight chapters we find one outstanding feature from chapter one through 511 only the word sins is mentioned sin is never mentioned
The only thing that we need to escape and be freed from is that which entices us and compels us to commit sins
A person is governed by the sin in his natural life, but he is condemned in his conscience by the sins committed outwardly
We must remember that it is one thing for a man to have debts; it is another thing for a man to have a disposition for incurring debts
We must make the distinction: Romans 3 is on the problem of sins, and Romans 5 is on the problem of the sinner
If you have not sinned, or to be more accurate, if you have sinned less, you are a moral sinner, or a sinner who sins little
Although we have received fresh grace in Christ, God has not fully removed the problem of sin; we are still sinners
When some listen to the gospel, they spend the whole time reasoning about how many or how few sins they have committed
By and by, when some were kidnapped, they said that they were pastors or preachers of such and such a denomination
Every time someone said that he was a pastor the robbers would ask him to recite the Ten Commandments the Lords Prayer and the Beatitudes
Today you can walk out to the street and meet anyone, and take him by the hand and tell him that he is a sinner
If someone tells you that he never robs or commits fornication, you can tell him that he is a sinner who never robs or commits fornication
The end of the law is to love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength
All the evil, filthy, and terrible things that happen in the world today come from one incident involving Adam
Adam did not murder; he did not commit fornication; he did not commit any of the evil and filthy sins in the world today
When we look into the New Testament, we see the Lord Jesus saying many times that he who believes has eternal life
The Lord Jesus said that the Holy Spirit came that the world would be convicted concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment
In the Old Testament, it was when man lost his proper relationship with God that all kinds of sins were committed
In the New Testament, it is when man loses the proper relationship with the Lord Jesus that all kinds of sins are committed
Neither is there anyone in the whole world who can say that he has not committed the sin of not believing in the Lord
Suppose instead that he had earned a lot of money, that he had gone into business, made a fortune, and became even richer than his father
It is not simply one who has squandered his father's estate, but rather one who has just left his father's house
We become sinners by developing a relationship with sin, and we commit sins by developing a relationship with sins
If he had been a person in the Old Testament age, he would have realized that there was still the sin of not loving God
If he were a person in the New Testament age, he would realize that there is still the sin of not believing in the Lord
Once a man commits these many sins, he brings upon himself the guilt or condemnation for sins, the verdict or judgment for sins
After we have been Christians for many years, we realize that what saddens and bothers us are not the many sins, but sin itself
One comes to realize that all the things that he has done are but outward matters and that the real evil thing is his person
Since God's salvation for man is complete, He must deliver us from the many sins and He must also deliver us from sin itself
If God only delivers us from the many sins, without delivering us from sin, then God's salvation cannot be said to be complete
If we are not clear about these three lines and are not able to distinguish between them, we will not be clear concerning the problem of sin
You could even park your car on the wrong side of the street, and you were free to park your car in any direction
The violation may have happened on Ha-tung Road, but the place where the violation is recorded is the Tsin-an-tsu district police department
The reason an act of sin is evil and terrifying is that once a sin is committed, there is the record of sin before God
Without knowledge, you are ignorant of your sins; and since your conscience does not bother you, you will feel peaceful
As soon as you have the knowledge and begin to realize Gods view and the view of the law concerning you your conscience will not let you go
The moment he hears the gospel and sees his own sins his place before God and the record of his sins before God his conscience has a problem
He will ask what he should do to be able to stand before the righteous God, and how he can become justified before such a righteous God
When the consciences of many wake up, they find that it is too late, that they do not have the opportunity anymore to believe or to be saved
If sin were only in our conscience, then we would need to perform at most ten good works to more than compensate for our one mistake
Why is there no need for God to send many angels to throw men into the lake of fire as though they were throwing stones?
For God to save us, He must deal with our sins before Him, and He must also deal with our sins in our conscience
Something is prompting him and arousing him, telling him that he has not borrowed for months and that he should do it one more time
Those who know the power of sin the most are those who are the holiest, for they are the ones who try to oppose and to stand against sin
Our Bible study this time covers God's way of dealing with our sins before Him and the condemnation of sins in our conscience
The Holy Spirit has applied Christ's work to us, so that we could receive the Lord Jesus and have peace in our conscience
Salvation is accomplished and the gospel is preached because on the one hand God has loved and on the other hand man has sinned
If God hates, He will not only have a conflict with whomever He hates, but will also have a conflict with Himself
If God hated any one of us here today, He would not have a problem with that one alone; He would have a problem with Himself
Many think that they should do something or that they should suffer or should be very conscientious before they can please God
Although you may sin and fail, God does not change His attitude toward you, for God is love and He loves the world
If you put a ball on a surface that is not level, you can be sure that something will happen; it will end up rolling down
Since God loves us, He must provide a solution to the problem of sins; He must provide the salvation that we sinners need
For this reason, the Bible has shown us this one great fact: the love of God is manifested in the death of Christ
Since we are sinners and are unable to save ourselves, Christ came to die in order to solve the problem of sin for us
Thank the Lord that although love is something abstract, with God it is immediately turned into something substantial
When you give him a bowl of rice or a piece of clothing or some money and when the food clothing or money reach him your love becomes grace
Only when there is deprivation and destitution, when there is no way for one to solve his problems on his own, is love realized as grace
We have to admit that mercy is more particularly an Old Testament word, in the same way that grace is more particularly a New Testament word
If you have a cross-reference Bible or a concordance, you will find mercy in the Old Testament far more frequently
Mercy speaks of the poverty of your present condition, and grace speaks of the bright condition that you will be saved into in the future
It is accomplished when this person is rescued today out of his poor condition to a new position, to a new realm and a new environment
He knew that if the Lord Jesus were to sympathize with him, He would not stop at showing mercy to him; He would surely do something
At the same time, we do not have the adequate faith to go to Him and ask for grace, telling Him that we need such and such a blessing
Because God is merciful, if you hear the gospel and are still unable to believe, you can cry, 'Son of David, have mercy on me'!
Ephesians 2:4-5 says, 'But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in offenses'
Before he was saved, he was in a condition of being a blasphemer, a persecutor, an insulting person, and an ignorant and unbelieving person
Mercy has to do with your condition, not the condition after you became a Christian, but the condition before you were saved
It was according to His great mercy that God regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead
Jude 21 says, 'Keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life'
While we are living on earth and keeping ourselves in the love of God, we await the day when the Lord will show mercy to us
Both in the Old Testament as well as in the New Testament, the word mercy is always preceded by either show or have
Mercy is also very good, but it also does not bring us any direct benefit; however with grace there is a direct benefit
Now we not only have an abstract love and a sentimental mercy, but we have grace to meet our needs in a concrete way
If man were without food or clothing or housing, mercy would not be adequate; there would also be the need of grace
For this, man thinks that if only God would be merciful to us and be a bit more lenient, everything would be fine
We think that if there were mercy and that if God would let us go and not reckon with us, everything would be fine
In it we see how the Son of God, Jesus Christ, has come to the world to show forth grace and to become grace so that we might receive grace
Grace is nothing other than Gods great work accomplished freely in His unconditional and boundless love for helpless unworthy and sinful man
If there is the principle of the law and of works and if man is to give something to God, he must give God what He demands
If we forget these three characteristics, we as sinners will not be saved, and we as Christians will fail and fall
Generally speaking, there are three things to man's work: his wrongdoings, his achievements, and his responsibilities
If the question of wrongdoing comes up and if it is stipulated that those with sin shall not have grace, then grace is basically annulled
Because the sick are sick they need a doctor because the poor are poor they need relief and likewise because man is a sinner he needs grace
Our problem today is that we always think that we have to be in a condition that is different from where we are today
On the one hand, we have an absolute need; on the other hand, the ground we stand on is one on which we cannot receive the grace we need
If we do not have any wrongdoings, we do not need God to do anything for us, and as a result, we do not need God's grace
If our sins are taken care of by God, they will be taken care of regardless of whether they are great or small
The Bible shows us clearly in Romans 3:23-24 that 'all have sinned,' but the all who have sinned are 'justified freely by His grace'
Sin is one of man's great mistakes, but to think that sin blocks man from receiving grace is a greater mistake
They think that they have to attain a certain standard of conduct and certain achievements before they can receive grace
If a man gives you a month's labor and you give him a month's wages, the payment cannot be considered a gift; it is a recompense
Romans 44 makes the matter very clear Now to the one who works his wages are not accounted according to grace but according to what is due
Wrongdoings do not stop us from receiving grace; on the contrary, they afford us the opportunity to receive God's grace
If you are standing on a position that is above God, or even one that is equal with God, you cannot receive grace
Even though we dare not say that we come to God only by our achievements, you have to believe that we need some achievements before God
In the same way, neither is grace God's overpayment of a debt, as if God owed you five dollars, but is now returning ten to you
If we are in God's light, and if we have a little knowledge of the Scripture, we will know that we are not qualified to enter in
The problem was not whether they had money or not, whether they were male or female, or whether they were masters or slaves
The difference between them and those inside did not lie in their being rich or poor, male or female, educated or illiterate
Now that we are saved, they say, we should do good works, for if we do not do good works now, we are again doomed to perish
He said that he believed that man is saved by grace, but if man does not behave properly after salvation, he will perish
Good works are related to the kingdom reward, to the crown or punishment, but they have nothing to do with salvation
Romans 6:23 says, 'For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord'
Thank God that because the obtaining of salvation is free the preserving of salvation is likewise eternally free
As the Lord has dealt with us in love, so we deal with the Lord in love; but there is no thought of a trade here
Today if we work serve the Lord suffer reproach or bear the cross it is not because we want to pay back His grace it is because we love Him
The love with which He has loved us has taken hold of us, captured our hearts, and constrained us to serve Him
In Romans, Ephesians, and Galatians, the apostle Paul shows repeatedly that man is saved by grace, not by the law
Similarly, there are places in the Bible where the word law has a definite article, and we should read the law
The meanings of these words with the definite article is quite different from their meanings without the definite article
In many places in the Bible, law refers to the principle God applies toward us, or the principle of God's requirement of us
The condition for fellowship between God and man is God's requirement upon man, what God wants man to do for Him, to accomplish for Him
If we know the purpose of God's giving the law, neither will we say that man can be saved through the works of the law
Since man has become fleshly, there are three things in him that are unchangeable: his conduct, his lust, and his will
The cross signifies the great love God has in dealing with man; but it also signifies the tremendous hatred man has toward God
Romans 8:7-8 says, 'Because the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be
Being unable to be in subjection is a matter of our nature and our lust; being unwilling to be in subjection is a matter of our will
Man thinks that he can be saved by the works of the law because he has never read the Bible or seen the light or the heavenly revelation
If you want to know whether or not you can be saved by the works of the law, you need to first ask why God gave the law
Only after you find out God's purpose in giving the law will you know whether or not you can be saved by the works of the law
Once God tells us His intention in giving the law, we will know whether man can be saved by the works of the law or not
The apostle Paul tells us that God had a thought, and this thought began before the times of the ages, before the creation of the world
Before man ever sinned and even before the creation of the world God had already made the decision to give us His grace through Christ Jesus
Paul says that God 'has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to His own purpose and grace'
He desired to save us and to call us with a holy calling according to His purpose, according to what He plans to do
God's salvation is not according to how much we can do for God; it is not according to how much responsibility we can bear before Him
You see that though this grace was planned long ago, it was not until the Lord Jesus came that we knew what grace really was
When God spoke to Abraham, it was the first time God revealed His purpose that had been planned before the times of the ages
God told him that His purpose, from before the times of the ages, was that through his seed, Jesus Christ, the nations would be blessed
God sees that we are not doing well, and He wants to help us; but we may still think that we are quite capable
We human beings are sinful and completely incapable, but we may still consider ourselves to be good and useful
God's purpose from before the times of the ages was to give grace, and in time He told Abraham that He would indeed give grace to man
Even with contracts between men, once they are signed, it is impossible to add conditions to them or to subtract conditions from them
Paul says, 'He does not say, 'And to the seeds,' as concerning many, but as concerning one: 'And to your seed,' who is Christ'
Since God wants to bless the nations through Christ Jesus, why did He give man the law four hundred and thirty years later?
Since the covenant God made with Abraham could not be annulled or supplemented, why would not the Lord Jesus just come to give us grace?
Although God gave the law to man, the covenant He made four hundred and thirty years before could not be made of none effect
God could not cancel the covenant formerly made after some further thought four hundred and thirty years later
If what was to be given is according to the principle of the law, it cannot be according to the principle of promise
If the covenant made by God could not be changed, either by subtracting from it or by adding to it, why then was the law given?
God gave the law to the Jews because He wanted to show the world through the Jews that He gave the law because of transgressions
We were corrupted already, but we did not know about it until the law came, at which time the sin within was manifested as transgressions
If you say to him, 'Friend, your complexion does not look very good; you have a temperature,' he may not believe you
Even when his clothes are very dirty, he can still eat with his father, sit with his father, and walk with his father
One day his father tells him that he cannot get his clothes dirty anymore, and that if he does it again, he will spank him
Now if he behaves according to his habit and does this again, he will have no peace within and his conscience will speak
All the Bible readers and all those who understand God's will know that God did not give us the law with the intention that we keep it
God gave us the law, and once we look at the law, we have to humble ourselves and confess that we are really not good at all
The law does not cause us to do anything that we have not done before; the law merely exposes what is in us already
Friends, remember that God gave you the law for one reason only: to show you that you have always been full of sin
The problem is that mans being is fleshly and because man is fleshly his will is weak his conduct is rebellious and his desires are filthy
When the law came and we tried to keep it, we realized where our sins are and how sinful and thoroughly evil they are
The law will not cause you to sin, but if you have sins, God's law will immediately show you that you are a sinner
Rather, the law was specifically given to the Israelites because it showed fleshly man his inward condition and his sin within
In this way, man realized that he had sin and would wait 'until the seed should come to whom the promise was made'
Man does not want God's grace, but because man has transgressions and is hopeless, he will possibly receive God's grace
There are these two features to the law it was added because of transgressions and it was ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator
When parties A and B draft a contract, the contract states what A must do and what B will do in return and vice versa
Paul concludes in this way: 'For if a law had been given which was able to give life, righteousness would have indeed been of law'
God shuts up all under sin 'in order that the promise out of faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe'
In the previous meetings we have seen that man has sinned and that God's salvation is based on the fact that man has sinned
Thank the Lord that though we have sin and though we have transgressed, God, who is love, purposed to give us grace and mercy
If God is to give us salvation, He cannot give it in a manner that conflicts with His nature, His method, and His way
If God forgives carelessly not judging the sinner's sin and dealing with his sins according to the law, where is His righteousness?
If God were to forgive us irresponsibly, what law, what righteousness, and what truth would be left in the universe?
They often help others out, and others often receive benefits from them; but we all agree that these people are not proper
There is one book in the Bible, the book of Romans, that tells us how God deals specifically with this one problem
They translate: 'To declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God'
It should read For the demonstrating of His righteousness in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred
While God justifies those who believe in Jesus, He is shown to be righteous, and man is to acknowledge Him as being righteous
Concerning the sins of the present time, He says that what is done is also for the demonstrating of His righteousness
The coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to the earth was God's requirement in righteousness; it was not God's requirement in grace
Because God was not willing to give up His righteousness, He preferred to have His Son die rather than give up His righteousness
Before the Lord Jesus came to the earth and was crucified on the cross, it would have been fine for God to refuse to save us
1 John 1:9 says, 'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
Today when we come to God through the accomplished work of Jesus Christ, God has to forgive us based on His faithfulness and righteousness
Now that the Lord Jesus has died, even if God were unhappy about saving us, strictly speaking He still has to do it
After what we have seen concerning Gods righteousness and the righteousness that the Lord Jesus has accomplished Romans 31926 is wonderful
Verse 20 says Because out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him for through the law is the clear knowledge of sin
Even the prophets in the Old Testament, including David and all the other prophets, testified to the same thing
Verse 22 says, 'Even the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ to all those who believe, for there is no distinction'
The propitiation place is the covering of the ark in the Old Testament tabernacle; it was the place where God bestowed grace upon man
They act as if God's heart is very hard and believe that before God would forgive them or turn His heart toward them they have to cry much
Most people today are ignorant first of God's righteousness and then of the fact that the Lord Jesus has accomplished God's righteousness
He is still calculating, hoping to save a little here or there, to do this or that, to generate a little money for the repayment of the debt
He still wants to say to his creditor that though he owes ten thousand talents, he does have a few pennies with him
Paul said that all those seeking to establish their own righteousness are not subject to the righteousness of God
Not to be subject to the righteousness of God is not to be subject to the work that God has accomplished in His Son Jesus
If any man wants to establish his own righteousness today, he is denying the sufficiency of the Lord's work on the cross
In other words, God has not just given you ten thousand talents of silver; all the money in the world has been given you
It is true that we are now saved, and that our sins are forgiven, but what do we do while living on this earth?
Regarding His children, God declares something most amazing here: 'Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf'
If you do not know what God's righteousness is, all you need to do is find a saved person and take a good look at him
If you want to know what God's righteousness is, just find a Christian and you will know that God has not dealt with our sins irresponsibly
Because of what happened in the first parable, there is the second parable, in which a woman lights a lamp to seek for the lost coin
The Holy Spirit has enlightened us and has caused us to be convicted concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment
By the time the Father comes, the matter of sin need not be mentioned anymore; He only has to do the work of welcoming us
Suppose a person has not yet come to God, but he sees that he is a sinner and realizes that the Lord Jesus has judged his sins
When such a one returns home, he has to realize that the matter of sin is forever gone; it has been dealt with on the cross
God has said that once we were lost, but now we have been found, that once we were dead, but now we have come to life
The man answered that if he wanted to be forgiven he had to feel remorseful at heart and do good and do this and that and many other things
After the man had listed all the things that should be done, our brother said, 'This is precisely the point of controversy
If God only loves us, He may spare us from the judgment of sins or may let us off easily, if that is something that He can do
Now that God has given us His righteousness, we are at peace, for we know that our sins have been judged in the person of Christ
Although in reality God's love is reliable, from man's point of view it is not as reliable as God's righteousness
When a person first begins to trust in God, he should learn to trust more in His righteousness than in His love
If God cannot be careless about sin and would rather judge His Son in order to deal with sin, we also cannot be careless toward sin
We rejoice not only because our sins have been forgiven, but because they have been forgiven after being dealt with
Last night we saw that, in spite of God's love and His desire to give us grace, there was one hindrance to grace's coming to us
At the same time, we have to see how the Lord Jesus satisfies the heart of the Christian so that we would be satisfied with His work also
A song which we sing says, 'God's heart is satisfied with the work of the Lord Jesus, and our hearts are also at rest with His work'
It seemed that everything good was with the Lord Jesus and everything bad was with God, that God is terrible and the Lord Jesus is lovable
The unsaved ones who do not know God consider that there is only one solution, which is for man to solve it by himself
The substitution that some talk about is not the substitution in the Bible, because their kind of substitution involves unrighteousness
In a court proceeding, only the one who has sinned against someone and the one who has been sinned against have the right to speak
Concerning the sinner's salvation, if the sinner does not take care of it himself, then God has to take care of it for him
On the sinner's side, it is righteous for him to suffer judgment and punishment, perish, and go into perdition
Only the sinning one can bear the consequence of sin; he has the right to bear his own responsibility and suffer judgment for his own sin
The only purpose for God to say this to the whole world is to condemn man and prove to him that he is a sinner
The Greek text shows us clearly that although the Lord Jesus was tempted in all things, He was never tempted by sin
If the Lord Jesus had any sin, His death would have been for Himself; He would not have been able to die for us
God has transferred the Lord's righteousness to us in the same way that banks transfer money from one account to another
If the righteousness of the Lord Jesus were transferable to us, He could have done this while He was living on earth
Everyone who reads the Gospels knows that the Jews sent Him to the Gentiles, and the Gentiles crucified Him on the cross
For the past two thousand years, many martyrs and disciples of the Lord had a much stronger voice than He did when they were about to die
We all like sheep have gone astray; / Each of us has turned to his own way, / And Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all / To fall on Him
If You make His soul a trespass offering He will see a seed He will extend His days And the pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in His hand
Those who stood by the cross at the time the Lord was crucified marveled and wondered why this man was being crucified
When the Lord Jesus was praying in the garden of Gethsemane, He may have seemed like the weakest of all men, without any courage
When He came out from the garden and met many evil men, He said, 'I am,' and 'they drew back and fell to the ground'
The Jews could mock Him, and the Gentiles could chastise and shame Him, but the sun was beyond the Jews' control
If it had merely been man's hand and man's crucifixion, that would have been the time He needed God's presence even more
We who have believed in the work of redemption know that the work of the cross was for Him to be judged by sin
The cross of the Lord shows us how evil sin is and how much of a price God has paid for the work of redemption
When the Lord accomplished redemption on the cross, this work of redemption had absolutely nothing to do with man
If we read the Old Testament, we will discover that the blood for the atonement of sin was brought into the Holy of Holies
The Lord Jesus has satisfied God's righteous requirements so that we can receive the substitution of the Lord Jesus
If one has not participated in this work, his sins are not yet solved, and he has no part in the substitution of Jesus
God's work of redemption is a matter regarding Himself; it is to satisfy Himself and has nothing to do with us
Although we say that the Lord Jesus has fulfilled God's righteous requirements, what does God have to say about this?
How can God show us that His Son has indeed accomplished the work of redemption and indeed met His requirements?
Regarding the redemptive work of the Lord, there is not only the aspect of the cross but the aspect of resurrection as well
If the Lord had not resurrected, though the redemption would have been accomplished, our hearts would be held in suspense
Since we are good friends and since you are here in Soochow, you should take a trip to Tiger Hill and the Winter Mountain Shrine
My friends you should not look at the cross you should not worry about whether the cross is sensible or not and whether it is right or wrong
Because God saw that the work of the Lord had fulfilled all the righteous requirements of God, everyone who comes to God is now justified
After he had counted all the money, he put his signature on the slip and passed it to another senior officer, who also signed the slip
As long as the bank took the money and put its signature on the slip, the money was genuine, and all the problems were over
If the Lord Jesus had died only, then the whole world could only have hope in Him; it could not have assurance in Him
Can you find one place in the entire Bible that says that we should believe that the Lord Jesus has died for us?
There is not a single verse in the entire New Testament that tells us that we should believe in the Lord's death for us
There is not a single place in the New Testament that says that we should believe in the Lord Jesus' dying for us
Why does the Bible not ask us to believe in the cross of the Lord, but asks us to believe in His resurrection?
Why does the Bible never ask us to believe in the cross of the Lord Jesus, but ask us to believe that God has raised Him from the dead?
The Lord's death and the redemptive work that He accomplished are transactions that went on between God and the Lord Jesus
Even if the redemption of the Lord were wrong, whatever mistakes there could be, God would never issue a wrong receipt
You do not have to ask whether the blood of the Lord is sufficient, or whether the Lord's work of redemption is approved
You may think that to believe in Jesus is not sufficient to be forgiven of your sins, that you may still have to do some good works
When God raised His Son from the dead, it proved that the redemption that His Son accomplished was a righteous one
Another wonderful thing is seen in 1 Corinthians 15:3 which says, 'Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures'
The redemption and deliverance from sin before God is due to the Lord's death; it is not due to His resurrection
The Lord's death redeems us from sins, and the Lord's resurrection allows us to know that we have been redeemed from our sins
The words 'the sins of' in the phrase 'the sins of the whole world' in some versions are not in the original text
The Chinese Union Version reads, 'And He is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world'
In Greek it should read, 'And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the whole world'
There are differences between the three pairs of things: ourselves and our sins, the all and the many, and sin and sins
If the Lord Jesus had died for the sins of all, then whether or not one believes, he can be saved, for all the problems of sins are solved
You can see that when it talks about Christ's bearing of sins, it says 'to bear the sins of many,' and not 'to bear the sins of all'
If Christ bore the sins of all, if He bore all the sins of everyone in the world, then we would not have to preach the gospel anymore
As long as you ask for it, the effectiveness of the Lord's death will be upon you, and you will have a share in it
The death of the Lord Jesus was not only for us, but for the whole world, so that the whole world may receive this death
If the Lord Jesus died for the sins of the whole world, then all the wrongdoings of all the world were removed
We have also seen how God through His Son Jesus died for us and for our sins, thus accomplishing the work of redemption
The ascension of the Lord Jesus is His appearing before God on our behalf, that we might be accepted in Christ
The gospel is inadequate if it mentions only the work of the Father and the Son without mentioning the work of the Holy Spirit
One sees the Father waiting at home for the repentant and saved sinner, and one also sees the Son coming to the world to save sinners
The Holy Spirit is working together with the Father and the Son to seek out the sinner for the accomplishing of the gospel work
Without the enlightening of the Holy Spirit, we will not admit that as a result of sin, we became lost persons before God
Our problem before God does not lie merely in how much we have wasted ourselves in eating, drinking, fornication, or gambling
The first thing he realized when he came to himself was that in his father's house there was an abundance of bread
My friends, when a person in the world has come to the end of himself in his sinful condition, he may, like Judas, become aware of his sins
Without the light of the Holy Spirit, he will not feel that he has left the Father's house and is in a distant country
Although there is the love of the Father and the work of the Lord, there is still the need for the Holy Spirit to prepare man's heart
One can say that the Lord Jesus is our objective Savior from God and that the Holy Spirit is our subjective Savior from God
If a person has wandered to a distant country and is wrong in his relationship with his father, he must be wrong in all other relationships
The light of the Holy Spirit enlightens and exposes all the areas in which you have transgressed against others
There is one thing we continually neglect in our preaching of the gospel, which the Bible pays attention to all the time
They may think that they have to pray for a long time, and they have no assurance whether God would listen to their prayers
Since God has caused the Lord Jesus to die and resurrect for us, all who desire to be saved need only to go to God and tell Him
If you think that even to call once is a work, then God says just believe a little in your heart and it will be enough
The characteristic of the Lord Jesus is His grace, and the characteristic of the Holy Spirit is His fellowship
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
The love of God is in the grace of the Lord Jesus, and the grace of the Lord Jesus is in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
After God has accomplished His work through His Son, He declares it to us and shows us through the words of the Bible
In other words, God has placed the grace that the Lord accomplished for us in His own Word and has sent this Word to us
If we took away the work of the Lord Jesus from the Word of God, God's Word would become zero; nothing would be left
We receive God's Word by faith, and the Holy Spirit opens up the work of the Lord that is contained in God's Word
If the temperature becomes too high or too low, or if other elements are added into the culture, the bacteria will die
If the truths understood by the Lord's children are separated from the Holy Spirit, they will gradually dry out and die
That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved'
God has even sent the Holy Spirit to convict and enlighten us and to give us the strength to accept the work of God
In the entire New Testament at least one hundred and fifty times it says that man is saved justified and has eternal life through faith only
The Bible shows us clearly from God's point of view that there is no other condition to salvation than to believe
The Bible shows us clearly, adequately, and simply that salvation is not based on who man is, what he has, and what he has done
Since giving is in the principle of grace on God's side, then receiving is in the principle of faith on our side
Although the Bible shows us that through faith one receives God's grace, many doctrines have emerged as a result of man's misunderstanding
Man comes up with theories that are based on his own thoughts and darkened mind, involving what he should do before he can be saved
If man does not see God's truth and does not understand His Word, he will not realize that the condition for salvation is faith
If a man sees Gods light and understands Gods truth he will not be able to overturn the New Testament fact that salvation is through faith
The problem today is that after man realizes faith as the condition of salvation, he adds something else to faith
Suppose there is a person who has the disposition and temperament of walking back and forth outside the meeting hall every day
In his temperament, disposition, and life, there is something that compels him to walk back and forth outside the meeting hall
You may not like what he does, and you may think that it is wrong, but he has no realization that this is wrong
God established the law, not in order that man would not sin, but in order to expose man's sins and make them transgressions
The strange thing is that man takes the law, which is there to prove his sin, to try to prove that he is righteous
God wants us to know through the law that we have sinned, but we want to prove through the law that we are righteous
God wants to show us through the law that we are perishing, but we want to prove through the law that we are saved
These matters typify the Lord Jesus' accomplishment of redemption and its subsequent salvation for us in the New Testament
It is so strange that man would try to establish his own righteousness not only through the law, but also through these types
We even find a Pharisee praying that he fasted twice a week and that he offered to God one tenth of what he had
In the New Testament, the apostles, or we should say the Holy Spirit, knew clearly that the readers of it may not necessarily all be Jews
Christianity says that Adam has been crucified and removed and that the Adamic race has been annihilated through the cross of the Lord Jesus
If one wants to be saved through keeping the law, he has to realize the serious consequence of the phrase keeping the law
Since the fall of man, the cherubim and the flaming sword were guarding the tree of life in the garden of Eden
Since the Lord Jesus has died resurrected and ascended the salvation we receive now is equivalent to what we would obtain if we keep the law
Of course we are not just saved when we believe in Jesus in saving us the Lord Jesus grants us many other things apart from the law as well
If, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also have been found sinners, is then Christ a minister of sin?
Paul asked that if he was not justified after he had believed in the Lord Jesus, did that mean that Christ is a minister of sin?
Please remember these two sentences: man is not saved by the law, and neither is he saved by faith with the law
It is also like saying the water from the faucet comes by the reservoir in the water department and through the pipes
It does not matter how fast you advance spiritually, for salvation is still of the free grace of the Lord Jesus
One must not forget that the Bible says that if we pay but a little attention to work, God's grace is annulled
Romans 4:4 and 5 say, 'Now to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due
To the one who does not work, but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted as righteousness'
When it is not work or labor, but only faith in the God who justifies the sinner, that faith is reckoned as righteousness
Since the work of salvation and redemption have been accomplished, there is no possibility for us to work out this salvation
We must declare that the work of the Lord Jesus has not been accomplished; the Lord's work has not been finished
The second difference lies in the method that man enters the kingdom of the heavens and the way he obtains eternal life
The Lord also says, 'Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens'
There is not such a thing, because eternal life is free grace; it is given through the Lord Jesus to all those who believe in Him
The Lord said that even though they promised that they would and could, the matter is still not up to Him to decide
God's attitude toward eternal life and the kingdom of the heavens is different: one is the gift of God, and the other is the reward of God
Revelation 20 shows us that the martyrs receive the kingdom, although it does not say that they are the only ones who receive the kingdom
The Bible shows us clearly that no person on earth who is rich according to his own ways can enter into the kingdom of the heavens
In order to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, and in order to gain a place in the kingdom, they choose to remain virgins
Those who use the world should be as those not using it, and those who buy should be as those who do not possess
If one would consider a little, he will realize that in the Bible, the kingdom and eternal life are two absolutely different things
We cannot enter the kingdom of the heavens unless our righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and the Pharisees
Romans declares positively how man is justified; Galatians argues negatively how to be justified and how not to be justified
If a man says that he is a godly Christian, his godliness should be manifested in his care and giving to the orphans and widows
All these words have to do with giving to others, showing mercy on others, not despising the poor, and helping others
Would you ignore all that was spoken in two weeks and just take the eight or nine sentences that you hear in that one message?
Romans and Galatians are specifically on justification, whereas James only mentions a few words about justification
If you hold on tenaciously to your wallet and tell others to go in peace, saying that you have faith, what good does this kind of faith do?
If you see a brother in poverty and give him money, clothing, or food, and then believe, then there is basis for your faith
When God saw us poor, hungry, naked, and dead in sin, He came to accomplish the work of redemption so that we could be saved
It is because God is not sitting in the clouds saying May everyone in the whole world be saved and may everyone not go to the lake of fire
Rather, God came down personally from heaven to accomplish His righteousness and to deal with sin on the cross
If you were to ask Paul to come here today and comment on this, even he would say that this kind of faith is dead
If a vain and boastful person keeps on boasting, someone will eventually rise up and say, 'You say that you have faith
If you pay attention to the tone here, you have to admit that this word is spoken to the vain and boastful person
Many times we do not give something to beggars because we are afraid that doing so would cause them to be beggars forever
Because they will not listen after he has spoken so much to them, he has to taunt them and shout at them a little
Verse 21 says, 'Was not Abraham our father justified by works in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar'?
James also mentions the case of Abraham, but he uses it to prove that man is justified not only by faith, but by works as well
Suppose a brother tells his son that if he memorizes a list of vocabulary words tonight, he will receive five pieces of candy tomorrow
Everyone who wants to understand the book of Galatians must realize that a promise is without condition and without work
Paul says strongly that justification is not by works, but James could not strongly say that justification is not by faith
Paul is the one who talks about the principle, so he can boldly declare that justification is of faith and not of works
Let us read James 2:21 again: 'Was not Abraham our father justified by works in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar'?
It was a fulfillment of the words in Genesis 15 that say that Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness
James was afraid that we would not be clear about the case of Abraham, so in verse 25 we see another illustration
And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works in that she received the messengers and sent them out by a different way
If some say that this is justification by works, it is something that they themselves are saying; it is not what James is saying
He says that when Rahab let the two men who spied out Jericho get away, it was reckoned to her as righteousness
When the Israelites left Egypt and went into the wilderness, they could not settle down anywhere, but had to wander for forty years
If the walls of Jericho had been made of straw or chicken feathers, we might think that the walls could have indeed fallen
If the men sent by the king of Jericho had found the spies in her house, immediately she would have lost her life
Finally, verse 26 says, 'For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead'
Still others express it by not going along with their husband in certain things or by forsaking their position
Formerly, we tried our best to do good, as if God would save us if He were only impressed enough by our good works
If we wish to talk about works, then our works must be as perfect as Christ's are before God, before they can be acceptable
In the past two messages, we have seen that the way of salvation on man's side is through faith, rather than the law or works
Although we cannot cover these ways in detail, we hope that we can enumerate all of them in the coming two messages
From the very beginning to the very end of the Gospel of John, we cannot find a single occurrence of the word repentance
Not only does it not mention repentance directly, it does not mention repentance even indirectly or metaphorically
Salvation is free, but because man's mind is full of the law and works, he never considers that God would give salvation to him freely
Whether it is the keeping of the law the performing of good works or the need for repentance man always thinks that he has to do something
Please remember that the repentance mentioned in the Bible and the repentance that we talk about are two different things
According to his mind, repentance is not something for the past, but is something to deal with the present and the future
Some have invented a new doctrine, unknown to the New Testament, based on this Chinese word, saying that some people only hwe but do not gai
He realizes that he was bad and that he was a sinner, but now, he should not be bad and should no longer be a sinner
The repentance that man talks about simply speaks of one thing: he is not willing to lower himself to the bottom rung
It concerns what we have done in the past, what we have thought and said, and what we were as persons in the past
In Luke 13:3 the Lord Jesus told the Jews that if they did not repent of what they did, they would die like the Galileans did
Acts 822 says Repent therefore from this wickedness of yours and beseech the Lord if perhaps the intent of your heart may be forgiven you
It means that Simon should repent of what he has just done, what he has just said, and what his thoughts have been
After seeing how the word is used in Luke, Acts, and Revelation, we can now understand what repentance really means in the Bible
It is always used in reference to the deeds of the past and is never used in reference to conduct in the future
We may say that faith is our looking up to Christ, and repentance is our looking at ourselves in the light of Christ
Without the enlightening of the Holy Spirit and the realization of ourselves, we cannot lift our eyes to the Lord Jesus
He does not know that he is condemned before God, that he is absolutely useless, and that he is, therefore, unable to receive God's grace
After you see the result of your own X-ray, you will admit that you are a sick man and that you need rest and treatment
If we misunderstand repentance to think that it is a change of our future behavior, we are absolutely ignorant of God's salvation
In the same way, there must first be the tilling work in God's salvation before the plants will grow in a deep way
Those who never feel that they have sinned will not be saved, and neither will those who never feel that they are wrong
In the New Testament, by the time of the book of Acts, the Holy Spirit had come and the full gospel was preached
He also said that 'he who has two tunics, let him share with the one who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise'
The apostle Peter preached to them the word of God and showed them what they had done to the Lord Jesus and what God had done to Him
Please remember that slightly more than a month before Pentecost, the same group of people were shouting, 'Take Him away!
Formerly, they considered the Lord Jesus as worthy of death; they shouted to crucify Him and to release Barabbas instead
What they had to do was judge themselves and be baptized upon the name of the Lord Jesus as an expression of their faith in Him
He explained that this was not his work, and it was not through his godliness that such a person was made to walk
In verses 15-20 he said, 'And the Author of life you killed, whom God has raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses
Repent therefore and turn, that your sins may be wiped away, so that seasons of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord'
He was saying that we believe in His being raised from the dead, that we believe in His name, and that His name had made the man strong
One cannot cut the matter neatly with a pair of scissors, with one side being faith and the other side being repentance
If you ask one hundred people when they were saved, perhaps only fifty can give you the exact date and year of their salvation
We have to realize that when the word of God is preached, different people have different reactions according to their own condition
Acts 17:30 says, 'Therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance, God now charges all men everywhere to repent'
Paul confessed before King Agrippa's judgment that his work was to cause men to repent and turn to God and do works worthy of repentance
Not only does this repentance have nothing to do with man's work, but it becomes one item within the scope of faith
Acts 5:31 says, 'This One God has exalted to His right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins'
When we preach the gospel, we can say that as we have forgiveness through the Lord Jesus, in the same way we have repentance through Him
While we were there or after we had returned to work, or while we were walking on the street or reading a book, we were convicted
In Acts 11, after Peter preached the gospel in the house of Cornelius, the Jewish brothers rebuked him for going to the house of a Gentile
Timothy 2:25 says, 'In meekness correcting those who oppose, if perhaps God may give them repentance unto the full knowledge of the truth'
Even in the Gospels, when the Lord Jesus came to preach the gospel, not only did He preach forgiveness but repentance as well
Lastly there is another verse telling us that it is God's goodness and kindness that is leading us to repentance
We have seen in the past few evenings that the way for a person to be saved is not through law-keeping, good works, or repentance
In so doing, they invent different ways to salvation, such as the keeping of the law, good works, repentance, and so forth
There are those who advocate that salvation is by confession, that it is necessary for man not only to repent, but to confess his sins
He said that when we receive the Lord Jesus as Savior, we must confess our sins either before God or before men
You would finally be saved when you had finished confessing all of your sins and all the sheets of paper had been torn away
He was unable to recognize most of the words in a Bible verse and needed to ask for help seven or eight times in reading a single verse
After his sermon, the speaker sought questions from the audience to see if there were things we were unclear about'
If we think that we can be saved through confession, then the solution to the problem of our sins is still not clear to us
The Gospel of John describes the way a sinner is justified by God, but 1 John indicates how a Christian may restore his fellowship with God
Remember that, whereas an unsaved person is forgiven of his sins by faith, a saved one is forgiven by confessing his sins
Sinners are pardoned by believing in the Lord, and Christians are forgiven by confessing their sins before their Father
They were in fact looking to the very Lord who was to pass through death and resurrection, and in whom they hoped for their salvation
In baptisms of the church, and in the baptism of John the Baptist, the Christ who died and rose is referred to
Of course, if a person, upon realizing his own sins, should stand up to make a confession on his own, we have to let him do so
A correspondent of a well-known British newspaper actually went to Wales in 1909 to conduct an investigation of the event
One day, when someone told him that Evan Roberts was in a small chapel, the reporter dashed off immediately to the place
Once in a while someone would stand to call a hymn, or another might rise to read a few verses from the Scriptures
If a person is led by the Spirit to confess his sins, we all have to say, 'O God, we thank and praise You, for You have worked among us'
The people were being baptized by John in the Jordan River, and while they were being baptized, they also confessed their sins
We may say that 'he spoke, walking,' which would mean that the person was speaking and walking at the same time
They were being baptized and confessing, just like our example of someone speaking and walking at the same time
In 1 John 1 it says confess our sins in Matthew 3 it says confessed their sins and here it says confessing and making known their practices
They are no longer afraid to tell the saints that they have been transferred from the miry clay onto a solid rock
Friends, you can discover from these three portions of the Word that the way of salvation is through faith and not through public confession
There is one other place, in James 5:16, where confession of wrongdoing to one another, rather than confession of sins, is mentioned
James tells us when a brother or sister is sick, the elders of the church should be called to pray over the sick person and anoint him
Having seen God's righteousness and the glory in His presence, we now realize that it is unrighteous to be indebted to others
There is no problem with your sins being forgiven before God, but you must make confession to men of your offenses to men
He was already saved on the cross; his salvation was altogether not due to any kind of confession or restitution
We are clearly shown that salvation is by faith, whereas confession is a spontaneous expression of Christian living
We wish to make recompense and to confess to those whom we have defrauded so that we may live a righteous life on earth
After we are saved, as the Holy Spirit works in us, we want to tell others what kind of sinners we were and how many sins we have committed
One seeks to be saved through praying and begging because he is entirely ignorant of God's love and God's grace
The prophets 'cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them'
Today there are those who also think that if they bring distress upon themselves and plead enough with God, He will have compassion on them
Because they have never seen God in the light of the gospel, they believe that their begging before God will turn His heart towards them
It is simply pointless and senseless for you to continue to beg after your parents have already given the item to you
It would be a strange thing indeed if someone gave you something and you were still begging instead of thanking!
If you know God's heart, and if you are clear about the Lord Jesus' work, you would never attempt to be saved through prayer
It was, of course, not an easy thing for God to accomplish salvation; it took God four thousand years to accomplish it
It is only after God has done so much work and expended so much effort that we can receive salvation in such an easy way
Romans 105 through 7 reads For Moses writes concerning the righteousness which is out of the law The man who does them shall live by them
The righteousness which is out of faith speaks in this way, 'Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven'?
God has already caused the Lord Jesus to die and resurrect, and His resurrection has become the basis of our justification
When the people were scattered among the nations of the earth as predicted in Deuteronomy 30, they could no longer claim to have any work
As long as he believes that God has brought Him down from the heavens and has brought Him up from Hades, everything will be worked out
Why is one saved when he confesses with his mouth Jesus as Lord and believes in his heart that God has raised Him from the dead?
For with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation'
Verse 12 says, 'For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him'
When you believe in your heart that Jesus is the Savior, spontaneously you will pray with your mouth that Jesus is Lord
Although the word says 'Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved,' yet calling is not the way to salvation
The reason is that calling comes from faith; it is a spontaneous action, something uttered before God spontaneously
Let us come back to verse 12: 'For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all'
Romans 322 and 23 say Even the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ to all those who believe for there is no distinction
May the Lord be gracious to us and show us that the only way of salvation in the Bible is faith and nothing else
We have seen the problems God encountered when He prepared this salvation for us and how He completely solved all the problems of sin
The first is the concept that in order to be saved, man has to love God: If a man does not love God, he will not be saved
It is God who loved the world and gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes into Him should not perish, but have eternal life
One has to love God with his whole heart, his whole soul, his whole strength, and his whole mind, and has to love his neighbor as himself
If this passage beginning from Luke 10:25 ended with verse 28, the truths of the Bible would contradict one another
If that were the case, man would have to love God with his whole heart, his whole soul, his whole strength, and his whole mind
It would also have been hard for him to ask who he was, for of all the men in the world, only philosophers do not know who they are
By coincidence a certain priest was going down on that road; and when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side
Which of these three, does it seem to you, has become a neighbor to him who fell into the hands of the robbers'?
If you see one who has not been beaten, that one may still have the heart, the soul, the strength, and the mind to do something
It would still be possible for him to love God with his whole heart, his whole soul, his whole strength, and his whole mind
If you tell the sinner to love God with all his heart, soul, strength, and mind, he would say that he has never loved God in his life
If you have never heard anything about loving your neighbor, you would not know how important it is to love your neighbor
Once you have heard the word about loving your neighbor, you will realize that you have never loved your neighbor
The words in the law such as loving God, loving the neighbors, not coveting or killing, are there only to expose our sinfulness
Not only is there no love with the whole heart, whole soul, whole strength, and whole mind, there is not any love for God at all
Wine symbolizes the blood of the Lord in redeeming us, and oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit applying the work of the Lord to us
Whether it is the Bible schools, the Sunday schools, or the Sunday pulpits, they all tell people that one has to be a good Samaritan
It does not mean that one should not love God with his whole heart, his whole soul, his whole strength, and his whole mind
In Luke 7, the Lord Jesus told Simon that he who has been forgiven the most loves the most, and he who has been forgiven little loves little
It is not a matter that he who loves much receives much forgiveness, and he who loves little receives little forgiveness
We have to see that not only does salvation refer to a man's salvation before God, but it also refers to his salvation before men
We can say that he who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but not that he who believes and is baptized shall not be condemned
The Lord Jesus said in verse 5: 'Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God'
In verses 6 and 8, when it mentions this matter again, it mentions only being born of the Spirit, without mentioning being born of water
There is only one condition to be saved before God and to come out of condemnation before God, which is to believe
Through His servants, His apostles, the Lord Jesus told us of His work: When He died on the cross, we were also included in His death
If we do not twist the Word of God but trust in it, we will see from it that none of those things are a condition for salvation
If God's way of salvation required something from us, that something would become an obstacle to our salvation
If one of them saw him walking with this young girl dressed in that kind of way in the middle of the night, what would they think?
In tears the woman said, 'Can you do nothing for a woman who has been sinful all her life to help her enter God's kingdom at the last hour?
Is that all you can do to help a dying woman to get into God's kingdom, who will have no tomorrow and who will have no second chance'?
She had told him that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God, that He was crucified, and that He shed His blood to cleanse us from sins
If you say that one must be baptized before he can be saved, then the thief on the cross could not be saved, because he was not baptized
Although we do not understand how the cross has satisfied God's heart, we know that Jesus of Nazareth has risen from the grave
We can go to the world to tell everyone of the work God has accomplished through the death of His Son Jesus Christ
At the same time, we can tell others that through the resurrection of the Lord, God has given us a receipt and a proof
He believes in the cross, but how does he know that the cross has solved all his problems and settled his case?
If you repay someone some money, how do you know that the amount paid is sufficient and that the bank notes are genuine?
Only one thing will assure you that the amount has been fully paid a receipt from your creditor saying that the amount has been paid in full
In the same way, the death of the Lord Jesus speaks of what He has done for God, while His resurrection speaks of what God has done for us
Death is the settlement between Him and God, but resurrection is the announcement to us of the settlement between God and His Son
If you believe that the Lord's death is for your sins, the Lord's resurrection will then declare that your sin record has been cleared
The death of the Lord Jesus was the settlement of the debt, and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus was the proof of this settlement
You may say that you cried for your sins that day, but how do you know that your tears will wash your sins away?
It is not sufficient for a person just to believe in the cross and to receive the redemption of the Lord on the cross
If God were standing among us today, and He wanted to show us His Son's work and the proof of this work, how could He do it?
Please read verse 10: 'He who believes into the Son of God has the testimony in himself; he who does not believe God has made Him a liar'
Please notice the next clause: 'Because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son'
We have seen what God has done for us, what problems He has solved through His Son, and what proofs He has given us
Over the past eighteen hundred years, George Muller may be considered as one of the men with the greatest faith
The greatest problem of man, and his most foolish thought as well, is to be confused about the condition for the Holy Spirit's work
Man thinks that if he repents God will work or if he is baptized God will work or if he confesses his sins or does good works God will work
If you have a proper relationship with the Word of God, the Holy Spirit will communicate to you all the works of God and the Lord Jesus
It may seem that what you receive are dead things, but when the Holy Spirit comes, He will make them alive in you
Perhaps you may ask, 'Why would the Holy Spirit communicate to us all of God's work in His Word when we believe in this Word'?
The King James Version translates this word as the noun substance but in the original language it is not a noun but a gerund a verbal noun
If you tell a person who has lost his taste buds to take a sweet drink, he will say that it tastes like some soy sauce he just drank
You can tell that one is black and another is brown because you can see, but to them there is no distinction between black and brown
With some people, after you pray with them, you know if they have passed from death to life and if they are saved
They plead to God saying, 'Oh God, save me,' as if by this begging, God would be touched to love them or to turn and save them
He did not feel that the Holy Spirit was working mightily in him like he thought He was working in other Christians
If a believer has sins that have not been repented of in this age, he will receive definite punishment in the coming kingdom
Man always has the thought that even though he is saved, he does not know whether he will become unsaved after a while
We will consider verse by verse all the Scripture that seemingly speaks of salvation not being eternal and being able to be lost
The word gift in the original language clearly indicates that it is something given freely; it cannot be reclaimed
Does it mean that now that we have become Christians, He has decided to cast us into hell and not love us anymore?
Humanly speaking, if He previously loved us so much that He would die on the cross for us, how could He have such a change today?
Because we are fleshly, we think that the Savior is not that important, and that life is more important than the Savior
If God has given us His only begotten Son through His great love, would He argue with us about the salvation that we have received?
If we were to lose our justification and become sinners again, we would put a question mark on God's omniscience
If we cannot get into the new heaven and the new earth, and if we cannot enter into eternal glory, God's work is not complete
Neither does God say that those whom He justified must also be considered saved by man before they can enter into glory
Can God foreknow that one hundred will be saved, but mark out only ninety, call only eighty, justify fifty, and merely bring ten into glory?
If salvation is only the result of our work, then failing in regard to the matter of salvation only means that we have stopped halfway
If we cannot be saved to the uttermost, this does not mean that we have stopped halfway; it means that God has stopped halfway
Since God has started it and has given us salvation Himself, He must complete this work until the day of Christ Jesus
Verse 6 says, 'Being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun in you a good work will complete it until the day of Christ Jesus'
The Bible repeatedly shows us that those who receive eternal life are the ones who have believed, and those who believe have eternal life
When God justified us, He did not do it in the way that a person sends people away on the street with two pennies
Since God has started this relationship and the life we received is an eternal life which can never cease to exist we can never perish again
God gave us another type in the Bible to show us that we can never lose our salvation once we have received it from God
After Adam sinned, God was afraid that Adam would eat of the fruit of the tree of life and that if he ate of it, he would not die
The relationship between God and us is such that we can strongly say that no power on earth can separate us from Him
When we were saved, not only did God regenerate us and give us eternal life; He made us one spirit with the Lord
Corinthians tells us that we have not only become one spirit with Christ, but we have become members of His Body
If a man has believed and has become a Christian, he is a member of the Body of Christ and is a little finger in God's hand
Not only does 1 Corinthians tell us that we are the members of the Body of Christ, but other books tell us the same
If we read the entire portion from verse 25 to verse 30, we will discover one thing the church is the Body of Christ
If there are any lost ones in the church, we will have a maimed Body, and there will not be the presenting of a glorious church
If it is possible for the members of Christ to perish, then not only will there be blemishes, but maimed parts as well
Every Christian is a small stone built upon the Lord Jesus to become the temple of God and the habitation of God
The skilled workmen had calculated accurately and prepared everything on the mountain before the materials were moved to the building
Verse 13 says that all who have heard the gospel of salvation and who have believed, have received the Holy Spirit as the seal
At the time a person is saved, God does a sealing work on him and puts the Holy Spirit within him to prove that he is of God
If the seal of the Holy Spirit in us can be erased, then it is possible for us to perish; we may be considered as not belonging to Him
We will not have it for merely three or five years, or for three or five hundred years, but until the day of redemption
The Holy Spirit is not in us for three or five days, or for three or five hundred days, but in us until the day of rapture
Never believe in the diagram that some Christians display which depicts a man with a heart full of snakes pigs dogs and many other animals
When a person's heart is clean, the Holy Spirit supposedly will come into him and stay there, and all the other animals will depart
God has given up His Son for our sake and has sent His Son into the world to pass through all the sufferings for our sake
Following this, verse 14 tells us that the Holy Spirit comes to be the seal because we are God's acquired possession
May God show us clearly how long our salvation lasts, so that we can remove all fleshly thoughts and accept His thoughts
It is not that the Holy Spirit seals a seal upon us, but that the Holy Spirit is a seal upon us; the Holy Spirit is the seal of God upon us
When we believed in the Lord Jesus, God promised us that He would give us the incorruptible inheritance in the heavens
Originally, one should pay thirty dollars a month to the landlord, but he first pays five dollars as a deposit for the house
When he gives the five dollars, he is saying to the landlord that the other twenty-five dollars will definitely come
When God gives us the Holy Spirit, He is telling us that all the inheritance in the heavens will be ours in the future
If a person were to lose his salvation after his believing in the Lord Jesus, what would he do with God's collateral?
Even if God does not give us a pledge or a deposit, when He says that He will give us an inheritance, He will surely keep His word
Because our mind is full of legality, God gave us the Holy Spirit as the proof for us to know that God has given us the deposit
After he had settled with Rebecca concerning her marriage to Isaac, he gave all these things to Rebecca as engagement gifts
On the one hand, the old servant gave her all these, such as what was on her nose, fingers, head, neck, and hand, to adorn her
My friends, when we look at the Holy Spirit within us, we will realize that we definitely will obtain the eternal inheritance
In the Bible we see that a relationship exists between the Lord Jesus and God, and a relationship exists between the Lord and us
There is a wonderful word in the Bible that says we Christians, the saved sinners, are the gifts given by God to the Lord Jesus
In John 17:6, the Lord Jesus said to the Father, 'I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world
All those whom God has given to the Lord Jesus, who have believed in the Lord Jesus, will be kept by the Lord Jesus
God cannot give us away as a token favor that has no substance to it and the Lord Jesus cannot simply throw us away after He has received us
They begged for food and clothing and maintained their livelihood through begging on the street; they had no other way to go on
By no means' is a strong expression, but because of our familiarity with the words, we do not pay so much attention to it
We are saved because of the Lord Jesus; we can continue in our salvation and be preserved in our salvation also because of the Lord Jesus
It is precious to know from the Bible that the Lord Jesus is our offering, but it is more precious to know that He is our High Priest
The Bible clearly tells us that the Lord Jesus is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him
Now would not the continuing eternal and lasting prayer of Gods Son the Lord Jesus Christ who is always before Him be much more effective
He prays for God to keep and protect us so that we can be like Him, so that we can be separated from the world, and so that we can be one
If you cannot push away the prayer of the Lord Jesus, and if you cannot get rid of the guardrail of prayer, you have no way to perish
The Lord Jesus told him in advance, 'Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has asked to have you all to sift you as wheat
It is not our prayer that keeps us saved to the end; it is the prayer of the Lord Jesus that can keep us saved to the end
He is my High Priest; He can save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him because He lives always to intercede for us'
Romans says that man cannot be justified by works, and Galatians says that man cannot keep his justification by works
Peter 1:5 says, 'Who are being guarded by the power of God through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed at the last time'
On account of God's glory, all those who know God and His keeping power would say that there is no way for them to lose God's salvation
No teaching in the Bible can have the sinners as its starting point; all teachings must have the Lord Jesus as the starting point
It would be terrible if sinners were taken as the starting point; but if the Lord Jesus is taken as the starting point, things will be clear
There are many sins that God has already judged in the Lord Jesus, but that were not manifested as sins to us when we were sinners
Concerning the losing of one's salvation, if we consider the matter from man's viewpoint, we will never see anything
If it is the Lord Jesus who does the keeping, even if a righteous person were to stumble seven times a day, he would still be able to get up
It is impossible to lose the life that God gave to us, because our life and that of the Lord are already hidden in God
It is also like saying that we will not come into judgment, but have passed out of death into life, as mentioned in John 5:24
If that were the case, the book of life would not look very nice; there would be deletions and corrections here and there
Verse 29 says, 'My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father's hand'
The hand mentioned in verse 28 is the Shepherd's hand, and the hand mentioned in verse 29 is the Father's hand
Man does not go to hell because he wants to go to hell; even sinners themselves do not want to go to hell, not to mention Christians
If the believers can be snatched from the Father's hand, then the evil spirits are greater than the Father of all creation
The mother monkey would then jump down and let the little ones climb up and pile themselves onto her back again
Since God has completed the writing of your future history and the future events, He has determined to accomplish it for you
He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not also with Him freely give us all things?
It is Christ Jesus who died and, rather, who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us
Because man's heart is filled with the flesh and the law, he cannot understand how God's grace can be so great
Because this is the way we live, we also think that God's grace and eternal life toward us are in the same principle of bartering
We will take a few of the supposedly contradictory arguments especially the more convincing ones and consider them one by one
Before we consider some of the problems in the Scriptures, we have to consider one strong objection and doubt that some men raise
Mackintosh that he had heard a preacher a week earlier preaching on the matter of being a child of God eternally
The writer of the letter complained that because of the teaching of 'once a child, eternally a child,' the young people had been damaged
To determine if a teaching is right, we can only judge it by the truth in the Bible; we cannot determine it by man's conduct
Though it is wrong for man to act irresponsibly because of this word, we still must judge everything by God's Word
Man always thinks that if he does not repent of his sins, change a little, and perform meritorious works, he cannot be saved
Those people mentioned above are not only ignorant of the way of God's salvation, they are also ignorant of the content of this salvation
He said that the things which were gains to him he had counted as loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus
With every regenerated Christian, mature or immature, there is a desire for holiness, a love for God, and a heart to please Christ
While he is living on earth today, he does not live to himself, but to the Lord, who has died and resurrected for him
Peter told us in his letter, 'According to His promise we are expecting new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells'
Now let us spend some time to consider some portions of the Scriptures that seem to speak of perdition after salvation
Peter said that there were many false prophets, and John said that many had departed from them and proved to not be of them
Many verses, which seem to speak of Christians being lost again, actually speak of Christians being disciplined
Not only is there the question of discipline and the question of falsity, but also the question of the kingdom and of the reward
Many times, we apply words for the kingdom to the eternal age, and words concerning the reward to the subject of eternal life
We must realize that there is a difference between the kingdom and salvation, and there is a difference between eternal life and reward
Before this eternal salvation is manifested, God will first manifest the matter of reward in the millennial kingdom
In addition to these things, there is another matter that Protestantism has buried in the grave for a long time
We have just mentioned two of them, which are the discipline that a Christian receives in this age, and the loss of reward in the kingdom
If God has made the distinctions, and we ignore the distinctions, we will end up with many unsolvable problems
It does not say anything about Jesus dying for man, nor does it say anything about believing in the Lord to receive life
He is confusing the attitude a man has toward his employees with the attitude he has toward his wife and children
The difference between government and salvation is as great as the distance between the north pole and the south pole
If someone sitting next to you eats sour grapes, you might feel like you can taste that same sourness in your own mouth
When they see the abomination of desolation, that is, the image of the beast in the Holy Place, they have to flee
They should flee to the mountains or to the countryside with the hope that by chance they would not see suffering persecution and affliction
Because we are too concerned for the matter of salvation, every time the word save appears, we apply it to ourselves
In verse 22 the Lord Jesus said another word: 'And unless those days had been cut short, no flesh would be saved'
Galatians 5:4 says, 'You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace'
These ones taught that after a man has believed in Christ, is saved, and has eternal life, he has to have the righteousness of the law
Chapter four brings out two other things to show us that it is useless for man to keep the law even if he is able to do it
Verse 4 says, 'You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace'
To be fallen from grace is to be fallen from the principle of grace and to follow the principle of works once again
Paul said that those in Galatians 5 strove to overcome, but they had fallen from grace to trust in their works instead
Paul rebuked them for doing good because their doing good meant that they did not need God's mercy anymore for the rest of their lives
We thank the Lord that salvation means to be continually under God's mercy and to be continually under His grace
Because they were earthly men, their failures were also earthly failures, and their punishments, earthly punishments
In the Old Testament, those that were blessed by God had much cattle, sheep, gold, and silver bestowed upon them
The Old Testament, though not exclusively dealing with things in the flesh, mainly speaks of the physical and material aspect of things
In the Old Testament, when a man was blessed by God, he would enjoy long life, have many offspring, and have much wealth
Galatians 5:4 says, 'You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace'
On the subjective side, the absence of peace in the heart and the continual presence of unhappiness is a Christian problem
When a man has turned away from the effect of Christ, he will not receive the effect he should receive from Christ
Corinthians 8:11 says in the King James Version, 'And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died'?
The subject of 1 Corinthians 8 is on the forbidding of Christians from eating food offered to idols in the idol temple
The Corinthian believers proposed that it was all right for Christians to eat food offered to idols in the idol temple
At the beginning of chapter eight, Paul said, 'Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge'
Although you can turn the words around and consider there to be nothing, these ones do not understand the things you are saying
These ones had offered to idols before, thinking that they were offering to God; they thought that the idols were gods
They would feel that they were doing the same thing that they had done before and were sinning the same way they had sinned before
For the sake of the other Christians, and for the sake of loving them, though you may have the knowledge, you would rather not do it
Verse 12 says, 'And sinning in this way against the brothers and wounding their weak conscience, you sin against Christ'
His conscience tells him that he has just sinned and that he has forsaken God to worship idols just as he used to do
In chapter thirteen, Pilate had killed quite a number of people and had mixed their blood with their sacrifices
He would think that he was through, that he had worshipped idols again and had eaten of the food offered to idols in the idol temple again
If we read this portion of the Scripture in 1 Corinthians 8 carefully from verse 7 on, we will see why Paul said what he did
Concerning the use of the word perishing, we can say that perishing here does not refer to the matter of eternal life and death
Verse 12 says, 'And sinning in this way against the brothers and wounding their weak conscience, you sin against Christ'
The sinning against the brothers here refers to the causing of the weak brother to perish through knowledge in verse 11
Verse 12 says that when you cause your brother to perish because of your knowledge, you are wounding his weak conscience
To perish is to have the brothers weak conscience wounded and to wound the weak conscience of the brother is to cause the brother to stumble
If you insist on explaining it this way, saying that a saved person will perish, you will find this argument hard to support
To them, verse 19 says to turn a brother back, and verse 20 says that in turning back the brother, the soul is saved from death
In principle, since James 1 through 5 speaks of love expressed in one's conduct, verses 19 and 20 should not deviate from this point
If you turn a sinner from the error of his way, God will no longer remember his sins and will cast them into the deep sea
In other words verse 20 is the formula the law and the principle of action whereas verse 19 is the case study and the individual incident
Verse 20 says that if anyone turns a person, he will not die and his sins will be covered before God and before men
James is telling us here that a Christian should treat his brothers and sisters with love and should recover them
They argue that if a man was saved and now has fallen away, it will be impossible for him to be renewed again to repentance
Chapter six begins by saying, 'Therefore leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us be brought on to maturity'
The first thing we must take note of is that the topic here is on progress to maturity, not regressing to perdition
The first section is on having no need, the second section is on having no possibility, and the third section is on having no right
When it says that it is impossible to again renew themselves unto repentance, many think that it means perdition
The Word of God tells us that indeed there have been many, and church history also tells us that indeed there were many
If there were no possibility for these to rise up again, then Peter would have been the first one that could not have risen up
If what was said before was right, then there should not have been a single one; if there is one, the Bible would be wrong
According to the original text, this part should be translated as 'once having slipped, it is impossible to again renew to repentance'
While one is building on this foundation, even if his foot slips, there is no need to lay again the foundation
After he came into the alley from the entrance, and as he was turning the corner to come into the building, he slipped
You would be saying that the Lord Jesus' onetime crucifixion was not enough, that there have to be more crucifixions
If a man wants to understand salvation, first, he has to differentiate between the genuine Christian and the false Christian
Although a Christian can lose his position of reigning together with Christ, he cannot lose his position of being a child of God
If Peter were to change a word here, if he were to say 'denying the Master who saved them,' then it would be very serious
No one can say, Jesus is Lord, except in the Holy Spirit, for whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved
Verse 20 says that these ones have the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and that they have escaped the defilements of the world
It has happened to them according to the true proverb: 'The dog has turned to its own vomit, and the washed sow to wallowing in the mud'
Some may argue that if excessive sorrow can cause such a one to perish, is this not an indication that a believer can still perish?
Paul told the saints in his second Epistle that they had to comfort and encourage him, lest he be swallowed up with excessive sorrow
The word katapino denotes something being swallowed up, as a ship sinking in the sea and being swallowed up by it
Paul's thought is that if the church would not forgive and comfort him right away, he would be swallowed up by sorrow
According to the Bible, whether one perishes or not does not depend on the way that he interprets the Scripture
If something is taken from you smoothly, it is a 'taking'; if something is wrung out of your hands by force, it is an apollyon
They tell us of those whose work and living after salvation are not perfected, and who are unable to be built up day by day
The person mentioned in this portion of the Word must be saved, because he has already had the sacrifice for sins
The apostle said that if one who already had the sacrifice for sins sinned willfully, there would be no more sacrifice for sins
Some people think that if, unfortunately, a Christian commits sins willfully, there will be no more sacrifice for sins for him
If Paul sinned 'willfully,' then according to Hebrews 10:26, there would remain no longer any sacrifice for sins
If a person perished and went to hell, he would see Paul there, because even Paul had no more sacrifice for sins
No matter what kind of Christian you may be, countless times in your life, you sin consciously rather than unconsciously
In verses 26 through 29, the first sentence begins with 'for,' which means that there was something mentioned before
It is because when we sin willfully after receiving the full knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins
In their mind, there is the spiritual aspect as well as the physical aspect, the heavenly aspect as well as the earthly
When the book of Hebrews was written, the earthly temple was still there, and the sacrifices were still being offered
The purpose of the book of Hebrews is to encourage the Christians to drop the earthly sacrifices and to accept the heavenly sacrifice
In the same way, sinning willfully here does not refer to things such as murder, arson, eating, drinking, gambling, and licentiousness
To abandon the assembling together shows that you have your back toward Christ and that your face is toward Judaism
To abandon the assembling means that you want the earthly temple, the earthly altar, and the earthly sacrifices
If it had said, 'After being regenerated' or 'After being washed,' then to sin willfully would be a matter of our conduct
It was the earthly emperor offering up sacrifices to the highest deity in heaven in order to redeem the sins of the people
After he received Christ as the sacrifice for sin, he could not go back to the Temple of Heaven to offer sacrifices anymore
They think that the sentence, 'There no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins' implies perdition
Let us take a look at Hebrews 9:12b, which says, 'Entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, obtaining an eternal redemption'
It tells us again that the Lord Jesus offered Himself only once, and then the work of redemption was eternally accomplished
Now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested for the putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself
Not often, but once for all, Christ offered Himself up before God as the sacrifice for sins and completed the work of redemption
Hebrews 10:10 says, 'By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all'
Verse 12 says, 'But this One, having offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down forever on the right hand of God'
After reading so many verses, we can know the meaning of the verse, 'There no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins'
If you do not want the redemption of Christ, but turn to Judaism, you will no longer find any other sacrifice for sins
The foregoing verses repeatedly mention the words 'once for all,' and the following verse says, 'There no longer remains'
If you forsake the Christian faith and look for another Savior, another sacrifice for sins, you will not find it
Some of the Jews at that time probably thought that if they rejected the Christian faith, they could still go back to the temple
If they did not want Christ, they could still have redemption for sins, because they still could keep the priests and the offerings
It will no longer be acceptable if they reject God's Son, that is, if they reject the reality and offer up the types
Hebrews 10:27 says, 'But a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fervor of fire, which is to consume the adversaries'
If they reject the Lord Jesus, they can only expect a fearful judgment and fervor of fire about to consume the adversaries
We have to differentiate two things in the Bible: God's discipline of believers in this age and their salvation in eternity
Now we have to see what are the kinds of people that God disciplines and what is the purpose of this discipline
If you are without discipline, of which all sons have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons'
If we accept the discipline of our parents in the flesh how much more should we accept the discipline from our Father the Father of spirits
If a Christian lives in a very loose way on earth, without manifesting God's nature and holiness, God's hand will fall heavily on such a one
Discipline is with a definite goal, which is that we may partake of His holiness, that we may not live foolishly day by day
After a Christian believes into the Lord Jesus, although he will never lose his salvation, he may receive severe chastisement from God
We should not make the mistake of thinking that because we are eternally saved, we can live loosely on this earth
One should not say that if a Christian does not do good, God will deny that he is a child of God and kick him out like a dog
He causes us to encounter many things in our families, in our bodies, in our career, and in our environment so that we will turn back to Him
By reading the Bible carefully, one has to acknowledge that they were saved because they were with the disciples at the time of Pentecost
Paul says in 1 Corinthians 11:29-30, 'He who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not discern the body
They did not see the respect they should render to the Lord Jesus, and they did not see their proper standing in the Body of Christ
Man may think that condemnation is the best method to keep us from sinning, but God does not use the way of condemnation
Those who are clear about the law of Moses would say that this person will surely perish and is guaranteed to go to hell
The destruction mentioned here and the sleep mentioned before relate to the body only; they do not refer to the spirit
Some people have a problem with 1 John 5:16, where it says that we should not make request for anyone who has committed a sin unto death
John 5:16 tells us of some people who sinned to the extent that God would have them die and their flesh removed from the world
There are many Christians in the church today who cannot differentiate between the kingdom of the heavens and eternal life
They think that the kingdom of the heavens is eternal life and that eternal life is simply the kingdom of the heavens
After he is saved, God immediately puts this one on a pathway, so that he will run in the race and will obtain the reward placed before him
If one will do this, then at the end of the race, he will obtain the heavenly glory and the heavenly reward from God
Good works are applicable to the matter of the reward, the matter of the crown, the matter of the glory, and the matter of the throne
In other words, God will never save a person because he has merits, and He will never reward one who has no merit
In the Bible, there is a clear distinction between salvation and the kingdom and between the gift and the reward
Because people would not differentiate these matters, the question of salvation is mishandled, and the question of reward is also mishandled
After salvation, God places the reward before them so that they will endeavor, pursue, and run after the reward
Through salvation God separates the saved ones from the unsaved ones; He separates the ones having eternal life from those being condemned
Today's problem with God's children is that they magnify salvation too much; all that they see is simply salvation
Just as the Bible says clearly that salvation is by faith, in the same way the Bible says clearly that reward is by work
The Bible reveals to us that salvation is by the faith of the sinners, and the reward is by the work of the Christians
Romans 4:4 says, 'Now to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due'
Today God will not save a person who is worthy, and in the future God will not reward a Christian who is not worthy
Corinthians 3:14 says, 'If anyone's work which he has built upon the foundation remains, he will receive a reward'
Luke 6:35 says, 'But love your enemies, and do good and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great'
Nowhere does the Bible mention that one has to love his enemies and do good before he can receive eternal life
There is such a verse that says if you lend to others and do good to others, your reward in heaven will be great
Timothy 4:14 says, 'Alexander the coppersmith did many evil things to me; the Lord will recompense him according to his works'
When the Lord Jesus says in the Gospel of John that He gives eternal life to His sheep, He is speaking reality and not some empty words
We see very clearly that the words 'the kingdom of the heavens' and the word 'reward' are found together many times
Also, blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens
The Lord begins by saying that this kind and that kind of people are blessed because the kingdom of the heavens is theirs
In the sermon on the mount, the Lord mentioned the matter of the reward many times because this portion concerns the kingdom
Every reader of the Bible agrees that the main subject of the sermon on the mount in Matthew 5 7 is the kingdom of the heavens
When Christ comes in the glory of His Father with His angels, that will be the time for Him to establish His kingdom on the earth
The Lord Jesus said that we have to pray to our Father who is in secret, and our Father who sees in secret will repay us
In the future, it will not be a matter of one crown being bigger than the other in size, or one crown having more diamonds than the other
After we have believed in the Lord, though our good work cannot save us, it will determine our status in the kingdom
Thank God that the question of our eternal life or death is settled, but we will still be judged before the judgment seat of Christ
There are many other verses in the Bible that show us that believers will be judged by the Lord Jesus before the judgment seat of Christ
Among these verses, 1 Corinthians 3 shows us most clearly how we will be judged by the Lord before the judgment seat
Corinthians 3:8 says, 'Now he who plants and he who waters are one, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor'
That judgment will not determine whether or not we will perish, but it will determine whether we will receive a reward
We have made it clear that the kingdom is the time when God will reward the Christians according to their works
Many who do not understand God's word and God's work think that they are guaranteed an entrance into the kingdom of the heavens
The Lord will make a distinction between those disciples who can enter into the kingdom of the heavens and those who cannot
The Lord clearly shows us here that the condition for entering the kingdom of the heavens is doing the will of God
If one is not faithful while living on the earth, though he will not lose eternal life, he will lose the kingdom of the heavens
Not only do they say that they prophesy, cast out demons, and do many works of power; they do these in the Lord's name
After the Lord went up the mountain His disciples came before Him and He opened His mouth and taught them from chapter five to chapter seven
Even if they have the outward works of prophesying casting out demons and doing works of power these works must not replace the Fathers will
Doing the Father's will is one thing, whereas prophesying, casting out demons, and doing works of power are another thing altogether
We must remember that we should not only call Him Lord with our mouth, but we should do the Father's will in our walk as well
Suppose one has a maid and two daughters, and suppose this one were to say to the younger daughter, 'Do you see that maid?
There is no reason for the Lord to use unsaved ones as an example to show the disciples that they ought to do God's will
Although you have not carried out God's will, you nevertheless prophesy, cast out demons, and do works of power in the Lord's name
In the original Greek the meaning of workers of lawlessness is people who do not follow the rules, keep the law, or abide by the regulations
If this word 'lawlessness' were translated as 'evil,' as some versions have done, many would have the ground to argue
If we do not do the will of God, but work according to our own will instead, we will be shut out of the kingdom
Today we may appreciate the works and may be interested in prophesying, casting out demons, and doing works of power
Another passage which some misinterpret as referring to perdition actually refers to the losing of the kingdom and the losing of the reward
Everyone who contends, exercises self-control in all things; they then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible
In these messages, we have emphasized the fact that in reading the Bible, one should pay attention to the context
Paul is talking about how a saved one can receive the prize; he is not talking about how an unsaved one can be saved
The Bible says that the prize comes from the running; God has placed us on a racecourse for us to run the race
His goal and direction were what he said in 2 Corinthians 5, that he was ambitious to be well-pleasing to the Lord
We may do many works outwardly, but as long as we do not restrict our body, we will not be allowed into the kingdom
If a Christian does not have good works after being saved, though he will not lose life, he will nevertheless lose the crown
But Christ was faithful as a Son over His house whose house we are if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end
The problem of eternity is totally settled, but the matter of position and reward in the kingdom depends on how we hold fast today
If one does not know the truth about selection, he will not see that this refers to the hope of the kingdom being firm
These are the things mentioned in verses 5-7, such as faith, virtue, knowledge, self-control, endurance, godliness, and love
The first of these parallel expressions says that we should be diligent to make our calling and selection firm
To make our calling and selection firm is to be richly and bountifully supplied with an entrance into this eternal kingdom
After one believes, there are experiences ahead of him; he still has the kingdom before him and a future glory waiting for him
Some will obtain these things: the kingdom, the crown, the glory, and the reward; whereas others will not obtain them
Some will not only enter in, but will be richly and bountifully supplied an entrance into the kingdom of Christ
Whether or not we would be counted worthy to receive the Lord's glory depends absolutely on the results of our personal walk and work
If we suffer persecution, difficulties, and shame today in the same way, we will share a portion with Him in the coming kingdom
God's disciplining love is the same as His saving love, which caused Him to send His Son to die for us on the cross
Although we have seen that a man cannot perish again after he is saved, we can never say that such a one will never suffer God's discipline
Now the question is whether God's discipline is confined to this age or whether it will be found in the coming age as well
Hebrews 9:22 says, 'And almost all things are purified by blood according to the law, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness'
Although many people have received the cleansing of the blood of the Lord Jesus, they still have many filthy thoughts while living on earth
The other is the cleansing by God which comes through our environment, our family, our personal health, or our job
In eternity, when we are with God and the Lamb in the New Jerusalem, we will be in the light as God is in the light
The Bible shows us clearly that in the coming age there will be discipline, and this discipline will prune and cleanse us
These verses do not say that those who do not know will not receive any lashes; they only say that they will receive few lashes
Everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required from him; and to whom much has been committed, they will ask of him all the more
Whatever you do, work from the soul as to the Lord and not to men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as recompense
The preceding verses speak of how a Christian should be a wife, a husband, a father or a mother, a son or a daughter, a master or a slave
Paul says that if a Christian does unrighteously, he will receive what he unrighteously did, because there is no respect of persons
Some sinning Christians whose problems are not solved before God today will receive chastisement in the future
It is clear that there will be chastisement in the future after the Lord comes back, but when after the Lord's return will it be?
The coming age can be called the age of the kingdom or the millennial age, because that age will only last a thousand years
If you are not clear about these ages, your reading of the Bible, theology, and biblical understanding will be all wrong
We can quote at least two hundred verses from the Old and New Testaments concerning the righteous judgment in the kingdom
Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready
It was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints'
Without having the particular righteousness and without being martyred, no one can have a part in the kingship
If you wish to know how to obtain such a wonderful new heaven and new earth just listen to His word And He said to me They have come to pass
As long as there is the thirst, as long as there is the need, God will give from the spring of the water of life freely
The overcomers here are different from the overcomers in the epistles to the seven churches at the beginning of Revelation
The overcoming in the first three chapters of Revelation is the overcoming by some Christians among other Christians
Compared to those in the world, we are all overcomers because we have a faith before God that the worldly people do not have
At the end of Revelation, after the kingdom is over and after the church is over, verse 17 says, 'And the Spirit and the bride say, Come!
The throne is of God and of the Lamb ; the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of the city ; and the Lamb is the lamp of the city
That the Lamb is mentioned related to the new heaven and new earth indicates that this will be an age of grace
According to the teaching of Revelation, we can say that in the new heaven and new earth God deals with man in grace
If we love the world today, walk by the flesh, and live a loose life, in the age to come we will be chastised by God
If we love the Lord today and forsake everything for the Lord's sake, we will receive God's grace and His reward
May we treasure the grace that we have received, and may we receive the warning from God and pursue after the reward of the kingdom
Everyone who understands the Word of God knows that in the church age, as soon as a man believes, he has eternal life
Those that have done good will come forth to the resurrection of zoe, and those that have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment
Verses 28-29 say, 'Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming in which all in the tombs will hear His voice and will come forth'
All those who are dead in their body, that is, those who are in the tombs, will hear the voice of the Son of God for the second time
Those who have done good will go into the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil will go into the resurrection of judgment
Why does He say here that we have to keep the law and sell all that we have, before we can inherit eternal life?
It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God'
Peter then asked what he would get for having left all to follow Him, and the Lord told them of the things that are to come
It depends on whether or not he is living for money, for material gain, for his family, or for the worldly people
Today many preach the gospel using this passage, and exhort people to enter the narrow gate and take the constricted way
If one were saved through entering the narrow gate and taking the constricted way, salvation would not be of grace, but of works
In order to reign with Christ in the kingdom, a person must enter the narrow gate and take the constricted way
They have not obeyed God's Word in taking care of God's work, but have instead done what they themselves like to do
They seek man's glory rather than God's glory and are not willing to stand in the same place of shame that the Lord stood in
The Bible says that we have to suffer and bear reproach with Him first before we can reign and be glorified with Him
If you give to others good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, the Lord will give to you in the same way
There is one thing which even judgment cannot triumph over a person showing mercy to others throughout his entire life
When the time of judgment comes, there will be some whom even the Lord of judgment will not be able to hold anything against
James 2:13 says, 'For the judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment'
At least one day they will learn to be merciful and to forgive others in the same way that the Lord showed mercy to them and forgave them
In verse 35 the Lord says, 'So also will My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts'
It shows the relationship between the heavenly Father and His children and the relationship between the brothers
If our problems today are not dealt with specifically, we will still suffer specific punishment in the future kingdom
There are many places in the Bible that mention God's punishment for the defeated Christians in the millennial kingdom
It is not a question concerning salvation and perdition, but a question concerning being great or small, high or low, in the kingdom
The Lord Jesus showed us that unless we turn and become like little children, we cannot enter into the kingdom of the heavens
Following this verse 4 says He therefore who will humble himself like this little child he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens
Verse 3 gives us the condition for entering the kingdom, while verse 4 gives us the way to be great in the kingdom
If your hands steal and your feet walk in improper paths, that is, if there is sin and lust in you, you must deal with them
It is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire'
It is not necessarily the Lord's intention that we cut off a hand or foot, for even if we do cut off a hand, we still cannot remove our lust
Matthew 52122 says You have heard that it was said to the ancients You shall not murder and whoever murders shall be liable to the judgment
Verse 23 says, 'Therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you'
If you think poorly of a brother and have spoken something against him, you have to go to him and deal with the matter
Leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift'
Now he is bringing you to court: 'Lest the opponent deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison'
It is not possible for us to have a problem with each other and yet reign at the same time in the millennium in the future
Either we will go in and the other will be excluded, or the other will go in and we will be excluded, or both will be excluded
That means that while you and he are alive and before the Lord Jesus comes back, you have to be reconciled to him
If the woman is not another man's wife, there would be no possibility for adultery, because adultery is unfaithfulness in marriage
For it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna'
If they allow sin to develop in them though they will not eternally perish there is the possibility that they will pass away into Gehenna
In verses 4 and 5 the Lord said, 'My friends, Do not fear those who kill the body and afterward have nothing more that they can do
At the beginning of the kingdom, before the judgment seat, the angels of God will take the Christians up to God
One or more angels will then read off the names from the book of life, and the Lord Jesus will confess some of the names
Still a third group, by the time of the kingdom, has their names preserved in the same way as they were first written in the book
Revelation 20:15 says, 'And if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire'
We know that the time of the lake of fire and brimstone is the time when the new heaven and the new earth begins
If some Christians have not dealt with their sins, they will still suffer the hurt and pain of the second death
To say that one has tasted the powers of the coming age is to say that one has tasted the things of the millennial kingdom
If such a person leaves the word of the beginning of Christ today and slips and falls, there is no repentance for him
To be disapproved, to be rejected, means that God will reject such a one and will not use him anymore in the kingdom
The verse does not say that he will receive a curse, but the punishment that he receives is similar to a curse
He will not perish forever, but he will suffer the hurt of the second death and will suffer the Gehenna of fire in the kingdom
If a Christian receives all these wonderful things but does not bear good fruit to God, but rather thorns and thistles, he will be burned
Even an elementary school boy knows that if you burn a piece of land, the burning will stop after all the thorns are burned up
In other words, only those things in Adam that are cursed, that should be removed but have not been removed, are to be burned
There is absolutely no problem with our salvation, but there is so much that has grown on top of it, so much that has come out of the flesh
Verse 2 says, 'Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it'
Many will reign with Christ because they have worked faithfully and have undergone persecution, reproach, and suffering
There are still many things which we are not clear about concerning the future, but the Bible has shown us enough
After a person is saved and up until he dies, his works, that is, his failures or his victories, will determine his fate in the kingdom
He has no choice but to cleanse us with specific punishments, so that we can be together with Him in the new heaven and new earth
If you listen to their sermons and read their books, they invariably push everything related to the kingdom onto the Jews
Some say that Paul never specifically said that his Epistles were written to Gentiles, and therefore, they are not for Gentiles
They think that everything that matches them is truth, and everything that does not match them and that differs from them is heresy
Regardless of how scriptural a basis there is for it, any thought or concept contrary to theirs is considered heresy
The Bible shows us that there will be the discipline in the kingdom in the future, but there is no purging in Hades today
The Bible shows us that there is no other name in heaven or on earth besides that of the Lord Jesus whereby we must be saved
The matter of our salvation is settled long before God disciplines us, but there are still things in us that do not match Him
One group of Protestant theologians proposes that since a man is 'once saved, always saved,' he can get away with anything in his conduct
Since a Christian is saved eternally, they say, he could be evil until the day he dies and still be in the kingdom
There is another group of Protestants who say that after a man believes, there is still the possibility that he will not be saved
A brother once said that if we are not eternally saved once we have believed, then the book of life will be extremely thick
Although there are only three or four places in the whole Bible that mention this problem, they afford us clear light
Coming into the world, He says, Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me
Now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested for the putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself
According to this tabernacle 'both gifts and sacrifices are offered, which are unable to perfect, according to conscience, him who worships'
When the conscience was troubled in the Old Testament one could always bring another bull or goat to offer a sin offering through the priest
The propitiatory sacrifice that God has set up in the New Testament is not a bull or goat but His very own Son
We cannot offer up a sin offering for the same sin any longer, for the Lord Jesus has accomplished all the work
There may be a lot of rice in Shanghai, but the starving ones in Szechwan will not be able to get it, because it is not alongside
It is because in the heavenly law court there is no talk of grace, in the same way that there is no talk of grace in earthly law courts
We are told in the next verse And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world
The Lord Jesus makes His defense for us based on His accomplished work, that is, His propitiation on the cross for us
The Lord Jesus has become an Advocate for every Christian who sins, in the same way that He has become the Savior for every sinner
He does not say that first we repent, confess our sins, and pray for forgiveness, and then He becomes our Advocate
At that very moment, the Lord Jesus will show God His work of the cross, and God will have to let your sins go
In the Holy Place there was a lamp, and in the outer court there was the sun, but in the Holy of Holies, there was no light at all
As God has manifested Himself in the light of the gospel, even so we should see God in the light of the gospel
If we truly know God in the gospel, we will see that the blood of His Son Jesus is continually and eternally cleansing us of all sin
It is not a re-cleansing, but a continual demonstration to God that He has died and that all the sins are dealt with already
Regardless of whether a Christian will confess and repent of his sins or not, the cleansing work of Christ is continually effective
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
In the Lord Jesus' being both the Advocate and the Savior, it is His blood that grants us forgiveness of sins and justification
Confession means that we stand on the same ground as God does, admitting before God that our deed is indeed a sin
Although he says this with his mouth, in his heart he is thinking of a way to sneak out the back door to go out and play again
There is a kind of cleansing in the Old Testament which is a type of the forgiveness of believers in the New Testament
Let us read what can be considered as the only portion in the Old Testament dealing with the forgiveness of the Christians' sins
He who burns it shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until evening
They show us the different aspects of the Lord Jesus and how He satisfies God's requirements in redeeming man's sins
Tell the sons of Israel to bring you a red heifer without blemish, in which there is no defect, and upon which a yoke has never come'
Numbers 19:2 says that this sacrifice was to be without spot and without blemish and was never to have come under a yoke
Not only is He without blemish, but also in His experience He is clean, that is, He has never been under a yoke
In the first part of this offering we see that the sprinkling of the blood signifies that the problem of the sinner is solved
Now we have to consider the second part of the offering, which shows us what is to be done for the sins of the believers
Everything in the world, whether great or small, sweet or bitter, rich or poor, was laid on Him and judged by God
For this reason, the Old Testament uses leprosy as a symbol of curable sin and a dead body as a symbol of incurable sin
Taking the living water and making it the water for impurity means that there is the need for the power of the Holy Spirit to be upon us
Because the Lord Jesus has died, the efficacy of His ashes becomes eternal, and by the Holy Spirit He is now applying this efficacy to us
A person who is not cleansed in the age of the Lord's resurrection will not be clean in the age of the kingdom
If he is cleansed today in the age of the Lord's resurrection, he will be clean on the seventh day, the age of the kingdom
Following this we read: 'Because the water for impurity was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is still on him'
All the unconfessed sins and all the sins that have not passed through the blood of the Lord Jesus leave their uncleanness on the person
In Numbers 19 God shows us that if a man touches a dead body, he is defiled and must cleanse himself with the ashes of the red heifer
Jesus' washing of the disciples' feet has one meaning, and the disciples' washing of each other's feet has another meaning
It is like the cleansing: There is only one cleansing by the blood, but there are many cleansings by the water of the ashes
Footwashing is a washing that comes about by the Word of God through the work of the Holy Spirit and based upon the work of the Lord Jesus
What then should we do when we touch the dirt while living on earth and coming into contact with the world every day?
The Lord Jesus said that those who have taken a bath only need to have their feet washed in order to be wholly clean
