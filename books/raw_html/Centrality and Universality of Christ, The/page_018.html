<P>The more you pray in this way, the more you will enjoy Christ. You will absorb something of Christ. Also, your prayer will be answered. However, your prayer's being answered is the secondary thing. The primary thing is that while you are praying in this way, you enjoy Christ and absorb Christ. The more you pray in the spirit, the more you contact Christ as the Spirit. Then you will realize Him as the life, the food, and the supply within. By praying you enjoy Him, absorb Him, and can apply Him to all the happenings in your daily life. This is the proper way for you to contact Christ.</P><P>When you are so much mingled with Him and one with Him, it will be difficult for people to tell whether you are praying or Christ is praying. Even you yourself will not be able to tell clearly which part is your prayer and which part is Christ's, because you are so much mingled with Him. This is the genuine prayer, and this is the New Testament principle of life. The principle of life in the New Testament is that the Triune God&#151;God the Father, in God the Son, and through God the Spirit&#151;mingles Himself with us in our spirit.</P><P>But in order for this to take place we must give Him the ground within us. This means that we have to pray by exercising our spirit. The more we exercise our spirit, the more we give Him the ground. Then He will occupy us, saturate us, and mingle Himself with us to make Himself us and to make us Himself. Then we are one with Him in the spirit in a very practical way. It is by this that we can be overcoming. We can overcome many difficulties and sins that are contrary to Christ. It is only when we are in Christ, living by Christ and being blended with Christ, that His victory is ours. When we are in Christ, we enjoy Him as everything&#151;as life, as power, as the light shining within us to guide us all the time. All these things are subjective within. This is exactly what we need today.</P><P>If we are one with Christ and blended together with Christ, it is easy for us to receive healing when we need it. But we do not pay attention to the healing but to the Healer. We do not pay attention to the gift but to the Giver. Of course, when we have the Healer and the Giver, we have the healing and the gift. We do not pay attention to the power, to the might, but we are satisfied and happy with the mighty One. It is not some thing, but a living Person whom we possess. It is not something of Christ, but Christ Himself (see Hymns, #513 by A. B. Simpson). This is the reality of the Christian life. This is also the reality of the church life. This is what God is seeking and what Christ is looking for. We have to realize that He is such a One living within us so that we may experience Him in such a living and experiential way. May God be merciful to us.</P>
