   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Religious Babylon and Material Babylon Scripture Reading: Rev 14:8; 17:1 19:4;</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>2:18-24; Matt 13:33 Revelation 17 is an unveiling of religious Babylon the apostate Roman Catholic Church: In the eyes of God the Roman Catholic Church, which perpetuates much of Judaism and has assimilated much of paganism, is Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Mystery in verse 5 indicates that Babylon the Great in chapter seventeen is the apostate church; she is mysterious in what she is, in what she practices, and in what she teaches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The woman in Matthew 13:33 is the Jezebel in Revelation 2:20, and Jezebel becomes the great harlot in 17:1: Jezebel, the pagan wife of Ahab, is a type of the apostate church 1 Kings 16:31.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The principle of the deeds of the apostate church is to mix the heathen, pagan things with the worship of God by His people Matt 13:33; Rev 17:4.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jezebel, the apostate church, is a self-appointed prophetess, who presumes to be authorized to speak for God and demands that people listen to her rather than to God 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the apostate church are the deep things of Satan, the mysterious teachings of Satan v. 24: Satan dwells in the apostate church in a subtle way through the teaching of the deep things of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The deep thought of Satan has saturated the apostate church, causing it to become the embodiment of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The harlot in 17:1 is the apostate Roman Catholic Church: The fornication of the apostate church consists of her having sinful relationships with the kings of the earth for her profit v. 2a: The Roman Catholic Church is intimately involved with worldly politics, and the kings of the earth commit fornication directly with her.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the eyes of God, this is spiritual fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The wine of her fornication signifies the heretical doctrines of the apostate church in her fornicating relationships with the governments on the earth v. 2b.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The apostate church is in a wilderness, a desert, where there are no springs of water prepared by God v. 3.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The harlot is gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls v. 4a: Gold, precious stone, and pearls are the materials with which the New Jerusalem is built 21:18-19, 21.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The apostate church is gilded not solidly built with these treasures as ornaments for outward display and as a deception intended to entice people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The harlot has in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication 17:4b: Since gold signifies the divine nature, the golden cup indicates that in her outward appearance the apostate church has something of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Her golden cup is full of idolatry, pagan practices, and satanic things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Roman Catholic Church has certain holy things, but she has mixed in many evil and unclean things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The great harlot is the mother of the harlots v. 5: The harlots, the daughters of the great harlot, are the sects and groups in Christianity that hold to some extent the teachings, practices, and traditions of the apostate church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The denominations and groups that still practice some of the great harlot s Babylonian traditions belong in the category of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only the pure, genuine local churches have no evil transmitted from the great harlot, the apostate church 1:11-12.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because God hates the apostate church, at the beginning of the great tribulation, God will cause Antichrist and his ten kings to destroy the Roman Catholic Church 17:16-17.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Revelation 18 is an unveiling of material Babylon the city of Rome: In Revelation 17 and 18 two aspects of Babylon the religious aspect and the material aspect are mixed together: The harlot in 17:16 denotes religious Babylon, signifying the Roman Catholic Church, whereas the woman in verse 18 denotes material Babylon, signifying the city of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 18:3 the aspects of religious and material Babylon are both mentioned: The Roman religion makes all nations drunk with her religious, devilish wine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The city of Rome enriches the merchants of the earth by the power of her luxury.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since Babylon the Great is twofold, to come out of her means to come out of both religious Babylon and material Babylon v. 4.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Material Babylon, the city of Rome, will become hateful in the eyes of God because it has been the source of both devilish politics and devilish religion vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>6-8, 20-24.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ as another Angel will shine over the earth to destroy Babylon the Great, the city of Rome, with His great authority vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>1-2.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Babylon the Great will have two falls the fall of religious Babylon and the fall of material Babylon 14:8; 18:2: The fall of religious Babylon will take place at the beginning of the great tribulation 17:16-17.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fall of material Babylon will take place at the end of the great tribulation 18:2, 21.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The praise in 19:1-4 is related not mainly to the fall of material Babylon but to the fall of religious Babylon, because in the eyes of God religious Babylon is more hateful than material Babylon.</S>
