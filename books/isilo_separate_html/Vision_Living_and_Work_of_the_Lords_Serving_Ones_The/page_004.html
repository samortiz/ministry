<p>Leading new believers in the life practices of praying, reading the Bible, meeting with the saints, and preaching the gospel can be considered as only &ldquo;elementary education.&rdquo; Therefore, we should lead them into fellowshipping with the Lord, being enlightened, and dealing with their sins so that there are no barriers between them and the Lord. We should also lead them to consecrate themselves fully to the Lord, walk according to the spirit, and know the anointing. In terms of spiritual experience, these items can be considered as being &ldquo;high school education.&rdquo; A person who knows the anointing may be considered rather advanced in the growth in life. However, in spiritual matters there is the principle of a cycle. In the educational system in schools, after learning math and history at the elementary level, we do not need to relearn them later. However, spiritual matters are different. The experiences in the divine life are always repetitive, forming a cycle. Hence, even after we know the anointing, we still need to pray, read the Bible, meet, and preach the gospel. Furthermore, we must continue to fellowship with the Lord, to be enlightened, and to deal with our sins. We will never graduate from these matters. We may graduate from a school curriculum, but the experiences of our spiritual life are a cycle from which we never graduate.</p>
<p>I have been in the Lord for sixty years, but I still need to pray and read the Bible every day, to meet regularly, and to preach the gospel. I still need to fellowship with the Lord, and I need the Lord to speak to me. Moreover, I still need to be enlightened, to confess my sins, and to consecrate myself day by day and moment by moment. We all have had the experience of being on the altar one moment and coming down from the altar the next moment. When we fellowship with the Lord, we are on the altar, but we often come down from the altar. Our life as a Christian is a life of being on the altar and off the altar. According to the truth, a person cannot come down from the cross after he is crucified. Nevertheless, even though a person cannot come down from the cross after being crucified, he can come down from the altar after being on the altar. This is confirmed by our experience. Hence, we need to consecrate ourselves repeatedly. After consecrating ourselves, we should ask the Lord to have mercy on us and to grant us the grace to walk according to the spirit. Besides these items of the Christian life, we need to experience the anointing continually. The points mentioned above are a main portion in the experience of life. We ourselves need to learn these experiences, and we need to lead others into these experiences as a cycle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING THE BIBLE AS THE BASE OF OUR WORK</h2>
<p>The most effective way to lead people is to use the Bible. Hence, we should know appropriate verses for every topic. In leading new believers to live the Christian life, we should first help them to pray. There are many verses in the Bible related to prayer, but we need to find the most appropriate verses.</p>
<p>In the same way, in helping others to read the Bible, we also need to use appropriate verses. For instance, 2 Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed.&rdquo; It is best to use this verse with verse 15, which says, &ldquo;The sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through the faith which is in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; We must learn to use these two verses when helping people read the Bible. Hence, we need more training and practice related to using appropriate verses. Otherwise, when we go out to contact people, we will be like an unskilled cook who, even though he has many ingredients, cannot prepare a delicious dish. There are many verses concerning going to meetings, preaching the gospel, fellowshipping with the Lord, and being enlightened. Furthermore, we should find relevant verses concerning the Lord&rsquo;s speaking to us through the Spirit, knowing the sense of life from the Lord, dealing with our sins in the light, and consecrating ourselves to the Lord. We also need verses concerning walking according to the spirit and knowing the anointing. We need to find all the relevant verses. This will make our contact with people more effective. As the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones, we should learn these things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S WORK IN TAIWAN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Need to Purchase Land for<br />
a Big Meeting Hall</h2>
<p>According to the development of all the churches in Taiwan, especially in the Taipei region, we will need a big meeting hall with facilities to provide hospitality. If such a meeting hall were available, some saints in a district in Taipei could bring a group of new believers there and live the church life together for three days. After that, another group of saints could take a group of new believers there. In this way the facility would be constantly occupied. The meeting hall will not be for regular meetings in the Taipei area but for special needs in the work, such as gospel meetings or weekend perfecting trainings. In the future we will have such a need. I believe that such a meeting hall would be used every day. The saints in other localities in Taiwan also could use the facility. Hence, we need to bear this burden and pray for this matter. May the Lord work in many ways to accomplish this.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having an Enlarged View</h2>
<p>We should not regard lightly the Lord&rsquo;s work in Taiwan. The Lord has truly done a great thing here. Taiwan has a rare environment: twenty million people populate this island, there is good transportation, and the level of education is high. In addition, we have a large number of saints. My main burden is that we would make use of these resources.</p>
<p>For the last few years I have felt that the church in Taipei has many resources and can be compared to a large company that possesses much capital. However, we have not touched our resources; instead, they lie waste. Our burden is to stir us up to use every resource. This stirring up will have a deep and far-reaching effect. We can compare this to throwing a large stone into the ocean and creating waves, which, if they are strong enough, will spread to the major continents. In recent months I have been traveling between the two coasts of the Pacific to stir up the saints. We hope that in thirty years some of the young people among us will be greatly used by the Lord. By then they will be in their fifties, which are our most useful years in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. Their future will be unlimited. We all need to be enlarged in our view to realize that what we are learning today is not only for us in Taipei but also for the future of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This is a great need. In the past we said that we would be willing to sell everything we have for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. However, the Lord has never asked us to sell anything. In April 1925, after I was saved, I consecrated myself to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I do not want the world anymore. After I finish my studies, I will go with my Bible from village to village to preach the gospel. I am willing to do this even if I must live on tree roots and drink from mountain brooks.&rdquo; That was my consecration. However, the Lord has had mercy on me. I never had to eat tree roots or drink mountain water. Furthermore, He did not lead me to go from village to village but rather from continent to continent. Who can say what our future will be? Sixty years ago I was only a young student. I was twenty years old, and I gave myself to the Lord, never expecting that He would use me, a Chinese young man, to spread His recovery to the five continents. Now about six hundred churches have been raised up. This is truly the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>On every continent doors are opening to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. However, we are short of people and cannot meet this need. We all must wake up in order to see our true condition. The work in Taiwan must have an epochal change so that we may meet the Lord&rsquo;s need. We must all realize this need and receive the burden to pray for it.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
