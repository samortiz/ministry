   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ANNOUNCEMENT OF A CONFERENCE IN HANGCHOW,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHEKIANG PROVINCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We ask all the brothers and sisters who meet in the Lord's name in all the localities to pray for the upcoming work of the Lord in Hangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some brothers who are in one accord awaiting the Lord's return feel deeply in prayer that what the church lacks today is not talent, method, or work but a revelation from the Holy Spirit, a spiritual living, and the cultivation of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, the Father's center and the Lord's work should be the two testimonies that every person with life should know assuredly and should diligently practice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason, in our prayer before the throne of the Father, we have decided to have an Overcomer Conference to support the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We hope to be able to have this conference in the fall of this year in Hangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We invite all the co-workers throughout China, those who walk in one accord in this way and who desire the truth, as well as all the brothers and sisters who pursue after the Lord's desire to come to the conference in Hangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Barring special hindrances, it will commence at the beginning of October.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The conference will last about ten days: The first seven days will be only for preaching the central messages; the last three days will be for separate fellowship meetings among the brothers and the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These fellowship meetings will resolve all kinds of spiritual difficulties and will emphasize the living of the members of the Lord's Body and their testimony of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After the conference is over, perhaps there will be a few days of Bible study.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible study meeting is prepared especially for those brothers and sisters who desire to pursue the truth and please the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brother Nee has already promised to bear the responsibility for the central messages of the Overcomer Conference.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The rest of the meetings will perhaps be borne by other brothers or sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But we deeply know that we are weak and useless.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the Lord does not begin working first, we cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this reason, we ask all the brothers and sisters who care for the Lord's work to pray earnestly for this Overcomer Conference and for all the matters related to it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We only hope that our Father will be glorified in His church and in our Lord Jesus Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Amen!</S>
