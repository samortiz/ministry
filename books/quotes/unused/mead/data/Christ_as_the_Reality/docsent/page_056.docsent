   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE HUMANITY OF JESUS FOR THE CHURCH SERVICE Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 2:8-10; 3:2-3, 8, 11, 14-15; 4:12; 5:1-2; 2 Tim 4:22 THE DEFINITION OF SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the local church the main feature is the service.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But when we say "service," we do not mean a kind of Christian meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is not our service.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we say "church service," we mean the practical serving in the church by many functions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, church service includes the functions of the elders, who care for many things in the responsibility of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The function of the deacons, who care for the church business and church affairs, is also included in the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All those who know the Bible agree that the two books written by the Apostle Paul to Timothy cover this matter of the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These books help us to know the way to behave in the church, and this is quite practical.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul says that he writes these things that we may know how to behave ourselves in the house of God, which is the church of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, the entire two books to Timothy are simply to reveal how we must practically behave ourselves in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we pray-read all the above verses which we have chosen from these two books, we will realize that they are all related to the matter of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Christianity today, most seeking ones pay their attention to the heavenly side.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They say that we need power, the manifestation of the gifts, and the miraculous things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I recognize that in the Lord's economy, there is a place for the miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I myself have experienced a good number of miraculous things in my Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in these two books to Timothy, which are written that the serving ones may know how to behave themselves in the church, there is nothing miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, these two books are very much related to the proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>QUALIFICATIONS FOR ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 1 Timothy 3, Paul gives us the qualifications of an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He does not say that to be an adequate elder you must have power, with all the gifts and miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No, in his writings concerning the qualifications of an elder, he does not even mention these things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Listen to what he says: "The overseer then must be without reproach, husband of one wife, temperate, of a sober mind, orderly, hospitable, apt to teach, not an excessive drinker, not a striker, but forbearing, not contentious, not fond of money" 1 Tim 3:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All these qualifications are the virtues of humanity which are so necessary for the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul did not say a word about power and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the past years of my Christian life and work, I have seen a good number of able persons with miraculous gifts and power.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But eventually what they were and what they did became a distraction and damage to the building up of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the long run, the local church can only be built up by persons like those whom Paul has described in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through these persons, the church will gradually be built up in a solid way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I believe many of us have seen able persons who were powerful and miraculous in gifts, yet eventually were of no benefit for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They were capable persons, yet they did not have the qualifications mentioned by the Apostle Paul in 1 Timothy 3.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They may build up twelve inches by their spiritual capabilities, but eventually they tear down fourteen inches by what they are.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They may build up something by what they do, but they tear down more by what they are.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The building up of a local church requires the proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It does not depend on our work as much as it does on our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be temperate, sober, and forbearing is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A local church does not need powerful elders, because sooner or later the church will be torn down by them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church needs forbearing, gentle elders who do not give themselves to anything but the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I do not believe it is necessary to mention all these aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all know what it means to be temperate, to exercise self-control, and to be forbearing, gentle, patient, and to make allowances for others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It takes the proper humanity to leave some margin for others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Out of this, there will be the real building up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We do need the proper humanity for the building up of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am so happy for the last verse at the end of these two books: "The Lord be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Grace be with you" 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If there were not such a verse, we would only have some good teachings; we could never fulfill them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Who can be such an elder?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is not one among us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only the Lord Jesus Christ has such a humanity, and praise the Lord, He is in our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must learn to turn to our spirit to take the very humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is in our spirit, and where the Lord Jesus is, there is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even He Himself is the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All we need for the building up of the church is the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need all the virtues of His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I cannot be such a person, but by enjoying His humanity in my spirit I can.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is not my duty; it is an enjoyment!</S>
