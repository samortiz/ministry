<H1 CLASS=TITLE>THIS ISSUE OF THE PRESENT TESTIMONY</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 6</H2><P>In the last issue's open letter, our brother Watchman Nee told how he completed the work on that issue even though he was being stretched out in different ways. In spite of the situation he was in, he proceeded to prepare the current issue of The Present Testimony for publication. This period of our brother's life has been filled with fierce conflicts and perilous fighting. While writing The Spiritual Man, his days were spent in the crevices of Satan's teeth. Since its completion Satan has been fighting even more with all the power of hell, attempting to completely wipe our brother out and make void the testimony of his book. This kind of warfare has occupied us and made us inactive for many days. These have been days of chanting lamentations. But at this very hazardous moment, our loving Father, our victorious Savior, has led our brother to the ascended position in the heavenlies to overcome Satan's fierce attack. With tears of joy we thank the Lord today that He has enabled us to put out this issue of The Present Testimony in His victory.</P><P>Here we would express our deep gratitude to all the brothers and sisters who are concerned for Brother Nee's health. Please continue to pray for him, so that he will receive the full blessing from the Lord during this period of rest and will be able to serve God more faithfully.</P><P>Two sisters among us will be preaching during the latter part of October in Yi-lin and Su-chia-chue in Kiangsu to the village women. They will also do some work among a few sisters. We pray that the Lord will protect the two sisters so that they may soon return safely from their temporary place of residence.</P><P>Recently, we were oppressed by the power of darkness. But this only serves to cause us to lift up our heads more, humbly and simply trust in God our Father, recognize the reality of spiritual warfare more, and maintain the testimony of a spiritual man to the end. Now, we can at last sigh in relief and continue with the work which was almost stopped. Without the covering of God's grace and the support of many prayers, we could not go on in peace. Therefore, we earnestly beseech you, "Please do not forget to pray for us!"</P><P>The co-workers of Watchman Nee<br>On behalf of the editor<br>December 24, 1928</P>
