<h2 class="head2">Loving the Lord Fervently</h2>
<p>Some people are concerned that they might become cold and stop loving the Lord. Those who constantly hope to love the Lord fervently are more likely to become cold. It is a common occurrence among Christians for those who hope to become zealous and love the Lord to eventually become cold and backslidden. However, we will surely be burning if, instead of focusing on our being fervent, we would care for others and visit them. We might wonder how we can visit others if we are not meeting regularly. If we would wait until our love for the Lord is burning and until we meet regularly before visiting people, we might need to wait a few years. Instead of caring about our cold condition, we should go visit a brother and say, &ldquo;Brother, I have not been meeting for a long time, but the Lord wants me to visit you.&rdquo; We may also tell him that we have not prayed for half a year. If we would be willing to say this to a brother, our praying will be recovered, and we will begin meeting regularly.</p>
<p>Haggai 1:9 says, &ldquo;You looked for much, and yet it amounted to little; and when you brought it home, I blew on it. Why? declares Jehovah of hosts. Because of My house that lies waste while you each run to your own house.&rdquo; Those who hope to eventually rise up and become spiritual and zealous are in principle the same as those who run to their own houses. Such people will not receive the blessing of God. This is the principle by which God deals with those who care for their own houses. If we can set aside our condition and can care for God&rsquo;s children who are the house of God, His blessing will be upon us. We should consider it to be of no consequence whether we are cold, zealous, spiritual, holy, or overcoming and instead have an anxious concern in our heart for the brothers and sisters and be devoured by the zeal of God&rsquo;s house. We should be like the apostle who had an anxious concern for all the churches and longed for the churches to be built up. Then we will become zealous, spiritual, holy, and overcoming. If we would care for the house of God in such a way, many blessings will be poured upon us.</p>
<p>However, we must not live a defeated life. I am burdened for us to see that the building up of God&rsquo;s house is what matters, not our personal victory, holiness, or spirituality. We are blessed when we are willing to set aside our personal benefit and spirituality and instead focus on the building up of God&rsquo;s house, the church. We may not have time for our personal pursuit, but we will grow at a rapid pace. We may not pray much, but our prayers will be answered. We may read only small portions of the Bible, but we will be fed and satisfied.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving Light from the Bible</h2>
<p>Some people have a pure desire to read the Bible in a proper way and, hence, spend much time to read the Bible. They do not have the purpose of becoming a teacher or of acquiring more understanding than others. However, it is possible that the more diligently they read the Bible, the more confused they will become. Such ones should learn to help others read the Bible and to read the Bible with others. Then they will be enlightened when they read the Bible.</p>
<p>People who think that they are capable of teaching others because they have a better understanding of the Bible are in darkness. Hence, they will not receive much blessing when helping others read the Bible. If we long for the Word of God, have a desire to read it, and feel the need to be enlightened but are willing to drop our pursuit in the Word in order to visit the believers who do not have a heart for the Word, we will be full of light when we read even one verse with them. We will even receive light when they utter a sentence from the Bible. Suppose we plan to fellowship with a brother concerning John 1:14 but do not have much light. The light will come as soon as we begin to speak. Such light is more precious than the light gained by studying concordances, reference books, encyclopedias, and Bible commentaries by ourselves.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on ourselves, we must care for the house of God. I enjoy reading the Bible, and if I had the time to do so, I could spend my whole life reading the Bible. However, I cannot do this and also take care of the needs of the saints. There are so many believers who need to be ministered to; hence, I cannot shut myself up in a room in order to read the Bible. I can testify that the light I have received from God far surpasses what I could have received in my personal study. If I had done nothing but read the Bible for the past thirty years, I do not believe that I would know the Bible or that I would have received any light. But by the grace of God I am much clearer concerning the Bible than I was thirty years ago. Such clarity has nothing to do with my mental capacity; it is entirely God&rsquo;s blessing. If we are for the house of God, His blessings will be ours. But if we are for our personal benefit, His blessings will be taken away from us.</p>
