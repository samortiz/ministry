<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Stuttgart, Germany in April 1977.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KERNEL IN GENESIS</h1>
<p>In this series of messages we shall cover one central point&mdash;the kernel of the Bible. The Bible is a book of life. As a book of life, the Bible has a kernel, and within this kernel there is the life germ. One day I visited a very large farm. While I was there, I saw many things: mountains, soil, trees, and many types of plants. On the trees I saw fruit. This fruit had skin, meat, and seeds. Inside the shell of the seeds there was the kernel. Apart from that kernel, there was no life germ. Everything in this environment&mdash;the heavens, the earth, the mountains, the valleys, the soil, the farm, the trees, the plants, the fruit, and the shell&mdash;was just for the kernel. If there had been no kernel, everything else would have been meaningless.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ETHICS</h2>
<p>The Bible, composed of sixty-six books, includes many things. For instance, there is a great deal of history recorded in the Bible. In the Bible we see the record of creation and the history of mankind, the Gentile nations, Israel, and the church. Eventually, the Bible unfolds the ultimate consummation of all these things.</p>
<p>The Bible also contains many doctrines. These doctrines make up what is commonly called theology. Theology teaches us all about God. It tells us what God is, what He can do, and what He has done, what He is doing, and what He will be doing. Along with theology, there is also the matter of religion, which tells us how to maintain a good relationship with God, how to worship God, how to serve God, how to love God, and how to do all for God.</p>
<p>In addition, the Bible also contains many ethical teachings. It speaks of love, kindness, patience, endurance, and humility. The Bible tells us that a man should love his wife and that a wife should submit to her husband. The Bible also says that children should honor their parents and that parents should take proper care of their children. It also contains ethical teachings about being good neighbors.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF SEEING THE KERNEL</h2>
<p>Are the history, doctrines, and ethics found in the Bible the kernel of the Bible? No, they definitely are not. You may be familiar with all the history, doctrine, religious teachings, and ethical instructions found in the Bible and still not know what the kernel is. Hence, it is absolutely crucial and vital that we see this kernel.</p>
<p>By considering the members of our physical body, we can appreciate how significant the kernel is. Although your right arm is very useful, you could still live if it were amputated. The same would be true if you lost your eyes. Although you would no longer be able to see, you would still have your life because the kernel within you would not have been damaged. The kernel in our physical body, of course, is our heart. If a person&rsquo;s heart were taken away from him, he obviously could not live. Outwardly he would still be complete, having all his limbs and the other members of his body, but the life within him would be gone. By this we see that neither the arms nor the eyes are as crucial as the heart, because the heart is the kernel of our physical body.</p>
<p>I am sorry to say that many Christians know the Bible, but they have never seen the kernel of the Bible. Instead, they have merely touched the outward aspects of the Bible, such as the record of creation; the history of mankind, the Gentiles, Israel, and the church; and all the doctrines and ethical teachings. Many know theology, perhaps even possessing a doctor&rsquo;s degree in theology, but they have never touched the kernel of the Bible. They may also know a great many teachings regarding religion, the worship of God, and the way to serve God and to love Him, but this does not mean that they have ever seen the kernel hidden within the Scriptures. Therefore, it is imperative to find out what the kernel of the Bible is.</p>
<p>Is the Bible a book of history? We must admit that the Bible is the best history book. If you major in history in college, but do not read the Bible, then you do not have an adequate knowledge of history. No other book besides the Bible tells us of the origin of the first generation of mankind. Hence, the Bible, a true history book, is the basis of all history. However, the history contained in the Bible is not the kernel of the Bible.</p>
<p>What about the doctrines in the Bible? Certainly there is no other book that contains more doctrines than the Bible does. The one word, God, includes hundreds of doctrines. Because there are so many doctrines in the Bible, we cannot deny that the Bible is a book of doctrine. If you say that the Bible is not a book of doctrine, you are heretical, for the Bible itself says that it is profitable for doctrine (2 Tim. 3:16). However, although the Bible is a book of doctrine, doctrine is not the kernel of the Bible.</p>
<p>The same is true regarding the ethical teachings in the Bible. When I was young, I studied the ethical teachings of Confucius. Because I had been born into Christianity, I also read the Bible and compared it with the teachings of Confucius. The ethics in the Bible are superior to the ethics of Confucius. No book on earth has better ethical teachings than the Bible. If you would know how to behave yourself as a wife, a husband, a child, a father, a mother, or a neighbor, you must read the Bible, an outstanding book of ethics. But no matter how excellent are the ethical teachings in the Bible, ethics is not the kernel of the Bible.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MYSTERY OF GOD&rsquo;S WILL</h2>
<p>In order to know what the kernel of the Bible is, we need to consider Ephesians 1:9. This verse says, &ldquo;Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself.&rdquo; This verse speaks of the mystery of God&rsquo;s will. God&rsquo;s eternal will has a mystery. A mystery is something that cannot be understood, for anything that is easy to understand is not mysterious. If you were to ask the angels what the mystery of God&rsquo;s will is, they would answer that they do not know. They are simply our servants, and they do not know what the will of God is, much less the mystery of God&rsquo;s will. Since the angels do not know what the mystery of God&rsquo;s will is, we must consult Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the Ephesians. In chapter one of this Epistle Paul indicates that if we would know the mystery of God&rsquo;s will, we need a spirit of revelation (Eph. 1:17). The mystery of God&rsquo;s will is revealed to our spirit. Therefore, instead of overly exercising your mentality in this matter, you should exercise your spirit to pray and ask the Lord to show you the mystery of God&rsquo;s will. We all need to say, &ldquo;O Lord, show me the mystery of Your will. For this, I need a spirit of revelation. Lord, I don&rsquo;t just want to know&mdash;I want to see. I thank You that You have given me a good mind, but my mind is not adequate to know the mystery of Your will. O Lord, reveal this matter to me.&rdquo; If you pray like this, the Lord will surely answer your prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MYSTERY OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>In Greek, Ephesians 3:9-11 speaks of the mystery of God&rsquo;s economy. This word &ldquo;economy&rdquo; is rather troublesome, for its meaning in the Bible is different from its meaning in present usage. The economy in the Bible is not a matter of finance; it is a matter of God&rsquo;s administration, God&rsquo;s arrangement, and God&rsquo;s dispensation. This economy of God also has a mystery. Furthermore, God&rsquo;s economy is related to His eternal purpose. Hence, it is important to know three things: the mystery of God&rsquo;s will, the mystery of God&rsquo;s economy, and God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. If we know these three matters, then we shall know what the kernel of the Bible is. The kernel of the Bible is the mystery of God&rsquo;s will, the mystery of God&rsquo;s economy, and the eternal purpose of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5:32 reveals that the kernel of the Bible is Christ and the church. According to this verse, Christ and the church are a great mystery. This great mystery is the kernel of the Bible. Taking Christ and the church out of the Bible would be like removing a man&rsquo;s heart from his body. However, although Christ and the church are so crucial, this kernel is very hidden.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE IMAGE OF GOD</h2>
<p>In the first three chapters of Genesis, Jesus Christ is not mentioned by name. Apparently, there is no reference to Christ in this portion of the Word. However, actually Christ is found in these chapters. The light in Genesis 1 denotes Christ, but this is not the crucial aspect of Christ hidden in this chapter. There is something hidden in this chapter referring to Christ, and that is the image of God spoken of in verse 26. In this verse God says, &ldquo;Let us make man in our image.&rdquo; Verse 27 says, &ldquo;So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him.&rdquo; Verse 26 speaks of &ldquo;our image,&rdquo; and verse 27, of &ldquo;his own image.&rdquo; In whose image was man created, and who is the image of God? Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is &ldquo;the image of the invisible God,&rdquo; and 2 Corinthians 4:4 speaks of &ldquo;Christ, who is the image of God.&rdquo; Although the word Christ is not found in Genesis 1, we do have the word image. If we have the revelation, we can see that the image of God mentioned in Genesis 1:26 is Christ. Man was made in the image of God, and the fact that the image of God is Christ indicates that man was made according to Christ.</p>
<p>Man was made in the image of Christ just as a glove is made in the image of a hand. A glove is made in the image of the hand for the purpose of containing the hand. In like manner, man was made according to Christ for the purpose of containing Christ. Thus, we see a hidden aspect of Christ in Genesis 1:26. Writing the word Christ above the word image in this chapter will help you realize that man was made in the form of Christ and according to Christ. However, this image is merely the outward form; we have not yet come to the matter of inward life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS OUR INWARD LIFE</h2>
<p>The inward life is found in Genesis 2, where we see the word &ldquo;life&rdquo; (v. 9). After God created man, He placed him in a garden. In the center of this garden there was the tree of life. God&rsquo;s intention in putting man before the tree of life was that man would receive the divine life. Who is this divine life? The answer is in Colossians 3:4, which says that Christ is our life. Therefore, Christ is both God&rsquo;s image and our life. We were made according to Christ that we might contain Christ, and Christ is destined to be our life. If we do not have Christ, we do not have the divine life (1 John 5:11-12). Although we may have the outward form of the image of God, without Christ we do not have the inward life. Therefore, we need Christ to be our inward life.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE ONE DESTROYING THE SERPENT</h2>
<p>Christ is also found in Genesis chapter three. Verse 15 says, &ldquo;And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.&rdquo; In this verse we see a wonderful title of Christ, &ldquo;the seed of the woman.&rdquo; God created man and placed him in front of the tree of life, but man fell. The subtle serpent entered in to damage man. Thus, God intervened to exercise His judgment, mainly upon the serpent. God told the serpent that the seed of the woman would bruise his head. This meant that someone would come to destroy Satan. The seed of the woman who came to destroy Satan is Christ. Hence, in the first three chapters of Genesis, we have Christ as the image of God, as our life, and as the One who destroys Satan. How wonderful! This is the kernel of the first three chapters of Genesis. If we do not have Christ in these chapters, we do not have the kernel. Rather, we merely have the record of creation, of the garden of Eden, and of the fall of man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IN GENESIS</h2>
<p>Although we have Christ as the image of God, as our life, and as the One who destroys Satan, we do not have the church in the first three chapters of Genesis. Genesis, of course, has not only three chapters, but fifty chapters. In chapters two and three we have Adam, and in chapters four through fifty we have seven important persons: Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph. These people together are a type of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ADAM, ABEL, AND ENOSH</h2>
<p>In Adam we see God&rsquo;s purpose and man&rsquo;s fall. In Abel we see the return of the fallen man to God (Gen. 4:4). Man fell in Adam, but he came back to God in Abel. Hallelujah for this return! With Enosh we have the beginning of calling upon the name of the Lord (Gen. 4:26). Some Christians do not agree with the matter of calling upon the Lord. However, this practice began with the third generation of mankind. The name Enosh in Hebrew means &ldquo;frail, mortal man.&rdquo; Man is fragile and easily broken. After fallen man returned to God, he realized that he was weak, frail, and mortal. When he realized this, he began to call on the name of the Lord that he might receive help, supply, strength, and nourishment. Thus, in Abel we see man coming back to God, and in Enosh we see man realizing his weakness and beginning to call on the Lord for help. Undoubtedly, by calling upon the name of the Lord, man received the supply from God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENOCH AND NOAH</h2>
<p>In Enoch we see a man who walked with God (Gen. 5:22). Enoch, the man who walked with God and lived by God, was eventually raptured to God (Gen. 5:24). Please pay attention to the sequence here: with Abel man returned to God, with Enosh man called on the name of the Lord, and then with Enoch man walked with God. After Enoch, we have Noah, in whom we see God&rsquo;s reign. Noah represented God in ruling over the world. At the time of Noah the man who had returned to God also had dominion over all the earth. Man had not only returned to God, received help from God, and walked with God; he also reigned over the earth for God. However, like Adam, the descendants of Noah also fell, even to the point that God gave up the created race.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND JACOB WITH JOSEPH</h2>
<p>After it became necessary for God to give up the created race, He came in to call one man, Abraham, out of the fallen race and to establish him as the head of the called race (Gen. 11:27&mdash;12:3). In the case of Abraham, we see that he, the called one, was justified by God through faith (Gen. 15:6). Isaac inherited from Abraham all the blessings through faith. In Jacob we see both transformation and reigning. In Abraham we have justification; in Isaac, the enjoyment of the inherited blessing; and in Jacob, a transformed person possessing the element needed to reign over the earth. Jacob eventually reigned over Egypt through his son, Joseph, who represents the reigning aspect of Jacob&rsquo;s life. In Jacob we see a transformed, mature person who rules over the entire earth. This is the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s will to have a heavenly ruling on earth. All this put together is a shadow, a type, of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE COMPOSITION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In the first three chapters of Genesis we have Christ as the image of God, as our life, and as the One who destroys Satan. In the following forty-seven chapters we see a shadow, a type, of the church, composed of the saints from Abel through Jacob with Joseph. All these people are the composition of the church. Whatever we see in each of these men is an aspect of the church. The church must be composed of people who have returned to God, who call upon the name of the Lord to receive help, who walk in the presence of God and live by Him, who have dominion over the earth, who have been justified by faith, who inherit all the blessings by faith, and who are transformed and matured to possess power to reign on earth. This is the church.</p>
<p>Therefore, both Christ and the church are hidden in the book of Genesis. In the first three chapters of this book we see Christ, and in the last forty-seven chapters we see the church. Christ is God&rsquo;s image, our life, and the One who destroyed Satan. This Christ brings forth and produces the church, the composition of so many persons. Therefore, the kernel of the book of Genesis is Christ and the church.</p>
<p>Now we see not only the tree, the fruit, the skin, the meat, and the shell of the book of Genesis; we also see the kernel. It took many years for me to see the kernel in this book. But Christ and the church are both hidden here. Who can deny that the kernel of Genesis is Christ and the church? Because this kernel is so hidden, we need a spiritual x-ray in order to see it. Without such an x-ray, we cannot find Christ and the church in Genesis. But now we have seen that Christ and the church are the kernel hidden within the fifty chapters of this book.</p><h2 class="head1">RETURNING TO GOD</h2>
<p>Are you an Abel? I can strongly testify that, as one who has returned to God, I am an Abel. More than fifty years ago, I was far away from God. But one day I turned around and came back to Him. At that time, I became an Abel. Are you still walking away from God, or have you returned to Him? Hallelujah, we have returned! We are not Cains; we are Abels.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>Are you also an Enosh, one who calls on the name of the Lord? Throughout the more than fifty years of my Christian life, I have been calling on the Lord for help. Many times I called on the Lord to help me with my temper because I was not able to deal with it. At other times I called on Him because I could not bear certain troubles. Realizing that I was weak and fragile, I said, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, help me.&rdquo; I am sorry to say that some Christians do not agree with this matter of calling on the name of the Lord. In times of peace they do not call on Him. However, in times of trouble they spontaneously call, &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; There is not one Christian who has never called on the name of the Lord. Why should we wait for trouble to come before we call on the Lord? Why not call on His name day by day? If you have never tried this in a daily way, I would ask you to try it now. There is no need to pray in the old way, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I need You. My temper is uncontrollable, and my wife is difficult. I need Your help, Lord.&rdquo; Instead of praying this way, say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Some say that this calling is too noisy. Although I agree that sometimes we should not be too loud and that we should not disturb others, we can still call upon the Lord in a subdued way.</p>
<p>Lamentations 3:55 and 56 indicate that to call on the name of the Lord is to breathe. Verse 55 says, &ldquo;I called upon thy Name, O Lord, out of the low dungeon.&rdquo; The writer here was in a very low state, even in a low dungeon, when he called upon the Lord. Then verse 56 says, &ldquo;Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.&rdquo; This indicates that our calling on the Lord is our breathing. There is no need to call with a loud voice. We can call on Him in the way of breathing Him in. This matter of calling on the name of the Lord began with Enosh, the third generation of mankind. Like Enosh, we all need to be those who call on the name of the Lord. The more we call on Him, the more help we shall receive from Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WALKING WITH GOD</h2>
<p>We should not only be an Abel and an Enosh, but also an Enoch walking with God. Although we all are Abels who have returned to God, I wonder if we all are Enochs who walk with Him day by day. Enoch walked with God by calling on the name of the Lord. If we would walk with God today, we also need to call on Him. As you are about to lose your temper, you should say, &ldquo;Lord, I am walking with You and I am about to lose my temper.&rdquo; If you say this, you will find it very difficult to lose your temper. The more you walk with God, the more difficult it will be to lose your temper.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REIGNING FOR GOD</h2>
<p>We also should be a Noah, not only walking with God and preparing salvation for ourselves and others, but also reigning for God. As Noahs, we enjoy God&rsquo;s full salvation, with God&rsquo;s dominion over the earth as the issue.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCES OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND JACOB</h2>
<p>In addition to being Abels, Enoshes, Enochs, and Noahs, we also should be Abrahams, Isaacs, and Jacobs. Certainly, like Abraham, we have been justified. Furthermore, like Isaac, we should daily enjoy our inheritance and be under God&rsquo;s blessing. Perhaps you may say that you do not want to be a Jacob, for Jacob was a supplanter, a heel-holder, one who deceived nearly everybody. Although you may not desire to be such a person, do not forget that Jacob was eventually transformed into Israel, the prince of God. We all shall be transformed Jacobs. Many can say that they have called on the name of the Lord, but not many can say that they have been transformed. However, we have returned to the Lord, we are calling on Him, we are walking with Him, and we are preparing salvation for ourselves and others that we may reign for God. At the same time, we are in the process of transformation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE&mdash;THE CHURCH AS THE HOUSE OF GOD</h2>
<p>The issue of the process of transformation through which Jacob passed was the twelve tribes that formed the house of Israel. The house of Israel is a full type of the church. In the Old Testament there was the house of Israel, and in the New Testament there is the church as God&rsquo;s house. Thus, the house of Israel was a type of the church as God&rsquo;s house. The house of Israel came out of Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p>
<p>Today we are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is mainly the recovery of Christ as our life and of the church as our living. However, although many Christians talk about the church, they do not have the practical church life. They have the doctrine of the church, but they do not have the practicality of the church. One reason for this is that they have not seen that the church is the issue of these significant persons in the book of Genesis. In order to have the proper church life, we need to be an Abel, an Enosh, an Enoch, a Noah, an Abraham, an Isaac, and a Jacob. We must not only return to God, but also undergo the process of transformation. It is in this way that we have the twelve tribes, the components of the house of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO SEE CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We all need to pray to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, grant me a clear vision of the kernel of the Bible. Cause me to see Christ and the church. I do not want to see Christ in a doctrinal way, but in the way of experience. And, Lord, I also need to see the practical church life that I may be a part of the real house of Israel today.&rdquo; We all need to pray this prayer. If we do, the vision will come to us, and we shall see that the Bible is a book of Christ as life and of the church as our living. Then we shall know the kernel of the Bible. I look to the Lord that we all may see this vision. We all should say, &ldquo;I must have the experience of Christ and of the practical church life! I don&rsquo;t care for theology. I want to see Christ as my life, and I want to see the church as my daily living.&rdquo; This is the kernel of the Bible.</p>
<p>In the following messages we shall continue with Exodus and other books of the Old Testament and New Testament. In all these books we shall see the kernel of the Bible, Christ and the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KERNEL IN EXODUS</h1>
<p>In the last message we saw the kernel in Genesis, Christ and the church. Christ is God&rsquo;s image, our life, and the One who destroyed the enemy. In these matters we have the divinity of Christ, the humanity of Christ, and the redemption of Christ. Today, we enjoy Christ&rsquo;s image, Christ&rsquo;s life, and Christ&rsquo;s work of destruction. This Christ has destroyed everything negative, including the world, sin, death, and Satan. What a wonderful Christ we have! Out of this wonderful Christ there comes into being the church, composed of many Abels, Enoshes, Enochs, Noahs, Abrahams, Isaacs, and Jacobs. All these people are the components of the genuine church life. If we would see what the church is, we must see the significant aspects of these people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL BEING A CORPORATE BODY</h2>
<p>In the book of Genesis we mainly see individuals, such as Abel and Enosh. However, with the last one of these individuals, Jacob, there is the house of Jacob. When we come to the book of Exodus, the second book of Moses, it is no longer a matter of individuals; it is absolutely a matter of the house of Jacob, the house of Israel. In Exodus we do not see individual believers; we see the house of Israel as a corporate body. This is a type of the corporate church. In this book God deals with the house, the congregation, not with individuals.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the book of Exodus, the house of Israel was in a fallen state in Egypt; all the Israelites were held in slavery by the Egyptians. The Israelites were suffering under such bondage, and they needed God&rsquo;s deliverance. Hence, the Lord came into their situation. In this coming, the Lord is signified by two kinds of persons.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE ANGEL OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>The first of these persons is the Angel of the Lord. The Angel who appeared to Moses in Exodus 3:2 is not a common angel; He is the Angel of the Lord. Most Christian teachers agree that this Angel is the Lord Jesus. In his translation, J. N. Darby capitalizes the word Angel to show that this Angel is not a common angel, but an extraordinary Angel, even Christ Himself. According to verse 6, this Angel says, &ldquo;I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&rdquo; Thus, the Angel of the Lord, who came to deliver the children of Israel, is the very God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MOSES AS A TYPE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Lord also came to the Israelites through Moses, who was a type of Christ. In Deuteronomy 18:15 Moses said, &ldquo;The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken.&rdquo; The Prophet about whom Moses was speaking was Christ (Acts 3:20-26). Therefore, Moses was a shadow of Christ. When the Angel of the Lord came with Moses to visit Israel, this indicated that the Lord came as the Angel and as Moses. Today, we know that Christ has come to us as the Angel of the Lord to deliver us from bondage and as Moses to speak to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE LAMB<br />
FOR REDEMPTION AND NOURISHMENT</h2>
<p>The Lord also commanded the house of Israel to prepare a lamb (Exo. 12:3), which also was a type of Christ. When John the Baptist saw Jesus coming to him, he said, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; (John 1:29). In the Old Testament the lamb was slain on the day of the Passover, and its blood was put on the doorposts (Exo. 12:6-7). Then the children of Israel ate the flesh of the lamb &ldquo;roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs&rdquo; (Exo. 12:8). The fact that the house of Israel slew the lamb, put its blood on the doorposts, and ate its flesh indicates that we must apply Christ to our situation. Before we were saved, we were not only under bondage; we were under God&rsquo;s judgment. Hence, we had to apply Christ both for our redemption and for our deliverance. Christ is our Redeemer. If we apply His blood to our sins, in the eyes of God we are under His blood and we are forgiven. God passes over us because we are under the covering of the blood of Christ.</p>
<p>Under the blood, we enjoy Christ as the life supply, for we eat His flesh. Thus, we have not only the redeeming blood, but also the nourishing life. Christ is good for eating. Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;He who eats Me shall also live because of Me&rdquo; (John 6:48, 57). Christ is not only our Redeemer; He is also our life. We are not only redeemed by His blood, but also nourished by His life. Consider the picture of the house of Israel in Exodus 12. Because the Israelites were under the blood of the lamb, God passed over them. Furthermore, by eating the flesh of the lamb, they were nourished and strengthened to leave Egypt.</p><h2 class="head1">REDEEMED AND DELIVERED</h2>
<p>In the book of Exodus we see Christ as the delivering Angel, as the speaking Moses, and as the redeeming and nourishing lamb. The house of Israel enjoyed all these aspects of Christ. They enjoyed both the blood of the lamb and the life of the lamb. Through this enjoyment they were set free and received the strength to make their exodus out of Egypt. When the Israelites crossed the Red Sea, the Egyptian forces followed them. But God buried them all under the flood of water, just as soon as the house of Israel walked through the water as on dry land. Hence, the Israelites were not only redeemed from God&rsquo;s judgment; they were also delivered from the bondage of the Egyptians. Christ is the delivering Angel, the speaking Moses, and the redeeming Lamb with the cleansing blood and the nourishing, strengthening life. By applying this Christ to our situation, we are redeemed, released, and delivered from Satan&rsquo;s bondage. Hallelujah, we are free!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PASSOVER BEING A TYPE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 5:7 and 8 say, &ldquo;Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.&rdquo; These verses indicate clearly that the Passover in the Old Testament is a type of Christ. Christ is our Passover. Every day we enjoy Him as the unleavened bread, as the sinless element. Day by day we feast, not only on the flesh of the Lamb, but also upon this unleavened bread. We have escaped from Egypt, and we have been delivered from the bondage of Satan. Now we are free to follow the Lord in the wilderness, where there is no more bondage.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
AS MANNA AND AS THE LIVING WATER</h2>
<p>However, as we follow the Lord in the wilderness, we still need to eat and drink. As the children of Israel were journeying through the wilderness, Christ came to them again. When they were in Egypt, He came as the Angel, as Moses, and as the Lamb. But in the wilderness He came as &ldquo;a small round thing,&rdquo; &ldquo;like coriander seed,&rdquo; for the purpose of nourishing, strengthening, satisfying, and energizing them (Exo. 16:14-15, 31). The house of Israel called the name of this small, round thing manna (Exo. 16:31). Without this manna, the Israelites could not have journeyed through the wilderness. Praise the Lord that day by day Christ came from the heavens to visit them and to give them nourishment!</p>
<p>The Passover took place just one time, but eating the manna is a daily matter. We need to feed upon Christ as the manna every morning. In fact, we need to enjoy Christ at least three times a day, eating Him in the morning, at noon, and in the evening. Do you enjoy Christ like this? Did you eat Him as your breakfast this morning? This morning for my physical breakfast I had some German bread. It was very solid; and it energized me, satisfied me, and strengthened me. Christ is much more solid than German bread. We must daily enjoy Him as our breakfast. Christ also should be our lunch at noon and our dinner in the evening. He is not only our Angel, our Moses, and our Lamb; He is our daily, heavenly manna.</p>
<p>Christ is also the rock flowing with living water (Exo. 17:6). Christ is our spiritual food and our spiritual drink. First Corinthians 10:3 and 4 say, &ldquo;And did all eat the same spiritual meat; and did all drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.&rdquo; Oh, we all must enjoy Christ to such an extent! Day by day, He is the manna and He is the rock that follows us. Whenever we are thirsty, we can drink of the living water flowing from this rock. As the heavenly manna and the heavenly drink, Christ surely is our daily supply. Certainly this is the kernel in the book of Exodus. Today we are enjoying this kernel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST&mdash;<br />
THE DWELLING PLACE OF GOD ON EARTH</h2>
<p>We have seen that the house of Israel was under bondage in Egypt and that Christ came as the Angel, as Moses and as the Lamb to redeem and deliver them. In the wilderness the Israelites were nourished daily by the manna and the living water. Now we must see the issue of this enjoyment of Christ. In Exodus 19:4 the Lord said, &ldquo;Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles&rsquo; wings, and brought you unto myself.&rdquo; In Exodus 25:8 we see God&rsquo;s purpose in bringing the house of Israel out of Egypt to Himself. In this verse the Lord commanded Moses, &ldquo;And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.&rdquo; God told the children of Israel to build Him a tabernacle, and they did build a tabernacle for Him. This tabernacle, the dwelling place of God, also signified the house of Israel.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE TO RECOVER THE EARTH</h2>
<p>Many Christians hold the mistaken concept that God wants to dwell in heaven. But the Bible reveals that God&rsquo;s desire is to dwell on earth. He is not satisfied with His heavenly dwelling place; He desires to come down to earth. You may love heaven, but God loves the earth. You may want to go to heaven, but God wants to come down to earth. Which do you prefer&mdash;heaven or earth? Although most Christians love heaven much more than earth, God loves earth more than heaven. He has no problems in heaven, but He does have many problems with the earth. God is eager to recover the earth that He may establish His dwelling place here.</p>
<p>God created man for the specific purpose of recovering the earth that He may have a dwelling place on earth. The time of Abel, the time of Abraham, and even the time of Jacob were not the right time for God to set up His dwelling place on earth. He had to wait until the house of Israel had come into being, had been delivered out of Egypt, and had been brought to Mount Sinai. That was the time God told the house of Israel to build Him a dwelling place on earth.</p>
<p>The tabernacle built by the Israelites was not only a type of the church; it was also a type of Christ. Moreover, it was not just the individual Christ; it was the corporate Christ, the enlarged Christ. The tabernacle was Christ enlarged to be God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GLORY OF GOD FILLING THE TABERNACLE</h2>
<p>When the tabernacle had been built and erected, it was filled with the glory of God. Exodus 40:34 says, &ldquo;Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.&rdquo; This means that the God of heaven had come into His dwelling place on earth. This matter has great significance.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ONE TABERNACLE IN GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is to have a dwelling place on earth. This dwelling place is the enlargement of Christ, an enlargement that includes all of us. God&rsquo;s dwelling place is not with one person individually; it is with all the believers corporately. In typology, all the children of Israel were one. The number of the Israelites must have been more than two million. Although they were so numerous, they were absolutely one; they were still one house. These more than two million people erected one tabernacle. It is difficult to believe that among this large number of people there was just one tabernacle. Most people, thinking that it would be awkward for so many to come together to one tabernacle, would suggest that there be several dozen tabernacles, and that a portion of the people be assigned to each of them. If there were twenty-four tabernacles, then the people would be divided into twenty-four sections, one section for each tabernacle. This would be the plan suggested by human wisdom. Christians today would probably propose that there should be more than a hundred tabernacles to accommodate this number of people.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s economy, however, is different from man&rsquo;s wisdom. In His economy there is one tabernacle for more than two million people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SMALL IN APPEARANCE, GLORIOUS IN CONTENT</h2>
<p>Furthermore, this unique tabernacle was not very large. Rather, it was just thirty cubits long and ten cubits wide. In other words, it was forty-five feet by fifteen feet. If we had been there, we probably would have proposed that the tabernacle be a great deal larger, perhaps five hundred feet by fifty feet. Nevertheless, in appearance the church should be one small tabernacle. All the people must come to this tabernacle. If you do not, you will not be able to meet God or to hear God&rsquo;s speaking, because God&rsquo;s presence and His oracle are both in the tabernacle. Outside the tabernacle, God does not speak.</p>
<p>In the book of Exodus we can see both Christ and the church, the kernel of this book. We see Christ as the Angel, as Moses, as the Lamb, as the manna, and as the rock with the living water. When we enjoy such a Christ, we eventually become the house of God, the dwelling place of God on earth. God&rsquo;s earthly dwelling place is not large; rather it is quite small. The outstanding point related to the tabernacle is not its greatness&mdash;it is the fact that God&rsquo;s presence and glory are there. In the tabernacle there was God&rsquo;s glory, God&rsquo;s speaking, God&rsquo;s light, and God&rsquo;s life supply. We must see the difference between the way God does things and the way man does things. Man desires to have a large outward appearance. Although the number of the people may be quite small, man likes to build a large hall for them. God&rsquo;s way is different. Although the number of the people may be huge&mdash;more than two million&mdash;He has a small building.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE BUILDING</h2>
<p>When the tabernacle was set up, the children of Israel were one. Just as the tabernacle had been set up, so they also had been built up into one people. The tabernacle had been built up into one entity. It was not a pile of material that had been gathered together. No, all the material had been built together into one tabernacle. This indicated that all the children of Israel were built up as one. Thus, the physical tabernacle was a type, a sign. The real dwelling place of God on earth was the house of Israel, signified by the tabernacle.</p>
<p>No matter how large the number of the children of God is, they all must be one and be one small building. Never try to be great. Although the church in Stuttgart may have a thousand or even ten thousand people, they all must be one. They should not be a great church, but a church that is small in appearance. However, the content of this church is the presence of God, the glory of God, the speaking of God, the light of God, and the life supply of God. As far as the outward appearance is concerned, everything is small; nevertheless, within this small tabernacle we see God&rsquo;s glory, we hear God&rsquo;s speaking, we are enlightened by God&rsquo;s light, and we are nourished by God&rsquo;s life. We all have experienced this. When we visited the great cathedrals with their high towers, we found that there was nothing there except darkness and emptiness. However, when we came to a small group of Christians meeting as the church, everything apparently was small, but from within we saw the glory of God, we heard the speaking of God, we were enlightened by the light of God, and we enjoyed the life supply of God. This is a testimony that such a group of Christians is the church.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s redeemed and delivered people, who follow Him in the wilderness, must be His dwelling place. Today, we, God&rsquo;s redeemed people on earth, must be built up together to become the tabernacle of God. No matter how many of us there may be, we must still be one. Whenever we come together, we should not have a great appearance, but we should be inwardly filled with the glory of God and with the presence of God. In us and among us there should also be the speaking of God, the light of God, and the life supply of God. This is the church built with God&rsquo;s redeemed and delivered people, and this is the picture of the church portrayed in the book of Exodus.</p>
<p>In the first chapter of the book of Exodus we see bondage, slavery, suffering, and affliction. But at the end of the book we see a tabernacle, God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth, filled with the glory of God and the presence of God and having the speaking of God, the light of God, and the life of God. If you compare the first chapter of Exodus with the last chapter, you will see a great difference between them. Before we were saved and built up into the church, we were in Egypt, under bondage, slavery, suffering, and affliction. When we were in bondage, there was no God, no light, and no life. Praise the Lord that by experiencing Christ as the delivering Angel, as the speaking Moses, as the redeeming Lamb, as the nourishing manna, and as the satisfying water, we have become the house of God, the dwelling place of God on the earth. This is Christ and the church, the kernel of Exodus.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING CHRIST AND BECOMING ONE IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>How I look to the Lord that you would enjoy Christ every day! Daily you need to enjoy Him as your manna to satisfy and strengthen you. There is a proverb which says, &ldquo;You are what you eat.&rdquo; Consider the house of Israel. They ate manna day after day. After eating manna for quite a long time, they eventually became the composition of manna. If we eat Christ day by day, we shall become Christ, for we become what we eat. If we enjoy Christ, eat Christ, drink Christ, and take Christ into us, Christ will become our constituent. Christ will be wrought into every part of our being, into our mind, emotion, and will. When we all become Christ, we shall be one in Christ and one with Christ. Then we shall be built together to be the tabernacle, the dwelling place of God on earth. If we have been built up as God&rsquo;s tabernacle, then whenever we come together in Christ and with Christ, God will be present. His glory, His speaking, His light, and His life will all be with us. This is Christ and the church. Do not emphasize things such as foot washing and head covering. They are not the kernel of the Bible. As we have pointed out again and again, the kernel of the Bible is Christ and the church.</p>
<p>We all have been saved and delivered by the Lord, and now we are following Him. Daily we need to eat and drink Christ, enjoying Him as the manna and the living water. As we enjoy Him in this way, we shall become Him. Our thinking will be His thinking. Then when we come together, we shall be the enlargement of Christ. There will be no old nor young, no Europeans nor Americans. Because Christ has transformed us, He will be all in all (Col. 3:11). If you enjoy Christ as your manna day by day, you will come to look like Him. If we all have the appearance of Christ, then when we come together, we all shall be Christ. Our oneness is not doctrines, beliefs, or the truths we hold. It is the Christ we experience and enjoy day by day. Every day we need to apply Christ to our situation and take Him to meet every need in our daily living. The more we do this, the more we shall be constituted with Christ and become Christ. As a result, we shall spontaneously be one in Christ and become one enlarged Christ. Thus, wherever we are, we shall be the unique tabernacle, the dwelling place of God on earth, to express Christ and to satisfy God. Christ is our daily supply. As we eat and drink Christ, we all become a corporate Christ to be the tabernacle of God on earth. This is Christ and the church as the kernel in the book of Exodus.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KERNEL FROM EXODUS TO FIRST KINGS</h1>
<p>At the beginning of the book of Genesis we see one man bearing the image of God. But at the end of the book of Exodus we see a corporate house filled with the glory of God. God&rsquo;s intention in His creation of man was not simply to have man; it was to have a corporate house as His dwelling place on earth, a house that could be filled with His glory for His expression. When God has such a house, He can dwell on earth. Heaven is a place where He lodges temporarily. God, however, desires an eternal dwelling place. At the end of the book of Revelation we see that New Jerusalem, God&rsquo;s eternal habitation, comes down out of heaven to the new earth (Rev. 21:2). God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth is a corporate man redeemed by God, indwelt by God, saturated with God, and one with God. In this dwelling place God is able to express Himself. This is God&rsquo;s eternal plan. Today God is still working toward the fulfillment of this plan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE ASPECTS OF<br />
THE FALLEN CONDITION OF GOD&rsquo;S PEOPLE</h2>
<p>At the time of Exodus 1, God&rsquo;s corporate people had fallen in at least three ways. First, they had become so sinful that they had fallen under God&rsquo;s judgment; second, they had fallen under the slavery of Pharaoh and had become worldly; and third, they were permeated with the smell of garlic. Hence, they needed to be redeemed from God&rsquo;s judgment, delivered from bondage in Egypt, and reconstituted with a pleasant-smelling element. When God&rsquo;s people were in Egypt, they frequently ate garlic, leeks, and onions. No one likes the smell of garlic. Anyone who contacted the children of Israel in Egypt would have been offended by the odor of garlic. Before God, the children of Israel were condemned; in Egypt, they were held under bondage; and in relation to themselves, they smelled like garlic. They surely needed to be redeemed, delivered, transformed, and reconstituted. They had to become a different kind of people, people no longer under God&rsquo;s judgment, no longer held in bondage in Egypt, and no longer giving off the odor of garlic.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention was that His chosen people would be His dwelling place on earth. But His people were under His judgment, they were under bondage in Egypt, and they smelled of garlic. How could God dwell with such a people? How could they be His dwelling place? It seemed impossible. However, it was not impossible with God. Christ came into their situation as the delivering Angel, as the speaking Moses, as the redeeming Lamb, and as the nourishing unleavened bread. This Christ is wonderful.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ANGEL OF THE LORD BEING THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>According to Exodus 3, Christ as the Angel of the Lord is the Triune God. In Exodus 3:6 the Angel said, &ldquo;I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&rdquo; The God of Abraham refers to the Father; the God of Isaac, to the Son; and the God of Jacob, to the Holy Spirit. Hence, the Angel of the Lord is the Triune God. We were in a fallen condition in Egypt, but Christ as the Angel of the Lord came to deliver us. Although we do not have the strength to escape from Egypt, Christ has the strength. In fact, He even is the very strength.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAMB WITH THE REDEEMING BLOOD<br />
AND THE NOURISHING LIFE</h2>
<p>Christ also came as the Lamb to shed His blood to cleanse us and to accomplish redemption for us, that is, to redeem us out from under God&rsquo;s judgment. We are no longer under the judgment of God. We are free! We are a redeemed people covered by the blood of Christ. As the Lamb, Christ also nourishes us, strengthens us, and affords us the energy to walk out of Egypt. His blood redeems us from God&rsquo;s judgment, and His life is the nourishment, giving us the energy to escape from Egypt.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE UNLEAVENED BREAD</h2>
<p>Exodus 12 reveals that Christ is also the unleavened bread. The fact that Christ is the unleavened bread signifies that Christ is the sinless element. With Him, there is no sin; He is entirely pure. When we eat Him as the unleavened bread, we take in His sinless element. By eating the flesh of the Lamb, we receive the strength to walk out of Egypt, and by eating the unleavened bread, we partake of the element that purifies us and keeps us from sin. Praise the Lord that we are out of Egypt and that we have become unleavened bread. This bread is making us sinless.</p><h2 class="head1">GOOD FOR THE BUILDING OF GOD&rsquo;S HOUSE</h2>
<p>As the children of Israel were crossing the Red Sea, the armies of Egypt pursued them. But the Angel of the Lord miraculously buried the armies of the Egyptians. This refers to our baptism. After we received Christ as our Redeemer, our life, and our nourishment, we crossed the Red Sea. This means that we were baptized. When we crossed the Red Sea in baptism, all the worldly forces, the Egyptian armies, were buried in the baptistry. After we were baptized, we found ourselves in the wilderness on the other side of the sea. We have been redeemed, we have been delivered, and now we are able to be for God. In Egypt, we were not good for God. But once we cross the Red Sea, we are good for God. We are no longer under God&rsquo;s judgment, in Egyptian bondage, or in sin. God&rsquo;s judgment, the bondage in Egypt, and sin are all over. We are free, purified, and absolutely good for the building of God&rsquo;s house on earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING SMALL,<br />
FULL OF LIFE, ETERNAL, AND PURE</h2>
<p>Although the children of Israel had eaten the lamb and the unleavened bread, they still needed to take the heavenly element into them. If they were to be God&rsquo;s dwelling place, they had to be heavenly. Hence, in the wilderness Christ came to them as the heavenly manna. As the Angel of the Lord, Christ is great. But as the manna, Christ is small, like coriander seed, and tiny, like frost. Our Christ is both great and small. In delivering us, He is great, but in nourishing us and making us heavenly, He is small. Hallelujah for the great Christ and for the small Christ! No one is greater than Christ, and nothing is smaller than Christ. He is great to deliver us, and He is small to nourish us.</p>
<p>If we want to eat something large, it must be cut into pieces and made small enough to eat. Praise the Lord that Christ is as small as a coriander seed. Although He is so small, He is full of life. He is a small seed, not a small grain of sand.</p>
<p>Exodus 16:14 says that manna is a &ldquo;round thing.&rdquo; Roundness in the Bible signifies eternity, that which is without beginning or ending. Although the Christ we eat is small, He is full of life and eternal. Exodus 16:31 also tells us that the manna was white, which indicates purity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING CHRIST AND EXPRESSING CHRIST</h2>
<p>As the children of Israel ate this wonderful manna day by day, they gradually lost the smell of garlic. Instead, they had the aroma of heavenly honey, for the taste of manna was &ldquo;like wafers made with honey&rdquo; (Exo. 16:31). Many years ago, in Taiwan, our family doctor told me that his daughter&rsquo;s skin had become yellow in color from eating carrots. She ate so many carrots that she expressed carrots. Likewise, if you eat a great deal of manna, you will become white, the color of manna, and you will express Christ.</p>
<p>My maternal grandparents ate a great deal of fish. They ate fish two or three times a day. Whenever my mother took me to visit them, I was bothered by the fact that everything in their home smelled of fish. My mother explained that, because my grandparents always ate fish, they naturally smelled like fish. Praise the Lord that we have a heavenly fragrance because we are eating the heavenly food, Christ. Christ is being wrought, constituted, into our being.</p>
<p>After the children of Israel were redeemed from God&rsquo;s judgment and delivered from Egyptian bondage, they were transformed by eating the manna. They were changed from having the odor of garlic to having the fragrance of the heavenly manna. Thus, with the children of Israel in the wilderness, God eventually gained a dwelling place among His chosen, redeemed, delivered, and transformed people. We also have been freed from God&rsquo;s judgment, from Egyptian bondage, and from the smell of garlic, and now we are good for the building of God&rsquo;s tabernacle.</p>
<p>All this is a picture of Christ and the church. Christ is the delivering Angel, the speaking Moses, the redeeming and nourishing Lamb, the sanctifying unleavened bread, and the transforming manna. Oh, Christ is so much to us! Eventually, we are redeemed, delivered, enlivened, and transformed. We are no longer good for anything of Egypt; we are only good for God&rsquo;s dwelling place. God&rsquo;s glory filled the tabernacle in the wilderness. For God&rsquo;s glory to come down means that God Himself comes down to earth to dwell in His habitation for His expression. The church today must be like this. Out of the enjoyment of Christ, the church comes into being to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose, that is, to express God and fully satisfy Him. Now we have the tabernacle as God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S NEED FOR AN ESTABLISHED TEMPLE<br />
IN THE GOOD LAND</h2>
<p>The tabernacle, however, was not stationary. Rather, it moved about from place to place in the wilderness. God did not want just a movable tabernacle in the wilderness; He needed an established temple in the good land. Although the tabernacle we see in the last chapter of Exodus was good, it was temporary; it was not established. Although the children of Israel had the tabernacle and were God&rsquo;s dwelling place, they were not yet fully established because they were still in the wilderness. Hence, they had to go on to enter into the good land.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, the good land is a complete picture of Christ. Christ is the Angel of the Lord, the speaking Moses, the redeeming Lamb, the unleavened bread, and the manna. Now we must see that even the good land is a type of Christ. Christ today is our good land, and we must enter into Him as the good land. We have enjoyed Him as the Angel, the Lamb, the unleavened bread, and the heavenly manna, but probably we have not yet entered into Him as the good land and experienced Him as the land.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO BURY OUR OLD MAN</h2>
<p>Formerly, the children of Israel were in Egypt. After they crossed the Red Sea, they were in the wilderness. In order to enter into the good land, they had to cross the water again, this time the river Jordan. In the Red Sea, the Egyptian forces were buried. However, the children of Israel themselves were not buried. Hence, although they enjoyed Christ, they were still very much in themselves. Because they were so much in themselves, they had to cross the water another time so that their old man could be buried. When the Israelites crossed the Jordan, God told them to take twelve stones, representing the twelve tribes of Israel, out of the river and to place another twelve stones at the bottom of the river (Josh. 4:2-4, 8-9). This signified that the old man of the children of Israel was buried. Their natural being was buried, and they became a resurrected people. They were not only redeemed and delivered; they were also resurrected. They had been redeemed out from under God&rsquo;s judgment, they had been delivered from Egyptian bondage, and now they were resurrected that they might depart from their natural being. This is deeper than redemption and deliverance. Those who still live in their natural being must cross the Jordan so that their old man can be buried and that they themselves can be in resurrection. When we are resurrected, we immediately find ourselves in the good land, in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RICHES OF CHRIST<br />
PORTRAYED BY THE GOOD LAND</h2>
<p>The Christ portrayed by the good land is very rich. This land is very spacious and rich. The good land is rich in four categories of things: water, food, animal life, and minerals (Deut. 8:7-10; 32:14). These categories signify the richness of Christ as our good land. Christ is not only the manna and the water flowing from the rock. In the good land we have streams, rivers, and fountains. These streams flow from the mountains, and the valleys are full of water. Now that we are in Christ we do not lack water. Wherever we are, on the mountain or in the valley, water is flowing. Both during pleasant times on the mountaintops and during sorrowful times in the valleys, there is an abundance of water.</p>
<p>In Christ as our good land there are also many types of food: wheat, barley, figs, vines, olives, and pomegranates. Christ is wheat, barley, grapes, figs, olives, and pomegranates. He is the wheat and the barley as bread for us to eat. He is the grape wine to make us happy and the fig tree to satisfy us. He is also the oil, signifying the fullness of the Holy Spirit, and the pomegranate, signifying the expression of the riches of life. He is also the cattle, signifying His redeeming and nourishing life. Christ is so rich! If you would know the details of all these aspects of Christ, I encourage you to read the book, <em>The All-inclusive Christ.</em></p>
<p>Christ is not only the water, the food, and the cattle; He is also the minerals dug out of the mountains. He is the stones, the iron, and the brass. If we read the Bible carefully, we shall see that the stones are for God&rsquo;s building. Stone signifies Christ as the building stone (1 Pet. 2:4-6) to establish the kingdom (Dan. 2:35). Iron and brass are metals used in making weapons for war. These weapons are used to subdue the enemy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GAINING THE GROUND<br />
FOR THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE</h2>
<p>After the children of Israel entered into the good land, they still had to face many enemies. God&rsquo;s intention was that the Israelites would build the temple in the good land. However, because the enemies were still present, God could not build the temple. Therefore, He raised up David, an excellent fighter, to defeat the enemy and gain the ground for the building of the temple. Furthermore, David even gave the design of the temple to Solomon, his son, and charged him to build the temple. Solomon did so. After the temple had been built, the glory of God came down again and filled the temple. On earth there was something more than a movable tabernacle; there was an established temple.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO STAGES OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The temple is also a type of the church. The tabernacle was neither stationary nor permanent, but the temple was established. Some churches are good, but they, like the tabernacle, are not settled and solidly established. Praise the Lord that some churches are the temple, fully settled and solidly established. In order to have such an established church, we must take Christ, not only as the manna, but also as the good land. We must take Christ as solid food, not just as the manna. German bread is very hard, and babies cannot eat it. Although babies might be able to eat manna, they cannot eat barley bread. Those in some local churches constantly eat manna. Although this is good, it is not good enough. We all must pass through the wilderness and enter into the good land. We must progress from eating manna to eating hard bread. We must also experience Christ as the stone and as the iron and brass. Christ is the stone to smash the enemy and to build the house of God. How we need to experience Christ as the iron and brass for the defeat of the enemy!</p>
<p>Some saints in the church life are very good. Day after day they eat manna. But when the enemy attacks, they are not able to deal with him. They are young, immature, and not at all strong. But some of the saints are very strong. They are like iron and brass. Each of them is a rock that can smite the enemy, build up the temple, and even establish the kingdom.</p>
<p>Christ is the Angel, Moses, the Lamb, the unleavened bread, the manna, and the good land, including water, food, cattle, and minerals. It is by experiencing Christ as the minerals in the good land that we become rock, iron, and brass. If we experience Christ in this way, we are good not only for the building, but also for fighting the battle, defeating the enemy, and subduing all the adversaries. When the enemy and the adversaries are defeated, we have the ground for the building of the house of God and for the establishing of the kingdom of God. This is the church. Once again we see that the church comes out of the enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<p>We have seen two stages of the church: the stage of the tabernacle and the stage of the temple. Is the church in your locality the tabernacle or the temple? I would be very glad to hear that the church in your city is the temple. As we have seen, the tabernacle is good, but it is not very solid or weighty. But the temple is weighty, solid, and settled. In order for the church to be the temple, a good number of saints must become stones, iron, and brass. Only by becoming iron and brass can we fight the battle and defeat the enemy. Are the saints in your locality stones, iron, and brass, or are they wafers that are sweet, delicious, tender, and kind, but not at all solid? If you pour water on a wafer, it will easily fall apart. But if you pour water on stone, iron, or brass, no damage will be done. Those who are solid and strong can stand against any storm or flood. They are able to stand against the enemy. This is the church in the stage of the temple. If we would have the church as the temple, we need to experience Christ as stone, iron, and brass, not simply as manna.</p>
<p>Whether the church is the tabernacle or the temple, the function, the foundation, and the nature are all the same. Both the tabernacle and the temple are unique. There cannot be more than one tabernacle, and there cannot be more than one temple. The tabernacle and the temple both come out of the experience of Christ. If we lack the experience of Christ, we simply cannot have the proper church life.</p>
<p>Thus far in this series of messages we have come to three stations. The first station is at the end of Genesis, the second is at the end of Exodus, and the third is the building of the temple in 1 Kings. At the time of 1 Kings chapter eight, God had gained an established temple on earth. God was able to put His name there, and He could fill it with His glory. Praise the Lord that in Stuttgart and other places God has such a solid temple, a solid church life. This temple is not built with wafers, but with stones. Praise the Lord that a good number of saints are stone, iron, and brass. They are strong to stand against the enemy, to express God, to be His dwelling place on earth, and to satisfy the desire of His heart. This is the kernel of the Bible, Christ and the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">EATING IN EGYPT, IN THE WILDERNESS,<br />
AND IN THE GOOD LAND</h1>
<p>According to the record of the Old Testament, the children of Israel were in Egypt, they journeyed through the wilderness, and they entered into the good land. When the Israelites were in a fallen state in Egypt, they were under God&rsquo;s judgment, they were under the bondage of the Egyptians, and they were permeated with the odor of garlic. The judgment upon them was related to God&rsquo;s righteousness, their bondage was related to the Egyptians, and the odor of garlic was related to their living. This was the condition of us all before we were saved. We were under the condemnation of God&rsquo;s judgment, we were under the bondage of the world, and we were saturated with the odor of worldly &ldquo;garlic.&rdquo; Garlic represents various worldly things, such as dancing and gambling. Before we were saved, we all had the odor of garlic. But we all were chosen and predestinated to be God&rsquo;s people that He may have a dwelling place on earth. God&rsquo;s intention is to make us His habitation on earth that the God in heaven may come down to earth. This habitation cannot be in Egypt; it must be in the good land. However, we, God&rsquo;s chosen people, had fallen into Egypt. How could we escape from Egypt, pass through the wilderness, and enter into the good land? For this we need God&rsquo;s deliverance, God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SAVED BY EATING</h2>
<p>Now we must see how God exercises His deliverance of His chosen people. God delivers us by feeding us. He saves us by giving us something to eat. Thus, we are delivered out of our pitiful situation by eating. We have a saying, &ldquo;Eating Jesus is the way.&rdquo; Jesus, however, is profound, and eating Him is not a simple matter. Jesus is unsearchably rich and all-inclusive; He is everything. When we were in Egypt, we had to eat Him as the Lamb because we were under God&rsquo;s judgment and were held in bondage to the world. The Lamb shed His blood for our sins, cleansed us of our sins, and redeemed us from God&rsquo;s judgment. This Lamb also has the nourishing life. By eating Him we are strengthened to leave Egypt. Thus, by the blood of the Lamb we are redeemed from God&rsquo;s judgment, and by the life of the Lamb we are energized and strengthened to escape from Egypt.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PURIFIED BY CHRIST AS THE UNLEAVENED BREAD</h2>
<p>When the children of Israel ate the Lamb, they also ate unleavened bread (Exo. 12:8). Likewise, we eat Christ not only as the Lamb, but also as the unleavened bread. When we take Christ as our life, this life not only energizes us and strengthens us; it also purifies us. This life is an unleavened life, a purifying life. The more we call on the name of the Lord Jesus and take Him into us, the more we are purified from within. We become not only strong, but also pure. The blood of the Lamb redeems us from God&rsquo;s condemnation, the nourishing life of the Lamb strengthens us and energizes us to walk away from bondage, and the unleavened bread, eaten with the flesh of the Lamb, purifies us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS THE BITTER HERBS</h2>
<p>The children of Israel not only ate unleavened bread, but also bitter herbs. Few Christians pay attention to the matter of the bitter herbs in Exodus 12. As the life of Christ purifies us, it becomes within us a sense that gives us a bitter feeling, a bitter consciousness, whenever we try to touch something sinful or worldly. The indwelling Christ will never allow us to touch such things. If you attempt to go back to the &ldquo;garlic&rdquo; of the world or to sinful things after you have partaken of Christ, you will have an unpleasant feeling, a sense of bitterness, within you. When I was young, I was very fond of playing soccer. Apart from my studies I cared for only one thing, and that was soccer. How happy I was on the soccer field! However, after I was saved, I could no longer enjoy soccer. Whenever I tried to play, there was a bitter taste inwardly instead of a sweet one. One day, as the ball came my way, I was unable to kick it. Something within was restraining me. The bitter feeling within me was so strong I could not move my feet. Although I wanted to play soccer, the indwelling Christ did not allow me to do so. This is the experience of Christ as the bitter herb. Have you not tasted such bitter herbs since you were saved? Praise the Lord for Christ as the bitter herb!</p>
<p>Let us take another illustration of the bitter herb, this time from the experience of married life. I have never met a married couple who have not exchanged words. No wife wants to lose the case, and no husband wants to be subdued by his wife. Thus, a wife and husband quarrel. Before you were saved, you might have enjoyed exchanging words with your husband and boasting to a friend concerning how you subdued him. However, things changed after you were saved. As you were exchanging words with your husband, something within told you to stop it. Perhaps you did not heed this inner sense and continued arguing with him. However, after he left for work you found that you had no peace. Something inside was troubling you, and there was a bitter feeling within. Instead of the desire to tell your friend about how you subdued your husband, you sensed a very bitter taste within. A few days later, you tried to exchange words with your husband again, but this time you were not able to speak. When he asked you what was wrong, you said that there was nothing wrong and encouraged him simply to go to work. This is Christ as the bitter herb.</p>
<p>All women enjoy buying beautiful things. When you went shopping before you were saved, you felt happy about the things you bought. But after you were saved, your feelings about shopping began to change. Suppose a sister goes shopping. As she gazes at a certain beautiful item, something within tells her not to look at it. Suppose the sister does not obey this feeling and purchases the item anyway. Suddenly, her happiness goes and the sense of bitterness comes. The item was on sale at a fifty percent discount. Nevertheless, the inner sense had forbidden her to buy it. Therefore, after making the purchase and bringing it home, the sister senses a bitter taste within. Because of this bitter feeling, she cannot pray well or even sleep well. This is the experience of the troubling Christ as the bitter herb.</p>
<p>Do not think Christ always gives you peace. Many times He gives a bitter taste instead of a sense of peace. Oh, Christ is a real troublemaker! Although the Lamb is sweet, the herb is bitter. Many times we say that Christ is sweet, and we often praise Him for His sweetness. But Christ is also bitter. There are times when we should praise Him for His bitterness and say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I praise You for Your bitterness!&rdquo; If we have been trained by experiencing Christ as the bitter herb, we shall obey the inner sense when it tells us not to buy a certain item in a department store. We know that if we buy it, we shall suffer bitterness. However, we are not easily trained.</p>
<p>I have suffered this kind of bitterness again and again. Forty-five years ago, as a young man, I was never willing to lose a case to my wife. But every time I exchanged words with her, I experienced the bitter herb. Therefore, I said, &ldquo;Lord, by Your mercy, I will never argue with my wife again.&rdquo; However, the next day my wife troubled me again. Perhaps she said, &ldquo;What are you doing in your room? Don&rsquo;t you know it&rsquo;s time for breakfast? Why won&rsquo;t you come out?&rdquo; To this, I would reply, &ldquo;What is the matter with you? What is wrong with me staying in the room to pray? Don&rsquo;t you know that I am having morning watch? I have been reading the Bible and praising the Lord.&rdquo; Immediately after saying these words, I sensed the bitter taste again. I have had to learn the same lesson over and over. Eventually, when my wife asked me what I was doing, I did not even dare to say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord.&rdquo; Rather, I kept silent and inwardly praised Him. When I did this, I experienced happiness instead of bitterness. This inner sense of bitterness surely teaches us. Hallelujah for Christ as the bitter herb!</p>
<p>By the blood of the Lamb we are redeemed, by the life of the Lamb we are strengthened, and by the unleavened bread with the bitter herbs we are purified and kept sinless. Thus, we are redeemed, released, delivered, purified, and cleansed. No longer are we in Egypt under God&rsquo;s condemnation and the world&rsquo;s slavery; no longer are we saturated with the odor of garlic. Now we are in the wilderness.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HEAVENLY ELEMENT OF MANNA<br />
CONSTITUTED INTO OUR BEING</h2>
<p>However, we still need to have the heavenly element added to us. Although we have been redeemed, delivered, cleansed, and purified, all this is negative; we do not yet have anything positive. Hence, we are not yet qualified to be God&rsquo;s dwelling place. In order to be God&rsquo;s habitation, something heavenly must be wrought into our being. Therefore, we need to eat the heavenly manna and drink the living water so that something heavenly and living might be constituted into us. Now we are daily and even hourly eating of the manna and drinking of the water. The more we eat and drink in this way, the less we smell like garlic and the more we smell like manna. Exodus 16:31 says that the taste of manna was &ldquo;like wafers made with honey.&rdquo; The taste of manna is sweet; it is heavenly, not worldly. When the heavenly element of manna is constituted into our being, we become qualified to be God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth. In this way the tabernacle was erected in the wilderness, and it was filled with the glory of God (Exo. 40:34-35).</p>
<h2 class="head1">WAFERS OR STONES?</h2>
<p>As we pointed out in the last message, the tabernacle was good, but it was neither solid nor established. By eating manna, we become wafers with the taste of honey. Certain brothers are like sweet wafers: they break when you touch them. When the saints from Germany came to Los Angeles several years ago, they were not the temple; rather, they were the tabernacle. They were all wafers. However, since then many of them have become stones. If I pour water upon a wafer, the wafer will be ruined. But if I pour water on a stone, the stone will remain the same. I praise the Lord that there are many stones in Stuttgart. This indicates that the church in Stuttgart is no longer the tabernacle in the wilderness, but the temple in the good land.</p>
<p>Some saints in the churches are still eating the Lamb. A number of new ones are eating the Lamb. They are still in the world, not yet in the wilderness. There are some others who are eating manna. Because those who eat manna are wafers, I am very easy on them, and I dare not touch them. But some of the elders can testify that I am not easy on them because they are stones. When I pour water upon them, it proves that they are stones. Some in the church are eating the Lamb, others are eating the manna, and still others are eating the rich produce of the good land.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING AND WALKING IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>Christ is not only the redeeming and nourishing Lamb; He is also the all-inclusive land. Colossians 2:6 says, &ldquo;As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him.&rdquo; Christ is the good land in which we may live, walk, and have our being. Christ is a sphere, a realm, in which we may dwell. Colossians 2:7 says that we have been rooted and that we are being built up in Christ. Being rooted in Christ is for growth, and being built up in Christ is for building. We have been put into the good land of Christ, and now we are the plants growing in this land which is everything to us. Christ is the Lamb, the manna, and the spacious land with all kinds of produce.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WATER AND THE FOOD IN THE GOOD LAND</h2>
<p>In Christ as our land we have different kinds of water. Deuteronomy 8:7 speaks of three kinds of water: brooks, fountains, and depths, that is, deep waters. Moreover, Deuteronomy 8:8 lists seven types of food: wheat, barley, vines, figs, pomegranates, olive oil, and honey. In the New Testament wheat signifies the incarnated and crucified Christ. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit&rdquo; (John 12:24). In this verse Christ indicated that He was a grain of wheat falling into the earth to die. This means that He was the incarnated and crucified Christ.</p>
<p>The first grain to ripen in the holy land is barley. Thus, barley signifies the resurrected Christ. We must experience Christ both as the incarnated and crucified One and also as the resurrected One. Day by day we may enjoy Christ as two basic items, as wheat and as barley.</p>
<p>Christ is also the wine that makes us happy and stirs us up. He is also the fig to satisfy us and to nourish us. Pomegranates signify the expression of the riches of the life of Christ, and the olive oil, the fullness of the Holy Spirit. All these points are covered in detail in the book <em>The All-inclusive Christ.</em></p>
<p>Deuteronomy 8:8 also lists honey along with the plant life. For the most part, honey has to do with the plant life. It is derived mainly from flowers and trees. Of course, a part of the animal life is involved&mdash;that little animal, the bee. Without the flowers we cannot have honey, and without the bees we cannot have honey either. The flowers and the bees cooperate to make honey. These two lives are mingled together, and honey is produced. Christ is both the plant life and the animal life. The plant life is the generating life, and the animal life is the redeeming life. The plant life has no blood, but it generates and multiplies. Only the animal life has the blood for redemption. Hence, Christ is not only the generating life, but also the redeeming life. Daily we need to enjoy Christ as the incarnated One, the crucified One, and the resurrected One. Then we shall have the wine to make us happy and to cheer us up. This will bring the satisfaction of the fig tree, the expression of the riches of life, and the fullness of the Holy Spirit. When all these are combined with Christ&rsquo;s redeeming life, we have the sweet honey.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR STONES, IRON, AND BRASS</h2>
<p>Deuteronomy 8:9 says the good land is also &ldquo;a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.&rdquo; Stones are for building, and a mountain signifies God&rsquo;s kingdom. Daniel 2:35 says, &ldquo;The stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.&rdquo; Christ is the stone that smites the nations, and the mountain is the kingdom of God. God&rsquo;s building brings in God&rsquo;s kingdom. The tabernacle in the wilderness could not bring in God&rsquo;s kingdom. Only the temple built in the good land could bring in the kingdom of God. David fought the battle, subdued the enemy, and prepared the ground for the building of the temple. Solomon actually built the temple. When the temple was built, the kingdom of God was established on earth.</p>
<p>When the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they had the tabernacle, but they did not have the kingdom. There was no way the kingdom could be established with the tabernacle because the Israelites did not have the stone, the iron, or the brass. They were not yet able to fight the battle to gain the ground for the building of the temple. When they entered into the good land, they stopped eating manna and began to eat the produce of the land (Josh. 5:12). They no longer ate something that came down from heaven, but something that grew out of the earth.</p>
<p>The manna from heaven had no minerals in it. But foods such as wheat, barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, and olives, contain minerals. In these solid foods there are iron and copper. Although not all these foods are sweet, they are substantial. Manna, on the contrary, was sweet, but it was not solid. Manna could not produce stones; it could only produce wafers. Some saints are lovely, sweet, soft wafers. These saints are good for tasting or for exhibition, but they are not good for fighting. No one can fight a battle with wafers or honey. I am happy to see that there are many stones in Germany. My intention in coming here is not to taste wafers. My burden is to fight, to smite the enemy. For this, we need stones, iron, and brass. Now is the time to fight the battle against religion and to build up the temple for the establishment of God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO PROGRESS IN OUR EATING</h2>
<p>I would ask you to consider what you are eating today. Are you eating the Lamb, the manna, or the rich produce of the good land? Praise the Lord for those who are eating the Lamb! But they must progress to a higher type of eating, progressing from eating the Lamb to the eating of the manna. We thank the Lord for those who are eating the manna, but they also must go on to the highest eating, the eating of the rich produce of the good land. In your Christian life, the eating of Christ must progress from the Lamb and the manna to the solid food of the good land. You need to eat the wheat, the barley, and all the other foodstuffs that have the minerals to make you strong stones, iron, and brass for God&rsquo;s building and for the fighting of the battle.</p>
<p>We must build the temple and fight the battle so that God may have the kingdom. This is what God needs today. The tabernacle is not adequate. God needs a temple with a city in a kingdom with the kingship and the fighting capability. The Lamb energizes us to leave Egypt, and the manna nourishes us and constitutes us with the heavenly element. Although both of these items are good, they are not good for fighting. No one will fight a battle with a lamb or with manna. We need solid food with minerals in it. We need to be rocks, not wafers. We need weapons made out of iron and brass. Oh, we need stones, iron, and brass to build up the temple, to establish the kingdom, to fight the battle, and to defeat the enemy! When we come to this point, we have reached God&rsquo;s goal. Here we not only have the tabernacle; we have the temple with the city in the kingdom. As His people eat the solid food and take in the minerals that make them stones, iron, and brass, God has His kingdom.</p>
<p>By now we all should be clear concerning three kinds of eating: the eating in Egypt, the eating in the wilderness, and the eating in the good land. The eating of the Lamb is the initial eating, the eating of the manna is the higher eating, and the eating of the solid food with the minerals is the highest eating. The first eating strengthens us to escape the world, and the second enables us to be reconstituted with the heavenly element that we might be the tabernacle. But neither is adequate for the solid building, for fighting, or for establishing God&rsquo;s kingdom. In order to have all this, we must proceed to the highest eating, the eating of the solid food with the minerals. These minerals make us rocks for God&rsquo;s building that the kingdom may be established, and they make us iron and brass to fight the battle to subdue the enemy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO EAT THE SOLID FOOD</h2>
<p>I am sure you all are eager to know how to eat solid food, and I am burdened to share the way with you. Eating the manna is easy, and eating the Lamb is even easier. But it is not easy to eat the solid food that contains minerals. One chapter covers the eating of the Lamb and two chapters, the eating of the manna. But whole books in the Bible are devoted to the eating of the solid food with the minerals. If you want to know how to eat the solid food, you need to read the whole book of Leviticus, a book that is not easily understood. You also need to read Numbers and all the books from Deuteronomy to 1 Kings.</p>
<p>Once we are in the good land, we shall no longer eat manna, for our supply is the rich produce of the land. In order to eat this rich produce, we must firstly live in the good land. If we still live in the wilderness, we cannot eat the solid food. In the wilderness there is no wheat, no barley, no grapes, and no figs; there is just manna.</p>
<p>Secondly, we need to labor on the good land. We need to till the ground, sow the seed, water the seed, cultivate the soil and then reap the harvest. The good land in which we are living is Christ. Day by day we need to work on Christ. Morning watch, prayer, and dealing with the Lord are all aspects of working on Christ. Sometimes in morning watch we may till the ground and sow the seed; at other times we may water the seed or cultivate the soil. Do not be lazy and say, &ldquo;It does not matter whether or not I have morning watch, pray, or spend time to deal with the Lord.&rdquo; It makes a great deal of difference whether or not you do these things. We need to labor on Christ. We all must be diligent to work like farmers. We must till the ground, remove the weeds, cultivate the soil, water the seeds, and even kill the damaging bugs and snails.</p>
<p>Snails are subtle; they hide themselves under various coverings, and they mainly come out at night while we are sleeping to eat the tender herbs. Recently I was wondering why some of the plants around my house were not growing. At first I thought this was due to the lack of sunshine. Eventually I learned it was because the plants were being eaten by snails. One day I found thirty snails in a certain large plant. There are many &ldquo;snails&rdquo; in our Christian life. Hence, we cannot afford to sleep. If we wake up early in the morning, we shall see how much these &ldquo;snails&rdquo; are eating our Christian life. Taking care of these &ldquo;snails&rdquo; is part of laboring on Christ.</p>
<p>If we labor on Christ as the good land, our harvest will be rich in both crops and flocks. After we reap the harvest, we shall have wheat, barley, vines, figs, olives, and pomegranates. In addition to all the plant life, in the good land there is the animal life&mdash;the oxen, the cattle, the sheep. This is the harvest of our rich experience of Christ. As we shall see later in these messages, the top ten percent of our harvest must be kept for the Lord. In subsequent messages we shall consider in detail how to eat the solid food, the food that makes us stones, iron, and brass for the building of the temple, the establishing of the kingdom, and the defeat of the enemy.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">HOW TO EAT CHRIST<br />
AS THE CHOICE PORTION OF THE HARVEST</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S CONCERN FOR MAN&rsquo;S EATING</h2>
<p>For the sake of His economy, God is very concerned about man&rsquo;s eating. Immediately after God created man, He did not give him a list of things to do and not to do. Instead, He placed him in front of the tree of life and charged him concerning his eating, saying, &ldquo;Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it&rdquo; (Gen. 2:16-17). God did not command man to love his wife or to worship and serve God. Rather, He strongly charged him to be careful about his eating. God seemed to say, &ldquo;If your eating is proper, everything will be all right. But if you eat improperly, you will die. Eating is a matter of life and death.&rdquo; If man eats properly, he will have the life he needs.</p>
<p>After man had fallen, God came in to save him. In His salvation God also charged man to eat, this time to eat the lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs (Exo. 12:1-10). If we would be saved, we must eat the Lamb with the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs. Our being saved depends upon our eating of Christ. By eating Christ as the Lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs, we are redeemed, delivered, and purified. After we have been redeemed from God&rsquo;s judgment and delivered from the bondage to the world, we must journey through the wilderness. In order for God&rsquo;s purpose to be accomplished, He charged the children of Israel to eat manna as they were journeying in the wilderness. Thus, God charged man to eat the tree of life, to eat the lamb, and to eat the manna. By eating Christ as the Lamb and as the manna, we are saved, we follow Him in the wilderness for the fulfillment of His purpose, and we become God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING IN RELATION TO THE WORSHIP OF GOD</h2>
<p>The matter of eating is also related to the temple established in the good land. If you read Deuteronomy 12 carefully, you will see that, as the children of Israel were about to enter the good land, God charged them with respect to their eating. The children of Israel were told to &ldquo;eat before the Lord&rdquo; in the place which the Lord had chosen out of all their tribes to put His name there (Deut. 12:7, 5). The eating mentioned in Deuteronomy 12, 14, 15, and 16 is related to the worship of God. In order to have the proper worship of God, we must eat. According to the natural, religious concept, worshipping God depends upon doing the right thing. This concept is wrong. In religion it is a matter of doing, but in God&rsquo;s economy it is a matter of eating. Only by eating properly can we worship God and fulfill His purpose. Therefore, when the children of Israel were about to enter the good land, God commanded them to take care of their eating. By eating they worshipped God, by eating they defeated the enemy, by eating they built the temple, and by eating they brought in the kingdom of God. For the children of Israel, eating was everything. Eating is the way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING CHRIST AS THE LAMB,<br />
THE MANNA, AND THE LAND</h2>
<p>Do you want to worship God? Then you must eat Jesus. Do you want to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose to build up His temple? Then you must eat Jesus. Do you want to defeat God&rsquo;s enemy and bring true peace to God&rsquo;s people? Then you must eat Jesus. If we want to bring in the kingdom of God, we need to eat the Lord. In the last stage of eating, the eating in the good land, all the enemies are defeated, the ground is gained, God&rsquo;s temple is built, and the kingdom of God is established.</p>
<p>The Christ we eat in this last stage must be greater than the Lamb or the manna; He must be the rich produce of the good land. Christ is a rich, spacious land, producing many kinds of food and minerals. The Lamb and the manna cannot compare with the good land. In our experience, Christ is firstly the Lamb, then the manna, and ultimately the good land. No doubt, you all are enjoying Christ. But what kind of Christ are you enjoying? Are you enjoying the Christ as the Lamb, the manna, or as the land? Some of us are enjoying Him only as the Lamb, some others also as the manna, and others even as the land.</p>
<p>Like a large family, the church should offer three diets: one for the babies, one for the strong, and one for the old ones. For the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose, we should neither be babies, nor should we be old. We need to be mature, but we should not be old. One day in the church in Anaheim I declared that there is no retirement in the church life. In the church life we have growth and maturity, but we do not have retirement. Although I am seventy-two, I think of myself as twenty-two because I daily eat the produce of the good land. In the early years I ate a great deal of Lamb and manna. Now I eat wheat, barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, and olives. I also enjoy Christ as the animal life. This is the reason I am strong with Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">NO LABOR REQUIRED FOR THE EATING OF MANNA</h2>
<p>Now we need to consider the way to eat Christ as the produce of the good land. The first thing we need to see is that the manna comes directly from God. It simply rains down from heaven. In order to have manna, there is no need to till the ground, sow the seed, or cultivate the soil. However, even in the eating of the manna, we cannot afford to be lazy. If we sleep late in the morning, we shall not be able to have manna, because it melts when the sun grows hot (Exo. 16:21). Furthermore, the manna must be gathered every day (Exo. 16:19-21). We cannot gather it one day and store it up for the next day. When the children of Israel tried to do this, they found that the manna &ldquo;bred worms, and stank&rdquo; (Exo. 16:20). Thus, we need to be diligent to rise up early every morning and collect manna for that day. Although in the wilderness God sent the manna from heaven to earth, even to the border of the camp, He did not send it into the mouths of the Israelites, or even into their tents. They had to rise up early and gather it. Nevertheless, the fact remains that they did not need to sow manna and grow it. All they had to do was gather it. Eating manna was that easy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE LAND AND AS THE SEED</h2>
<p>Eating the produce of the good land is much different from eating manna. In order to eat the produce of the good land, we must labor on the land. God has given us the land and He will send the rain, but we must work the land. The land is Christ. The seed sown into the land is also Christ. We are in Christ, and Christ is the land. The Christ who is in us is the seed, and the Christ in whom we are is the land. Without, Christ is the land; within, He is the seed. Oh, Christ is everything! Hallelujah, we are in Him, and He is in us! We cannot deny that we have both the land and the seed. We cannot deny that we are in Christ as the land; neither can we deny that Christ is in us as the seed. What we to do now is labor on the land with the seed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WORSHIPPING GOD<br />
WITH THE CHOICE PORTION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Although we may have both the land and the seed, we still need the house of God. The Lord commanded that, after the children of Israel had entered into the land, they worship Him in the place He had chosen. They were to worship Him, not by bowing down before Him, but by eating before Him the choice portion of the produce of the land (Deut. 12:7, 17-18; 14:23). God seemed to be saying to the Israelites, &ldquo;In the good land, you must worship Me in the place I have chosen by eating with Me the top portion of your produce. I do not want empty, religious worship. When you come to My chosen place to worship Me, do not come empty-handed. Come with the choice portion of the harvest. Come with wheat or barley, wine or oil, or with the firstlings of your flocks and herds. I want you to worship Me with this top portion.&rdquo; If the Israelites were to have this choice portion, they first had to have the harvest; and the only way they could have a harvest was by working the land, that is, by doing the work of farming.</p>
<p>Consider the situation of today&rsquo;s Christianity. Because most Christians are eating only the Lamb and the manna, they have no harvest. Whenever they go to a so-called church service, they go empty-handed. At most, they bring some money to put in the offering. Although they may say, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to church,&rdquo; they have no harvest of Christ to bring with them.</p>
<p>Manna cannot be the harvest that constitutes our proper worship to God. Manna is something given, not something harvested. God rains down manna from heaven, and we go out and gather it. That is not a harvest. In order to have a harvest we must labor on the good land with the seed. This means that we must labor on Christ as the good land with Christ as the good seed. Only then shall we have a harvest. Do you have a harvest of Christ? I am not referring to the Christ in whom you have believed for salvation. This is Christ as the Lamb. And I am not referring to Christ as the manna. When I speak of the harvest of Christ, I mean the Christ you have sown, the Christ on whom you have labored, and the Christ you have reaped to be your harvest. Whenever Christians gather in today&rsquo;s Christianity, they come empty-handed. They simply sit in the pews expecting their pastor to deliver a good sermon.</p>
<p>When I was young, I was a member of a certain denomination. The pastor did his best to encourage us to pray. Every Sunday morning, after his sermon, he called upon a member of the congregation to pray. Every one of the hundreds sitting in the pews listening to his sermon was afraid of being called upon. Everyone sitting in those pews was empty. None of us had anything of Christ in the spirit, in experience.</p>
<p>The worship God requires is not like this. God requires that we come to Him with a harvest of Christ. We need to come to the church meetings with the riches of Christ. In the meeting a brother may testify, &ldquo;In the last few days my neighbors have been giving me a difficult time. But, praise the Lord, by His grace I have been experiencing Christ! I came to this meeting with the very Christ I have experienced. I do have the choice portion of my harvest of Christ.&rdquo; If we are like this, we shall come to the church meetings singing, praising, and saying, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! Amen! Hallelujah! Christ is my life, Christ is my strength, Christ is my victory, Christ is my everything!&rdquo; If we are filled with the riches of Christ, we shall not be able to wait for the scheduled time of the meeting. We shall come early, eager to testify of our experience of Christ, eager to tell the brothers and sisters how rich is the Christ we have experienced. This is the worship God desires. Whenever we give a testimony about our experience of Christ, we shall be fully satisfied. By giving such a testimony we eat the solid food of the good land. How different this is from eating manna!</p>
<p>However, suppose I do not contact the Lord or fellowship with Him all week long. On Wednesday I have an argument with my wife, and she remains unhappy with me until Sunday morning. On Sunday, I ask her to go to the meeting with me, but, still offended, she tells me to go by myself. I arrive at the meeting dull, dumb, and in a pitiful condition. I sit next to a brother who is on fire, and he says, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; I force myself to respond, but there is no reality in what I say. Although many are fully nourished by the meeting, I receive no nourishment at all. Instead, I feel sick. When I return home, I am not able to eat. Then, because my situation is desperate, I begin to call on the Lord and say, &ldquo;O Lord, I repent of my sloppiness. Lord, have mercy on me. Cleanse me with Your blood. Hallelujah I am cleansed and forgiven!&rdquo; The next morning I rise up early and pray-read the Word and say, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God. Amen! Hallelujah for the beginning! Hallelujah for the Word! Hallelujah for God! Oh, in Him, the Word, is life, and life is the light of men. Hallelujah for life! Hallelujah for light!&rdquo; Daily I contact the Lord and live in the third heaven. I have a wonderful week, full of the enjoyment of Christ and the experience of Christ. By next Sunday morning, I am ready to attend the meeting with my wife. When I say, &ldquo;Dear, let us go to the meeting,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; As we are driving to the meeting, we praise the Lord in the car. We enter the meeting hall eager to share our enjoyment of Christ. As I testify of my experience of Christ, I spontaneously eat the very Christ I have experienced. This is the experience of eating Christ as the choice portion of the harvest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TOP TENTH BEING FOR THE WORSHIP OF GOD</h2>
<p>The children of Israel were forbidden to eat the top tenth of the harvest in their homes (Deut. 12:17-18). They had to keep this portion aside until they went to worship God in His chosen place at the appointed time. Then they brought to the place of God&rsquo;s choosing the top portion of their harvest. Before God and with God and one another, they enjoyed this portion of Christ. This enjoyment produces the worship God is seeking. It also constitutes the church life and establishes the kingdom. This top tenth of Christ affords us the minerals that make us stones, iron, and brass. When we have these minerals, we are qualified to build the temple, to defeat the enemy, and to bring in the kingdom.</p>
<p>In the following messages we shall see how to eat Christ as the wheat, the barley, and as the other foods in the good land; we shall also see how to mine the minerals out of the earth. In this message we have seen the general matter of laboring on Christ and experiencing Him in our daily living. The land is ours, and the seed is in our hand. We simply need to work the land and labor with the seed to grow Christ. We should not pray, &ldquo;O Father, I am hungry. Rain manna upon me.&rdquo; This kind of prayer is good for babes, but it is not good for you. If you pray like this, God will say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pray in this way. Go to work on the land with the seed. I have given you the land and the seed, but I cannot give you the harvest. You work the land, and I shall send the rain to water your work. Then you will have a harvest.&rdquo; We may enjoy ninety percent of this harvest in an ordinary way and in any place, but the top ten percent can be enjoyed only in the meetings of the church. When we bring the top tenth to the meetings and share it with others, we eat the choice portion of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">EATING CHRIST AS THE SOLID FOOD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">ALLEGORIZING THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Many Christians say that we should not allegorize the Bible. However, if we do not know how to allegorize the Bible, it will be a closed book to us, for the Bible is full of allegories. There are many allegories in the Gospel of John. Take, for example, John 1:1. This verse says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word.&rdquo; Even this Word is an allegory. Certainly Christ as the Word is not a word composed of black and white letters. That is not the meaning of John 1:1. In John 8:12 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;I am the light of the world.&rdquo; This also is an allegory. Jesus is not a light given off by the sun or by a lamp. The Gospel of John also tells us that Jesus is the Lamb of God (John 1:29). Certainly Christ is not a lamb with four feet and a tail. What nonsense it would be to say that! To say that Christ is the Lamb is to speak allegorically.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John the death of the Lord Jesus is described in an allegorical way. It is very difficult to describe a person&rsquo;s face. Not even a book of hundreds of pages could replace a photograph of a person&rsquo;s face. If you want someone to know what you look like, do not write many letters describing yourself&mdash;send him a picture. Likewise, if you want an adequate understanding of the death of Christ, consider the figures used in the Gospel of John. John uses three figures to depict the death of Christ: the Lamb, the serpent, and the grain of wheat (John 1:29; 3:14; 12:24). Although we may use thousands of words to describe the death of Christ, without these three figures we would not know the meaning of His death in an adequate way. Praise the Lord for the allegories in the Gospel of John concerning Christ&rsquo;s death. Christ died on the cross as the Lamb to redeem us. He was also crucified in the form of a serpent that He might destroy the enemy, Satan. Christ did not have the poisonous nature of the serpent; nevertheless, He was crucified in the form of a serpent. Christ also died as a grain of wheat in order to release His life. These three allegories give us a full picture of the death of Christ. They indicate that Christ died to redeem us, to destroy the enemy, and to release His life. If we did not have these three allegories, it would be very difficult to adequately understand the death of Christ. Hence, it is not right to say that we should not allegorize the Bible.</p>
<p>In this message we shall see how to eat Christ as wheat and as barley. Both wheat and barley are allegories of Christ. Christ is the real wheat and the real barley. If we would know Christ as wheat and as barley, we need to consider both the plain words in the New Testament and the pictures in the Old Testament. The New Testament says clearly that Christ is our life (Col. 3:4). But this statement is rather general. In what specific way is Christ our life? We need a picture to show us how Christ can be our life. Thus, we need the wheat and the barley to portray the meaning of Christ as our life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WHEAT, THE LIMITED JESUS IN HIS INCARNATION</h2>
<p>In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus indicated clearly that He was a grain of wheat. This verse says, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&rdquo; Wheat signifies Christ in His incarnation and crucifixion. To be incarnated means to be limited. Although in eternity Christ was the unlimited God, unlimited both in space and in time, one day He was incarnated and became limited. Oh, the unlimited God was limited in Jesus, a little carpenter from Nazareth! Although the Lord is the eternal, infinite, unlimited God, He lived as a man, limited even in the matter of time. When His brothers in the flesh encouraged Him to go into Judea, Jesus said, &ldquo;My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready&rdquo; (John 7:6). The Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have the freedom to go to Jerusalem; I am limited to stay in Galilee.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus was not only limited in time, but also in space. It is difficult to believe that the unlimited God lived in the house of a carpenter for thirty years. This is Jesus as our life, the One by whom we may live. Thus, wheat signifies the limited Jesus.</p><h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS WHEAT IN OUR LIMITATIONS</h2>
<p>We all know what it means to be limited. Married life, for example, is a limitation and a restriction. Marriage certainly places limitations on us. Although the young people may be free as the birds in the air, they experience limitations when they get married. Although you may be as free as a bird today, you will find yourself in a cage after you get married. Every wife is a cage to her husband, and every husband is a cage to his wife. Before I was married, I kept my bedroom window open at night because I enjoyed the fresh air. But my wife would close all the windows and turn the bedroom into a cage. Before I was married I had the freedom to spend as much time as I wanted reading the Bible. I could study the Bible from 7 p.m. until 2 a.m. However, after I was married, my time spent in studying the Bible in the evening was limited. At 9:30 my wife would want the lights turned out because she felt it was time to go to sleep. Although we may not always be happy in the cage of our married life, there is no escape from it. For us Christians, there is no divorce or separation. We cannot flee the cage of married life. After a period of time, some little birds are born into this cage. What a further restriction this is! As the years went by and children were born, I experienced many more limitations. I cried out to the Lord and said, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! What should I do?&rdquo; The Lord seemed to say, &ldquo;Simply be limited and restricted. Look at Me. Although I am the unlimited God, I was incarnated and limited for thirty years. I can promise you that after thirty years you will be released.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day, thirty years later, I said to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, You told me that I would be released after thirty years, but now I am more limited than ever. I have not only sons and daughters, but daughters-in-law, sons-in-law, and grandchildren. I also have the limitation of so many churches and elders. Lord, what shall I do now?&rdquo; Then the Lord said, &ldquo;Look at Me again. Although I was released after thirty years, don&rsquo;t you know that I am still being limited by you and all the other believers?&rdquo; Eventually, I saw the vision of Christ as the wheat. The very Christ who indwells me is the incarnated One. In a sense, He is still incarnated today, for the indwelling Christ is willing to be limited, caged, in us. When I saw this vision of the limited Christ, I began to worship Him, saying, &ldquo;O Lord, thank You for my wife, for all my children, for all the churches, and for all the elders. How I thank You, Lord, for my cage.&rdquo; Such a prayer causes wheat to begin to grow immediately. I can testify that I have a wheat field in my Christian life. How I thank the Lord for my wife, my children, my in-laws, my grandchildren, the churches, and the elders. All these produce the environment that enables me to grow wheat.</p>
<p>The young brothers and sisters who soar like birds in the air do not have any wheat. Whenever they come to a meeting of the church, they fly freely, but they do not have any wheat in their hand. But after they get married and experience Christ in their limitations, the limited Jesus will begin to grow in them as wheat. The brothers who take responsibility in the churches are also limited by one another. But this limitation gives Christ the opportunity to grow in them as wheat. This wheat is the incarnated Jesus growing in the midst of our limitations.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIMITATION LEADING TO CRUCIFIXION</h2>
<p>Eventually, these limitations will put us to death. Limitation always leads to crucifixion. Husbands and wives not only limit each other; they also crucify each other. Without exception, every husband crucifies his wife. If you are honest, you will admit that you have crucified your wife many times. But how good it is to be crucified! The more we are crucified, the more the wheat grows within us. The way to eat Christ as wheat is to be limited and crucified. If you are not willing to be limited and crucified, you will not have any wheat. There will be no need for you to talk about how to eat the wheat because there will not be any wheat to eat. You must grow the wheat before you can eat it. And in order to grow wheat you must be limited and crucified. Hallelujah for this limitation and crucifixion!</p>
<p>Paul said, &ldquo;For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus&rsquo; sake&rdquo; (2 Cor. 4:11). Day after day, the wives and the husbands deliver one another to death. Although your honeymoon may have been very sweet, I am sure that it did not last very long. I do not know of any honeymoon that has lasted for even thirty days. It seems that the honeymoon often becomes a &ldquo;vinegar-moon.&rdquo; Although you may tell your wife that you love her, you are ready to crucify her several days later. During the first few days of your honeymoon you may say, &ldquo;Dear, I love you.&rdquo; But after those days, you will feel like saying, &ldquo;I will nail you to the cross and put you to death.&rdquo; This kind of crucifixion does not take place once for all; it is continual. My wife has crucified me many times. Whenever I think that this crucifixion will be over once and for all, I am crucified again a few days later. This is the experience of the incarnated and crucified Jesus. When we experience Jesus as the limited One and as the crucified One, He grows in us as wheat.</p><h2 class="head1">BARLEY, THE UNLIMITED CHRIST</h2>
<p>Now we come to Christ as barley. The Bible is wonderful. If you do not know how to allegorize the Bible, you will never know the secret of the Bible. More than fifty years ago, I was taught that the Bible was inspired by God. For years I believed this doctrinally. But gradually, as I probed into the depths of the Bible, especially the allegories, I became thoroughly convinced that the Bible is indeed inspired by God.</p>
<p>Why does Deuteronomy 8:8 mention wheat first and then barley? Wheat must come before barley. After Christ was incarnated and crucified, He was resurrected. In the good land barley ripens earlier than any other grain. Because it ripens so early, it is the firstfruit of the harvest. The firstfruit is a type of the resurrected Christ (Lev. 23:10). First Corinthians 15:20 says, &ldquo;But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruit of them that slept&rdquo; (Gk.).</p>
<p>As the barley, Christ is unlimited. According to John chapter six, Christ fed more than five thousand people with five loaves of barley (vv. 9-10). And the fragments left over from these five loaves filled twelve baskets! This proves that barley is unlimited. On the one hand, we are growing the limited Jesus; on the other hand, we are growing the unlimited Christ. The riches of this Christ are unsearchable, and His power is profound. Like Paul, we can say, &ldquo;I can do all things through the One who empowers me&rdquo; (Phil. 4:13, Gk.). By this unlimited Christ I am able to bear my wife, my children, and all the elders.</p>
<p>The sisters who live by the resurrected Christ can bear their husbands and all their children. Every husband gives his wife a difficult time. Sisters, do not expect to marry an angel. Every husband is troublesome. We husbands simply do not know how to sympathize with our wives. What then shall the sisters do? They must say, &ldquo;We wives are more than conquerors because we have an unlimited Christ. The resurrected Christ is now in us, and He can bear anything.&rdquo; Learn to grow the limited Jesus and the unlimited Christ. I can testify that I have Christ as both wheat and barley. I have an abundance of both wheat and barley on which to feed and with which to feed others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">JOY, SATISFACTION, RICHES, AND FULLNESS</h2>
<p>Although the wheat and barley are the two basic items, Deuteronomy 8 also mentions other foods. Bread may be the major food on the table, but we still need some marmalade or jam to put on the bread to make it sweet. In addition to the wheat and the barley, we have vines and different fruits. Praise the Lord, we have wine to cheer us up and to make us joyful, and we have figs to satisfy us (Judg. 9:11, 13). Thus, along with the wheat and the barley, the solid food, we have wine and figs to be our joy and satisfaction. Furthermore, we have pomegranates, signifying the expression of the riches of life, and olives, signifying the fullness of the Spirit. Therefore, we have the riches of life and the fullness of the Spirit. In our field we enjoy Christ as six items: wheat, barley, vines, figs, pomegranates, and olives. With the limited Jesus and the unlimited Christ we have joy, satisfaction, the riches of life, and the fullness of the Spirit.</p>
<p>In this message we have seen some hints concerning how to eat Christ as the solid food. Firstly, we must grow Christ. Christ as our solid food is not given to us; we must grow it. Everything has been prepared for us to grow Christ. We have the land and the seed, and the rain has been promised. Now we need to grow Christ as wheat, the limited Jesus; as barley, the unlimited Christ; as wine, the joyful Christ; as figs, the satisfying Christ; as pomegranates, the rich Christ; and as olives, the Spirit in fullness. Hallelujah, we can grow Christ in all these aspects and have a bountiful harvest! After we have reaped the harvest, we must set the top portion aside, bring it to the church meeting, and share it with the Lord and with the brothers and sisters. As we share this top portion of Christ, we eat it. In this way we eat Christ as the solid food that energizes us and equips us to fight the battle, to build up the temple, and to bring in the kingdom. When we eat Christ as the solid food, we are no longer wafers; we are stones, iron, and brass for God&rsquo;s temple and for God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE HARVEST, THE CHOSEN PLACE,<br />
AND THE RELEASE OF THE SPIRIT</h1>
<p>In order to eat Christ as the solid food, as the produce of the good land, we must firstly have a harvest. The Lord has given us the land and the seed, and the rain is coming; however, He cannot give us a harvest. For this, we need to do the work of farming. Otherwise, we cannot grow Christ, and there will be no harvest. We have seen that manna comes altogether from the Lord&rsquo;s side. He gives it, and we gather it and eat it. The eating of the solid food of the good land, however, is different. Although the seed and the land have been given, and although the rain has been promised, there will be no harvest unless we work the land.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NECESSITY OF THE HARVEST</h2>
<p>It is the last stage of eating, the eating of the solid food in the good land, that constitutes the genuine worship of God. If we do not have a harvest, we not only have nothing to eat, but also nothing with which to worship our God. Both our daily living and our worship of God depend upon eating the harvest. Therefore, the harvest is crucial. We must farm the land and grow Christ so that we may have a harvest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING THE TITHE IN GOD&rsquo;S CHOSEN PLACE</h2>
<p>To have the harvest is simply to have something to eat. We do not yet have the way to eat it. Thus, after we have reaped the harvest, we must still learn how to eat the produce. According to our natural concept, once we have the harvest, we may eat it in any way, at any place, and at any time we choose. But according to the divine revelation in the Bible, there are some restrictions pertaining to the eating of the produce of the good land. Hence, we need to be very careful about this matter.</p>
<p>Some may say that because these restrictions are an Old Testament matter, they have nothing to do with us, the New Testament believers. I beg those who hold this view to change their mind. All Scripture was written for our benefit (Rom. 15:4; 1 Cor. 10:6, 11). The spiritual things concerning Christ and the church are so mysterious and abstract that, in addition to the plain words in the New Testament, God in His wisdom has given us the pictures in the Old Testament. These pictures portray the spiritual things revealed in the New Testament. The Apostle Paul allegorized the Old Testament. For instance, he allegorized the crossing of the Red Sea, the eating of the manna, and the drinking of the water that flowed from the rock (1 Cor. 10:2-4). According to Paul&rsquo;s allegorization, the crossing of the Red Sea was baptism, and both the manna and the rock were Christ. If Paul had had the opportunity, he probably would have allegorized every item in the Old Testament. In order to understand the New Testament adequately, we must consider the figures found in the Old Testament. Take the example of the golden lampstands in Revelation 1. If we would understand the significance of these lampstands, we must consider the first mention of the golden lampstand, the lampstand in Exodus 25.</p>
<p>The entire history of the children of Israel was a type. The falling away of Israel into Babylon was a type, an allegory, of the fallen church, called the great Babylon. In Revelation 17 the Roman Catholic Church is called Babylon the Great. In like manner, the regulations concerning the eating of the harvest are all allegories, types, and shadows. Hence, they are full of meaning for us today.</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 12:17 and 18 say, &ldquo;Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand: but thou must eat them before the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose.&rdquo; In these verses the Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Tell the children of Israel that, when they enter into the good land and reap the harvest, they must set aside one tenth of the harvest. They have no right to eat this in the place of their choice. At the time of the feast, they must bring this top tenth to the place I have chosen for My name and for My habitation. This will be the unique place, and they all must bring the top tenth of their produce to that place.&rdquo; If the children of Israel had eaten the top tenth of the harvest in any other place, it would have been a serious sin in the eyes of the Lord. If they had done so, it would have meant that they were doing what was right in their own eyes (Deut. 12:8). They had to learn to do what was right in the eyes of the Lord. The Lord commanded them, saying, &ldquo;Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest: but in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee&rdquo; (Deut. 12:13-14). The Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t eat the tithe in the place of your choice&mdash;eat it in the place I have chosen.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S CONCERN FOR THE UNITY OF HIS PEOPLE</h2>
<p>Eventually, the unique place chosen by the Lord was Jerusalem. No matter in what region an Israelite lived, he had to set aside the top tenth of his harvest and bring it at the set time to Jerusalem. He had no right to eat this portion at home. Although this practice may seem quite awkward to us, it was a test whether the Israelites would act according to their sight or according to God&rsquo;s sight, whether they would do things according to their choice or according to the Lord&rsquo;s choice. From God&rsquo;s point of view, the practice of bringing all the tithes to Jerusalem was very economical.</p>
<p>Perhaps you would say, &ldquo;This does not seem economical to me. It was awkward for people to travel so far with their produce. Why didn&rsquo;t God allow His people to enjoy the top tenth where they were?&rdquo; Do you think that you are wiser than God, that you are more intelligent than He? You must renounce your thoughts concerning this matter and take the word of the Bible. God&rsquo;s economy is for oneness, for unity. The children of Israel went to Jerusalem three times a year in order to be united. If there had not been this place of unity, those in the north would have said, &ldquo;It is too far to go down to Jerusalem to worship. Let us establish a center here in our territory.&rdquo; Then those in the south would have said, &ldquo;It is not convenient to go to Jerusalem. Let us have a center in our region.&rdquo; Suppose the tribe of Naphtali said, &ldquo;Let us establish our own center,&rdquo; and the tribe of Dan said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t like those in Naphtali. Let us establish our own place of worship.&rdquo; If this had been permitted, the children of Israel would have been divided. However, throughout the centuries, the children of Israel have not been divided as far as their worship is concerned. Although the nation of Israel was divided into the northern and southern kingdoms, they were still united by the unique place of worship chosen by God.</p>
<p>All the Israelites had to go to Jerusalem to worship three times a year, and they had to go not just for an overnight visit, but to dwell together for several days. Suppose two Israelites, neighbors, had trouble getting along with each other. In fact, they were enemies. Nevertheless, at the time of the feast of Passover, according to the law, they both had to go to Jerusalem to worship. Although they might travel to Jerusalem by different routes, they had to approach Mount Zion by the same pathway. Furthermore, as they were ascending Mount Zion, they had to sing Psalm 133: &ldquo;Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!&rdquo; Thus, these two brothers had to forgive each other and be reconciled. Otherwise, they would not be able to offer their sacrifices to the Lord. If they had attempted to offer their sacrifice while still at enmity with each other, the Lord would have said, as the Lord Jesus did hundreds of years later, &ldquo;Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee; leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift&rdquo; (Matt. 5:23-24). By this illustration we see that the requirement to gather in Jerusalem at the time of the appointed feasts forced the children of Israel to be one. If there had not been this regulation, these Israelites who were at enmity would never have been reconciled. The one may have said, &ldquo;If he goes to Jerusalem, then I will go to another place of worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is precisely the practice of today&rsquo;s Christianity. There is no unique place of worship, and every Christian worships according to what is right in his own eyes. Whenever a Christian is unhappy with others in a certain group, he feels free to go to another group. If after a period of time he is no longer happy with those in that group, he will look around for a third group. Perhaps, he will eventually start a meeting in his home. When after a few years those in that group are no longer happy with one another, some will start a meeting on the next street. This is the confusion of today&rsquo;s Christians. Where is the unique place of unity? There is no such thing among Christians. In fact, if you talk about it, you will be condemned as narrow-minded. Today, nearly everyone feels the right to establish a worship center as he chooses. Instead of the proper restriction and regulation there is confusion. But no man-made worship center is recognized by God. Rather, every such center is sinful in His eyes, for it is the practice of the principle of Babel. The principle of Babel is division and confusion. Babel is the origin of Babylon, and the very characteristic of Babylon is division resulting in confusion. In the eyes of God the division and confusion among Christians today is Babylon. Nevertheless, many Christians persist in talking about love and the unity of the Body. But hardly any will give up their divisions. Instead, they justify their divisions. If you rise up and tell them to forsake the divisions and eliminate the confusion, they will accuse you of being narrow-minded and of causing more divisions. What a deplorable situation!</p><h2 class="head1">THE LAWLESSNESS IN TODAY&rsquo;S CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>Consider again the Lord&rsquo;s regulation regarding coming to His chosen place to worship Him with the top tenth of the harvest. In Deuteronomy 12, 14, and 16 God said words such as, &ldquo;The place I shall choose,&rdquo; fifteen times. In Deuteronomy 12:5 He said, &ldquo;But unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come.&rdquo; Verse 11 of the same chapter says, &ldquo;Then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the Lord.&rdquo; In these verses the Lord seems to be saying, &ldquo;You must go to the place I have chosen, the place where I put My name, the place of My habitation. You have no right to offer sacrifices in the places you see. You must be regulated by Me and go to the place I have chosen.&rdquo; That place was the uniting factor. For thirty-five centuries it has kept the children of Israel one. If Christians today observed such a uniting principle, no one would dare cause division. Whether or not we liked one another, we would still have to be one. If I were a loud brother, you would have to be one with me, and if I were a quiet brother, you would also have to be one with me. You would have no choice. But where is such a regulation in Christianity today? Instead of this regulation, there is lawlessness. Because of this lawlessness, Christians cannot eat the top portion of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S FOOD</h2>
<p>Praise the Lord, this top portion is to be eaten by the people of God! But it must be brought to the uniting center, where it is honored and respected by God and enjoyed by Him. When the Israelites brought the top portion of their produce to Mount Zion, it was offered to God, and a portion of what was offered to God became His food. The expression, &ldquo;My food,&rdquo; is found in Numbers 28:2. According to the Hebrew, this verse says, &ldquo;Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, and my food for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savor unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.&rdquo; At the uniting center, both God and the Israelites enjoyed the top tenth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE POVERTY OF TODAY&rsquo;S CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>In all the years you have been a Christian, have you ever heard of such a regulation? As far as Christian meetings are concerned, all Christians today do whatever is right in their own eyes. Some do not like meetings where people say amen or praise the Lord in a loud way. Some like to have a quiet or formal service with a sermon. These dear Christians do not like to meet with other Christians who have meetings that do not fit their concept. They prefer to meet in their own way. But is Christ divided? Do we serve different Gods or have different Bibles? Are there different ways of salvation? No, there is one Christ, one God, one Bible, and one salvation. Any Christian who has seen the church, the Body, knows that the church is one. Whether some saints are noisy or speak in tongues, they are brothers in the Lord, and we must be one with them. Our attitude toward all believers should be that we care only for Christ and that we love them because Christ is in them. We should not be bothered by any who speak in tongues or who say amen in the meetings.</p>
<p>Because there is no uniting principle, no unique center for oneness, among today&rsquo;s Christians, there is no enjoyment of the top portion of Christ. For this reason, today&rsquo;s Christian meetings are very poor. Some are so pitiful that they use performances of rock music and drama in their meetings. How could the Lord be in these meetings? Furthermore, those who meet in this way do not have the Lord&rsquo;s speaking. Today in neither the United States nor Europe is there a Christian paper with a rich message. The reason for this is that Christians do not have the speaking of the Lord. They lack His speaking because they do not have the temple with the Holy of Holies. The Lord speaks only from the Holy of Holies. Who can deny that this is the actual situation of Christianity today?</p>
<p>Recently, by the Lord&rsquo;s grace, we have put out the life-studies of various books, including Genesis, John, Romans, Hebrews, and Revelation. Although some oppose the local churches, they use our materials for their own purpose. For example, a few weeks ago, a brother heard a certain radio preacher conducting a study of Revelation. One of his messages was exactly according to message eighteen in our Life-study of Revelation. Another example is that of an itinerant preacher who has written a tract opposing the local church. This preacher has reprinted some of my material. However, although he gives credit to other writers for material taken from their books, he does not give me credit for the material from my book. Furthermore, not long ago he conducted a study of Romans. One brother who is familiar with that study told me that he used the materials from my Life-study of Romans.</p>
<p>My point in relating these incidents is to show the poverty-stricken condition of Christianity. Christianity is poverty-stricken because of its division and confusion. Will God speak in a meeting where there is division and confusion? Certainly not! There is no need to say that most Christians do not have the top portion of the harvest; they do not even have the harvest. In fact, I doubt if they even have manna.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>Nothing touches the Lord&rsquo;s heart as much as the recovery of the church life. This is His recovery today. The Lord desires to recover the church life that He may have a people who have come out of every division, that He may have a place for His name and for His habitation, and that He may have the Holy of Holies in which and from which to speak to His people today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TOP TENTH ENJOYED ONLY IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>We have seen that the top tenth of the harvest had to be kept separate, brought to the unique worship center, and enjoyed there with God. However, the Israelites could enjoy the remaining ninety percent of their harvest at any time and in any place. We in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery can testify from our experience that we always have something of Christ to enjoy. Daily we are nourished and illuminated by the Word. Daily we enjoy the riches of Christ, the ninety percent of the harvest. But no matter how rich is the enjoyment of the ninety percent, it cannot compare with the enjoyment of the top ten percent. This enjoyment is found only in the church meetings. The children of Israel went to Jerusalem three times a year for the feasts. But we feast in the meetings of the church at least three times a week. I do not like to miss even one church meeting. No matter how much I enjoy the Lord at home or in other places, this enjoyment can never replace the enjoyment I have in the meetings, where we eat the top portion of Christ. Do you want to taste this top portion? Then do not stay at home, for you can never enjoy it there. Come to the church meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COMING TO THE MEETINGS FILLED WITH CHRIST</h2>
<p>Suppose, however, that no one in the church labors on Christ. When they all come together in the meetings, they will be empty-handed, without Christ. This does not mean that they do not believe in Christ. It means that they have not experienced Him. In other words, they have no wheat, barley, wine, figs, pomegranates, or olives. Although the brothers and sisters may have their Bibles and hymnals, they have no harvest of Christ in the spirit. Hence, nothing of Christ comes out of their mouth in the meeting. Instead, they sit there like a flat tire and wait for a certain brother to deliver a message. This kind of meeting is pitiful; it is a return to the old tradition of a speaker and an audience. Praise the Lord that the church in Stuttgart is not like this! So many of the saints in Stuttgart are full of Christ. They do not just have the Bible in their hand&mdash;they have Christ in their spirit. Thus, in the meetings there is an abundance of wheat, barley, and the other items of the riches of the good land. What a wonderful meeting it is when the brothers and sisters stand up one by one to testify of their experience of Christ!</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXHIBITING CHRIST<br />
THROUGH THE RELEASE OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>If the church meeting is to be living and filled with Christ, the testimonies should not drag on and on. Such slow, dragging testimonies kill the meeting. We all must do our best to release the spirit so that Christ may come forth to nourish the saints. When we do this, we enjoy the top portion of Christ. This is a very important matter. Since we all have something of Christ, let us come together to exhibit Him. When the children of Israel gathered at Mount Zion, they brought their tithes together. Although each Israelite might not have had very much, there must have been a heap of firstfruits when all the tithes were put together. Eventually, there was an exhibition of the rich produce of the good land. Likewise, we need to put our riches of Christ together and exhibit them in the meetings. In order to have such an exhibition of Christ, we must do three things: first, we must have the harvest; second, we must come to the unique place God has chosen, not to a place of division or confusion; and third, when we come to the church meetings, the unique place, we must release our spirit.</p>
<p>When you give a testimony in the meetings, do not relate your personal history in detail. The saints do not want to hear your history; they want to eat Jesus. They want to enjoy Christ out of your spirit. Long testimonies filled with details about your personal history will simply put the brothers and sisters to sleep. Two years ago in Taipei we held a conference attended by more than nine thousand people. In order to give as many as possible the opportunity to testify, the elders decided to limit each testimony to twenty seconds. Because the attendance was so large, a microphone was used for the testimonies. At the end of twenty seconds, the microphone was turned off, and the one speaking could not continue. Nearly everyone was caught. But they received an excellent training. When you testify, forget the unnecessary details. Simply say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! Christ is my life and my light. How sweet He is, and how good He is to me! This morning my wife was giving me a difficult time. But the Lord strengthened me, and now I can shout, &lsquo;Hallelujah!&rsquo;&rdquo; Testimonies like this, easily given in twenty seconds, are very nourishing. By giving this kind of testimony in the church meetings, we eat the choice portion of Christ.</p>
<p>In order to eat the top portion of Christ, we must have the harvest, we must go to the unique place, and we must exercise our spirit to testify in a quick, direct way. It is impossible to have the harvest overnight. For this, we must labor on the land. If we labor diligently, we shall eventually have a harvest. I believe that you all love the Lord and the church. Now the Lord is telling you that you must learn to grow Christ, to let Christ grow in you. If you do this, you will have a harvest of Christ to bring to the church meetings.</p>
<p>When you are in the meeting, be prepared in spirit. In some respects, functioning in the meeting of the church is like playing basketball. The members of a basketball team come to the basketball court prepared to play. Even their attire indicates that they are players, not spectators. However, many come to the church meetings dressed as spectators, not as participants. They have no intention of participating in the meeting. They are neither prepared nor equipped for this. Rather, they watch others play. Furthermore, they may be not only spectators but also critics, judging some for using poor grammar, others for being too emotional, and still others for being too sharp. Eventually such people are not happy with anything or anyone. If we come to the meeting like this, it is impossible to practice the church life.</p>
<p>We are still too much under the influence of Christianity. We need to be recovered, to be brought back to Christ. Day by day we must live in Christ, by Christ, with Christ, and for Christ. If we labor on Christ day by day, we shall certainly have a harvest of Christ to bring to the meetings.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">CAPTIVITY AND RECOVERY</h1>
<p>In order to eat Christ as the choice portion of the harvest, we need three things: the harvest, the unique place chosen by God, and the release of our spirit. We need to release our spirit so that Christ may be released. None of these three points is found in today&rsquo;s Christianity. To have a harvest means to grow Christ. When some Christians hear this, they will say, &ldquo;We never heard of such a thing as growing Christ. What does this mean? Isn&rsquo;t Christ perfect and complete? How can we grow Him?&rdquo; Throughout the centuries, Christians have not held the concept of growing Christ. The phrase, &ldquo;grow Christ,&rdquo; cannot be found in Christian writings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING CHRIST, NOT OUR LIMITATIONS</h2>
<p>I am quite concerned that you understand accurately what it means to eat Christ. In a foregoing message I shared with you how to grow Christ as wheat in the midst of limited situations. However, this does not mean that we should eat the limitations; instead, we must eat the Christ that grows in limitations. The concept of eating the limitation comes from traditional teachings. These teachings began with the book, <em>The Imitation of Christ,</em> by Thomas &#224; Kempis. Through the reading of this book many Christians have received the impression that they must suffer and bear the cross, that is, that they must eat their limitations. Many think that Christians should have long faces and wrinkled brows. Apparently the teaching that we must bear the cross and sacrifice for others is scriptural; actually it is mixed up with a natural concept. The main teaching in Hinduism is that of suffering. We have to be careful about mixing the truth of self-denial through the cross of Christ with the natural concept of the religious, ethical, or heathen teachings concerning suffering and sacrifice. Those religious and ethical teachings easily fit our natural concept. The revelation in the Bible is vastly different. According to the Bible, we need to live by Christ and with Christ. Hence, we need to allow Christ to grow in us. Instead of eating the cross, we need to eat Christ. The message on growing Christ as wheat and barley was not a word about eating the cross. It was a word about living by Christ and with Christ, a word about growing Christ in our limited situations.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING SHORT OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Just recently I was talking with a young brother about marriage. When I asked him about his experience in married life, he said, &ldquo;Before I was married, I thought I was quite patient. But married life has really exposed me, and now I see that I am not very patient at all.&rdquo; This brother was saying that married life exposed his shortage of patience. Then I replied, &ldquo;Brother, it is wrong to say that married life exposes your lack of patience. You should say that married life exposes your lack of Christ. One of the largest families in China is the Chang family. The Chang family was famous for patience. In their living rooms they were accustomed to hanging a picture showing the character for patience printed in a hundred different ways. In this way the Chang family boasted of its patience. Every member of the Chang family learned the lesson of patience. One day, a member of the Chang family was married. Before he was married, he thought he had a great deal of patience. But his married life exposed him, showing that he was actually short of patience. Brother, in saying that married life exposes your lack of patience, you are not being a Christian; you are being a member of the Chinese Chang family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many missionaries to China were not able to differentiate Christian patience from Chinese patience. Although I was born in China, I was born into Christianity, I was raised in Christianity, and I studied in Christian schools. I learned both the Chinese ethical teachings and the biblical ethical teachings. Some missionaries even told us that the ethics in the Bible were exactly the same as the ethics of Confucius. At that time, although I was unsaved and unregenerated, I was absolutely for Christianity because it was my family religion. Whenever anyone opposed Christianity, I was prepared to fight for it and defend it. At that time, I was very troubled when I read the classical Chinese writings and compared them with the Bible. It seemed that the ethics in the classical Chinese writings were excellent. I told myself that the Bible and the Chinese philosophers teach the same thing as far as ethics are concerned. When I was nineteen years of age, I was genuinely saved and thoroughly converted. I was saved to know the Lord Jesus and to live by Christ. After I was saved, I realized that there was a great difference between the teachings of the Bible and the teachings of the Chinese philosophers. The difference is that the Chinese philosophy emphasizes ethics, whereas the Bible emphasizes Christ. For His economy, God&rsquo;s concern is not ethics, but Christ. Therefore, we should not say that we are short of patience; rather, we should say that we are short of Christ.</p>
<p>In the early years we used certain expressions that were not accurate. For example, when a brother said that he could not endure living with his troublesome wife, we would say, &ldquo;Brother, you need to learn some lessons. You are short of patience and endurance. You need to learn the lesson of being broken. The reason you cannot bear living with your difficult wife is that you have not been broken. Brother, the Lord intends to break you.&rdquo; Today I regret the use of certain expressions, such as &ldquo;learning the lessons&rdquo; and &ldquo;being broken.&rdquo; We are not short of patience, endurance, and brokenness; we are short of Christ. Suppose a certain person has very little of Christ. Even if he were broken into pieces, he would still be short of Christ. Thomas &#224; Kempis taught us to bear the cross. But even if we bore the cross for thousands of miles, we still would not have Christ. We are not short of bearing the cross; we are short of Christ. It is very important to see this.</p>
<p>Consider the example of a young married brother who truly loves the Lord and seeks Him. His wife also loves the Lord. In fact, it was because they were both seeking the Lord that they fell in love and were married. However, although they both have Christ, they have not yet gained very much of Christ. Unintentionally, this brother&rsquo;s wife gives him a great deal of trouble. The brother becomes so desperate that he goes to his pastor for help. The pastor opens his Bible to Ephesians 5:25, which says, &ldquo;Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it.&rdquo; This brother&rsquo;s pastor then proceeds to tell him that he must learn the lessons of patience, endurance, and sympathizing with his wife. The brother accepts the counsel of his pastor, returns home, and tries his best to sympathize with his wife. But although he tries to be patient and to endure, he is not successful. One day this brother and his wife come into the local church. When he brings the problem of his difficult wife to one of the elders, he is told, &ldquo;Brother, after listening to you talk about your problems in your married life, I realize that you have never been broken. Brother, you need to be broken.&rdquo; The brother accepts this advice, returns home, and tries to be broken. Eventually, this also is of no avail. Finally, he goes to yet another elder and presents the problem to him. This brother, knowing the way revealed in the Scripture, says, &ldquo;Brother, you are not short of patience, endurance, or brokenness. You are short of Christ. What you need is more Christ. Are you willing to learn to breathe Christ in? You will never be able to bear your dear wife. Do not try to bear the cross&mdash;gain more of Christ. Are you willing to open up your spirit and call on the Lord? When you gain more of Christ, your problem will be solved.&rdquo; The brother gladly takes this advice and gains more of Christ. Although his wife remains the same and is difficult to live with, this brother has more of Christ. Every time his wife troubles him, he grows more Christ. And the more he grows of Christ, the greater a harvest he has of Christ. Thus, he is able to eat of Christ, not just as the manna, but as the produce of the good land. There is no need for this brother to eat his limitation or his cross. Instead, he needs to eat the Christ he has experienced.</p>
<p>Years ago, we did not see this matter very clearly. Therefore, when the brothers came to me with problems in their married life, I told them to learn the lessons of patience, endurance, and brokenness. In my experience, however, I found that these teachings did not work very well. When I realized this, I was troubled. I was like a doctor who administered a prescription that did not heal the ailment. Eventually, I discovered another dose. This dose is not patience or endurance or brokenness&mdash;it is Christ. The reason a brother is unable to bear the cross of his wife is not because he lacks patience, endurance, and brokenness; it is because he is short of Christ. From that time onward, I began to practice this myself. I tested this prescription in my own laboratory by calling on the name of the Lord. I opened my spirit and my whole being to let the Lord Jesus come into me more and more. When Christ is added to me, defeat becomes victory. This does not mean that the environment changes, nor even that I change myself. It is that more of Christ is added into my being. This is what it means to grow Christ, to allow Him to increase within.</p><h2 class="head1">ENJOYING THE CHOICE PORTION OF CHRIST<br />
IN THE UNIQUE PLACE BY RELEASING OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Christ by whom we live and with whom we live becomes our enjoyment. We eat Him and we enjoy Him. We do not eat our sufferings. I eat my Christ and bring the top portion of the Christ I have experienced to the church meetings. When I bring this Christ to the meetings, share Him with others, and offer Him to God, I enjoy Him with God and with the saints. Firstly, I came to recognize my need of the top portion of Christ. Then I began to help the saints to realize this. Eventually, this revolutionized our living. From then on we learned how to have the harvest. Secondly, I learned how to bring the top portion of the harvest to the church meetings. At the beginning, however, I did not realize the need to release my spirit. Therefore, I shared Christ in a rather dead way. I related my experience of Christ to the saints in a deadening way without the release of the spirit. When I realized what I was doing, I condemned myself and repented. After that, I came into the meeting and said, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! I don&rsquo;t need patience, endurance, or brokenness! I need Christ! And the best way to gain Him is to call on His name. O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; How refreshing this is!</p>
<p>Remember the three things necessary for eating the choice portion of Christ. First, we must have the harvest. This harvest is not a harvest of patience, endurance, lessons, suffering, or bearing the cross. We need a harvest of Christ. Day by day, we are not growing patience; we are growing Christ. We need to live by Christ and with Christ, giving Him the opportunity to grow within us. Then we shall have a harvest of Christ. Second, we must discern what is the unique place of unity. We must not go to a place of division, a place where there is neither the Lord&rsquo;s presence nor His speaking. Third, when we come to the place of unity with our harvest of Christ, we must function by releasing our spirit to share Christ with others. When we do all this, the meetings of the church will be filled with the riches of Christ. It is in this way that we enjoy the top portion of Christ. This enjoyment of Christ makes us strong and solid for the building. It will cause us to become a mountain out of which come the iron and brass needed to defeat the enemies. Hallelujah, this is God&rsquo;s economy!</p>
<h2 class="head1">IDOLATRY AND THE DEPARTING OF GOD&rsquo;S GLORY</h2>
<p>In Old Testament times the kingdom was established, and the glory of God came down and filled the temple (1 Kings 8:10-11). However, this glorious situation did not last very long. The children of Israel became degraded, and idols were placed in the temple. Ezekiel 8:9-16 reveals that the temple was filled with idols and that the elders even took the lead to worship idols. According to the New Testament, the church established at Pentecost was full of glory. However, not too long afterward, the so-called church became full of idols. Today idolatry abounds in the Roman Catholic Church. If you enter a Catholic cathedral, you will see idols all along the walls.</p>
<p>According to the book <em>The Two Babylons,</em> many heathen things were brought into Catholicism. Take the example of Christmas. December twenty-fifth, the day Christmas is celebrated, was originally the birthday of the pagan sun god. After Constantine the Great embraced Christianity, he encouraged others to be baptized. As a result, thousands of unsaved persons were baptized into Christianity. Formerly they worshipped the sun and celebrated the birth of the sun on December twenty-fifth. After they were baptized into Christianity, they maintained their heathen practice of worshipping the sun, and eventually this practice was absorbed by Christianity. They changed the name of the sun god to Jesus and claimed that December twenty-fifth was the birthday of the Lord Jesus. What an insult to the Lord! What blasphemy! Easter also has a pagan origin. Furthermore, the Catholic Church worships Mary, calling her the mother of God. Actually, the Mary in Catholicism is a heathen goddess. This heathen goddess was brought into Catholicism, and her name was changed to Mary. Now she is called the mother of God, and Catholics worship her. This is idolatry. And it is abominable in the eyes of the Lord. A number of aspects of paganism have been brought into Protestantism through Catholicism. Christmas is celebrated not only by Catholics, but by those in all the major denominations. This indicates that these denominations are involved in paganism.</p>
<p>Ezekiel 10:18 says, &ldquo;Then the glory of the Lord departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.&rdquo; Due to the idolatry in the temple, the glory of the Lord departed. When the temple was built, the glory of God filled it. But in Ezekiel chapter ten, because of the idols the glory of God departed and returned to heaven. This whole picture signifies first that on the day of Pentecost the glory of God came down and filled the church built up by the Apostles. Later, due to idolatry and paganism, the glory of God left the so-called church. Today the glory of God is not in the Catholic Church nor in any group involved with paganism. This involvement is blasphemy to God and an insult to Him. How can God dwell in such a place? It is impossible! The reason today&rsquo;s Christianity is so pitiful is that God is not there. Catholicism, Protestantism, and all other groups involved with paganism are Babylonian in the eyes of God. The Catholic Church, the mother of the prostitutes, is the great prostitute, and all the other Babylonian groups are her daughters. This is not my teaching; it is God&rsquo;s word in the Bible. Christianity may have the name of God, but the glory of God is not there. It is impossible for Him to dwell in a place filled with idolatry and paganism.</p><h2 class="head1">CARRIED AWAY TO BABYLON</h2>
<p>After God had departed and returned to heaven, the children of Israel were scattered. Some were carried away to Egypt, some to Syria, and the majority to Babylon. The temple was destroyed, and all its vessels were carried away to Babylon and placed in the temple of Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s idols. This signifies that at a certain time the entire church was destroyed by the Babylonians, who carried away the contents of the temple to Babylon and placed them in the temple of their idols. At a certain time in church history, Babylonianism came into the church, destroyed it, and carried away its contents. If you study church history, you will see that this was truly the situation. Therefore, in Revelation 17 the apostate church is called Babylon the Great, the great prostitute.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RETURN TO JERUSALEM</h2>
<p>How we thank the Lord that He never forsakes His purpose! After the seventy years of captivity, the Lord came in and told His captured people to return to Jerusalem. The Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Now is the time for you to return from your captivity. Go back to Jerusalem and build My house.&rdquo; Ezra 1:5 says, &ldquo;Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had stirred up, to go up to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem&rdquo; (Heb.). The Spirit of God was moving to stir up the spirits of the children of Israel. This indicates that the recovery, the return from captivity, is absolutely a matter of the spirit. Ezra does not say that the Spirit of God stirred up their mentality. No, he says the Spirit of God stirred up their spirit. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery does not take place in the realm of our mentality. If the children of Israel had exercised their mentality regarding the call to return to Jerusalem, they would have said, &ldquo;Many of us were born in Babylon. Our homes and our jobs are here. Surely the Lord is omnipresent. If He could be in the holy land, could He not be here with us in Babylon? Look at how spiritual Daniel was. Even here in Babylon he was able to be so spiritual and do something for God. We all have been helped by him. It is crazy to go back to Jerusalem. Those who say that we must go back are narrow-minded. God is not that narrow; He is everywhere. We don&rsquo;t want to be bothered traveling all that distance to a desolate land. We would have no houses or businesses there. What would we do when we got there? This must be Ezra&rsquo;s crazy idea. We don&rsquo;t think it is God&rsquo;s command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Likewise, if you exercise your mentality to analyze the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today, you will think that it is needless to return to the unique ground of unity. Today there are many who have performed some work for God, but none of them is willing to go back to Jerusalem. Rather, they say, &ldquo;Why should I return to the ground of unity? This is Witness Lee&rsquo;s crazy idea. Forget about it! He is too narrow-minded. God is everywhere, not just in the local church. As long as we have the Bible, preach the gospel, meet together, help others grow and seek the Lord, everything is all right. God is broad-minded. It makes no difference whether you are in the Catholic Church, the denominations, the free groups, or in your own home. God is gracious and He is everywhere. Don&rsquo;t listen to the crazy talk about returning to the ground of unity.&rdquo; Such Christians may be successful in their work, but they do not have the glory of God. Deep within, they are not satisfied. Thus, our spirit must be stirred up. Forget your troublesome mentality, turn to your spirit, and call upon the name of the Lord Jesus from deep within. If you do this, you will sense deep in your spirit that you should go to the church.</p>
<p>Hallelujah for the minority, the remnant, that returned to Jerusalem! Most of those who returned were not strong ones. Nevertheless, they went back, bringing with them the vessels of the house of the Lord, &ldquo;which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put...in the house of his gods&rdquo; (Ezra 1:7). After we come back to the church, the riches of Christ are gradually recovered. This is the return of the vessels.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LAYING THE FOUNDATION<br />
OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>After the children of Israel had returned to Jerusalem, they laid the foundation of the house of the Lord (Ezra 3:8-10). Then, according to Ezra 3:11, &ldquo;All the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the Lord, because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid.&rdquo; Verse 13 says, &ldquo;The people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.&rdquo; Some Christians today do not agree with the matter of shouting. The reason they oppose shouting is that they have not been recovered. In Babylon people weep rather than shout (Psa. 137:1). Those still in Babylon would say, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy upon me. I love You, Lord, but I&rsquo;m still in Babylon. Although I am for You, I don&rsquo;t have the temple. How pitiful!&rdquo; How could such a person shout? However, when we return to Jerusalem and lay the foundation for the temple, the foundation of the recovery, we have something worth shouting about. We must shout because we have the foundation for the rebuilding of the temple. For this reason, many times in the church meetings we became so excited that we were beside ourselves. Where else could we experience such joy? Because we are so full of joy, we can hardly control ourselves. This is why the church meetings are often noisy and full of shouting. Some may say that our meetings are too noisy and that this is altogether unscriptural. But read Ezra chapter three. The people shouted with a great shout. How can you say that shouting is not scriptural? It is more than scriptural. We have not yet shouted enough. We must shout a great deal more. Hallelujah, the foundation of the temple of the Lord has been laid!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BABYLON AND JERUSALEM</h1>
<p>In the Bible there are two lines that run parallel to each other: the line of Babylon and the line of Jerusalem. In Genesis 11 we have Babel. The Greek word Babylon is the equivalent of the Hebrew word Babel. Babylon begins in Genesis 11 and runs throughout the whole Bible until it reaches its consummation in Revelation 17 and 18. In Revelation 18 Babylon is destroyed. In the Old Testament we have Jerusalem, and in the New Testament we have the New Jerusalem. Babylon and Jerusalem are opposed to each other. If you have Babylon, you do not have Jerusalem, and if you have Jerusalem, you do not have Babylon. Eventually, Babylon will be destroyed, and the New Jerusalem will be completely built up.</p>
<p>The Bible says a great deal about Babylon. Speaking of Babylon, Revelation 18:4 says, &ldquo;Come out of her, My people, that you may not participate in her sins, and that you may not receive of her plagues.&rdquo; This strong call is related to us, for today God is calling us out of Babylon. This is a serious matter. In order to understand God&rsquo;s call to come out of Babylon, we must know what Babylon is.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DIVISION AND CONFUSION</h2>
<p>Many Christians are in Babylon and do not even realize it. They simply do not know that Babylon is here and that they are in it. Hence, I am burdened that we might be clear about Babylon. In the Bible Babylon has a double significance. The first significance of Babylon is that it is related to division which causes confusion. In the first mention of Babylon (Gen. 11), we see that Babel caused division and that out of this division came confusion. God created mankind as a corporate people to fulfill His purpose. Originally the people were one for God&rsquo;s purpose, and there was neither division nor confusion. Then Babel appeared, and it divided the people of God. Hence, there were divisions, and these divisions caused confusion. Since the time of Babel, the people created by God for the fulfillment of His purpose have been divided and are in a state of confusion.</p>
<p>The church is also a corporate people called and redeemed by God for His purpose. On the day of Pentecost the church was one. However, the church has been divided again and again, and these divisions have caused confusion. This is the situation of Christianity today. Christianity is full of divisions that result in confusion. Recently I was told that in the city of Dallas, Texas, there are more than two thousand different so-called churches. What division and confusion! This is Babylon. Some of those in the divisions have tried to argue with us, saying, &ldquo;Why do you say that we are Babylon? We are not Babylon; neither are we in Babylon.&rdquo; Whether they realize it or not, they are in Babylon. Unconsciously, they are in Babylon.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DRUGGED WITH BABYLONIANISM</h2>
<p>Let us use the illustration of eating garlic. Suppose all the people in a certain room are eating garlic. The more garlic they eat, the less sensitive they are to the odor of garlic. However, if someone who has not been eating garlic and who is accustomed to fresh air comes into the room, he will immediately detect the odor of garlic. However, if he would tell those in the garlic room that they are reeking with the odor of garlic, they would deny it, because they all have been drugged by the garlic they have eaten and are no longer sensitive to its odor. In like manner, since the fourth century, Christianity has been drugged with Babylonianism. From that time onward, Christianity has been addicted to the Babylonian drugs. Who can deny that today&rsquo;s situation is full of divisions? But there were no divisions on the day of Pentecost. Instead, there was only Christ, the Spirit, and life. There was no Baptist church, Episcopalian church, or Lutheran church. There was no Christmas, Santa Claus, or Christmas stockings. On the day of Pentecost, the atmosphere was pure, and the air was fresh. But from the time of Constantine the Great, who brought &ldquo;garlic&rdquo; into Christianity, paganism began to creep in.</p>
<p>Although I was born in Christianity, as a child I occasionally visited the Buddhist idol temples in China. In one of these temples I saw a picture of a woman with a small child. Later, I saw the same picture in a Catholic cathedral. The Catholics say that this woman is the holy mother and that the child is Jesus. But the Buddhists say that this lady is a divine woman who comes with a child for a barren woman. According to Buddhist tradition, a woman who is unable to bear children should stand before that picture, burn incense, and pray to the woman in the picture. Supposedly, the woman in the picture will later come with a child for the barren woman. When I saw the same picture in a Catholic cathedral that I had seen in a Buddhist temple, I was troubled. Years later, I read the book entitled <em>The Two Babylons.</em> The writer of this book traced the origin of this picture to Nimrod. Originally, the child in the picture was Nimrod, and the woman was both Nimrod&rsquo;s mother and his wife. How terrible! After Nimrod originated this picture, it was spread to China, India, Japan, and Egypt. This Babylonian picture was taken in by the Roman Catholic Church, which claims that it is a picture of the holy mother and the holy child Jesus. What a devilish, satanic, demonic mixture! Christianity has become Babylonian; today it is full of divisions and confusion.</p><h2 class="head1">BABYLONIAN IDOLATRY</h2>
<p>The second significance of Babylon is that it is related to idolatry. History records that in Babel, built by Nimrod and his father, names of idols were on the bricks used to build the city. Hence, that city was full of idols. The outstanding feature of Babylon was its idolatry. When Nebuchadnezzar carried away the vessels from the temple of God and brought them to Babylon, he put them into the temple of his idols (2 Chron. 36:7; Ezra 1:7).</p>
<p>The Babylon the Great unveiled in Revelation 17 is also filled with idols, with the abominations of the earth (Rev. 17:5). The Catholic Church is filled with idolatry. In order to study the Catholic Church firsthand, I visited a large cathedral in Manila. At the front entrance there was a large image, an idol of Jesus. When I said that was an idol, I was told that it was Jesus. Then I said, &ldquo;It is blasphemous to say that this idol is Jesus.&rdquo; Someone replied, &ldquo;Jesus is too abstract and mysterious. When we talk to people about Jesus, it is difficult for them to understand what we are saying. But when they see this image, it is easy for them to understand something about Jesus.&rdquo; What subtlety! That image was not Jesus! It was an idol.</p>
<p>Probably we are all familiar with the picture of Jesus that portrays Him as a handsome man. Many Catholics and Protestants have that picture in their homes. But that picture is not Jesus; it is an idol. In 1936 in China I met a young woman who was possessed by demons. Since I knew that demon possession was related to idolatry, I asked her if there was an idol in her home. She told me that she had come to believe in Jesus and that there were no idols in her house. However, I could not understand how she could believe in Jesus and have no idols in her home, yet still be possessed by demons. Hence, I asked her again about idols in her home. Eventually, she told me that at home she had that picture of Jesus and that it was her habit to worship it. I told her that her picture was an idol and that a demon was behind it. I further told her to burn that picture. Then she said, &ldquo;How can I burn the Jesus in whom I believe?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;That is not Jesus. It is an idol.&rdquo; After she burned the picture, the demon departed from her.</p>
<p>Many Christians have been in the garlic room so long they can no longer sense the odor of garlic that is all around them. Day after day, many unconsciously worship idols, actually thinking they are worshipping God. Today&rsquo;s Christianity is not only full of divisions and confusion; it is also full of idols. Furthermore, it is full of traditions. Traditions are falsehoods, and falsehoods are vanity. Falsehood is also a form of idolatry, for it is believing something that is vain. The two main aspects of Babylon are division with confusion and idolatry. If you apply these two principles to today&rsquo;s Christianity, you will see that the situation of Christianity is exactly Babylonian. Therefore, we must come out of her and return to Jerusalem, to the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">JERUSALEM, THE UNIQUE PLACE</h2>
<p>Now we must see what Jerusalem is. For the Jews in the Old Testament, Jerusalem was the unique place of worship, the uniting center. Babylon caused division, but Jerusalem maintained the unity. Today&rsquo;s Babylon is division, and today&rsquo;s Jerusalem is unity, oneness. When we come back to unity, to oneness, we come back to Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HUMAN SPIRIT, THE HABITATION OF GOD</h2>
<p>At Jerusalem, the unique center of unity, there was the temple, the habitation of God. Where is God&rsquo;s habitation today? According to Ephesians 2:22, God&rsquo;s habitation is in our spirit. In principle, our spirit is today&rsquo;s Jerusalem. The Samaritan woman said to the Lord Jesus, &ldquo;Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship&rdquo; (John 4:20). Jesus answered, &ldquo;An hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father....But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and reality...God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality&rdquo; (John 4:21, 23-24). The Lord&rsquo;s word about worshipping in spirit implies that the real Jerusalem today is our human spirit.</p>
<p>When we are in the mind, we are divided. But when we turn to our spirit, we are one. Do not talk too much about doctrine. Satan, the subtle one, always likes to raise questions regarding doctrine. In many places I visited, Satan used certain ones to ask me questions. Satan&rsquo;s strategy in doing this is to draw us out of the spirit and into the mind so that we shall argue with one another. If we exercise our minds to discuss doctrine for a period of time, we shall be divided. Suppose instead of praying and exercising our spirit, we raise questions about foot washing, head covering, and the size of the cup used at the Lord&rsquo;s table. The more we talk about such matters, the more we shall argue and fight. Eventually, as a result of arguing about doctrine, we shall be divided. But when we are in the spirit, there is no division and no idolatry. In the spirit there is simply the divine Spirit, God Himself.</p>
<p>I have been a Christian for more than fifty years. In the past, I was not able to define Babylon. But in these last years, the Lord has shown me that Babylon is division with confusion. Wherever there is division with confusion, that is Babylon. Moreover, Babylon is idolatry. Wherever there is the worship of idols, that also is Babylon. When my eyes were opened to see these things, I realized that because they are in the mind, most Christians are in Babylon. They are in divisions with confusion and, to some extent, they worship something other than God. They care for certain other things more than they care for God. In principle, this is idolatry. In like manner, for many years I did not know what today&rsquo;s Jerusalem was. Later, however, the Lord showed me that today&rsquo;s Jerusalem is the unity in our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">BABYLONIAN QUESTIONS</h2>
<p>It is one thing to see these matters; it is another thing to apply them. Suppose two genuine Christian brothers, who both have a background in religion, come together for fellowship. One asks the other what church he goes to. By asking this question he proves that he is in Babylon. Why must we ask others what church they attend? Is it not good enough that they are dear brothers in the Lord? But Christians today are constantly asking questions such as: What church do you go to? Have you been baptized by immersion or have you been sprinkled? Do you speak in tongues? What is your view concerning the rapture&mdash;pre-tribulation, post-tribulation, or partial? What about eternal security? All these questions are Babylonian. Christians have been divided again and again simply by doctrinal questions like these. We are not divided by God or by Christ. We have one Christ, one God, and one Holy Spirit. Our faith and our hope are also one (Eph. 4:4-6). But we definitely are not one in doctrine. If we talk about God and Christ, we are one. But if we talk about doctrine, we shall be divided immediately. Do not ask divisive questions. If you do, you are being Babylonian. Asking questions such as these implies that you are being divisive.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING THE SAME THING</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:10 Paul says, &ldquo;Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you.&rdquo; This word is simple, but it is very difficult to practice. All Christians should speak the same thing. But this certainly is not the practice of today&rsquo;s Christianity, for nearly everyone speaks something different. In verse 12 of the same chapter Paul says, &ldquo;Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.&rdquo; This verse is a clear example of not speaking the same thing. Those who do not speak the same thing are divisive. Look at today&rsquo;s Christianity. One says, &ldquo;I am a Presbyterian,&rdquo; another says, &ldquo;I am a Lutheran,&rdquo; and yet another says, &ldquo;I am an Episcopalian.&rdquo; But in verse 13 Paul asks this question: &ldquo;Is Christ divided?&rdquo; When we all speak the same thing, we are one. When someone asks which church you belong to, you should say, &ldquo;Brother, your question is divisive. By asking this question you are being Babylonian. Whether you realize it or not, we are for Christ, and Christ is everything to us.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIKEMINDED ACCORDING TO CHRIST</h2>
<p>In Romans 15:5 and 6 Paul says, &ldquo;Now the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus, that you may with one accord and with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; We all must be likeminded according to Christ, having one mind and one mouth. Among today&rsquo;s Christians there are numerous minds and mouths. We must not be like this. To have many minds and many mouths is to be divisive, to be Babylonian. The only way to be saved from this kind of Babylonianism is to turn to the spirit, where there is unity, and care only for Christ. Christ is everything; He is all in all.</p>
<p>However, Christ should not be a mere doctrine to us; we must experience Him and live by Him, with Him, and in Him. Christ must be the good land on which we labor day by day until we have a harvest. We need to learn how to enjoy Christ, how to eat Him, how to offer Him to God, and how to share Him with others. If we do all this, we shall be filled with Christ, infused with Christ, and saturated with Christ. The result will be that we have one mind, the mind of Christ, and one mouth, a mouth that speaks Christ. We should be those who know nothing but Christ and the church. We must live by Christ, live in Christ, live with Christ, work on Christ, grow Christ, reap Christ, harvest Christ, present Christ to God, serve Christ to others, and enjoy Christ in our homes and in the meetings. Oh, how much we need to care for Christ!</p>
<p>If we are all like this, we shall surely be likeminded. There will not be an American mind, a German mind, a Chinese mind, a male mind, or a female mind. There will just be one mind&mdash;the mind of Christ. We all shall be likeminded, not according to theology or doctrine, but according to Christ. Therefore, we shall have only one mouth, and we shall no longer ask people what church they go to. Instead, we shall ask questions such as, &ldquo;How much of Christ have you eaten today? What have you gained of Christ today?&rdquo; Learn to ask questions like this. We know nothing but Christ, we preach nothing but Christ, we teach nothing but Christ, we minister nothing but Christ, and we share nothing but Christ. We care for Christ and Christ alone. Christ is all and in all. He is the Lamb, the unleavened bread, the bitter herbs, the manna, the living water, the good land, the wheat, the barley, the wine, the figs, the pomegranates, the olives, the honey, and the milk. Christ is the mountain, the stone, and the brass. Because we care only for Christ, we have just one mind and one mouth.</p>
<p>Do not ask any more divisive, Babylonian questions. For example, to ask whether the meetings should be loud or quiet is to raise a Babylonian question. Learn to ask questions without being Babylonian. As far as loudness or quietness is concerned, you should say, &ldquo;Brother, please tell me by what way I can release Christ. Can I release Him by being noisy or by being quiet?&rdquo; This is an excellent question, and it is not Babylonian. I would answer this question in this way: &ldquo;Brother, release Christ by any means. If you can release Christ by being quiet, then be quiet. But if you need to be noisy in order to release Him, then feel free to be noisy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another question that has been asked is the question of long hair or short hair. To ask whether your hair should be long or short is to ask a Babylonian question. Those who insist on short hair will have a short-hair church, and those who insist on long hair will have a long-hair church. This will produce two new divisions, the long-hair division and the short-hair division. The question regarding the length of hair is divisive. Instead of asking a question about hair in a divisive manner, we should ask the question like this: &ldquo;Brother, by what way can I release Christ more, with long hair or with short hair?&rdquo; If you ask the question like this, you are not being Babylonian because you care only for releasing Christ. If this question were asked of me, I would say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about long hair or short hair. Forget about the length of your hair. If you can release more of Christ by having your hair long, then let your hair be long. But if you can release more of Him by having your hair short, then cut it short. The answer to the question does not depend on my opinion; it depends on the release of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another question concerns the length of sisters&rsquo; skirts. Some sisters have asked me how long their skirts should be. I replied, &ldquo;What do you mean? How long is long, and how short is short? You must go to Christ and ask Him this question. If you can gain more of Christ by wearing a long skirt, then wear a long one. If a short skirt will enable you to gain more of Christ, then wear a short one. But if wearing a short skirt will not help you to gain more of Christ, then do not wear a short skirt. The length of your skirt must not be according to my opinion; it must be according to Christ.&rdquo; Have you ever heard this kind of answer before? It is the answer according to Christ. It is not a matter of long hair or short hair, of long skirts or short skirts. It is absolutely a matter of Christ. We do not need to talk about hair or skirts. We need only to talk about Christ. Day by day, we should speak of Christ for the church. This is the kernel of the Bible.</p>
<p>Christianity has caused people to deviate from this central line of Christ and the church to matters such as foot washing, head covering, and all kinds of divisive doctrines. In today&rsquo;s Christianity there is very little talk about Christ. Rather, most of the talk concerns other things. Thus, we need to come back to the unity, to the Spirit, to Christ, and to the church. If we do this, we shall all speak the same thing, and that will be Christ and the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">BECOMING STONES FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE TWO ASPECTS OF BABYLON</h2>
<p>Revelation 17:4 says, &ldquo;And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication.&rdquo; According to this verse, the woman is gilded with gold, precious stone, and pearls, the very materials with which the New Jerusalem is built. But these materials are the gilding of this woman. Gilding is a thin covering; it is not the real thing. For example, an ornament may be gilded with gold. The ornament is not actually gold; it is simply covered with a thin layer of gold.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the woman in Revelation 17 has a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication. In the Bible abomination indicates idolatry, because idols are an abomination in the eyes of God. Fornication signifies an improper contact, an improper relationship. Although the cup is golden, signifying the nature of God, it is not filled with gold, but filled with abominations and fornication, that is, with idolatry and improper relationships.</p>
<p>Verse 5 says, &ldquo;And upon her forehead a name was written, Mystery, Babylon the Great, The Mother of the Prostitutes and the Abominations of the Earth.&rdquo; This woman, Babylon the Great, is the mother of many prostitutes. It is important that we find out who this mother is and who her daughters are. Revelation 17:16 says, &ldquo;And the ten horns which you saw and the beast, these shall hate the prostitute and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh and shall burn her utterly with fire.&rdquo; The ten horns refer to ten kings of ten kingdoms. Under the leadership of Antichrist, these ten kings will hate the prostitute, make her naked, eat her flesh, and burn her thoroughly.</p>
<p>Revelation 18:3 says, &ldquo;For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the fury of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the power of her luxury.&rdquo; This word certainly refers to religious Babylon, which has made the whole earth drunk with her wine. The words &ldquo;and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the power of her luxury&rdquo; refer to material Babylon, which makes people rich. Thus, religious Babylon causes people to be drunken, and material Babylon makes them rich in material things. The Babylon in the Old Testament was the literal Babylon, and the Babylon in the New Testament is the symbolic Babylon. Symbolic Babylon has two aspects: the religious aspect and the material aspect. According to history, there has been both a religious Babylon and a material Babylon. In the eyes of the Lord, the Roman Catholic Church is religious Babylon, and the city of Rome is material Babylon. Even Augustine said that Rome was Babylon. These two aspects of Babylon are both found in the book of Revelation. The religious aspect is found in chapter seventeen, and the material aspect, in chapter eighteen. Both are related to Rome, the one to the Roman Church, and the other to the city of Rome.</p>
<p>The word in Revelation 18:4, &ldquo;Come out of her, My people,&rdquo; refers to both religious and material Babylon. Because Babylon is about to fall, God&rsquo;s people must come out of her. Do not remain in Babylon waiting for her to fall. Come out of her now.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DAUGHTERS OF THE GREAT PROSTITUTE</h2>
<p>Now we come to the matter of the daughters of the woman, Babylon the Great, portrayed in Revelation 17. If the mother of the prostitutes is the Roman Catholic Church, then the daughters must be the religions which continue some of the Babylonian practices of Catholicism. The mother and the daughters make up a family of prostitutes. Although in this family there are the mother and the daughters, there is no husband, because fornicators do not have a proper husband. They have been involved with many men, but none of them is a husband. The mother and the daughters look alike. As the mother is, so are the daughters. We have seen that the constitution of the mother is division with confusion and idolatry; the constitution of her daughters is the same. Just as divisions issue in confusion, so idolatry issues in fornication. Four words adequately describe the mother of the prostitutes. These words are division, confusion, idolatry, and fornication.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR ONLY GOD AND HUSBAND</h2>
<p>The church is not only the people of God, but also the wife of Christ. Christ is both our God and our husband. With respect to Christ as our God, we must worship Him and Him alone. Anything we have besides Him is an idol. But with respect to the Lord as our husband, the church must not be involved with any other man. If a woman is involved with many men, she commits fornication. In the Bible idolatry and fornication are linked together. According to Numbers 25, when the Moabites induced the children of Israel to commit fornication, the Israelites fell into idolatry also. When Solomon committed fornication by taking hundreds of wives and concubines, &ldquo;his wives turned away his heart after other gods&rdquo; (1 Kings 11:4). Furthermore, the church in Thyatira, a prefigure of the Roman Catholic Church, was involved with both fornication and idolatry (Rev. 2:20). Every idol is an illegal husband. The Lord is our unique God and our only husband. Apart from Him, we must not have any other. Rather, we should be a chaste virgin espoused to our one husband (2 Cor. 11:2). To love something in place of the Lord is to practice idolatry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DENOMINATIONAL NAMES, MARKS OF FORNICATION</h2>
<p>In the eyes of God denominational names, such as Lutheran and Episcopalian, are deplorable. My wife is rightly called Mrs. Lee. However, suppose she bears a name tag that says, &ldquo;Mrs. Smith.&rdquo; Although she tells people that she is Mrs. Lee, she continues to wear this name tag wherever she goes. This surely would cause confusion. And to me, her husband, it would be a great insult. I would say to her, &ldquo;What are you doing? Are you not my wife? Since you are my wife, why do you wear the name tag saying that you are Mrs. Smith?&rdquo; Suppose she answered, &ldquo;Certainly I am your wife, and my name is Mrs. Lee. Don&rsquo;t pay any attention to this name tag. It doesn&rsquo;t mean anything. I wear it simply for the sake of convenience.&rdquo; Although we may consider denominational names a convenience, they are actually marks of fornication. Why do you bear the name of Luther? Do you belong to him? Is Luther your husband? Why do you bear the name Episcopalian or Methodist? Are these the names of your husband? A name means a great deal. Do not try to excuse yourself by saying that denominational names are some kind of convenience. This is subtle. In the eyes of the Lord every denomination commits fornication because it takes a name other than the name of Jesus Christ. In Revelation 3:8 the Lord Jesus commended the church in Philadelphia for not denying His name. But all denominations deny the Lord&rsquo;s name. At least they take another name along with His name. This is a very serious matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DESPERATE NEED FOR ENLIGHTENMENT</h2>
<p>Look at today&rsquo;s situation in Christianity. There is division, confusion, fornication, and idolatry. The daughters of the great prostitute are those involved with these things. Those who are still in division and confusion and who commit fornication are part of the daughters of the prostitute. Our age is very dark. Under the light we see things clearly, but in the darkness nothing at all can be seen. Most Christians today are in darkness. Because they are in darkness, they can be involved with division, confusion, and fornication without having any consciousness of it. Their senses have been drugged. They commit fornication without any awareness of what they are actually doing. How desperately they need to be enlightened. Today the Lord is speaking. Through His speaking, He shines upon us. In these days we all are under His enlightening. After reading this message, you will not be able to say that you are not clear about division, confusion, fornication, and idolatry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE BROTHERS</h2>
<p>In the previous message I pointed out that to ask a person what church he belongs to is to ask a divisive question. As long as you are in a division, you are in Babylon. But we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery hate division and confusion. Whenever I meet a brother, I am satisfied to discover that he is a genuine believer. Once I know that he is truly a brother in the Lord, I would never question him further to find out whether he is a Baptist, a Presbyterian, or a Methodist. To ask such a question is to be divisive. We are not divisive. We love all Christian brothers no matter whether they are Presbyterian, Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist, or Episcopalian. I am not a Methodist. If I were a Methodist, I would ask a brother whether or not he is a Methodist. If he were a Methodist, then I would love him. But we are neither Methodists, nor members of any other denomination. Rather, we are simply Christians. Instead of being divisive, we love all our brothers, including those in the Catholic Church who are truly saved.</p>
<p>We are all-inclusive, and we love all our brothers. If I were to ask a brother whether or not he speaks in tongues, it would indicate that I either oppose tongue-speaking or favor it. If I oppose speaking in tongues, I would desire to find out if others speak in tongues. If they do, I would condemn them. This is divisive. But if I favor speaking in tongues, I would also want to find out if others speak in tongues. If they do, I would love them because I am in favor of speaking in tongues. This also is divisive. We do not care whether or not a brother speaks in tongues. We care for him simply because he is a Christian brother. We are not divisive, but all-inclusive. Whenever you ask questions to find out where a brother is, you are being divisive. In the local churches we do not search out people to find out where they are. Rather, we embrace all Christians. We embrace those who speak in tongues and those who do not, those who wear long hair and those who have short hair. We embrace Presbyterians, Lutherans, and even Catholics. We receive every genuine believer. How wrong it is for any to condemn us for being narrow-minded! On the contrary, we are broad-minded.</p>
<p>After reading these messages concerning Babylon, you may be tempted to condemn others for being in Babylon. I encourage you never to do this. Do not go to your relatives and friends in the denominations and tell them that they are in Babylon. Be careful not to do this.</p><h2 class="head1">WOOD AND STONE</h2>
<p>In the building of the tabernacle there were no stones. The tabernacle was built with gold and wood. Gold signifies the nature of God, and wood denotes the humanity of Christ. Hence, the tabernacle as the dwelling place of God was built with Christ&rsquo;s divinity and humanity. The temple was built primarily of stone, but also partly of wood. Hence, it was a combination of wood and stone. Wood is also mentioned with respect to the rebuilding of the temple. Haggai 1:8 says, &ldquo;Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house.&rdquo; Although wood is mentioned in Haggai, it is not mentioned in Zechariah. In Zechariah we see the topstone (Zech. 4:7). This indicates that the rebuilding of the temple was also mainly with stone. How could there be a topstone without a foundation stone? And how could there be a topstone without a cornerstone? The buildings in the holy land were constructed in the following manner: there was a foundation stone, a cornerstone that held the walls together, and a capstone, called the topstone, that covered the building. The mention of the topstone in Zechariah 4:7 thus implies that there was a foundation stone and a cornerstone. Therefore, in the rebuilding of the temple there was more stone than wood. This is confirmed by the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 24:2. In this verse the Lord Jesus, speaking of the temple, says, &ldquo;There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s ultimate building, the New Jerusalem, will not contain any wood. It will be built of gold, pearl, and precious stone. God&rsquo;s building began with wood. Gradually stone was added. Ultimately there will be no wood; there will be nothing but stone.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FROM COTTON TO STONE</h2>
<p>We need to see how this applies to us today. When we first came together as the local church, there was hardly any stone. We came with the gold and the wood, with Christ&rsquo;s divinity and humanity. At that time the building of the church was a matter of Christ&rsquo;s divinity and humanity. The beginning of any local church is always like this. Gradually, as we grow in Christ and Christ grows in us, we become more involved with Christ and we become stronger.</p>
<p>In the past you probably were not even wood. Instead, you were a heap of cotton. Look back at the time you first came into the church life. Were you not cotton? I can still remember the day I came into the church in 1932. Without a doubt I was just a heap of cotton. I was soft, warm, nice, and kind, and everyone liked me. Gradually I changed from cotton into hard wood. Then eventually the wood was petrified through the flowing of the divine life within me. This flow carried away my wooden nature and replaced it with heavenly, divine minerals. Apparently, I am still wood; actually, I have become stone. When in my experience I was a ball of cotton, I had little to do with Christ. Christ was the gold and the wood with which the tabernacle was built, and I was a ball of cotton within the tabernacle. When you are a ball of cotton, you may love the Lord and believe in Him, but in your actual experience you have very little involvement with Him. He is He, and you are you. He is the gold and the wood, and you are a ball of cotton. Eventually, however, in the church life, you become more involved with Christ, and Christ is wrought into your being.</p>
<p>When we enter into the New Jerusalem, we shall no longer be balls of cotton or pieces of wood; we all shall be precious stones. Every precious stone is hard. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today the need is for stone. We do not cast away those who are balls of cotton. We shall certainly keep them, but keep them in the hope that they will daily and gradually change from cotton to wood and from wood to stone. Ultimately, God&rsquo;s temple, God&rsquo;s habitation, will be built with stone. The Lord Himself is the foundation stone, the cornerstone, and the topstone, and we also must be living stones (1 Pet. 2:5). In the New Testament we are told clearly that the building material for the church is not wood, hay, and stubble; it is gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO BECOME STONES</h2>
<p>I believe the Lord&rsquo;s testimony in Europe will be subjected to more tests than His testimony in the United States because Europe is the territory of the mother prostitute and her older daughters. The local churches in this territory must be strong, and every one in them must be a stone. When Peter was brought to the Lord, the Lord changed his name from Simon to Cephas, which means a stone (John 1:42). In Matthew 16 Peter received the revelation that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God, and the Lord Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Thou art a stone, and upon this rock I will build my church&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18, Gk.). Here we see that the church is built with the stone on the rock. The only way we can become stones is by enjoying Christ and eating Him. When we eat, a metabolic change takes place in our being. By eating we take food into us. Eventually, this food is digested and assimilated into our very fibers. This brings about a change, a transformation, of our being. It is not sufficient to have the doctrine of Christ. We must open our being, exercise our spirit, and take Christ into us. We should not take the doctrine of Christ into our mentality; we must take Christ as the life-giving Spirit into our being and let this Spirit be the transforming element that will change us metabolically. This is not a matter of the outward correction of our behavior, but of the inward transformation of our being. In this way we become stones. This is what the Lord desires today.</p>
<p>I am not interested in merely teaching you or edifying you. I am doing my best to minister the element of Christ into you. I do not like to pass on knowledge. Instead, I would minister the transforming Christ into you. If you take this Christ into you, you will never be the same. Each of these messages is an injection. After you have received these injections, you could not be the same even if you wanted to. Hallelujah for the injections of Christ! I have the full confidence that these heavenly injections will make us stones for the church today and ultimately for the New Jerusalem.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST IN HIS DIVINITY</h1>
<p>In the Bible God&rsquo;s building begins with the tabernacle and consummates with the New Jerusalem. In the tabernacle there were gold and wood, but no stone. Stone was used along with gold and wood in the building of the temple. Although the Bible speaks of the foundation stone of the first temple, there is no mention of the topstone until the time of the rebuilding of the temple. Zechariah speaks of the topstone (Zech. 4:7), but not of the foundation stone. Thus, it is possible to have the foundation stone without the topstone, but not to have the topstone without the foundation stone. In order to have the topstone, you must have both the foundation stone and cornerstone.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FROM WOOD TO STONE</h2>
<p>In the church, God&rsquo;s building in the New Testament, there is gold, but there is no wood. The wood has been petrified, and thus it has become stone. Furthermore, in the New Jerusalem not only will there be no wood; all the stones will be precious stones, not ordinary stones. Therefore, with the first stage of God&rsquo;s building, the tabernacle, there were gold and wood, but in the consummation, there will be gold and precious stone. When the church life began in Germany, there was very little stone; there was mostly wood. But in the church in Stuttgart today, there is not only wood, but also a certain amount of stone. In the days to come the wood will decrease, and the stone will increase. Hallelujah for the decrease of the wood and the increase of the stone!</p>
<p>The change from wood to stone comes about through the process of transformation. Formerly, a certain brother was altogether wood, but today he is sixty percent stone and just forty percent wood. After another period of time, he will be eighty percent stone and twenty percent wood. When this brother enters the New Jerusalem, he will be one hundred percent stone, and that stone will be precious stone. In addition to salvation, we need transformation. Although salvation may take place in an instant, transformation is a life-long process. I have been in this process for more than fifty-two years, and I am still in the process of being transformed. I realize that I still have some amount of wood. However, I fully expect that the wood that remains will also be petrified, changed into stone.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAMB AND THE STONE</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals that Christ is both the Lamb and the stone (John 1:29; Acts 4:10-11). It is quite common for Christians to praise the Lord and say, &ldquo;Worthy is the Lamb! Hallelujah to the Lamb! Glory to the Lamb! Praise the Lamb!&rdquo; But have you ever heard someone praise Him by saying, &ldquo;Hallelujah to the stone! Worthy is the stone! Praise the stone! Glory to the stone!&rdquo; It seems that historic Christianity does not know Christ as the stone or praise Him as such. One day the Lord Jesus said to the Pharisees who were rejecting Him, &ldquo;Did ye never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord&rsquo;s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?&rdquo; (Matt. 21:42). When the Pharisees rejected Christ, they also rejected the cornerstone. When Peter was preaching the gospel, he also spoke of Christ as the cornerstone. According to Acts 4:10 and 11, Peter said, &ldquo;Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by Him doth this man stand here before you whole. This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.&rdquo; All Christians realize that the Lord Jesus is the Savior, but very few realize that He is also the stone. He is both the crucified Lamb and the rejected stone.</p>
<p>Christian theology repeatedly emphasizes the fundamental matter of redemption. However, the theologians do not see the matter of the building, and thus they do not talk about it. Therefore, theology emphasizes Christ as the Lamb, but neglects Him as the stone. Christ is not only the Lamb for redemption; He is also the stone for the building. The building, not redemption, is the goal. Redemption is part of the process to reach the goal.</p>
<p>The fact that Christ is both the Lamb and the stone is proved by comparing Revelation 5:6 with Zechariah 3:9. Revelation 5:6 indicates that Christ is the Lamb with seven eyes, and Zechariah 3:9 indicates that He is the stone with seven eyes. Thus, the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven eyes of the stone. This proves that the Lamb is the stone and that the stone is the Lamb. Furthermore, it reveals that Christ&rsquo;s redemption is for the building. Christ is not only the Lamb to redeem us; He is also the stone for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>Regarding Christ as the stone, there are three main aspects: the foundation stone, the cornerstone, and the topstone, the capstone. At the bottom of the building, there is the foundation stone, and at the top, there is the capstone. Between the foundation and the capstone there is the cornerstone that joins the wall and supports the topstone. Thus, with the foundation, the cornerstone, and the topstone, we have the complete structure of the building. As the building stone, Christ is the bottom, the top, and the joining and supporting element. He is everything in God&rsquo;s building. Moreover, Christ is also the living stone (1 Pet. 2:4). Anything that is living grows, increases, and produces. Thus, as the stone for God&rsquo;s building, Christ is not only the foundation, the corner, and the top, but also the One who is increasing and producing. He has produced us, and now He is increasing within us to make us living stones for God&rsquo;s building (1 Pet. 2:5).</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s building everything is Christ. God&rsquo;s temple, God&rsquo;s eternal habitation, is Christ. In this building Christ is the foundation stone, the cornerstone, the topstone, and the living stone for the increase. At the bottom, at the top, on every side, and in every corner, we have Christ. Eventually, this Christ is the church. The church is the building with Christ as the foundation, the cornerstone, the topstone, the increasing wall, and ultimately as the entire building. This is the kernel of the Bible, Christ and the church.</p><h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS THE FOUNDATION STONE<br />
AND AS THE CORNERSTONE</h2>
<p>We need to experience all these aspects of Christ as the stone for God&#8217;s building. If we experience Him in these aspects, we shall have a complete building. This building is simply Christ Himself. The fact that Christ is the foundation stone is not a doctrine; it is something that we must experience. Apart from the church life, you cannot experience Christ as the foundation stone. Furthermore, outside the church life, it is impossible to experience Christ as the cornerstone, much less as the topstone. During the early days of the church life in Germany, you brothers probably did not have very much experience of Christ as the foundation stone. But after the stormy winds began to blow and attacks began to come upon the church, you realized that you cannot afford to be the church without a foundation. You had to experience Christ in such a way that you could withstand the storm and the tide. This is the experience of Christ as the foundation. Praise the Lord that in Stuttgart the foundation has been laid!</p>
<p>Gradually, after the laying of the foundation, you began to experience Christ as the cornerstone, as the One who joins the building together. It is not enough for the walls to be solid; they must also be connected. They are joined by your experience of Christ as the connecting element, that is, as the cornerstone. This is much more than a doctrine; it is a very real experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS THE TOPSTONE</h2>
<p>Although you may have Christ as the foundation stone and the cornerstone, you will eventually realize that you are still in the open air. What will protect you from the rain? You need not only a solid foundation and a strong cornerstone, but also the topstone. It is not a simple matter for Christ to be the topstone. Zechariah 3:9 reveals that the topstone has been engraved. This engraving indicates some kind of dealing. On neither the foundation stone nor on the cornerstone was there any engraving. The engraving on the topstone makes it beautiful. The beauty of the building is mainly with the topstone, and this beauty comes from the engraving, the cutting. This matter is deep and profound.</p>
<p>In relation to the building of the first temple, there was no mention of the topstone. Only at the time of the rebuilding of the temple does the Bible speak of the topstone. In fact, no other stone is mentioned. Although the rebuilt temple was small in size, its beauty surpassed that of the previous temple. In the eyes of God, the rebuilt temple was beautiful and precious. The church that was built on the day of Pentecost was rather large, but its topstone was not that beautiful. Later the church was damaged. Now, at the end of this age, the Lord is rebuilding the church. Although it is smaller in size than it was on the day of Pentecost, it has the topstone full of engraving. This engraving is the beauty of today&#8217;s recovered church. The saints in the church in Stuttgart should be encouraged, for the church in their locality has a certain amount of beauty.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A SPIRITUAL DREAM</h2>
<p>I hope that many of you will have a spiritual dream concerning God&#8217;s building. In your dream may you see the foundation stone, the cornerstone, and the topstone with its beautiful engraving. Today, in the rebuilt church, we have the topstone with its engraving. When I speak of having a spiritual dream, I am not talking nonsense. According to the book of Genesis, Joseph had two such dreams (Gen. 37:5-9). In the first dream, the other sheaves bowed down to his sheaf. In the second, the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars made obeisance to him. Joseph had these dreams long before he began to reign in Egypt. Likewise, before we can have the genuine church life, we need to have some dreams. Day and night may you dream of the foundation stone, the cornerstone, and the topstone. Eventually, your dreams will be fulfilled.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR A BIRD&#8217;S-EYE VIEW</h2>
<p>Up to this point, we have seen a bird&#8217;s-eye view of the Old Testament. In principle, we should come to know the Bible in the same way as we acquaint ourselves with a city. We should first see a general sketch and then become familiar with the main streets. If, instead of seeing a general sketch of the city, you begin by learning all the small streets, lanes, and alleys, you will get lost and never come to know the city as a whole. Likewise, if you try to know the Bible by firstly studying it verse by verse, you will get lost. You will not even be able to find your way through the first chapter of Genesis. For example, Genesis 1:2 speaks about darkness being upon the face of the deep. You may wonder what the darkness is and then what the deep is. In your attempt to find out, you may consult a concordance and, after that, a Bible dictionary. If you go through the Bible this way, it will take a long time to complete even the first several verses of the first chapter of Genesis. If you take this way, you will never come to know the Bible. The way to know the Bible is to first have a bird&#8217;s-eye view and see the kernel of the Bible, which is Christ and the church. In the first three chapters of Genesis, we have Christ, and in the remaining forty-seven chapters, we see the church. In Exodus we have the tabernacle; in 1 Kings, the temple; and in Ezra, Haggai, and Zechariah, the rebuilt temple. This is a bird&#8217;s-eye view of the Old Testament.</p><h2 class="head1">WHO CHRIST IS AND WHAT CHRIST IS</h2>
<p>We come now to the New Testament. The first thing we must do is to find out who Christ is and what Christ is. Does it sound rather strange to speak of what Christ is? Because Christ is so wonderful and all-inclusive, we must know not only who He is, but also what He is. When we say that Christ is God and man, we are speaking of who Christ is. But when we say that Christ is the light and the door, we are speaking of what Christ is. In this message we need to see who Christ is in His divinity. In the following message, we shall see who Christ is in His humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD</h2>
<p>Regarding who Christ is in His divinity, there are seven items. First, Christ is God. Certain so-called Christians do not believe that Christ is God. Among them are the Children of God and the modernists. Approximately twenty-five years ago a certain group of so-called Christians in Manila who did not believe that Christ was God sent four representatives to visit me. Two were medical doctors, one was an attorney, and one was an accountant. They came to see me with the intention of proving that Christ was not God. I referred them to John 1:1, which says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God,&rdquo; and to John 1:14, which says, &ldquo;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout the centuries, there have been many debates concerning the Person of Christ, especially concerning His divinity. Some who denied that Jesus was God argued that Christ was a good man who was made God after His resurrection. This is heresy. The Bible says that in the beginning, that is, in eternity past, our Christ was God. He is nothing less than God Himself. Although Christ is God, this does not mean that we have two Gods. We have one God, the unique God. Christ is our unique God. The unbelieving Jews in their stubbornness do not believe that Christ is God. If they believed this, they would be converted. Although the unbelieving Jews refuse to admit that Christ is God, we believe that He is God because the Bible says so. Romans 9:5 says, &ldquo;Christ, Who is over all, God blessed forever.&rdquo; Our Christ is the very God who is over all.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CREATOR</h2>
<p>Second, Christ is the Creator. Hebrews 1:10 says, &ldquo;You in the beginning, Lord, have founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands.&rdquo; The very God our Creator, the One who created heaven and earth, is Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD</h2>
<p>Third, Christ is the Lord. Heaven and earth belong to Him. We also belong to Him. Everything has an owner, a possessor. The owner of the universe is Jesus the Lord. He owns the heavens, He owns the earth, and He owns you and me. If you do not believe in Jesus, then you are a person without an owner. How pitiful that would be! Anyone who does not have an owner has no care and protection. If you do not believe in Jesus, you do not have the Lord as your owner. Your parents are not your owner; neither is your husband, or wife. The Lord Jesus must become your owner. If you receive Him, He will become your owner. You will become His possession, and He will take care of you. How good it is to have One to possess us!</p>
<p>Consider the example of my watch. If my watch had no owner, it would have no care or protection. Because I own my watch, I take good care of it. If it is not in its proper place, I do not have the peace to sleep at night. If I take such care of my little watch, how much more does the Lord take care of those whom He possesses. Who is taking care of you? If you do not have Jesus, you do not have a Lord, and you do not belong to anyone. How thankful I am that I have Jesus! He is my Lord, and He is taking care of me.</p>
<h2 class="head1">JEHOVAH</h2>
<p>Fourth, Christ is Jehovah, the everlasting One. From eternity to eternity, He is Jehovah. The name Jehovah means He who was, He who is, and He who will be. The name Jehovah is included in the name Jesus, which means Jehovah the Savior.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FATHER</h2>
<p>Fifth, Christ as the Son is the Father. Those who hold to the traditional teachings are troubled when we say that Christ the Son is the Father. However, I do not care for tradition or for history; I care only for the pure word in the Bible. Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given...and his name shall be called...The mighty God, The everlasting Father.&rdquo; In this verse we see the child and the Son. The child is born to us, and the Son is given to us. As we all know, the child was Jesus born in the manger at Bethlehem, and the Son is the Son of God given to us. The child born in the manger is called the mighty God, and the Son is called the everlasting Father. This certainly indicates that the Son is the Father. But according to traditional teachings, it is heresy to say that the Son is the Father. Thus, because I quote Isaiah 9:6, pointing out that the Son is called the everlasting Father, I have been accused of teaching heresy. Some of the critics may say, &ldquo;The Son is the Son, and the Father is the Father. How can you say that the Son is the Father? To say this is heretical.&rdquo; Nevertheless, I do not care for tradition or for man&rsquo;s teaching; I care only for the Bible, for Isaiah 9:6. Is the Father not spoken of in Isaiah 9:6? Certainly He is. Is the Father in this verse different from the holy Father in the Godhead? If you say that the Father in Isaiah 9:6 is different from the Father in the Godhead, then you have two divine Fathers, and you yourself are heretical. In your mentality you may still cling to the concept that the Son is the Son, that the Father is the Father, and that we should not say that the Son is the Father. If you claim that it is wrong to say that the Son is the Father, then you do not fully believe Isaiah 9:6.</p>
<p>Recently, in their writings, the opposers have said, &ldquo;We must follow the historic church. Throughout the centuries, the church has always said that the Son is the Son and that the Father is the Father. To say something else is to deviate from the historic church. The local churches and Witness Lee have deviated from the teaching of the historic church.&rdquo; However, we are not the first to deviate from the historic church. What about Martin Luther? In his time the church did not believe in justification by faith. When Luther saw the matter of justification by faith in the Scriptures, he turned from the historic church. If he had not deviated from the historic church, there would not have been any recovery. Without that deviation, how could there have been the reformation? Every time the Lord recovers a certain matter, that recovery is a deviation from the historic church.</p>
<p>Those who say that the historic church has never taught that the Son is the Father are the ones who hold on to the creed formulated at the Council of Nicaea. They say, &ldquo;The Nicene creed does not teach that the Son is the Father.&rdquo; This reminds me of a proverb which says, &ldquo;If your shoes are smaller than your feet, will you buy a new pair of shoes, or will you cut your feet to fit your shoes?&rdquo; If your feet are too big for your shoes, you should not cut your feet to match your shoes; you should buy a new pair of shoes. But today&rsquo;s opposers are trying to cut their feet to match their shoes. What they have is a short, narrow creed, a creed that is shorter and narrower than the Bible. However, unwilling to throw away their creed, they prefer to cut the Bible to fit their creed. Because I keep the whole Bible, I have been condemned. Do you believe the whole Bible, including Isaiah 9:6? Do you believe what Isaiah 9:6 says regarding the name of the Son being called the everlasting Father? If you do not, it means that you are cutting the Bible to fit your creed. I advise you to throw away those small shoes and buy a larger pair. Do not suffer by trying to cut your feet to match your shoes. Today those who follow the traditional teachings are cutting the Bible. Nevertheless, we praise the Lord for Isaiah 9:6. The child is the mighty God, and the Son is the eternal Father. Our Christ is God, the Creator, the Lord, Jehovah, and the eternal Father.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SON</h2>
<p>Sixth, Christ is the Son. There is no argument about this. As the Son, Christ is the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15). Moreover, all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily (Col. 2:9). As the Son, He is the embodiment and expression of the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Seventh, Christ is the life-giving Spirit. First Corinthians 15:45 says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit&rdquo; (Gk.). No creed is large enough to contain Isaiah 9:6 and 1 Corinthians 15:45. Who is the life-giving Spirit spoken of in 1 Corinthians 15:45? Without doubt, it is the Holy Spirit. Christ, the last Adam, became this life-giving Spirit. Is this life-giving Spirit different from the Spirit in the Godhead? Certainly not. If you say that this life-giving Spirit is different from the Spirit in the Godhead, then you are heretical, because you have two life-giving Spirits. Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;Now the Lord is that Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord here is Jesus. Hence, Jesus is the Spirit.</p>
<p>Some Christians may say, &ldquo;If the Son is the Father and the Lord is the Spirit, then are They one or three?&rdquo; The answer is that They are both one and three. Although I cannot explain this, I do know that They are both one and three because the Bible tells us so. In this matter, we should all adopt the attitude taken by Martin Luther, who said:</p>
<p>Those who neglect the Scripture and approach such questions [as the Trinity] with confidence in their own mental power are the teachers of God, not His pupils....If reason disturbs you here and questions arise like those of the Turks: Are there, then, two gods? Answer: There is only one God, and still there is the Father and the Son. How is this possible? Respond with humility: I do not know.</p>
<p>The Trinity is a mystery. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are both one and three. We do not know how this can be, and we should not try to know. To do so means that you intend to be God&rsquo;s teacher. Because the Trinity is a mystery, no one can understand it adequately. All we can do is simply believe it according to the Bible. The Bible says that there is one God, and we say, &ldquo;Hallelujah, there is one God!&rdquo; The Bible says that this God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and we say, &ldquo;Hallelujah, our God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.&rdquo; Furthermore, the Bible also says that the Son is called the Father and that the Lord is the Spirit. To this, we should also say, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this message we have seen seven matters relating to Christ&rsquo;s divinity. We have seen that Christ is God, the Creator, the Lord, Jehovah, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Now I would ask you this question: How many do you have in your experience? Do you first have God and then the Creator, the Lord, Jehovah, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit? No, in experience we do not have seven; we have one. In our experience God is the Creator, the Creator is the Lord, the Lord is Jehovah, Jehovah is the Father, the Son is called the Father, and the Son is also the Spirit. Hallelujah, we have such an all-inclusive One! If you exercise your mentality over this matter, you will say that you have seven, because your mentality has been saturated and permeated with the traditional teachings. According to this mentality, you first have God the Father, then you have the Son, and the Spirit. To you, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three Gods. You dare not say this, but deep within, unconsciously or subconsciously, you hold such a concept. The reason many hold this concept is that they have taken in too much of the garlic of traditional doctrine. They do not have the fresh air of the pure Word of the Bible. According to the pure Word of the Bible, our God is Triune: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Moreover, the pure Word reveals that the Son is called the Father and that the Lord is the Spirit. Thus, we do not have three Gods; we have just one God. Our Christ is all-inclusive. If we have Him, we have God, the Creator, the Lord, Jehovah, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. All that the divine Being is, we have in Christ. This Christ has become our Savior, our life, and our everything. By eating this Christ and enjoying Him, we become the material for the building of God&rsquo;s house.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST IN HIS HUMANITY</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEANING OF RECOVERY</h2>
<p>We are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Because we are in His recovery, we must know what the word recovery means. To be recovered is to be brought back by the Lord to the beginning. At the beginning, there was the Lord Himself and the pure, living Word. Christianity, however, has deviated both from the Lord and from the living Word and has become a religion of doctrine. In Christianity there is very little of the Lord Himself. Most Christians have the Lord Jesus only as their Redeemer and Savior; they do not have Christ as their everything. Some have Christ in name, and others have Christ in doctrine; however, they do not have Christ in His all-inclusiveness and the complete, pure, living Word. Instead, they have the so-called creeds that cover only certain parts of the Bible. We in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery do not care for creeds; we care only to follow the whole Bible. No matter how good or how accurate a creed may be, it can never contain the entire Scripture. If you devote your attention to creeds rather than to the Bible, you will certainly be lacking something.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, we saw that we had to come back to the beginning, to the Lord Himself and not to any kind of religion, including the religion of Christianity. Furthermore, we saw that we had to return to the whole Bible, not just to part of it. For this reason, we have never followed anything blindly. Anything we observed in Christianity, we brought to the Lord, and we prayed about it. Then we considered it in the light of the Bible to see whether or not it corresponded to the Scriptures. We studied everything carefully and thoroughly according to the pure, complete, living Word of the Bible.</p>
<p>At the time of Martin Luther, the majority of the so-called Christians in the historic church had lost the Lord Himself and had been deprived of the Bible. Therefore, the Lord raised up Martin Luther and brought him back to Himself and to the Scriptures. In the Bible Luther saw the matter of justification by faith, which was absolutely a contrast to the teaching of Catholicism. Luther fought for justification by faith, the battle was won, and justification by faith was firmly established.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST<br />
AND THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>However, that was just the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. What about the practice of the church life? More than four hundred years have passed since the time of Martin Luther. Although justification by faith was recovered long ago, the church life has not yet been fully recovered. The reason for this is that the church life comes out of the experience of Christ. It does not take much experience to be justified by faith. As long as we believe in Jesus Christ, we are justified. But to have the church life, we need the experience of Christ. The eating of the manna signifies the experience of Christ. As we have seen, the tabernacle comes out of the eating of the manna, that is, out of the experience of Christ. Likewise, the temple issues out of the enjoyment of the rich produce of the good land. This strongly indicates that the experience of Christ issues in the church life.</p>
<p>The reason the church life has not been practiced throughout the centuries is that Christians have had mainly the doctrine of Christ; they have had very little of the experience of Christ. Whenever we experience Christ, we spontaneously have the desire for the church life. If you enjoy and experience Christ in the morning, you will desire to meet with other Christians in the evening. The enjoyment of Christ will bring you to the church life. When I speak of the experience of Christ, I refer to the eating of Christ, the enjoyment of Christ as our food and our life supply, the partaking of Christ as our daily enjoyment. Everyone who enjoys Christ and eats Him desires to attend the meetings of the church. Whenever I experience Christ, this experience encourages me and even inwardly compels me to seek the church life.</p>
<p>Many Christians have no interest in the church life because they have merely a mental doctrine of the three Persons of the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Although they hold to their doctrine, they have no experience of the Triune God. To them, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are very remote. While some of them hold the Triune God as a doctrine, they continue to go to movies, to drink, and to dance. Apparently, their doctrine has no effect on their living. But when they hear of someone speaking of the Son and the Spirit in a way that differs from their concept, they rise up to defend the traditional teaching of the Trinity. What a pitiful situation! We, on the contrary, want to have a Father whom we can experience, a Son who is our life supply and daily enjoyment, and a Spirit who transforms us and changes our entire being. If we have merely the doctrine of the Trinity, we shall not sense our need for the church life. But if we experience the Triune God, we shall immediately become aware of our need for the church life.</p>
<p>We in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are burdened for the practice of the church life. We are not in tradition and we do not care for tradition. We care for the living Lord and the living Word. In the living Word, we see the all-inclusive Christ. The all-inclusive Christ is not for doctrine. He is for our enjoyment so that we can have the proper church life. Therefore, for the sake of the church life, we need to see who Christ is and what Christ is.</p><h2 class="head1">HAVING THE FATHER BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE SON</h2>
<p>In the foregoing message, we saw seven matters relating to Christ&rsquo;s divinity. We saw that Christ is God, the Creator, the Lord, Jehovah, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. If we have the Son we also have the Father. First John 2:23 says, &ldquo;Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: but he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.&rdquo; If the Son were not the Father, how could I have the Father by acknowledging the Son? Thus 1 John 2:23 proves that, in experience, the Son is the Father.</p>
<p>One day, as the Lord Jesus was speaking about the Father, Philip said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us&rdquo; (John 14:8). Philip seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Lord, we surely desire to see the Father. If You show us the Father, we&rsquo;ll be satisfied.&rdquo; Philip&rsquo;s question troubled the Lord Jesus, and He said to him, &ldquo;Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father. How is it that you say, Show us the Father?&rdquo; (John 14:9). The Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Philip, what are you talking about? You ask Me to show you the Father. You have been seeing Me for more than three years. Don&rsquo;t you know that I am one with the Father? When you see Me, you see Him.&rdquo; When we see the Son, we see the Father. How foolish it is to be so doctrinal! Whenever we acknowledge the Son, we have the Father. This is our experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CALLING ON THE LORD AND RECEIVING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>According to our experience we also know that whenever we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we receive the Spirit. Although we call on the name of Jesus, it is the Spirit who comes. We do not call on the Holy Spirit; we call on Jesus. Why does the Spirit come when we call on Jesus? It is because Jesus is the Spirit. Whenever I call a particular brother by name, that brother himself comes. This illustrates the fact that when we call the name, we get the person. Likewise, the more we call on the name of Jesus, the more the Spirit comes. Jesus is the name, and the Spirit is the Person. When I call on the name of Jesus, the Person of the Spirit comes. This is not doctrine; it is our experience. Whenever I call on the name of the Lord Jesus for several minutes, I am filled and set on fire with the Spirit. How wonderful the Lord Jesus is! He is everything!</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS MAN</h2>
<p>Now we must see who Christ is according to His humanity. Christ is not only God, but also man. First Timothy 2:5 speaks of &ldquo;the man Christ Jesus.&rdquo; How can Christ be both God and man at the same time? The Bible reveals that He is God and man. Do you believe this? Can you comprehend it in full? Of course not. There is a vast difference between God and man! God is God, and man is man. Nevertheless, Christ is both God and man. Whenever you are asked to explain this, you should say, &ldquo;I cannot explain it in full, but I do know that the Bible says that Christ is both God and man.&rdquo; Christ is too wonderful to be explained. Nothing that we can explain is wonderful. Christ, who is both God and man, is unexplainable and wonderful.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEED OF WOMAN</h2>
<p>In His humanity Christ is the seed of woman (Gen. 3:15). Galatians 4:4 says, &ldquo;But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman&rdquo; (Gk.). Although Christ is a man, He is still different from us. We were born of a human father, but Christ was not. He was born of woman. On the one hand, He had to have the human nature; on the other hand, He could not have the sinful nature. If He had been born of a human father, He would have had not only the human nature, but also the sinful nature. Therefore, Jesus was born of a woman that He might have a sinless human nature. Although He was a genuine man, He did not have our sinful nature. As the seed of the woman, He was born of the woman without having a sinful nature. Hallelujah for Christ&rsquo;s sinless human nature!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEED OF ABRAHAM</h2>
<p>Galatians 3:16 indicates that Christ is the seed of Abraham. As the seed of Abraham, He inherits everything from God as a blessing to bestow upon His believers. In Him as the seed of Abraham we enjoy all the blessings God promised to Abraham.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEED OF DAVID</h2>
<p>Christ is the seed of David, the son of David (Matt. 1:1). As the son of David, He inherits the kingship and the kingdom.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SECOND MAN</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:47 says, &ldquo;The second man is the Lord from heaven.&rdquo; Here we see that Christ is the second man. In the eyes of God there are just two men: the first man, Adam, and the second man, Christ. There is no third man. As a man, Christ came to be the second man so that there could be a new start. The first man was rejected by God, but the second man is acceptable to Him. Although we were born into the first man, we have been reborn into the second man. Naturally, we were born in Adam, but spiritually we were reborn in Christ. Hallelujah, we are no longer in Adam, the first man, but in Christ, the second man!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAST ADAM</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:45 says that Christ is &ldquo;the last Adam.&rdquo; This means that He is the last One and that no one succeeds Him. He is not only the second man, but also the last Adam. After the second man it may seem that there could be a third man or a fourth man. But because Christ is also the last Adam, we know that no one will come after Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SAVIOR</h2>
<p>Christ is also our Savior. According to John 4:42, He is spoken of as &ldquo;the Savior of the world.&rdquo; Our Savior is a man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">JESUS</h2>
<p>Christ is also a man by the name of Jesus (Matt. 1:21). He was a Nazarene, and He grew up in the home of a carpenter (Matt. 2:23; 13:55). When He was full-grown, He Himself also worked as a carpenter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRIST</h2>
<p>Christ is also the Christ, God&rsquo;s anointed One. As Jesus, He is our Savior, and as Christ, God&rsquo;s anointed One, He accomplishes God&rsquo;s purpose. He is both Jesus and the Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD</h2>
<p>The man Jesus is also the Lord (Acts 2:36). Many Christians are not clear concerning the two aspects of Christ as the Lord. Because Christ is God, the Creator, He was the Lord before He came as a man. One day, He was born as a man named Jesus. How could this man, a Nazarene, be the Lord? Acts 2:36 says that after Jesus was resurrected and ascended, God made Him the Lord. As God, Christ was the Lord already; but as a man He still needed to be made the Lord. Thus, after Jesus ascended into the heavens, God appointed Him to be the Lord. Now the Lord is not only God, but also a man, the man Jesus. Peter&rsquo;s word in Acts 2:36 was spoken to the opposing Jews, the very ones who had crucified Jesus on the cross. Although they had crucified Him, God resurrected Him from the dead, placed Him on the throne, and proclaimed to the whole universe that He, the man Jesus, is the Lord. Today a man is on the throne to be the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPHET</h2>
<p>Acts 3:22 reveals that Christ is a Prophet, One who speaks for God. This was typified by Moses, who spoke to the children of Israel for God (Deut. 18:15, 18). Christ spoke to His disciples for God when He was on earth. Today He still speaks within us for God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLE</h2>
<p>Christ is also the Apostle. Hebrews 3:1 tells us to consider Jesus the Apostle. As the Apostle, Christ was the One sent by God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRIEST</h2>
<p>Hebrews 3:1 also indicates that Christ is the Priest. As the Apostle, Christ comes from God to us, and as the Priest, He goes from us to God. Hallelujah, Christ is both the coming One and the going One! He comes with God to us, and He goes with us to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KING</h2>
<p>Christ is also the King, even the King of kings (Rev. 17:14). Thus, Christ is the Prophet, the Apostle, the Priest, and the King. This should not merely be doctrine; every item must be our experience. Have you ever experienced Christ as your Prophet, Apostle, Priest, and King?</p><h2 class="head1">THE CAPTAIN OF SALVATION</h2>
<p>Hebrews 2:10 reveals that Christ is the Captain of our salvation. Many Christians have no experience of Christ as their Captain. Hence, we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery need to experience Him in this aspect. Christ is not only our Savior; He is our Captain, and we are His army. As our Captain, He has taken the lead to fight on, and now we must follow Him in fighting the battle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEDIATOR OF A BETTER COVENANT</h2>
<p>Hebrews 8:6 says that Christ is &ldquo;the Mediator of a better covenant.&rdquo; As the Mediator, Christ is the Executor in resurrection of the new covenant, the new testament, which He bequeathed to us by His death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SURETY</h2>
<p>Christ is also the Surety, the Guarantor, of the new covenant (Heb. 7:22). He is not only the Guarantor; He is also the guarantee insuring the new testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FORERUNNER</h2>
<p>Hebrews 6:20 describes Christ as the Forerunner, the One who has cut the way into glory. We are all running in God&rsquo;s race, and the man Jesus Christ is our Forerunner in this race. He has run the race and He has entered the veil, where He is now waiting for us. We need to experience Christ as the Forerunner and follow Him to run the race.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINISTER OF THE TRUE TABERNACLE</h2>
<p>In Hebrews 8:2 we see that Christ is the Minister of the true tabernacle, the heavenly tabernacle. As such a Minister, He ministers heaven (which is not only a place, but also a condition of life) into us, that we may have the heavenly life and the power to live a heavenly life on earth as He did while He was here. This matter is deep.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SHEPHERD</h2>
<p>Christ is also the Shepherd (Heb. 13:20), the chief Shepherd (1 Pet. 5:4). Christ with all the foregoing qualifications is our Shepherd today, taking care of God&rsquo;s flock, which is the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FAITHFUL WITNESS</h2>
<p>Christ is also the faithful Witness, the One who testifies God (Rev. 1:5). He is the living and faithful Witness of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE AUTHOR OF FAITH</h2>
<p>Hebrews 12:2 says that Christ is the Author of our faith. This means that He is the Originator, the Inaugurator, the source, and the cause of faith. Although according to our natural man, we have no faith, He Himself is our faith. Hence, we live by His faith, by Him as our faith (Gal. 2:20).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PERFECTER OF FAITH</h2>
<p>Hebrews 12:2 also reveals that Christ is the Perfecter of faith. This means that He is the Finisher, the Completer, of faith. He will finish what He has originated. He will complete what He has inaugurated.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BRIDEGROOM</h2>
<p>Christ is also the Bridegroom (John 3:29). When He comes back, He will judge the earth and receive us as the Bride. Hence, in order for Him to come back, He must be the Bridegroom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING CHRIST IN HIS HUMANITY</h2>
<p>We need to experience all these aspects of Christ. In the past, we knew Christ mainly as our Savior and, doctrinally, as the Son of God. We had very little experience of Him. But today, for the sake of the church life, we need to experience Him in His humanity. Have you ever experienced Christ as the Prophet speaking for God within you? To read the Bible without Christ is not real or living. We must have Christ as God&rsquo;s Prophet speaking within us. Perhaps in the past you did not have Christ as the One speaking in you. At that time, your Christ seemed far away. But I can testify that my Christ is constantly speaking in me and to me. He is my Prophet.</p>
<p>Christ is not only God, but also a man, and His humanity must be our experience. We should not try to imitate Him. Instead, we should daily enjoy Him in His humanity. Because Christ as a man is in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), we may experience Him by turning to our spirit. Hallelujah, Christ is with our spirit! The more we experience Him in His humanity, the more His humanity will become our food to nourish us. Eventually, this food will transform us and uplift our humanity.</p>
<p>Do not take the aspects of Christ covered in this message merely as doctrine. Rather, consider them as reminders to experience Christ. How good it is to experience Christ in His divinity as God, the Creator, the Lord, Jehovah, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. At the same time, it is very good to experience Him in His humanity as man, the seed of woman, the seed of Abraham, the seed of David, the second man, the last Adam, the Savior, Jesus, the Christ, the Lord, the Prophet, the Apostle, the Priest, the King, the Captain of salvation, the Mediator, the Surety, the Forerunner, the Minister, the Shepherd, the faithful Witness, and the Author and Perfecter of faith, and the Bridegroom. The more we enjoy Him in all His riches, the more we shall be brought into the church life. As we enjoy Christ and experience Him in all these aspects, we are constituted into the church life. The church is not an organization; it is a constitution of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. This is the kernel of the Bible.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">ASPECTS OF WHAT CHRIST IS</h1>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s person is wonderful, profound, and mysterious. His Person has two aspects, the divine aspect and the human aspect. In theology the study of Christ&rsquo;s Person is known as Christology. Since the second century, Christian teachers have argued concerning the Person of Christ. Due to the different teachings and opinions, the argument regarding the Person of Christ has gone on and on, even until today. Therefore, we must be on the alert. If we follow a teaching regarding Christ&rsquo;s Person that is not according to the Bible, we shall be in difficulty. Do not be influenced by any teaching concerning Christ&rsquo;s Person that is not according to the Scriptures.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPOSSIBILITY<br />
OF UNDERSTANDING CHRIST FULLY</h2>
<p>I beg you to come back to the Bible and not try to analyze Christ or to understand Him according to your mentality. We simply cannot understand Him fully. In fact, we cannot even understand ourselves. Can you tell me where your mind is located? Furthermore, do you realize that you have two hearts, a physical heart and a psychological heart? You can locate your physical heart, but can you locate your psychological heart? Where is it? We all should answer, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; If you would know the Bible, you must learn to say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; The Bible reveals that we have a soul. Do you know where your soul is? And what about your spirit? Do you know where it is? We all have a spirit, a soul, a heart, a mind, an emotion, and a will, but we are not able to locate them. In addition to all this, and most mysterious of all, there is the matter of our physical life. Do you understand your physical life? Not even medical doctors know what life is. Thus, how could we expect to understand all there is of Christ when we cannot even understand ourselves?</p>
<p>The matter of eating also illustrates how limited our mind is. Do you know everything about the food you eat? If you did not eat until you adequately understood what you were eating, you would die of starvation. Day after day, we eat our food without trying to analyze it. I am not interested in understanding the food I eat. In my travels throughout the world, I have stayed in homes in many different countries in the Far East, Europe, South America, and the United States. Because my hosts have lovingly taken care of me, they served me the best food. As they served me, they have often attempted to explain the food to me. However, I said to myself, &ldquo;Please, simply serve me the food. Do not try to explain it. There is no room in my mind for all this information. Please stop talking and let me enjoy the meal. Because you love me, I know that you have prepared the best food for me. I am assured that you would never serve something that was bad for me. I prefer to enjoy my food ignorantly.&rdquo; Actually, the more you study, the less you will enjoy. But the less you study, the more food you will enjoy and the better you will digest it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>We may apply this matter in coming to the Bible. It is not sufficient just to study the Bible; we have to eat it. Jeremiah 15:16 says, &ldquo;Thy words were found, and I did eat them.&rdquo; In resisting the temptation of the devil, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God&rdquo; (Matt. 4:4). When you come to the breakfast table, do you study the food or do you eat it? No one would be so foolish as to study it. However, most Christians do not eat the Word of God when they open their Bibles; they merely study it. Too much study without eating may damage you; many have been damaged in this way.</p>
<p>One day I began to read the Gospel of John. I was puzzled by the first phrase, &ldquo;In the beginning,&rdquo; and I began to study it. I asked myself, &ldquo;The beginning? What does this mean? What kind of beginning is this?&rdquo; I stopped eating and began studying. I checked the marginal references, and then I consulted a concordance and a dictionary to find the meaning of the phrase, &ldquo;In the beginning.&rdquo; I simply was not able to understand this. Instead of eating the meat of the chicken, I studied the bones. But it was too much for my teeth to handle. Nevertheless, I went on to study further and to ask more questions concerning what the Word was and how the Word could be both with God and God Himself. It seemed to me that it was not logical to say that the Word both was God and was with God. I wondered if the Word and God were one or two. After many years, the Lord showed me that the way is not to study, but to eat. After having learned this way, I came again to John 1:1 and began to eat it. I prayed with this verse, saying, &ldquo;In the beginning, Amen! In the beginning was the Word. Amen! Oh, the beginning! Oh, the Word! And the Word was with God! Amen! And the Word was God! Hallelujah for the beginning! Hallelujah for the Word! Hallelujah for God!&rdquo; In this way, I had a rich breakfast.</p>
<p>If you are troubled over the matter that the Son is called the everlasting Father, I suggest that you eat Isaiah 9:6. Eat the verse by saying, &ldquo;For unto us! Amen! Oh, unto me, unto you, unto us! A child is born! Amen! Not taught, but born! Hallelujah, a Son is given! Not a teacher, but a Son! And the government shall be upon His shoulder! Amen! And His name! Hallelujah for His name! His name shall be called wonderful! Wonderful! Hallelujah! Oh, His name is counselor! What rich food this is! He is wonderful! He is the counselor! Praise Him, He is the mighty God! A child is the mighty God! His name is called the everlasting Father! Hallelujah, the Son is the Father!&rdquo; After you eat this verse, you will still not understand it fully, but you will be nourished.</p>
<p>Some say that they do not like pray-reading because it is too noisy. If you do not like the noise, exercise your table manners and eat quietly. However, those who take care of their manners usually do not enjoy eating very much. Nevertheless, even when you observe the proper table manners, eating is still superior to studying.</p>
<p>The principle here is not to trust in our limited mentality. The spiritual mysteries are always revealed to our spirit, not to our mind. As you are pray-reading the Word, open your spirit. Do not exercise your mentality&mdash;exercise your spirit. Then the Holy Spirit will shine into you and reveal the depth of the truth into your spirit. In this way, you will receive revelation instead of mere knowledge.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORD</h2>
<p>Now in this message we need to consider thirty-five items of what Christ is. Christ is the Word (John 1:1, 14). When we say that Christ is the Word, we are not speaking of who Christ is, but of what Christ is. The Word is the expression of God. I may have a great deal of feeling within me, but if I have no words, my feelings cannot be expressed. But when my feelings are expressed in words, then you are able to understand them. Christ is the Word, the Word of God. Although no one knows God, Christ as the Word speaks for God, defines God, and even declares God. Hallelujah, Christ is the Word!</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE</h2>
<p>John 1:4, speaking of Christ as the Word, says, &ldquo;In Him was life.&rdquo; Thus, Christ is life. Life causes us to be living. To come to the Word and be made living by it means to receive life. But if instead of becoming living, you are deadened, this indicates that you did not receive life; rather, you received death. Every time we receive the Word in which there is life, we become living. This is life. Christ is the Word, and He is also life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIGHT</h2>
<p>John 1:4 also says that this life is the light of men. Hence, Christ also is light. If you have life, then you have light. Anyone who is dead is absolutely in darkness, for death denotes darkness. However, life indicates light. As long as we are living, we shall be in the light and be able to see. But when someone dies, he is in darkness and sees nothing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GRACE</h2>
<p>John 1:14 says, &ldquo;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.&rdquo; Christ is full of grace. Grace is Christ for our enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REALITY</h2>
<p>Christ is also the reality. Reality means the realization of what God is to us. Grace is related to life, and reality is related to light. Life is the essence, the substance, of grace. If you have life, you will enjoy grace. Light is the realization of what God is. When you have light, you gain reality. Thus, grace is connected to life, and reality is connected to light.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TABERNACLE</h2>
<p>According to John 1:14, Christ is also the tabernacle. The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us. Christ in the flesh was God&rsquo;s tabernacle, God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAMB</h2>
<p>John 1:29 indicates that Christ is the Lamb. This verse says, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; As the Lamb, Christ took away our sin.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LADDER</h2>
<p>John 1:51 says, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, you shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&rdquo; This verse reveals that Christ is the ladder which Jacob saw in his dream (Gen. 28:10-22). Jacob&rsquo;s dream is fulfilled in this verse. Christ, the heavenly ladder, joins earth to heaven and connects God to man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TEMPLE</h2>
<p>In chapter one of the Gospel of John we have Christ as the tabernacle; in chapter two we see Him as the temple (John 2:19, 21). Christ is the temple of God, God&rsquo;s habitation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BRASS SERPENT</h2>
<p>John 3:14 reveals that Christ is also the brass serpent. When the children of Israel committed sin against God, many of them were bitten by serpents and died. When the children of Israel cried out to Moses, the Lord told him to lift up a brass serpent on a pole. Everyone who looked at that serpent was forgiven, healed, and kept alive (Num. 21:4-9). In John 3:14 the Lord said to Nicodemus, &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&rdquo; This means that when the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He was lifted up as the brass serpent. He died so that the serpent might be destroyed. As the Lamb, He died on the cross to take away our sin. But as the brass serpent, He died on the cross to destroy the old serpent, Satan, the devil (Heb. 2:14).</p><h2 class="head1">THE FOUNTAIN</h2>
<p>Christ is the fountain, or spring, of water. In John 4:14 He says, &ldquo;Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BREAD OF LIFE</h2>
<p>As we all know, Christ is the bread of life typified by manna (John 6:35). The spring of water is for us to drink, and the bread of life is for us to eat. Thus, we must drink of Him and eat Him. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me&rdquo; (John 6:57). If we eat Him, we shall live by Him. Because I eat adequately day after day, I have the energy I need. I live by what I eat. If I do not eat properly, I do not have the energy to speak. The food I eat energizes me. This food is not the objective food, the food for study; it is the subjective food, the food I take in through eating. The real food is Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DOOR</h2>
<p>In John 10:7 the Lord Jesus said that He was the door. Many Christians think that Christ as the door is for us to go to heaven. But if you read John chapter ten, you will see that the door is not for going to heaven; it is for enabling us to get out of the fold, that is, to get out of religion. Religion, including every denomination, is a fold, but the church is a flock. We must come out of the fold and be flocked together as one flock. Only through Christ as the door can we come out of the fold. Hallelujah for Christ as the door! The more you love Christ, eat Christ, live by Christ, and fellowship with Christ, the more He will be the wide open door through which you may walk out of religion, out of the denominations, out of every kind of fold. Through Him as the door you will be released from the fold to the pasture. Sheep do not enjoy the fold as much as they do the pasture. When there is danger or bad weather, the fold is useful. But when there is no danger and the weather is pleasant, the sheep prefer to come out of the fold and to get into the pasture where they can enjoy the green grass as their food. We in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are in the tender green pasture feeding on Christ. We are not in the fold eating dry grass.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PASTURE</h2>
<p>Christ is not only the door for us to come out of religion; He is also the pasture. In the church life, meeting after meeting we sense that we are in the pasture eating the tender grass.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>We have already pointed out that Christ is life. Now we must see that He is also the resurrection (John 11:25). Resurrection is stronger than life. Resurrection is life that has been put into death and that has risen above death. Thus, resurrection is the life that conquers and subdues death. It is the life that can walk out of death. Because the Lord Jesus was the resurrection, He was able to be put into death, walk through death, take a look at every aspect of death as if He were on a sight-seeing tour, and then walk out of death. After completing His tour of the region of death, Christ walked out of death. This is Christ as the resurrection. We all need to enjoy Christ not only as life, but also as the resurrection.</p>
<p>This is not a doctrine; it is something that must be applied to our daily living. Many of us have a problem with our temper. It seems that our little temper often puts us into death. Many times sisters have come to me and said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I want to be a good sister, a good wife, and a good mother. But I am bothered by my temper. When my temper rises up, I don&rsquo;t know what to do. Please help me. I am afraid of my temper.&rdquo; In the past, my experience was the same as theirs. Gradually, however, I received the revelation that my temper is death. However, because Christ is in me as resurrection, I need not be afraid of the death my temper brings. Suppose the enemy uses your husband or wife to stir up your temper. The first thing you must realize is that the devil is tempting you. The devil may say, &ldquo;You have heard that Christ is your resurrection. Now let me test you to see whether or not this resurrection will work.&rdquo; After you realize that this temptation is coming from Satan, do not be afraid of your temper, and do not try to overcome it. Rather, praise the Lord and say, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Amen! Little devil, are you trying to cause me to lose my temper? Do you intend to put me into death? I would like to go with you to have a sightseeing tour. Praise the Lord! Hallelujah! Good-by death!&rdquo; This is the experience of resurrection.</p>
<p>Sometimes the devil may send a brother to rebuke you. This brother may be the only one who has the boldness to rebuke you. His rebuke is another form of death. After being rebuked by him for several minutes, you may find yourself in a tomb. You may be tempted to think that it is not fair for him to rebuke you. But yielding to that temptation will cause you to lose the resurrection. I have had some experience of this. As someone was rebuking me, I said within to the Lord, &ldquo;Amen, Lord! Hallelujah, now I am coming out of the tomb.&rdquo; Even as that one was rebuking me, I came forth from the tomb. This is the experience of Christ as the resurrection.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GRAIN OF WHEAT</h2>
<p>Christ is also a grain of wheat. John 12:24 reveals that Christ fell into the earth as a grain of wheat and died so that He might bring forth many grains. By His death as the Lamb, He took away our sin; as the brass serpent, He destroyed the devil; and as the grain of wheat, He produced many grains to form the loaf, which is the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY</h2>
<p>Christ is the way (John 14:6). If you do not know how to contact God, take Christ as your way. Always and in everything take Christ as the way. The young brothers and sisters may not know how to go on as far as marriage is concerned. They simply do not know whom they should marry. At such a time, they should not try to know. Rather, they should take Christ and say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You are my way. I love You, I take You, I live by You, and I live for You.&rdquo; When they do this, Christ will be their way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE POWER OF GOD</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 1:24 says that Christ is the power of God. In order to do anything, we must have power. Christ is the power of God for us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WISDOM OF GOD</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 1:24 also says that Christ is the wisdom of God. In order to do things, we also need wisdom. Thus, Christ is the wisdom of God for us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RIGHTEOUSNESS, SANCTIFICATION, AND REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 1:30 indicates that Christ is our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Christ is power and wisdom so that He can be our righteousness for our past. Our past is miserable. In the past there were many sins and wrongdoings. Thus, for our past, we need Christ to be our righteousness. Hallelujah, by Him, through Him, and in Him, we have been justified, and our past has been forgiven.</p>
<p>For the present, Christ is our sanctification. Thus, we are now able to live a holy life. In ourselves, we cannot be holy and sanctified, but Christ is our sanctification. Day by day, for our present living, He is our sanctification.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for the future, Christ is our redemption. One day, our body will be redeemed. Therefore, for our past, Christ is our righteousness; for our present, He is our sanctification; and for our future, He is redemption. Oh, Christ is everything!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DEEP THINGS OF GOD</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 2:10 says, &ldquo;The Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.&rdquo; The deep things of God, or the depth of God, is Christ. All scientific knowledge is superficial. Only Christ is deep. If as a Christian you do not live by Christ, you are a superficial Christian. Although you may have a doctor&rsquo;s degree, you are still shallow, for whatever you know is superficial. But Christ is deep. If you have Him, you truly have the deeper life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOUNDATION</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 3:11 says, &ldquo;For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Christ is the only foundation. For the church, God&rsquo;s temple, Christ is the foundation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PASSOVER</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 5:7 says, &ldquo;Even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.&rdquo; Because of Christ, God has passed over us, and we have no problems with Him. We have Christ as our Passover.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL FOOD</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 10:3 speaks of &ldquo;the same spiritual food&rdquo; (Gk.). This indicates that Christ is our spiritual food, our heavenly manna. Daily we need to eat Him as our spiritual food.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL DRINK</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 10:4 indicates that Christ is our spiritual drink. As our spiritual drink, He is the living water.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRITUAL ROCK</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 10:4 also says, &ldquo;They drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.&rdquo; Christ is the spiritual rock that flows out the living water. He has been cleft for us, and out of Him flows the living water for our drinking.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HEAD</h2>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 11:3, Christ is the Head. He is the Head of the Body and of every one of us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BODY</h2>
<p>Christ is not only the Head; He is also the Body. First Corinthians 11:3 indicates that Christ is the Head, and 1 Corinthians 12:12 indicates that He is the Body. This verse says, &ldquo;For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is the Christ&rdquo; (Gk.). This reveals that Christ is the Body. Of course, the Christ here is not the individual Christ; it is the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ. Christ Himself is the Head, and the church is the Body. Eventually, however, both the Head and the Body are Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRSTFRUIT</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:20 we see that Christ is the firstfruit. In verses 47 and 45 of the same chapter we see that Christ is the second man and the last Adam. When we put these three items together, we have the first, the second, and the last. This indicates that Christ is the first, the second, and the last. He is everything!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA</h2>
<p>Revelation 22:13 reveals that Christ is the Alpha and the Omega. Christ is not only the way; He is also the alphabet. As we all know, every word is composed of letters. Christ is the letters that compose every verse of the Bible. Because He is the first letter, the Alpha, and the last letter, the Omega, He is certainly all the letters in between. An English-language typewriter has twenty-six letters. With these letters we can compose any word, sentence, paragraph, or book. I have such a typewriter in my study at home. By using the twenty-six letters on this typewriter, I can compose anything. Christ is the real typewriter containing all the letters from Alpha to Omega. Whenever you want to say something, simply type Christ. Day by day, we must practice typing with Christ as the letters. I hope that everyone in the local churches will be a good typist, well able to type with Christ as the letters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRST AND THE LAST</h2>
<p>Revelation 22:13 also tells us that Christ is the First and the Last. As the Alpha, He is first, and as the Omega, He is the Last.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BEGINNING AND THE END</h2>
<p>Furthermore, Revelation 22:13 reveals that Christ is the beginning and the end. As the beginning, nothing precedes Him, and as the end, nothing succeeds Him. This means that before Christ and after Christ there is no other. Christ is everything. Is the Christ you experience like this? We must admit that the Christ experienced by many Christians is not. We, however, must experience Christ in a full way, all the way from Alpha to Omega. Before Alpha, there is no letter, and after Omega, there is also no letter. The Alpha is the beginning, and the Omega is the end.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL IN ALL</h2>
<p>Lastly, Christ is all in all. This aspect of Christ is related to the new man, the church. According to Colossians 3:11, in this new man, &ldquo;There is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.&rdquo; In the new man Christ is in everyone, and Christ is all. Christ is in you, and Christ is in me. Therefore, in the new man, that is, in the church, there is no American, German, Chinese, or Japanese. Likewise, there are no managers, servants, or Ph.D.&rsquo;s. Sometimes we refer to a certain brother as a brother with a doctor&rsquo;s degree. I do not like to hear this. The doctor&rsquo;s degree must be put away, because in the new man there is only Christ. In the new man Christ is in everyone, and Christ is everyone. Christ is all and in all.</p>
<p>How we need to experience Christ! All these aspects of Christ are not doctrine, religion, or ethics. Neither are they Christianity. Christ is for our enjoyment, and the issue of our enjoyment of Christ is the church. Once again, this is a matter of Christ and the church, the kernel of the Bible.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY CHRIST BUILDS HIS CHURCH</h1>
<p>Although we may have the riches of Christ, it is possible to have them merely in an objective way. The riches may simply be the riches and yet not have anything to do with us. To know the riches of Christ objectively is one thing; to enjoy them subjectively is another. Buying groceries is very different from eating prepared food. We must learn how to eat all the aspects of Christ revealed in the Gospel of John, 1 Corinthians, and the other books of the Bible. Christ is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the all in all. How profound He is! How all-inclusive! Nevertheless, as profound as He is, Christ is for our enjoyment. The way to enjoy the riches of Christ is by eating, and the way to eat is by calling on the name of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING THE RICHES OF CHRIST<br />
BY CALLING ON HIS NAME</h2>
<p>First Corinthians, a book that unfolds many aspects of the riches of Christ, reveals that the way to eat these riches is by calling on the name of the Lord. This epistle even opens with the matter of calling. The second verse of chapter one says, &ldquo;Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours&rdquo; (Gk.). This book was not written to those who study, but to those who eat, that is, to those who call on the name of the Lord. We all must learn to call upon His name, for the riches of Christ are made available for our enjoyment through our calling on Him. As Romans 10:12 says, &ldquo;The same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many Christians know how to pray, but not how to call. I used to think that praying and calling were the same. Later I learned that they were different. When I call, I pray; but when I pray, I do not necessarily call. Although I may receive answers to my prayers, I do not receive nourishment by praying. But whenever I call on the Lord, I receive both the answer and the nourishment.</p>
<p>Children are experts at calling on their parents. A little girl does not say, &ldquo;Mother, I need some water&rdquo;; instead, she says, &ldquo;Mama, give me a drink!&rdquo; Whenever she calls like this, she gets something to drink. Likewise, there is no need for us to say, &ldquo;Lord, thank You for being so good to me. Lord, I need You very much. Every day and every hour I need You.&rdquo; This is praying, not calling. When we call on the Lord, we may say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! I need You, Lord! O Lord, how good You are! Lord, You are my health day by day!&rdquo; Receiving an answer is secondary; being nourished is primary. Whenever I exercise my spirit to call on the Lord, I am richly nourished.</p>
<p>All Christians have called upon the name of the Lord at some time. However, most of them call only when they are in trouble. They do not call during times of peace. Why should we wait until trouble comes to call on the Lord? We need to form the habit of calling on Him at all times. Every morning when I rise up, I take several deep breaths. This is very refreshing and invigorating. Likewise, we need to breathe in the Lord by calling on His name. If we do this, we shall enjoy fresh air and nourishment. The Bible does not say that the Lord is rich to all who study about Him or meditate on Him. No, the Bible says that the Lord is rich to all who call on His name. When we call on His name, we touch Him and receive His riches.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RICHES OF CHRIST PRODUCING THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In this message we come to the matter of the church. We have seen who Christ is and what Christ is. Now we must see that all the riches of Christ are for the church. In the foregoing messages we have seen seven aspects of Christ in His divinity: God, the Creator, the Lord, Jehovah, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. We have also seen various aspects of Christ in His humanity, such as the Prophet, the Priest, the King, the Apostle, and the Bridegroom. All that Christ is in His divinity and in His humanity is for the producing of the church. If we would know the church, we need to know how the church comes into being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BUILT BY CHRIST</h2>
<p>The first mention of the church in the Bible is in Matthew 16:18. In this chapter the church that is revealed is a prevailing church. Prior to speaking about the church, the Lord had asked the disciples who He was, and Peter had said, &ldquo;Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (Matt. 16:13-16). It is wonderful to know that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. But as soon as Peter had received this revelation, the Lord said, &ldquo;And I say also unto thee, That thou art a stone, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18, Gk.). This word indicates that after we see who Christ is, we must also see the church, because Christ is for the church. Christ is the source, and the church is the product. If you know the source, then you must also know the product.</p>
<p>The Lord told Peter that he was a stone, and that He would build His church upon Himself as the rock. The Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Peter, you are a stone, and I am the rock. I shall build My church with stones upon this rock. The church I build will defeat Satan, for the gates of Hades will not be able to stand against it.&rdquo; The &ldquo;gates of Hades&rdquo; is a biblical term denoting the power of Satan. The power of Satan cannot prevail against the builded church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BRINGING IN THE KINGDOM</h2>
<p>The church built by Christ will bring in the kingdom. Verse 18 speaks of the church, and verse 19, of the kingdom. Verse 19 says, &ldquo;And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&rdquo; When the church is built, the kingdom will come. The church and the kingdom are two aspects of one thing. The proper church is also the prevailing kingdom.</p>
<p>In verse 19 we have the keys of the kingdom and in verse 18, the gates of Hades. We have seen that the gates of Hades refer to the power of Satan. Now we must see that the keys of the kingdom refer to the authority of God. Which is stronger&mdash;the power of Satan or the authority of God? Of course, the authority of God is much stronger than the power of Satan. The church built by Christ is the kingdom of heaven, and this kingdom has the authority of God. Thus, the power of Satan cannot prevail against the builded church.</p>
<p>Certainly you have never seen such a church in Christianity. But what about the church in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today? We need to be fair in answering this question. Although the church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is much better than anything in Christianity, it is still not that high. We must go higher and higher. Whenever we come together, the kingdom of heaven must be present, and the authority of God must be here. Then the power of Satan will be defeated. The day is coming when such a church will be built up among us. I believe that in many major cities there will shortly be churches that are the kingdom of heaven filled with the authority of God and able to defeat the power of Satan. Although this has not yet been accomplished, we have the Lord&rsquo;s promise: &ldquo;I will build My church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today the Lord Jesus is still building the church. At present we cannot find such a prevailing church in London, Paris, or Rome. Although there are thousands of Christians in these cities, there is no church like the one described in Matthew 16. Praise the Lord that He is recovering the church life! In Stuttgart there is a church different from anything found in Christianity. We admit that not even the church in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is fully built yet; we are still in the initial stage. But the Lord will continue to build His church. He was building yesterday, He is building today, and He will be building tomorrow. He will keep on building until the church fully becomes the kingdom of heaven possessing the authority of God to defeat the power of Satan. When that day comes, the churches will be ready for the rapture; they will be ready to be taken by the Lord as His Bride. At that time the Lord Jesus will come back.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE BRIDE TO BE PREPARED</h2>
<p>We know that when the Lord Jesus comes back, He will come as the Bridegroom. In order for the Bridegroom to come, the Bride must be prepared. If the Lord came back today, would the Bride be ready? Certainly not. How can the Bridegroom come if the Bride has not been prepared? For centuries Christians have been talking about the Lord&rsquo;s second coming, and many are still doing so today. The more they talk and wait for Him to return, the more He seems to delay His coming. The reason for this is that the church has not yet been built. It would be a shame to the Lord to come back without having a built-up church. His enemy, Satan, would say, &ldquo;Jesus, have You come back? What about Your promise in Matthew 16? Jesus, You still have not built Your church! Look at Your church. It is a mess, filled with idolatry, fornication, division, and confusion. Is this the church You promised to build?&rdquo; What a shame this would be to the Lord! Therefore, the Lord continues to build His church.</p>
<p>The Lord is not building with a large number, but with a rather small number. Nevertheless, in the various major cities strong churches will be built up. Then at His coming back He will be able to say to Satan, &ldquo;Satan, look! In all these major cities I have built up My church. In My church there is no division, confusion, idolatry, or fornication. Satan, what do you have to say about this?&rdquo; At that time, the Lord Jesus will be able to boast to the enemy. However, today He can do little boasting concerning the builded church. Therefore, we all must press on and give the Lord the opportunity to build up His church in a pure way, in a victorious way, and in a prevailing way so that He can put His enemy to shame. Even now the Lord has a church in New York and in Los Angeles, the devilish center of the movie industry. Is this not a shame to Satan? In these churches there is no division, confusion, idolatry, or fornication. There is only the all-inclusive Christ. Hallelujah! I strongly believe that the time is coming, perhaps within ten years, when the situation regarding the church will be beautiful. The Lord&rsquo;s promise to build His church will be fulfilled.</p><h2 class="head1">BUILDING THE CHURCH BY BAPTIZING THE BELIEVERS<br />
INTO THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>In Matthew 28:19, the Lord revealed the way to build up the church: &ldquo;Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Gk.). The nations, pagans, need to be discipled. After they have been discipled, they must be baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Christianity has made baptism a formal ritual. But in Matthew 28 baptism is not a ritual; it is the immersing of the believers of Christ into the Triune God. In Christianity a pastor may baptize a new convert either by sprinkling a few drops of water upon him or by immersing him. In either case he may say, &ldquo;I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; But whether the new convert is sprinkled or immersed, he remains the same. Nothing has changed.</p>
<p>Years ago, in South America, a Catholic priest baptized a certain native boy and changed his name. After bringing him into the cathedral and sprinkling water upon him, the priest changed his name to John. At that time Catholics were not allowed to eat meat on Fridays. On a particular Friday John was preparing some venison to eat. Realizing that he should not eat meat on Friday, John decided to change the venison into fish. He said to himself, &ldquo;If the priest could change my name by sprinkling water on me, then I can change this venison to fish by sprinkling water on it.&rdquo; Therefore, he sprinkled water on the venison and called it fish. As the priest walked by, he smelled the venison cooking. Offended, he rebuked John, saying, &ldquo;John, don&rsquo;t you know that today is Friday and that you are not allowed to eat meat? You must eat fish today.&rdquo; John replied, &ldquo;I have done the same thing to the venison that you did to me. You sprinkled water on me and changed my name to John, and I sprinkled water on the venison and called it fish.&rdquo; This illustrates what a ritual baptism has become throughout much of so-called Christianity.</p>
<p>Genuine baptism is a matter of putting people into the Triune God. The Lord Jesus did not tell the disciples to baptize the nations into water; He told them to baptize the nations into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. One writer has pointed out that the name here denotes the Person of the divine Being. Hence, to baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to baptize them into the Person of the Triune God. Whenever we baptize others, we must exercise our spirit and our faith to say, &ldquo;We do not merely place you into the water; we are immersing you into the Triune God. Before now, you were outside the Triune God and had nothing whatever to do with Him. Now we are putting you into the Triune God; hereafter you will be one who is in the Triune God.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</h2>
<p>After the Lord Jesus was resurrected, He appeared to His disciples. Although the doors were shut where the disciples were, on the day of His resurrection, the Lord, with a physical body, mysteriously entered the room (John 20:19). As He was speaking with them, He breathed into them and said, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (John 20:22). After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus came back to breathe Himself into the disciples. Many Christians know what took place on the day of Pentecost, but they do not know what happened on the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. They do not know that on the day of His resurrection the Lord Jesus breathed Himself as the Spirit of life into His disciples. After the Lord Jesus breathed Himself into them, we are not told that He left them. This indicates that He stayed within them. After He breathed Himself into them, He remained within them as their life of resurrection. Most Christians think that the Holy Spirit was not given to the disciples until the day of Pentecost. This is a mistaken concept. Fifty days earlier than Pentecost, the Lord breathed the Spirit into the disciples, and they received the Spirit of life. According to Acts chapter one, the disciples were able to pray for ten days. How could they have done this if they did not have the Spirit within them? The only way one hundred and twenty believers could pray in one accord for ten days was to have Christ as the life-giving Spirit within them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE SPIRIT OF POWER</h2>
<p>Although the disciples had the Spirit of life within them, they did not yet have the Spirit of power upon them. For that, they had to wait until the day of Pentecost. At that time the ascended Christ poured Himself upon the disciples. On the day of resurrection, the disciples received the life of resurrection, for they received the Spirit of life. But on the day of Pentecost the ascended Christ poured Himself upon His disciples to empower them. Therefore, on the day of Pentecost the disciples had both the Spirit of life within them and the Spirit of power upon them. Within and without, they were permeated, saturated, and filled with the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">INWARDLY FILLED AND OUTWARDLY IMMERSED<br />
FOR THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>On the day of Pentecost the church was fully built up. Inwardly the believers were filled with the Spirit of life and outwardly they were immersed into the Spirit. They were absolutely in the Spirit. As a result, they became a prevailing church. This was not a matter of organization or formality. It was a matter of a group of believers being filled with the Spirit within and immersed into the Spirit without. They were in the Spirit, the Spirit was in them, and thus they were one with the Triune God. Immediately, they became a prevailing church. That church was the kingdom of heaven; it had the authority of God and was able to overcome the power of Satan. This was the church on the day of Pentecost, and this is the church the Lord is building up in His recovery today. In order for this to take place, we all must be filled with the Spirit of life and immersed into the Spirit of power.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BAPTIZED INTO ONE BODY</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 12:13 says, &ldquo;For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit&rdquo; (Gk.). How does the church come into being? It is not by human organization, but by immersing the believers into the Triune God. By being filled with the Spirit of life and by being immersed into the Spirit of power, we become one with the Triune God, and the Triune God becomes one with us. Eventually, we are one in the Triune God. This is the way we become the one Body, the church.</p>
<p>May the Lord grant us all a clear vision that the church is neither an organization, nor merely a group of people; it is the disciples who are filled with the Spirit of life and immersed into the Spirit of power. When we are permeated and filled with the Spirit both within and without, we are the church. Those in the church are extraordinary. They are filled with the Spirit, immersed into the Spirit, permeated with the Spirit, and one with the Spirit. These are the people of the church, the people of the kingdom, those who have the power and authority of God to overcome the power of Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE STRENGTHENING OF THE INNER MAN</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:8 reveals that the Apostle Paul preached the unsearchable riches of Christ. All the believers have received these unsearchable riches. In these messages we have seen and received the riches of Christ. However, we still need to pray that these riches would be applied to us and become our enjoyment. For this we need to pray, as Paul did, for the strengthening of our inner man (Eph. 3:16). Here Paul seemed to be saying, &ldquo;O Father, strengthen the believers in their inner man. Do not strengthen them in their mentality or in their physical bodies, but in their inner man.&rdquo; The inner man is our spirit. Although we all need to be strengthened in our spirit, in our inner man, the natural strength of our mind needs to be reduced. Many Christians are strong in their mentality. They have a large head, but a very small spirit. Their mind is filled with thoughts and imaginations. While they are sitting in a meeting listening to a message, their thoughts may travel around the world. Furthermore, they find it very easy to talk. However, if you ask them to pray, they will immediately be quiet. Prayer requires the exercise of the spirit, but talking comes out of the exercise of the mind. Those with a large mentality find it easy to talk, but difficult to pray. This proves that their inner man, their spirit, is weak. Thus, they need to be strengthened in the inner man and reduced in their mentality. If this takes place, their head will become smaller, and their spirit will become larger. As a result, they will like to pray more and talk less. They will begin to say, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; They will enjoy saying this because their spirit will have been strengthened and expanded. We all need to pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, strengthen my spirit and restrict my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN OUR HEART</h2>
<p>We also need to pray, &ldquo;O Lord, strengthen my spirit so that Christ may make His home in my heart.&rdquo; When we were saved, the Lord Jesus came into our spirit. How much of Christ do you have in your spirit? If you sense that you have little of Him in your spirit, you should pray that He would strengthen your inner man. If you learn to call on the Lord, your spirit will be filled with Christ as the life-giving Spirit. This is the way to be strengthened in the inner man. The more you say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; the more Christ will come into you, spread into your heart, and take it over. As Christ spreads in you, He makes your heart His home (Eph. 3:17). Although all Christians have Christ in their spirit, few have Christ in their mind, emotion, and will, which are the different rooms of our heart. Christ desires to fill all these rooms and to make our heart His home.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED WITH ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD</h2>
<p>According to Ephesians 3:19, eventually, we shall &ldquo;be filled with all the fulness of God.&rdquo; This means that we shall not simply have Christ in our spirit, but that He will make His home in our heart and take over our entire being. As a result, we shall inwardly be filled with all the fullness of God. When we are filled with all the fullness of God, we become the practical and prevailing church. This church is the kingdom of heaven with the authority of God to overcome the power of Satan. By this we see that the building of the church does not come by outward organization, but by the inner life, that is, by having Christ fill us, saturate us, and permeate us until we are filled with the fullness of God. This is Christ&rsquo;s way to build His church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY TO PRODUCE THE CHURCH</h1>
<h2 class="head1">IMMERSED INTO THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>Baptizing believers in water signifies that they are being immersed into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19). We were born outside of God and we have drifted far away from Him. One day we heard the gospel, and the gospel brought us back to Him. However, it is not adequate merely to be brought back to God; we must also be put into Him. For this, we need to be baptized. Whenever we baptize believers into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, we are placing them into the Triune God. After we have been baptized, we have not only come back to God and belong to Him; we are also in Him. Therefore, we can declare, &ldquo;I used to be a sinner outside of God and far away from Him. But now I have been discipled and baptized into the Triune God. Angels, do you know where I am today? I am in the Triune God. Oh, I am in the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Satan, don&rsquo;t touch me! I am valuable and precious because I am in the Triune God.&rdquo; After we have been baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, wherever we are and whatever we do, we are in the Triune God.</p>
<p>Do not consider baptism a ritual or an empty form. I say again, to baptize believers is to put them into the Triune God. In the past, I saw some who shouted and danced after they came out of the baptismal water. Some even waved their arms and rejoiced, so glad were they to be in the Triune God. Hallelujah, we are in the Triune God! As those in the Triune God, we are the material for the building of the church. The church is not a physical building, nor even merely a gathering of believers. The church is a corporate composition of those who have been immersed into the Triune God.</p>
<p>Galatians 3:27 says, &ldquo;For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&rdquo; Those who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. In this verse Christ is likened to a garment that we put on. When we are baptized into Christ, we are put into Christ, and we put Christ upon us. This is our union with Christ. Now that we have been baptized into Christ, we are one with Christ. And we are one with the Triune God.</p>
<p>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord prophesied and said, &ldquo;I will build my church.&rdquo; In Matthew 28:19 He commanded His disciples to baptize the nations into the Triune God. Hence, the first step in producing the church is to immerse the believers into the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT OF LIFE AS OUR CONTENT</h2>
<p>On the day of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus appeared to His disciples in a mysterious way. After entering the room where the disciples were gathered, He breathed into them and said, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (John 20:22). We need to be very clear regarding the significance of this action. By breathing into the disciples and telling them to receive the Holy Spirit, the Lord indicated that from then on He would be in them and that He would never leave them.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John reveals that in eternity past the Lord was the Word, that the Word was God, and that, in His incarnation, the Word became flesh and dwelt among us as a man. This man was the Lamb of God (John 1:29). After dying on the cross to take away our sins, He was resurrected. On the day of His resurrection He came to the disciples as the holy breath. Here we have a problem in language. In the Greek language, the same word, <em>pneuma,</em> is used for both breath and spirit. The Lord Himself was actually the very breath, the <em>pneuma,</em> that He breathed into His disciples after His resurrection. After accomplishing the work of redemption as the Lamb, He went into death and was resurrected. In resurrection He became a mysterious One, for He became the <em>pneuma</em> breathed into His disciples. How wonderful! Although Peter, John, and all the other disciples had already been baptized into the Triune God, on the day of resurrection Christ as the Spirit, the <em>pneuma,</em> the breath, was breathed into them to be their content. In the past we were sinners outside of God and far from Him. Now, as saved ones, we have been brought back to God and baptized into Him. However, we still may not have the Lord as our content within. Our content must be the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ as the Spirit of life, the holy breath. As He breathes Himself into us, we need to breathe Him in. He breathes out, and we breathe in. After the Lord breathes Himself out as the Spirit of life and we breathe Him in as the reality of life, He becomes our content. Now not only are we in the Triune God, but the resurrected Christ as the Spirit of life is also in us. Thus, our content is the Spirit of life, the resurrected Christ, as the resurrection life within us. This content, which is Christ Himself, is the very substance of the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CONSTITUTION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The church is not something outside the Triune God. Neither is the church merely a group of believers who meet together. The church is the constitution of Christ. It is not an organization; it is a constitution with Christ and of Christ. Consider your physical body. It is not an organization, but a living constitution including many parts. When you go to a dentist, he may fix your teeth by placing a golden element in them. However, that element is not part of your constitution. No matter how pure, valuable, and beautiful it may be, it cannot be constituted into you, because it does not contain your life. Likewise, the church is not just a group of believers in Christ who have been cleansed of defiling germs, who have been made righteous, clean, and pure, and who regularly gather together. This is not an adequate understanding of the church. The church is the constitution of Christ. It is Christ constituted into the very fiber of our being. The Christ constituted into us is the church. The church is the constitution of the resurrected Christ who embodies the reality of the Triune God. Thus, the church is a living constitution of the Triune God who has been wrought into our humanity. Yes, we are human beings, but in our humanity we have the constitution of the Triune God, for He has been wrought, constituted, into us. Hence, we are not merely human beings; we are also the church. We are not simply a group of believers meeting together. We are those who have been immersed into the Triune God and who have Christ constituted into our being. This is the church. The church people are not merely those who have been redeemed, cleansed, purified, and adjusted. They are those who have been reconstituted with Christ, who is the very embodiment of the Triune God.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, are we simply those who have been redeemed, cleansed, purified, and adjusted? We must answer this question by strongly saying no. In addition to all this, we have been reconstituted with Christ. Thus, we may need to say to Satan, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me! Don&rsquo;t you know that I have Christ in me, that Christ has been constituted into the fiber of my being?&rdquo; I can truly say that for me to live is Christ (Phil. 1:21). I am not only a redeemed person, nor merely a cleansed and purified person; I am a person filled with Christ, a person who has Christ wrought into my being. Now within me there is a heavenly, spiritual constitution. Therefore, I say once again that the church is the constitution of the Triune God into our being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONCEPTION AND DELIVERY OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>On the day of resurrection the church was conceived, but it was not yet born. When the Lord breathed Himself into the disciples, they were impregnated with the church, but the church had not yet been delivered. It had only been conceived within them. When the resurrected Christ came into the disciples, that was the conception of the church. On the day of Pentecost, the ascended Christ, the Christ on the throne, poured Himself out upon His disciples. This pouring out of the ascended Christ upon the disciples was the birth, the delivery, of the church. Thus, the entering in of the resurrected Christ into the disciples was the conception of the church, and the outpouring of the ascended Christ upon the disciples was the delivery of the church. Therefore, on the day of Pentecost the church came into being. On that day the church, a corporate child, was born.</p>
<p>Consider the situation of the one hundred twenty on the day of Pentecost. They were the very church described in Matthew 16:18 and 19. Wherever they were, there was the kingdom of heaven with the authority of God. And the gates of Hades could not do anything about it. Therefore, on the day of Pentecost, the Lord&rsquo;s promise spoken in Matthew 16:18 was fulfilled initially. However, that wonderful situation did not last very long. Nevertheless, on the day of Pentecost the church, the corporate child, was delivered.</p>
<p>This is not a matter of doctrine. Many Christians place too much emphasis on doctrine. The point here is to see how the church is produced, how the church comes into being. The church is produced by immersing the believers into the Triune God, by their receiving the resurrected Christ as their life, content, and constitution, and by the pouring out of the ascended Christ upon them to cause them to be wholly and thoroughly filled with the Triune God and immersed into Him. This is the way the church is produced. As those in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must know the church to such a degree.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INWARD CONTENT<br />
AND THE OUTWARD EQUIPMENT</h2>
<p>Many Christians do not realize that on the day of resurrection the resurrected Christ came as the heavenly breath and breathed Himself into His disciples. This is one aspect of the formation of the church. Then, fifty days later, on the day of Pentecost, the ascended Christ on the throne poured Himself out upon the disciples. This is another aspect. The breathing out of the holy breath on the day of resurrection was for life, and the pouring out of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost was for power. On the day of resurrection there was the <em>pneuma,</em> the breath, the air. But on the day of Pentecost there was the mighty wind (Acts 2:2). Air is for life, and wind is for power. The Spirit of life, who is the resurrected Christ, is our content of life, and the Spirit of power, poured out by the ascended Christ, is our outward equipment. Thus, we have the inward content of life and the outward equipment of power. Together these produce the church. The church is a group of believers in the Triune God who have the resurrected Christ as their life content and the ascended Christ as their outward equipment. This is the church which is the kingdom of heaven possessing the authority of God to defeat the power of Satan. The gates of Hades cannot prevail against such a church. This is also the kind of church the Lord is recovering today. My burden in this message is that we would all have a vision of such a church.</p>
<p>Praise the Lord that, by His mercy, we are becoming this kind of church. We all can testify that we are those in the Triune God, that we have the resurrected Christ within as our life content, and that we have the ascended Christ upon us as our equipment. Although the degree is not as high as it was on the day of Pentecost, we are nevertheless in this church. Now the degree must become higher and higher and greater and greater.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN US<br />
FOR THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>For this reason the Apostle Paul prayed for us in Ephesians 3:14-19. He bowed his knees to the Father and prayed that He would grant us to be strengthened by His power through His Spirit in our inner man, that is, in our regenerated spirit, so that Christ might make His home in our entire being, possessing every area of our mind, emotion, and will. In this way Christ becomes settled and makes His home throughout our entire being. The more Christ makes His home in our heart, the higher will be the degree of the building of the church. Eventually, the church will be filled with all the fullness of the Godhead. This church will be the house of God on earth, a house filled with the glory of God. It will also be the Bride prepared for the coming back of Christ. This is the church the Lord is recovering today.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST<br />
AND THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h1>
<p>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus prophesied that He would build His church. Following that, in the book of Acts the Lord gave us a pattern by which we can clearly see how He produces and builds His church. We see this pattern of the producing of the church with the one hundred twenty on the day of Pentecost. Originally, all of these one hundred twenty were far away from God. Although they were in Judaism, they were nonetheless astray from God. Then the Lord Jesus came and called them. In a sense, He discipled them. Through the record of the four Gospels, we see how the Lord brought them back to God and also baptized them into God. Thus, by the time of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, this one hundred twenty had been brought back to God and had been baptized into God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT<br />
BREATHED INTO THE DISCIPLES</h2>
<p>Many Christians do not see the crucial matter that the resurrected Christ came back to His disciples as the very <em>pneuma,</em> as the life-giving Spirit. They see that Christ was the Word of God; that, as the Word, He became flesh; that when He was crucified on the cross, as the Lamb of God, He took away our sins; that He was resurrected; that He has ascended to the heavens, where He is now seated on the throne of God; and that He is coming again. They see all these matters, and we see them too. But because of the subtlety of the enemy, they do not see the crucial matter that as the resurrected One, Christ came back to His disciples as the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 15:45 says that the last Adam, Christ, became the life-giving Spirit. In the flesh Christ was the last Adam, but in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. Although all Christians see that Christ in the flesh was the last Adam, not many see that in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. On the day of His resurrection, Christ did not come back to the disciples as the last Adam in the flesh. Rather, He came to them in resurrection as the life-giving <em>pneuma,</em> as the life-giving Spirit. On this occasion He did a significant thing: He breathed Himself into His disciples (John 20:22). This breathing was the breath of the <em>pneuma,</em> and this breath of <em>pneuma</em> was the life-giving Christ, the Christ of resurrection. By this unique act of breathing, the resurrected Christ breathed Himself into His disciples.</p>
<p>Firstly, the one hundred twenty disciples were brought back to God and baptized into God. As those who had been brought back to God and baptized into Him, they were ready to receive the resurrected Christ into them. Therefore, on the day of His resurrection the resurrected Christ came as the life-giving Spirit and breathed Himself into them. Prior to that time, Christ had been among them, but He had never come into them. But that day, the resurrected Christ as the life-giving <em>pneuma</em> came into them to be their life, their content, their substance, and their very element for the building of God. The resurrected Christ as the life-giving <em>pneuma</em> is the building element, the building substance, for God&rsquo;s house. On the day of His resurrection this substance entered the disciples.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECEIVING OF THE SPIRIT BEFORE PENTECOST</h2>
<p>Many Christians have the mistaken concept that before the day of Pentecost the Spirit had not come to the believers. This concept is absolutely wrong. According to Acts chapter one, before the day of Pentecost the one hundred twenty prayed in one accord for ten days. If the Spirit had not been in them, how could they have been kept in one accord for ten days? It would have been impossible. Even many today who have the Spirit find it difficult to be one with others for any length of time. What do you think would happen if more than a hundred Christians tried to meet together in one accord for ten days for the purpose of praying together? Probably after the first day there would be a fight. Some would pray to establish a mission, others to set up a chapel, and others to open a seminary. Eventually, they would end up fighting with one another. The only way the one hundred twenty could have been in such oneness before the day of Pentecost was through the resurrected Christ who had come into them as the life-giving Spirit on the day of resurrection. Therefore, in those days prior to Pentecost, the one hundred twenty had been brought back to God, had been baptized into the Triune God, and had received the resurrected Christ as the <em>pneuma</em> to be their life and content. Before Pentecost, they lived and prayed by this life-giving Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY<br />
BECAME THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>On the day of Pentecost, the ascended Christ on the throne poured Himself out as the Spirit of power upon these one hundred twenty believers. Thus, the one hundred twenty disciples passed through three stages: first, they were brought back to God and baptized into Him; second, the resurrected Christ as the Spirit of life was breathed into them; and third, the ascended Christ as the Spirit of power was poured out upon them. Within, they had the resurrected Christ as life; and without, they had the ascended Christ as power. They had the resurrected Christ as their inward content, and they had the ascended Christ as their outward equipment. When they reached that point, they became the church. This is the pattern of the producing of the church. The church is a group of believers who have been brought back to God and baptized into Him, who have had the resurrected Christ as the Spirit of life breathed into them to be their content, and who also have the ascended Christ poured out upon them as their power and equipment. Within, such a group of believers has Christ as life; and without, they have Christ as power. Therefore, they are the church. The principle is still the same today. Wherever there is the church, there is certainly a group of believers who have been brought back to the Triune God and baptized into Him, who have Christ within them as their life, and who have Christ upon them as their equipment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APPLICATION TODAY</h2>
<p>We must apply all these matters to our situation. Perhaps you are meeting in your locality with a group of Christians. Have you all been brought back to God and baptized into Him? Do you have the resurrected Christ within you as the Spirit of life to be your life and content? Do you have the ascended Christ, the Christ enthroned in the heavens, the One who is Lord of all, poured out upon you to be your power and equipment? If you have all this, then you can proclaim to the universe that you are the church.</p>
<p>The church is not a group of Christians meeting together in a ritualistic way. Neither is it a group of believers sighing and groaning about their condition and trying to make themselves holy and righteous. What kind of Christian are you? Are you one who does not pray, sing, or shout, but who constantly sighs, groans, and tries to become holy, clean, and pure? The church is not composed of this kind of Christian. The church is made up of Christians who are praising, singing, and declaring that they are in the Triune God, that they have the resurrected Christ within them, and that they have the ascended Christ upon them. We have no time for sighing and groaning. Rather, our time is for singing and praising the Lord. This is the church against which the gates of Hades cannot prevail. Some may say that we are too proud in saying that we are such a church. I do not care for this criticism. I only care for such a praising, shouting, declaring church. Where are we today? We are in the Triune God! What do we have within us? We have the resurrected Christ within us as our life and content! What do we have upon us? We have the ascended Christ upon us as our power and equipment! Therefore, we are the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals that the church is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23; 1 Cor. 12:12-13). The church can be the Body of Christ only by being constituted with those who are in the Triune God, who have Christ in them as their content, and who have Christ upon them as their equipment. Consider your physical body. Anything that does not have your blood, your life, and your nature cannot be part of your body. A sculptor may fashion a replica of your body out of wood and then paint it to match your coloring. Would you admit that this replica is actually your body? Of course not. Rather, you would say, &ldquo;This is not my body. Cast it into the fire and burn it. To say that such a thing is my body is an insult to me. My body is just part of me. It has my blood, my nature, and my life.&rdquo; Just as our body is part of us, so Christ&rsquo;s Body, the church, is part of Him. First Corinthians 12:12 says, &ldquo;For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is the Christ&rdquo; (Gk.). Christ is not only the Head, but also the Body. Because we are members of the Body, we are part of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:22 and 23 reveal that the church, the Body, is the fullness of Christ. This term, the fullness of Christ, is deep and difficult to understand. It is easier to illustrate it than it is to define it. Consider a certain brother who is very large physically. If this brother were small and thin, he would not have much fullness. But because he is physically large, when we look at him, we see his fullness, which is his large body. If this brother had only a head but no body, he obviously would not have any fullness. In like manner, the Body of Christ, the church, is the fullness of Christ. Christ fills all in all. As One who is universally great, Christ certainly needs a large Body, the church, to be His fullness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FULLNESS COMING OUT OF<br />
THE ENJOYMENT OF THE RICHES</h2>
<p>No matter how large a certain brother may be today, when he was born, he probably weighed less than ten pounds. However, being a full grown man, he may weigh more than two hundred pounds today. If any brother still weighed the same as he did at birth, he certainly would not have any fullness. What poverty it would be for him to weigh the same year after year! How did a tall and heavy brother grow from being less than ten pounds at birth to being more than two hundred pounds today? He grew by eating the riches of his native land, that is, by eating so much chicken, eggs, beef, and milk. By eating all these riches over a period of many years, he gradually gained weight and grew to be large in stature. This illustrates the fact that the fullness comes out of the riches. To be exact, we need to say that the fullness comes out of the enjoyment of the riches. Without the enjoyment of the riches, we and the riches are not related to each other. But through the enjoyment of the riches, the riches become us.</p>
<p>The book of Ephesians speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ. In Ephesians 3:8 Paul said that he preached among the Gentiles &ldquo;the unsearchable riches of Christ.&rdquo; As we have seen, Ephesians also speaks of the fullness of Christ. The riches of Christ are all the many aspects of Christ for our enjoyment. In the messages on who Christ is and what Christ is in His divinity and His humanity, we considered a great many of these aspects, more than sixty items. By eating, digesting, and assimilating these riches of Christ, we become His fullness. This fullness is the church. The church is the issue of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO ENJOY CHRIST</h2>
<p>There is hardly any reality of the church in Christianity today because there is very little enjoyment of Christ. Instead, there is a great deal of knowledge, theological doctrine, and ethical teaching. But there are no practical riches of Christ for the believers to enjoy. Many of you were in Christianity for years. How much of Christ did you enjoy when you were there? Although those you were with claimed to be the church, how much of Christ did they have within them? They might have had the knowledge of the Bible, but they did not have much of Christ digested and assimilated into their being. We do not need to understand Christ. We need to enjoy Him!</p>
<p>For more than seventy-two years, I have been eating foods that I know little or nothing about. When I was in Japan, the Japanese saints served me the best Japanese food. However, I cannot recall the name of even one dish. I simply did not know what it was I was eating. I only know it was good food and that I ate it. When it comes to eating and nourishment, we do not need to know that much. Throughout the years, I have eaten many varieties of food, but to this day I know very little about them. But I do know to eat. The Christ in the Bible is not merely for us to know or understand. Our mentality is too limited to understand Him fully. Hallelujah, Christ is for our enjoyment! Thus, we may say, &ldquo;Amen, Lord Jesus! You are my God, my Creator, and my Lord. Amen, Lord, You are my life, my light, my power, my rock, my wheat, my door, and my pasture. Hallelujah, Lord, You are my everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If your wife gives you a difficult time and you are about to lose your temper, do not try to overcome it. Take this as an opportunity to say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I praise You! You are my life. Hallelujah, You are my righteousness and my sanctification!&rdquo; If you do this, your temper will disappear, and you will be transcendent, far above your situation. This is not merely the overcoming of the temper; it is the enjoyment of Christ. It means very little to overcome your temper. What truly matters is that we enjoy Christ.</p>
<p>The fullness of Christ comes out of Christ. In the years to come, I expect to see the fullness of Christ coming out of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. The church today is the Body of Christ. This Body is simply a part of Christ. As a part of Christ, it is also the fullness of Christ. As the resurrected One, Christ has come into us, and as the ascended One, He has come upon us. But this is not all. Day by day, we need to drink of the one Spirit. To drink of Him is to enjoy Him. First Corinthians 12:13 says, &ldquo;For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit&rdquo; (Gk.). This verse firstly says that we all have been baptized into one Spirit. Then it says that we need to drink of this Spirit. We need to drink of the Spirit continually. Day by day we must drink of this Spirit, taking in something of the all-inclusive Christ for our enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MATURITY AND FUNCTION</h2>
<p>We also need to pray, &ldquo;Father, grant me to be strengthened in my inner man so that Christ may make His home in my heart, in every part of my inner being, and that I may digest and assimilate more of Christ and have more of Christ constituted into me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this way we shall eventually become mature. Although you may be in the Triune God, may have Christ in you, and may have Christ upon you, you may still be immature. Because you are immature, you cannot function in the meetings. You have the necessary organs, but because you are lacking maturity, you are not yet able to function. Maturity comes from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. The more you eat of Christ, the more you mature; and the more you mature, the more you function. This is the church. The church is neither an organization nor a formal assembly. Rather, it is a living organism, a living constitution.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CHURCH AS THE NEW MAN</h1>
<p>The book of Ephesians reveals that the church is also the new man (Eph. 2:15; 4:24). Very few Christians, even Christian teachers, have seen that the church is the new man. Ephesians 2:15 says, &ldquo;Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to create in himself of twain one new man, so making peace&rdquo; (Gk.). Out of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles, Christ created a new man. This proves that the new man in Ephesians is not an individual man, but a corporate man. As the Body, the church needs Christ as life; and as the new man, the church needs Christ not only as life, but also as the person. A man is not like a tree; a man needs a person. A tree needs life, but it does not require a person. However, we not only have life; we also have a person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON</h2>
<p>To have Christ as our person is higher and deeper than having Him as our life. What does it mean to take Christ as your person? We often say that we live by Christ. But in what way do you live by Christ? Is Christ only your life, or is He also your person? Suppose a brother&rsquo;s wife gives him a difficult time. When such difficulties arise, most Christians would say that they need to trust in Christ and look to Him for help. In addition we may realize that we need to take Christ as life. We know that our life is no help in this situation, for our life easily loses its temper. But the life of Christ overcomes our temper. Therefore, in the midst of the difficulty this brother may say, &ldquo;Lord, I trust in You. My life loses its temper, but Your life doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Such a prayer is good, but it is not adequate. When my wife gives me a difficult time, I do not say, &ldquo;Lord, I trust in You. Help me, Lord, with Your life.&rdquo; Although I prayed like this a great deal in the past, I do not pray like this today. Rather, I say, &ldquo;Lord, You are my person. If You are going to lose Your temper, then I will lose my temper as well. Lord, what will You do with my dear wife?&rdquo; If the Lord says, &ldquo;I still love her,&rdquo; then I would say, &ldquo;Amen, Lord, I love her too.&rdquo; In this way I take the Lord as my person. This is not a matter of overcoming my temper by taking the Lord as life. It is absolutely a matter of living by Him as my person. If the Lord tells me that He still loves my wife when she is giving me a difficult time, within I am happy and I can say, &ldquo;Lord, I am happy because You are happy, for You are my person. Hallelujah!&rdquo; There is a great difference between taking the Lord as our life and taking Him as our person.</p>
<p>In my ministry I often said in the past, &ldquo;Lord, strengthen me and give me power and utterance.&rdquo; Although I still sometimes pray like this, many times I simply say, &ldquo;Lord, the time for ministry has come. You are my person, Lord. Will You be speaking?&rdquo; If the Lord says, &ldquo;Yes, I shall be speaking,&rdquo; then I say, &ldquo;Lord, since You are speaking, I shall speak also. But if You don&rsquo;t speak, I won&rsquo;t speak either, because You are my person.&rdquo; In the past I prayed, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, please tell me the message You want me to speak.&rdquo; Before I left the United States to come to Germany, some of the saints asked me what I would be ministering in Stuttgart. I told them that I did not know. And truly I did not know. I did not know even after I had arrived in Stuttgart. I did not even know the night before this conference began. But I did realize that it was not I who would be speaking; it was Christ, who is my person. Thus, that night I had a sound sleep. The next morning I said, &ldquo;Lord, what are You going to speak on at this conference?&rdquo; In a few minutes the Lord said, &ldquo;The kernel of the Bible,&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;Amen, Lord.&rdquo; From this experience of mine we see that Christ is not only our life, but also our person. We are the new man, and Christ is our person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SLAYING THE ORDINANCES</h2>
<p>It is not a simple matter to take Christ as our person. Ephesians 2:15 says, &ldquo;Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to create in himself of twain one new man, so making peace.&rdquo; In order to create the new man, Christ had to die. Most Christian teachers say that Christ died on the cross to deal with our sins, the world, the flesh, and the old man. Although I have read a number of books on the cross, not one of them said that Christ died on the cross not only to deal with sin, self, and the old man, but also to slay the ordinances that the new man might be created. These ordinances separated the Jews from the Gentiles. The Jews keep the Sabbath and do not eat swine, but the Gentiles do not keep the Sabbath and they do eat swine. In order to create one new man, Christ had to slay all the ordinances.</p>
<p>However, Christians today have many new ordinances. Although we may not be conscious of being under ordinances, we actually are under them. For some who were born and raised in Christianity, their concepts have become their ordinances. For example, according to their concept, a Christian service of worship must be quiet. If a Christian with this concept visits a meeting where there is shouting and praising, he will disapprove and withdraw from the Christians in that meeting. His ordinance concerning quietness in the meetings separates him from those Christians who enjoy praising the Lord and shouting.</p><h2 class="head1">SOME EXAMPLES OF ORDINANCES</h2>
<p>One day a sister told me about a Brethren assembly in Vancouver, British Columbia, that was divided over the matter of using a piano and organ in the meetings. One group was in favor of the organ, but not the piano, and the other group favored the piano, but not the organ. As a result they were divided into two assemblies, the organ assembly and the piano assembly. This division came from their ordinances.</p>
<p>In 1963 in Los Angeles the leaders of at least three particular groups came together with the desire to practice the church life. When this was proposed to me, I said, &ldquo;It is wonderful for us Christians to come together. However, I must remind you that believers have been divided by different teachings, opinions, and ordinances.&rdquo; Among these groups one had a Brethren background, and another had a charismatic background. As every Christian knows, these two kinds of groups could never get along together. Nevertheless, at that time they all agreed to meet together. Then I said, &ldquo;Both those with the Brethren background and those with the Pentecostal background must drop their opinions, practices, and ordinances. If not, you will never be one.&rdquo; Those in all the groups agreed to drop their opinions and ordinances. Thus, they came together. The first meeting was held the first Sunday of March, 1963. I was present in that meeting, and it was rather good. There were no ordinances. The following Sunday I was in New York. In that meeting the ones with the Pentecostal background began to speak in tongues, and those with the Brethren background attempted to stop them. This resulted in a fight in the meeting. The next day I received a phone call telling me to come back to take care of the situation. The brother who called was one from a Brethren background. He said that some sisters had not only spoken in tongues, but even played tambourines. I asked him what was wrong with the tambourines, and I told him to come together and forget about the ordinances. I reminded him that they all had said amen to my word about dropping their ordinances. However, the brother said that he could not tolerate this situation. Soon I returned to Los Angeles. Those from the Brethren background told me that they could not tolerate the playing of the tambourine in the meeting. I said, &ldquo;Brothers, in the eyes of the Lord, what is the difference between a piano and a tambourine?&rdquo; When they admitted that there was no difference, I said, &ldquo;Since there is no difference in the eyes of the Lord between a piano and a tambourine, why would you accept the playing of the piano, but refuse to tolerate the playing of the tambourine?&rdquo; They said that they did not like it and that they would not take it. They would accept a piano, but not a tambourine. I said, &ldquo;Brothers, if this is your attitude, then our joint meeting is through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this, I spoke with those who practiced speaking in tongues. I said, &ldquo;Brothers, I have learned that last Sunday some of you spoke in tongues and played the tambourine.&rdquo; When I said this, they became very touchy and replied, &ldquo;Brother Lee, those brothers don&rsquo;t know their spirit. When we spoke in tongues, they called a hymn to stop us.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Brothers, from the very beginning I told you that in order to have a joint meeting with the leaders from different backgrounds, we all had to drop our practices and opinions. But if you insist on speaking in tongues and playing the tambourine, eventually the others will stop coming to the meetings, and you will be the only ones left. What then would be the use for us to come together?&rdquo; Then they said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, do you like the playing of tambourines and speaking in tongues?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;It is not a matter of what I like or don&rsquo;t like. It is a matter of having the church life. If I had the church life according to my preference, that would not be the church life. Rather, it will be something according to my choice.&rdquo; Eventually, those on both sides took my word and agreed to come together again. However, when we came together, those from the Pentecostal background still cared only for speaking in tongues and playing the tambourines. They had forgotten what I had said to them and their agreement. Those from the Brethren background looked down upon those who spoke in tongues and did everything possible to control the meeting. As time went by, the tongue-speakers gradually departed. What remained was a group of people talking about the Bible in the way of dead knowledge. They killed everything.</p>
<p>The problem today is that every group of Christians has its own ordinances. Some, turning the question to me, have asked, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Yes, we do, but these are not our ordinances. Sometimes we practice pray-reading in the meetings and sometimes we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; But some began to oppose the matter of pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord, saying it was the release of the soul, not the release of the spirit. When I heard that a particular brother had opposed pray-reading and calling on the Lord, I said to the brother who had informed me of this, &ldquo;Please ask him this question: While you are condemning pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord, are you speaking from your spirit or from your soul?&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">MEETING ACCORDING TO CHRIST</h2>
<p>By giving these illustrations I simply wish to point out our need to drop all the ordinances. If some saints desire to speak in tongues, give them that liberty. Although you may not like it, you should not stop them. If some saints receive profit from calling on the name of the Lord, we should not criticize them. We have no ordinances regarding this matter. If we still have ordinances, we cannot have the new man. To have the new man all the ordinances must be slain. It is not a matter of a loud meeting or a quiet meeting. It is a matter of a meeting according to Christ. We should have no preferences. When I am hungry, I have no preference; I simply desire to eat. One day the Lord&rsquo;s disciples were hungry and broke the Sabbath by eating grain. Today the saints must have the same liberty. We should not keep any regulations. Because the Brethren observe certain regulations, they kill their meetings. But we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery must never set up regulations in the church life. Rather, we must come together as the Spirit leads. We do not have regulations; we have the living Spirit. As He leads, we move and act. But this also requires our cooperation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ORDINANCES VERSUS THE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>Throughout the years, saints from various backgrounds have come to our meetings and tried to convince us to take their way. We told them that we could not take their way. If we did, we would be sectarian, just as they were. Although we did not ask them to change, we told them that they could not expect us to take their way. Neither would we expect them to take our way. Deep within, you may feel that you do not like our kind of meeting. Who are you to criticize? Are you the Lord? Are you sure that you are one hundred percent right? None of us can be sure of this. Thus, we must learn to let others have their liberty. Those who criticize us are narrow-minded. In the past a number have tried to convince us to take speaking in tongues. We replied, &ldquo;If you like to speak in tongues, feel free to do it in the meetings. We will not stop you. But neither will we be convinced by you to practice a meeting centered on speaking in tongues. If we did this, we would lose our ground of being general.&rdquo; Others may enjoy pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord. Who are you to criticize it, or to say that only your way is the right way? This is neither right nor fair. If you are not happy with the practice of pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord in the meetings, then do not do it. But do not criticize others for doing it. Have you never read Romans 14? A very clear word is given in Romans 14:2 and 3: &ldquo;One believes that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables. Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats, for God has received him.&rdquo; If we do not drop the ordinances, it will be impossible to have the new man. Rather, we shall be a sect.</p>
<p>Some who read this message may already have been poisoned by the rumors that we are narrow and that we like to convince all others to be like us. This is an absolute lie. We have no intention of convincing others. Our expectation is that other Christians would give us liberty and that we would give them liberty. This surely is a fair attitude. If you do not like to speak in tongues, then do not speak in tongues. But if I want to do it, please give me the liberty to do so. I may be profited by my speaking in tongues. What is wrong with this? You may not agree with the matter of calling on the name of the Lord. But why must you criticize us for calling on His name? We are nourished when we call on Him. There is no reason for you to reject it. Look at today&rsquo;s pitiful situation. Where is the new man? Instead of the new man, there are ordinances everywhere. Some of our brothers attended certain meetings and at the beginning they were charged not to say a word. They were told that if they said anything, they would be disciplined and put out of the meeting. What a sectarian spirit this is! This is dictatorship. How could anyone with such an attitude have the new man? Throughout the years, thousands of people have visited our meetings. We have not forbidden anyone to speak; our meetings are open. If you want to say something, you are free to do so. If I attend your meeting, will you have the same attitude? If I began to speak, would you stop me?</p>
<p>It is those who are narrow themselves who condemn others for being narrow. Brother Nee once told us that only robbers are afraid that others would steal from them. If you are not one who steals from others, you will not have the fear that others will steal from you. If I am afraid that the brother standing near me will steal my wallet, surely I must be a thief myself. Likewise, those who accuse us of being narrow are the ones who are narrow. Examine the situation of their meetings to see if their meetings are open.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO CHANGE</h2>
<p>Although today&rsquo;s situation is so pitiful, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we have been recovered. We do not care for ordinances. We care for the new man. Brothers, do you still hold to certain ordinances in your locality? You may say that you have learned the way of Anaheim. But after a few months, Anaheim may change. I have been condemned for constantly changing. Twenty-five years ago, I was forty-seven years of age; today I am seventy-two years of age. Certainly I have changed during the past twenty-five years. I changed because I am growing. But a stone image like those of Mary in front of Catholic cathedrals will not change. During the twenty years I was with Brother Nee, he had four great changes. If necessary, I can prove the fact that he changed by his writings. He told me that it was necessary for us to change. As the years go by, we expect to have further changes. Eleven years ago we did not have pray-reading. In Los Angeles from 1967, we began to have it. Perhaps in the future we shall dig something more out of the deep mine of God&rsquo;s Word. Then we may have another change. If we would change, our critics would probably condemn us for it. Hallelujah, we are changing! We do not expect to stop changing until we reach eternity. Until then, we are growing and changing. Praise the Lord that we are the new man! As the new man, we do not need ordinances. Rather, we have Christ as our life and as our person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HUMAN SPIRIT IN EPHESIANS</h2>
<p>The human spirit is mentioned in each of the six chapters of Ephesians. Ephesians 1:17 says, &ldquo;That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him&rdquo; (Gk.). The spirit here is not the Holy Spirit, but our human spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:22 says, &ldquo;In whom ye also are being builded together into a habitation of God in spirit&rdquo; (Gk.). This verse also refers to our human spirit, not to the Holy Spirit, as the habitation of God. God&rsquo;s habitation is in our spirit. The Holy Spirit of God is the dweller, not the habitation.</p>
<p>Ephesians 3:5 says, &ldquo;Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in spirit&rdquo; (Gk.). The revelation of God&rsquo;s mystery is given to our spirit. In order to see or touch anything, we must use the proper organ. In order to see the revelation of the mystery, we need a spirit. In this matter our mentality does not work, for the more you think about the mystery, the more you will be in darkness. In order to see spiritual things, we need the spirit.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:23 says, &ldquo;And be renewed in the spirit of your mind.&rdquo; Ephesians 4:22 tells us to put off the old man, and verse 24 speaks of putting on the new man. The way to put off the old man and put on the new man is to be renewed in the spirit of our mind. The &ldquo;spirit of your mind&rdquo; is a special term. It means that the spirit has spread into our mind, thus becoming the spirit in our mind. It also proves that our mind has been taken over by the spirit. In other words, it reveals that our natural mind has become a spiritual mind, for in our mind there is the spirit. It is by the spirit spreading into our mind that we are renewed. We need to be renewed in our mind. Then we shall put off the old man and put on the new man.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5:18 says, &ldquo;Be filled in spirit&rdquo; (Gk.). We do not need to be filled with wine; we need to be filled with the Lord in our spirit. We should not have an empty spirit. Rather, our spirit must be filled with God.</p>
<p>According to the Greek text, Ephesians 6:17 and 18 read, &ldquo;And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit.&rdquo; Verse 18 reveals that we must pray at every time in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO BE IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In this book concerning the church there are these six verses regarding the spirit. If we would see the church, we must learn to be in the spirit. Anyone who is dissenting is certainly in the mind. However, if such a one would turn from the mind to the spirit and remain in the spirit, he would be a different person. In the mind you are one kind of person, and in the spirit you are another kind of person. Suppose I begin to think that my wife is not treating me very well, that she is not taking proper care of me. The more I think these thoughts, the angrier I will become. But if, as I am thinking these things concerning my wife, I turn from my mind to my spirit, I shall immediately become another person. In principle, it is the same concerning the church. You may be a rather thoughtful person and think, &ldquo;Is this the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? If it is, then why is the number so small? I see very few people among them who have doctoral degrees.&rdquo; However, if, instead of exercising your mind, you turn to the spirit, you will say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord!&rdquo; The church is absolutely in the spirit. It is not in our mind or understanding.</p>
<p>All the saints who come into the church enjoy a church life honeymoon. When they are on their honeymoon, they say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! I am in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery! I am in the church and I am for the church! Hallelujah!&rdquo; However, no honeymoon lasts very long. Sooner or later, your honeymoon in the church will be over. At that time your mind will be very active, and you will begin to examine the brothers. When you were on your church life honeymoon, everyone was wonderful. It seemed that all the saints were angels. But when the honeymoon is over, everyone becomes a turtle in your eyes. It seems that no one is good. Do not stay in the low valley of the mind filled with rocks, turtles, and snakes. Get yourself to the mountaintop in your spirit. Whenever you turn to the spirit, you find yourself on the top of a mountain where you hear the singing of birds and see the leaping of hinds. However, if you stay in the valley filled with turtles, frogs, and snakes, you will question the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. You will ask why there are so many turtles and frogs. Then you will say, &ldquo;If this is not it, then where shall I go?&rdquo; If you go anywhere, you will go from one valley full of snakes to another. The only place to go is to your spirit. When you call on the name of the Lord Jesus, you will be on the top of the mountain. We need to pray, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, give us a spirit of wisdom. Lord, help us to stay in our spirit where Your habitation is. O Lord, fill our spirit.&rdquo; If we do this, we all will be new. We shall not only be a new church, but also be a new man. Daily the oldness will fall off, and the ordinances will be dropped.</p>
<p>The church is in our spirit. Never be bothered by outward things. The church is all-inclusive, open to all Christians. Do not be troubled by those whose practice is different from yours. Give them liberty. Instead of being bothered, turn to the spirit. The more we turn to our spirit, the more Christ will increase within us. Eventually, the riches of Christ will come out of us to nourish the new ones and to transform them. There is no need to adjust others, for this rich Christ will transform them. Eventually, they will become tired of playing with their toys. I have seen many who spontaneously dropped their toys after receiving the nourishment of Christ. The church life is just Christ filling us, changing us and others, and transforming the whole Body. We do not have regulations, creeds, or ordinances. We have only the living, rich Christ in our spirit. This Christ is growing, increasing, changing us and others, and building the church as the new man. This is the church life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LORD&rsquo;S NEED FOR CHURCHES</h1>
<p>In this message we come to the book of Revelation, the consummation of the Bible. In the preceding messages we have followed the line of the kernel of the Bible. Firstly we saw that in the book of Genesis God gained a transformed Israel. Then, in the book of Exodus, He gained a tabernacle, and, following that, in 1 Kings, a temple. After the captivity in Babylon, the Lord gained the rebuilt temple. In the New Testament we have seen how rich Christ is in His divinity and humanity. Christ is unsearchably rich. The enjoyment of this rich Christ issues in the proper church life. Thus, in the New Testament we have firstly Christ and then the church.</p>
<p>In the book of Revelation we see seven churches, the seven golden lampstands. At the end of this book we see the unique universal golden lampstand, the New Jerusalem. In this message and in the one following we need to consider these seven lampstands and the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WRITTEN TO CHURCHES</h2>
<p>The book of Revelation was not written to individuals. It is a book written to churches. The Apostle John did not send this book to individual Christians, but to seven churches. Only by standing in the churches do we have the right angle to see what is written in this book. As we all know, in order to see or hear anything, we need the right angle. When I face a certain direction, I cannot see what is behind me. If I want to see what is behind me, I must turn. Without making such a turn, I am not able to see anything. If I were not standing with the churches and in the churches, it would be difficult for me to see what is written in this book. The book of Revelation is closed to many Christians because they are not standing with the churches. Although this book is for all the saints, so many of the saints are not standing with the churches. Therefore, they are not able to see what this book contains. Throughout the centuries for the most part Revelation has been a closed book. Although the saints have read through this book again and again, they have not been able to see what is in it. Praise the Lord that by standing with the churches, we can clearly see the things in this book!</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST IN GOD&rsquo;S HABITATION</h2>
<p>At the beginning of Revelation we see seven golden lampstands, and at the end we see the New Jerusalem. Both the seven lampstands and the New Jerusalem refer to God&rsquo;s building, the church, the eternal habitation of God. In this book we not only see the church, the eternal habitation of God; we also see Christ. Among the churches and in the New Jerusalem there is Christ. Thus, if we would see Christ, we must be in the churches and among the churches, because Christ is walking in the midst of the churches. Today, He is in the churches, and in eternity, He will be in the New Jerusalem. To see Him, we must be in God&rsquo;s habitation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REVELATION SEEN ONLY IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Revelation 1:10 indicates that John saw the vision in his spirit, not in his mind. This verse says, &ldquo;I was in spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s day.&rdquo; This book is full of spiritual revelation. But spiritual revelation can be seen only by our spirit. Although our mind may understand many things, it cannot see spiritual revelation. For this, we need to be in spirit. Therefore, in Ephesians 1:17 Paul prayed, &ldquo;That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him&rdquo; (Gk.). How much we need revelation! However, we can receive revelation only in our spirit. To see the churches and the New Jerusalem we must exercise our spirit.</p>
<p>I am sorry to say that some Christians are not clear that they have a spirit. Some think that the spirit is the same as the mind. Perhaps some of you have this concept. If you do, it is an indication that you are not clear that you have a spirit. You daily exercise your mind to think, consider, study, and research. But because you are not clear that you have a spirit, you cannot exercise your spirit.</p>
<p>Atheists are those who do not believe in God. The reason they do not believe in God is that the organ that substantiates God, the spirit, is deadened. Our nose is the organ that substantiates odors. If for some reason my nose does not function, I shall not be able to detect a particular odor that may be in the room. Thus, I would say that this odor does not exist. Actually, the odor exists. The problem is that I lack the organ to substantiate it. It is the same with the perception of colors. Although I may be surrounded with beautiful colors, if I have no sight, I have no means to substantiate them. In like manner, the spiritual things exist, but if we do not know to exercise our spirit, we cannot substantiate them. We lack the power to substantiate the existence of spiritual things.</p>
<p>Some saints are clear that they have a spirit, but they do not exercise it. As we grew up, we were all trained to exercise our mind. Thus, we are not accustomed to using our spirit. For this reason, many who know they have a spirit do not exercise their spirit. Suppose someone would shut his eyes and say, &ldquo;You claim that there are many pretty colors in the room. What are you talking about? I cannot hear them. Have you really seen these colors, and are they truly beautiful? Why can&rsquo;t I hear?&rdquo; What nonsense! When it comes to seeing colors, you must forget your ears and open your eyes. Then you will behold the beautiful colors that are around you. In like manner, we need to exercise our spirit to see the churches. Although you may have read the book of Revelation many times, you may have never seen the churches in this book. Many spent time to study the book of Revelation. For the most part they saw the frogs, the locusts, the ten horns, and the great dragon, but they were not much impressed with the seven lampstands, nor the New Jerusalem. When you read the book of Revelation in the past, did you see the churches and the New Jerusalem? When I read the book of Revelation as a youth, I wanted to know about the ten horns, the locusts, and the frogs, but I had no desire to know about the seven lampstands. In this message we are not concerned with horns, locusts, and frogs. We are interested in seeing the seven golden lampstands, the seven churches.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO BE IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Today many Christians are talking about the church, the Body. But they do not know the churches. Although they are talking about the church, they are not in the church. Without the churches, we cannot be in the church. Where is the church? Are you in it? Were you in the church ten years ago, five years ago, five weeks ago? In the past, we were not in the church. We were with other Christians, but deep within we realized that that gathering of Christians was not the church. According to the book of Revelation, the churches are not in the heavens; they are in cities on the earth. If you are not in one of the churches, you are not in the church, no matter how much you talk about the church. To contact the church and be in it, you need the local church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ACCORDING TO ITS KIND</h2>
<p>Consider the type of the church in Genesis 2. After God had created all the animals, He eventually created man. However, God did not create a wife for man. Rather, He brought the living creatures to Adam and showed them to him. Adam seemed to say, &ldquo;Those do not look like me. That is a horse, that is a turtle, and that is a lamb.&rdquo; As the animals were presented to Adam one by one, he did not find one that could match him. A turtle is a turtle, a horse is a horse, and a wife is a wife. And I would also say that a denomination is a denomination, a free group is a free group, and a church is a church.</p>
<p>In the past some dear friends tried their best to argue with me, saying, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you claim that you are the church. Why are we not the church?&rdquo; I answered them very simply and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you call yourselves Presbyterians and Baptists? Now you come to argue with me saying that you are the church. If you are the church, why don&rsquo;t you call yourself the church?&rdquo; Then they said, &ldquo;The names Baptist and Presbyterian are merely denominational names. They don&rsquo;t mean anything.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I am glad to hear that these names mean nothing. Since they do not mean anything, why don&rsquo;t you drop them? Why still hold on to something that has no meaning?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;Brother Lee, how can we drop these names?&rdquo; I pointed out that their words were contradictory. On the one hand, they said that the name meant nothing; on the other hand, they said that they could not drop their names. Then I asked, &ldquo;What is this? If you are the church, then say you are the church. Suppose a woman wearing a name tag that says &lsquo;Mrs. Jones&rsquo; comes to you and claims to be Mrs. Smith. I would say, &lsquo;If you are Mrs. Smith, why do you bear the name of Mrs. Jones? If you say that this is just a name and that it means nothing, then I would tell you to drop it. If you find it difficult to drop that name, it must prove that you are Mrs. Jones, not Mrs. Smith.&rsquo; Brothers, if you are the church, why do you call yourselves Presbyterians, Baptists, and Lutherans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day I pointed out to a friend that there was a group called the Church of England in China and that there was a group called the Chinese Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. What confusion this is! According to Genesis 1, everything is after its kind. A sheep is after its kind, a horse is after its kind, and an ox is after its kind. But what are the Church of England in China and the Chinese Presbyterian Church in the United States of America? They certainly are not according to their kind. The head of the Church of England is the Queen, and every British subject is considered a member of the Church of England. In order to be a member of the Church of England, there is no need to be reborn. Natural birth is sufficient. Is such a thing the church? Is it according to its kind? Certainly not!</p>
<h2 class="head1">WHY WE SAY THAT WE ARE THE CHURCH<br />
IN A CERTAIN LOCALITY</h2>
<p>In 1963 I was invited to speak to a group of Christians in Missouri. At the end of one of the meetings, my host asked me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, why do you call yourselves the church in Los Angeles?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;The church in Los Angeles includes all the saints in Los Angeles. But so many of them do not meet with the church. Rather, they stay with the denominations. Only a small number are willing to meet with the church. Consider the example of the Smith family. Suppose the Smith family has twenty-six members and that nineteen of them have left the family. Only seven remain at home. Are those seven not the Smith family? If they are not the Smith family, then what are they? We realize that all the Christians in Los Angeles are part of the church. But most do not want to be with the church. Thousands are in the Catholic Church and in the denominations. If we, the small number who want to remain in the church, do not call ourselves the church, then what would you call us? Give us a name. Any name you give us will simply cause trouble. So many members of the Smith family have gone away. Some have gone to the movies, others to the seashore, and others to the dance hall. Only seven are at home. Nevertheless, those seven certainly are the Smith family.&rdquo; They had to admit that we were right in saying that we are the church in Los Angeles. However, after that time, some began to doubt, saying, &ldquo;Is that really the Smith family? The Smith family includes twenty-six members. How can those seven say that they are the Smith family?&rdquo; Brothers, this is a day of confusion and division, and we must be on the alert. We must know how to discern what the church is. We need the local church in order to be in the church. Many of us can testify what a blessing it has been to touch the church. We can testify that we are in the proper church life. We do not care for the number. Even if the Smith family has only a few members remaining, they are still the Smith family.</p><h2 class="head1">THE STANDING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Today, at the end of this age, there is need for the recovery of the churches. There needs to be a church in Rome and in every major city in Europe. In the city of Rome there are certainly a good number of saved ones, even among the Catholics. But these true believers are still in the wrong place. If even a small number would take the standing of the church in Rome, there would be a genuine local church there. If that small number standing as the church are not the church, then what would you call them? Some may argue that the church in Rome includes all the believers. But do you think it is possible to bring all the true believers in the Catholic Church living in Rome back to the church? This is impossible. Whether or not we are the church depends upon our standing. If we are standing upon any divisive ground, we are not the church; we are a division. But as long as we are standing on the ground of unity, we are the church in our locality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCHES</h2>
<p>The time is short. The Lord is coming soon. As we have pointed out, before His coming back, He needs to complete the building of the church. It would be a shame to Him to come back without finishing this. Look at today&rsquo;s Christianity. Look at the Catholic Church, the denominations, and the free groups. What a mess! What a confusion! Is not all this a shame to the Lord? How could He come back to such a situation? Where is the fulfillment of His word in Matthew 16 that He will build His church? Where is the church built upon the rock? For the sake of His coming back, the Lord must build the church.</p>
<p>Now I want to say strongly that the Lord must build His church in the territory of Antichrist. Before Antichrist appears, the Lord Jesus must build His churches in Western Europe. Although many Christians are waiting for the Lord to come back, He is waiting for the building up of His churches. Praise the Lord that our eyes have been opened to see the need of the building of the local churches! In Italy, France, Switzerland, England, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway there is such a need. How I long that you all would be burdened to go to the major cities in Europe that the Lord might have a church in each of them! You need to say, &ldquo;Lord, burden me to go to Paris for the church life. Lord, burden me to go to Rome so that You may have a church there. O Lord, burden me for a church in Stockholm.&rdquo; If you are faithful to the Lord, honest with Him, and willing to be burdened, even five or seven could move to a city to start the church life there. So many cities need a shining lampstand. Paris needs one! Geneva needs one! Western Europe is not a heathen land like Mongolia or Tibet. It is an old region saturated with Christianity. But where is the church? Although this is a land of Christendom, of Christianity, where is the church? Can the Lord Jesus come back to the Church of England? Can He come back to the confusion in the free groups? If the Lord came back today, He would be ashamed because the Bride has not been prepared. Suppose it is the day of your wedding, and your bride is not present. Would that not be a shame to you? Certainly no bridegroom would come, stand, and wait for his bride until he was assured that she was prepared and adorned for him. The Lord Jesus is coming as the Bridegroom for the Bride. But where is the Bride in all of Western Europe?</p>
<p>This is not a matter of doctrine. I hate the mere doctrine of the church. I want to see some genuine, living churches. I do not care for the number that are in these churches. If there could be a church in Rome with a hundred fifty people who are shining, filled with Christ, and immersed in Christ, the Lord would be able to boast to Satan. He could say, &ldquo;Satan, in your city of Rome I have a shining church!&rdquo; Brothers, you all must be burdened for the churches in Europe. What is the use of merely studying the Bible, attending conferences, and listening to messages? The Lord needs churches. Young people, the Lord needs churches, and you must bear the burden for this. Surely the Lord desires a church in Madrid, the capital of the old Catholic country of Spain. Who is willing to be burdened to go there? The Lord is calling for this. Who will go to Paris? To London? To Rome? In these dark cities there is no lampstand. Oh, the Lord is calling! Who is willing to be burdened to go to a major city in Europe so that the Lord may have a church there? The Lord is calling! He is calling you and me to bear the burden for the major cities in Europe that He may have churches built up in the territory of the coming Antichrist. Go and tell others that today the Lord needs churches!</p><h2 class="head1">CONSECRATION, THE ONLY WAY</h2>
<p>Some may wonder how we can be used by the Lord for the spread of the churches. The only way is to consecrate yourself every morning and every evening, day after day. Again and again you need to pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I consecrate myself to You. I offer myself to You for Your church.&rdquo; If you do this, the Lord will open the way. Something will happen. The Lord will lead you to someone, or He will lead someone to you. You and that other person will be one, and something will be accomplished. I assure you that something will be worked out. Do not follow the old track, the old religion, and do not follow the free groups. Do not follow any vain talk, vain teachings, or vain messages concerning the church. You must claim something practical and say, &ldquo;Lord, I hate vain talk. Lord, I want to see a practical church in the place where I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forty-five years ago I was in a situation where there was no church. Every morning I rose up early, went to the top of a mountain, and prayed to the Lord. No one had taught me to call on His name, but there on the mountain I practiced calling on the Lord. Every morning I cried to the Lord, calling on His name and saying, &ldquo;Lord, what do You want me to do? Lord, as a young man, I am here and I am ready. I am ready for You, for Your interests, for Your kingdom and for Your move on earth.&rdquo; I prayed like this for nine months. Eventually, in that city the Lord started the church life, and that church became very prevailing. Because of that church, many churches were raised up in the north, northeast, and northwest of China. Oh, the Lord is able! He can do it! But it all depends on you. Are you willing for this?</p>
<p>You do not need to know much doctrine or be that &ldquo;spiritual.&rdquo; Look at Peter, John, and the other early Apostles. Some of them were young fishermen still working with their fathers when the Lord called them. They did not have any college degrees. But the Lord called them and spent three and a half years with them. I have spent a good deal of time to find out how old the Apostles were when the Lord Jesus called them. I am convinced that Peter was not more than twenty-five years old when he was called. He was still a young man when he became an elder in Jerusalem, the first local church. All the elders of that first church were young people. I am assured that none of them was more than thirty. The Lord&rsquo;s move is always with the young people. The young people will turn the age. David turned his age, and Daniel turned his age. Do not think that you are too young. You do not need a college degree in order to be in the church life. Everything depends upon your heart, upon whether or not you are willing to pay the price. Are you willing to sacrifice? If you are, the Lord will use you. I know what I am talking about. I did not receive a college degree or graduate from a seminary. But a church was raised up.</p>
<p>You do not need graduation; you need consecration. And do not consecrate yourself merely occasionally. It will not work if you consecrate yourself every few years. Rather, you must consecrate yourself day after day, again and again. Consecration is the secret. For the sake of the raising up of churches in Europe, there is an urgent need for consecration. It is by our consecration that the Lord will have a way to raise up more local churches.</p>
<p>If you read Revelation 2 and 3, you will see that again and again the Lord is calling the overcomers. The overcomers according to Revelation 2 and 3 are those who overcome degraded Christianity, those who overcome the present situation of Christianity. In order to overcome the present situation of Christianity, we must answer the Lord&rsquo;s call and offer ourselves to Him. We must say, &ldquo;Lord, I know You are moving on. You are for something new, and I am ready to move on with You. Lord, I am one with You for Your move. Lord, have mercy on me, and do not leave me behind. As You are moving on, take me in Your hand and carry me on.&rdquo; This is the way to pray. The Apostle Peter, a fisherman, did not go to school for several years, graduate, and get ordained. He was a fisherman who gave himself to the Lord. That was sufficient. Young people, you need to give yourselves to the Lord and follow Him in the churches for a few years. At the end of this time, you will be equipped and qualified. This is what the Lord needs today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CRUCIAL MATTER OF EATING</h2>
<p>In the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 the crucial matter related to the churches is eating. To those in the church in Ephesus the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God&rdquo; (Rev. 2:7). To those in the church in Pergamos He said, &ldquo;To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna&rdquo; (Rev. 2:17). To those in the church in Laodicea He said, &ldquo;Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me&rdquo; (Rev. 3:20). In the midst of the degradation of Christianity, we must eat Jesus as the tree of life and as the hidden manna, and enjoy Him as a feast. If we do this, we shall grow and be qualified for the Lord&rsquo;s move on earth today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING, TRANSFORMATION, AND BUILDING</h2>
<p>In Revelation 2:17 not only did the Lord speak of the hidden manna; He also said that He would give the over-comer a white stone. This stone indicates that those who eat the Lord as the hidden manna will be transformed into a white stone for God&rsquo;s building. If we eat Jesus daily, we shall be transformed into stones, the material for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>The building is also referred to in Revelation 3:12, which says, &ldquo;He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.&rdquo; In all these verses we see eating, transformation, and building. If we eat Jesus, we shall be transformed and built up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TEACHINGS CONDEMNED BY THE LORD JESUS</h2>
<p>Along with speaking concerning eating, transformation, and building, in these seven epistles the Lord condemns the teaching of Balaam, the teaching of the Nicolaitans, the teaching of Jezebel, and the teaching of the depths of Satan. Although there are all kinds of teachings in Christianity, the Lord Jesus in these seven epistles condemns the teachings and encourages the believers to eat Him as the tree of life and as the hidden manna and to feast with Him. We also must reject the teachings of Balaam, of the Nicolaitans, of Jezebel, and of the depths of Satan.</p>
<p>Some may argue that the teachings the Lord Jesus commands us to reject are all wrong teachings. That is correct. But are you sure that the teachings you received are correct? How do you know they are? Perhaps you have already been deceived and cheated, although you are entirely innocent. You think that all the teachings you have received are very good. You do not realize that these good teachings have poisoned you. A number of believers could have been good material and could have been used by the Lord for His church. But they have been poisoned, deceived, and distracted from the proper church life by the teachings they received in the past. Take counterfeit money as an example. How do you know that the currency you have is not counterfeit? Do not say that the bills others have are false and that yours are genuine. You may be deceiving yourself. In like manner, do not say that others have received wrong teachings and that the teachings you have received are right. Perhaps you also have taken in some inaccurate teachings. If you are in doubt about the validity of paper money, do not accept any paper money at all. In its place, take only gold. Do not trust in your discernment. Trust in the gold. Do not have an appetite for teachings, for you may not have the discernment to determine which are correct and which are false. No counterfeit money bears a mark saying that it is counterfeit. Rather, every false bill is nearly the same as a genuine one. Therefore, if in doubt, accept only gold.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NEW JERUSALEM</h1>
<h2 class="head1">TWO CONSUMMATIONS</h2>
<p>The Bible ends with the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2). This means that New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of all the positive things in the Bible. In the same principle, the consummation of all the negative things is the lake of fire. At the end of the Bible there are two consummations, one represented by a city and the other represented by a lake. The city is a city of water, and the lake is a lake of fire. New Jerusalem is a city of living water. Because this living water flows throughout the city, it will never be dry. The lake is a lake of fire. Everything in it burns. Without exception, all the positive things will be gathered into the city of water, and all the negative things will be cast into the lake of fire. Antichrist and his companion, the false prophet, will be the first to be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 19:20). All those who follow them to fight against Christ will also go there. Later, Satan, his angels, and all the sinners will also be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:10, 15). Eventually, even the demons, death, and Hades will be put there (Rev. 20:13-14). Therefore, the lake of fire is a universal &ldquo;trash can.&rdquo; Everything that is not of God, that is against God, or that is considered by God as trash will go into the lake of fire. I trust that no one reading this message will end up in the lake of fire. But what about the work you are doing? Will your work go to the lake of fire or to the New Jerusalem, the eternal habitation of God? Here in the eternal habitation of God, everything is positive. Every positive thing in the Bible can be found there.</p>
<p>This matter of the New Jerusalem has never been adequately opened to Christians. Perhaps Revelation 21 and 22 have been closed to you for years. Although you have read these chapters again and again, you simply could not see anything. In this message I want to point out various aspects of New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TREE OF LIFE</h2>
<p>After God created man, He placed him in a garden in front of the tree of life (Gen. 2:8-9). Thus, immediately after the creation of man, the tree of life was mentioned. The tree of life is one of the outstanding features of New Jerusalem. Revelation 22:14 indicates that the tree of life is in the New Jerusalem. This verse says, &ldquo;Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city.&rdquo; In the first two chapters of the Bible we see the old heaven, the old earth, the old garden, Adam, and the tree of life. In the last two chapters of the Bible we see the new heaven, the new earth, and the city with the tree of life. In this city we do not see Adam, but Israel and the Apostles representing the new man. In the garden in Genesis there was the old man; in the city in Revelation there is the corporate new man. In the garden there was the tree of life, and in the city there is also the tree of life. Although the heaven and earth have changed, the garden has been changed into the city, and the first man has been changed into the corporate new man, the tree of life remains unchanged. Everything has been changed or improved except the tree of life. From the beginning to the end, the tree of life remains the same. Hallelujah, the tree of life never changes!</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIGHT</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:3 says, &ldquo;And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.&rdquo; In Genesis 1:14-18 we see that God created the light-bearers, the sun, the moon, and the stars, on the fourth day. New Jerusalem is a city of light (Rev. 21:23). In every part of the city there is light. This light is so strong that there is no need for either the sun or the moon. The light that will illumine the city is God Himself, and Christ, the Lamb, will be the lamp. God is in Christ, just as the light is in the lamp. God, the light, is in the Lamb, the lamp, shining in, over, through, and out of the city. As far as New Jerusalem is concerned, the sun, moon, and stars are useless. Today we need electrical light because we do not have sunshine everywhere or all the time. But in New Jerusalem there will neither be the natural light nor the man-made light. Hallelujah for the light in New Jerusalem!</p>
<p>When you came into the church life, did you not have the sense that the environment and the atmosphere were absolutely new? Did it not seem as if you were in the new heaven and new earth? Furthermore, in the church there is the tree of life. The church is also full of light, for here God is shining through Christ as the lamp. In the church life there is no darkness. Before we came into the church life, we were in the old universe, the old atmosphere, the old environment, an environment that was filled with darkness and death. But the day we entered into the church life, the heavens, the earth, the atmosphere, and the environment all became new. Instead of death, there was the tree of life, and instead of darkness, there was light.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REDEEMING GOD</h2>
<p>In New Jerusalem we have the redeeming God. One day, because man had fallen, the creating God became the redeeming God. In Genesis 3:15 the redeeming God came as the seed of the woman. The seed of the woman is simply the redeeming God, God becoming the seed of woman to redeem us. This redeeming God is called the Lamb. John 1:29 says, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Revelation 22:1 speaks of the throne of God and of the Lamb. Both God and the Lamb are sitting on one throne. For years I was not able to understand how two could sit on one throne. Certainly they are not sitting side by side. Rather, God is in the Lamb. We know this by the fact that God is the light and that the Lamb is the lamp. The light and the lamp are not side by side. The light is in the lamp. This proves that God is in the Lamb sitting on the throne. Therefore, the two are actually one, just as the light and the lamp are one unit, one entity. In like manner, God and the Lamb are one entity, not two.</p>
<p>God in the Lamb is the redeeming God. For eternity in New Jerusalem we shall see the redeeming God, God in the Lamb.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RIVER OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Revelation 22:1 says that the river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. For the water of life to flow out of the throne means that it flows out of God Himself. In order to understand this we must go back to the Gospel of John. The Gospel of John firstly tells us that God was in the beginning, then that this very God became flesh to be the Lamb (John 1:1, 14, 29). Furthermore, in chapter seven of John we are told of rivers of living water flowing out of our innermost being (John 7:37-39). The Apostle John tells us that these rivers refer to the Spirit. Therefore, in the Gospel of John we firstly have God; secondly, the Lamb; and thirdly, the Spirit as the rivers of life. In New Jerusalem we have God in the Lamb, and out of this redeeming God flows the river of life, the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>This is a picture of the Triune God. Out of God in the Lamb flows the river of life. This is the dispensing of the Triune God. Before God could dispense Himself into us, He had to redeem us. Thus, the picture in Revelation 22 reveals that the redeeming God is the life-dispensing God. The Lamb signifies redemption, and the river of life signifies the dispensation of life. For eternity, our God will be the redeeming and life-dispensing God. Oh, our God is in the redeeming Lamb, flowing out as the river of life to dispense His life into every part of the city. The tree of life grows in the river of life.</p>
<p>This is a portrait of the church life today. In the church life our God is the redeeming God and the life-dispensing God. Hallelujah, in the church our God is in the Lamb, flowing as the life-giving Spirit to reach us all. When this flow of the life-giving Spirit reaches us and gets into us, we receive the life supply and are nourished. We are satisfied and filled. In this way the Triune God is dispensed into us!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SUPPLY OF LIFE</h2>
<p>New Jerusalem is a square city with three gates on each of its four sides. The city proper is a mountain of gold. On the top of this mountain is the throne of God and of the Lamb, out of which flows the river of life. The tree of life grows in the river of life. The river of life flows out of the throne and spirals down the mountain, eventually reaching all twelve gates on each of the four sides. This indicates that the flow of the Triune God waters the whole city. Every part of the city receives the life supply, because the tree of life grows in the river and the river reaches every part of the city. The tree of life is not a tall tree; rather, it is a vine growing on both sides of the river. Only as a vine could its growth follow the flow of the river. The river moves in spiral fashion, and the tree grows in the same way. It is like a grapevine, making many turns as it grows along the flow of the river of life. Wherever the river flows, the tree of life grows. Thus, the supply of life is in the flow of life. In the church life today we have the flow of the river of life, that is, the flow of the life-giving Spirit. With this life-giving Spirit we have Christ as the tree of life to be our life supply.</p>
<p>The life, the light, the redeeming God, and the Spirit as the flow of life are all in the city. Where are you? Are you in the city? We all must answer, &ldquo;Hallelujah, we are in the city!&rdquo; We know that we are in the city by the fact that we are stones. All the twelve Apostles are stones, the foundation upon which we are built, and we also are stones (Rev. 21:14; 1 Pet. 2:5). The names of the twelve tribes of Israel are inscribed upon the gates of the city (Rev. 21:12). The twelve tribes of Israel represent the Old Testament saints, and the twelve Apostles represent the New Testament saints. The children of Israel and the Apostles are in the city, and we also are in it.</p><h2 class="head1">A GOLDEN CITY</h2>
<p>The basic element of the city proper is gold. The city itself is gold (Rev. 21:18). As we have pointed out, this city is a mountain of gold. Gold signifies the divine nature. The fact that the New Jerusalem is a golden city signifies that the entire city is constituted with the nature of God. Likewise, the basic element of the church today is the nature of God. The church is constituted with the divine nature.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PEARL GATES</h2>
<p>The twelve gates of New Jerusalem are twelve pearls (Rev. 21:21). The fact that the twelve gates of the holy city are twelve pearls signifies that regeneration through the death-overcoming and life-secreting Christ is the entrance into the city. In John 3:3 and 5 the Lord Jesus told Nicodemus that unless a man was born again he could not enter into the kingdom of God. Regeneration is the entrance into the kingdom, the entrance into this city. We all have been regenerated and have passed through this gate into the city. Our regeneration was our entrance.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOLDEN STREET</h2>
<p>After entering in through the gates, we find ourselves on the golden street (Rev. 21:21). This signifies that our way, our street, is God&rsquo;s golden nature. Everything we do must correspond to the divine nature. If the sisters ask me what color and style of clothing they should wear, I would say that the color and style of their clothing must be according to the nature of God. The divine nature is their way, their street. If you ask me what your hair style should be, I would also say that it must be according to the golden street, according to God&rsquo;s nature. After we have been regenerated, we walk on the golden street, that is, we walk according to God&rsquo;s nature.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A COMPOSITION OF PRECIOUS STONES</h2>
<p>New Jerusalem is a composition of precious stones (Rev. 21:19). Precious stones are the result of transformation, and they are produced by heat and pressure. Through intense heat and great pressure a natural substance becomes a precious stone. After we are regenerated, we begin to be burned and pressed. This heat and pressure will eventually transform us into precious stones. At present, some are not yet very precious; they still have some dust on them. But we all are in the process of transformation. I am fully assured that when we enter into the New Jerusalem, there will no longer be any dust or clay, only precious stones.</p>
<p>Pearls signify regeneration, and precious stones signify transformation. After we have been regenerated, we must undergo the process of transformation. Praise the Lord that we have been regenerated and have passed through the pearl gate! Praise the Lord that we are also becoming precious stones! Many are still somewhat muddy. In a previous message I pointed out that some of you are wafers and that, because you are wafers, I dare not touch you. Pouring water on a wafer causes it to disintegrate. I know whether or not I can touch you and how much water I can pour on you. If you are muddy and I pour water upon you, you will be all the more muddy. But if you are a precious stone and I pour water on you, you will not be affected at all. One day we shall no longer be muddy; rather, we shall be jasper. Through transformation we shall become precious stones.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING</h2>
<p>The precious stones in New Jerusalem are not piled one upon another; instead, they are built together. Hence, the precious stones in this city signify not only transformation, but also building. In the church life today we are daily being transformed and built together. A few years ago there was little of the building in Germany. But in Stuttgart today there is some amount of building. You have not been only transformed, but also built together. Thus, the precious stones constituting the wall of the New Jerusalem signify both transformation and building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APPEARANCE OF GOD</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:11 says, &ldquo;Her light was like a most precious stone, as a jasper stone, clear as crystal.&rdquo; Jasper signifies the appearance of God. In Revelation 4:3 we see that the One sitting on the throne has the appearance of jasper. Now in chapter twenty-one we see that the appearance of the whole city is the appearance of jasper. This means that the entire city bears the appearance of God. Therefore, the precious stones built together signify three things: transformation, building, and the appearance of God. In both the Old Testament and New Testament, we have transformation, building, and the appearance of God. Ultimately, these three positive things will be found in New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In the New Jerusalem we have transformation, building, and the appearance of God. We also have the walk of holiness signified by the golden street. As we have seen, after we enter in through the gate, we walk along the golden street. This walk along the golden street is a holy walk, a walk of holiness. Therefore, we have regeneration, the holy walk, building, and the expression of God.</p><h2 class="head1">FILLED WITH GLORY</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:11 also says that New Jerusalem has the glory of God. Both inside and outside, New Jerusalem is filled with glory. Glory is everywhere. Glory is the manifestation of God. When God is manifested, that is glory. Because God is fully manifested in this city, it has the glory of God. Hence, in New Jerusalem we have regeneration, a holy walk, transformation, building, the appearance of God, and the full manifestation of God. All these aspects of New Jerusalem should be in the church today. In the church we should have the pearl gates of regeneration, the holy walk on the golden street, transformation, building, the appearance of God, and the manifestation of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN</h2>
<p>In New Jerusalem we have the number twelve (Rev. 21:12, 14, 16, 21; 22:2). Twelve here is composed of three times four. We know this by the fact that there are three gates on each of the four sides of the city (Rev. 21:13). The number three signifies the Triune God, and the number four signifies the creature. Hence, the number twelve, composed of three times four, signifies the mingling of the Triune God with man. The entire New Jerusalem is a mingling of God with man. This tells us that the church is a matter of the mingling of the Triune God with man.</p>
<p>In the foregoing messages we have pointed out that the church is the constitution of Christ into human beings. This means that the church is the mingling of the Triune God with man. In the church life today we are being mingled with God. What a picture we have in Revelation 21 and 22 of the mingling of God with man! This picture is better than thousands of words.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REIGN OF GOD</h2>
<p>But there is still more to be seen of New Jerusalem. In this city there is the reign, the kingship, of God (Rev. 22:1, 5). In New Jerusalem all the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and built-up ones, those who bear the appearance of God with the glory of God, will reign as kings. This characteristic must also be found in the church today. If we are a proper church, we shall reign. A number of times we have told the Lord that we do not agree with certain events taking place in the political sphere. In our prayers we said, &ldquo;Lord, we don&rsquo;t agree with this.&rdquo; By praying in such a way, we reign over the situation. The church in Stuttgart must reign, telling the Lord about those things that the church does not agree with.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NATIONS WALKING IN THE LIGHT OF THE CITY</h2>
<p>In Revelation 21:24 we are told that the nations will walk by the light of the New Jerusalem. In eternity, all the unsaved yet restored nations will walk in the light of New Jerusalem. If the church today is strong and shining, the heathen will also walk under our light.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the Bible. It is the consummation of the kernel of the Bible, Christ and the church. In all these messages, we have seen the kernel of the Bible. Although we may not know all the small streets, lanes, and alleys, we do know this main street. After reading these messages, we cannot say that we do not know this main street. Rather, we must shout, &ldquo;Hallelujah, I know the main street! I don&rsquo;t know so many details, but I do know the kernel of the Bible. I know the highway from the church to New Jerusalem!&rdquo; We are walking, even driving, on this highway today. In all these messages we have seen this highway from Genesis through the tabernacle, the temple, the rebuilt temple, the church, and the New Jerusalem. This is the kernel of the Bible. Now we are in the church life, walking the church way toward New Jerusalem. Here we have the Triune God, the redeeming and life-dispensing God. Here we have life, light, regeneration, the holy walk, transformation, building, the appearance of God, the manifestation of God, and the divine reign. It is no wonder that the heathen are walking in the light of the church. Hallelujah! This is the church life today and the New Jerusalem in eternity.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">WALKING IN THE SPIRIT</h1>
<p>In the New Testament there are three verses that speak of both the human spirit and the divine Spirit. John 3:6 says that our spirit is born of the divine Spirit; John 4:24 says that God is Spirit and that those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit; and Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. Many who have been Christians for years have never seen the two spirits in these verses. Not long ago two brothers among us visited some preachers in a certain city. One brother began to speak about the two spirits. Because those preachers were proud and thought that they knew everything about the Spirit, they asked the brothers to talk about something else. At this point the other brother said, &ldquo;You have told us that you know everything about the Spirit. Please tell me: what are the three verses in the Bible that speak of the two spirits?&rdquo; Unable to locate the verses, the preachers could only look at one another.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HUMAN SPIRIT BORN OF THE DIVINE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>John 3:6 says, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; The first spirit in this verse is God&rsquo;s Spirit, and the second is our spirit. This means that our spirit is born of God the Spirit. This verse is found in the most familiar chapter in the Bible, John chapter three. Nearly every believer is able to recite John 3:16, but not many are able to recite verse 6. We need to be deeply impressed with this verse. It tells us that our spirit is born of the Spirit. How mysterious is this birth in our spirit!</p>
<p>The birth of the spirit in John 3:6 is not the first birth, the natural birth; it is the second birth, the spiritual birth. All the saved ones have been born twice. If you have had only one birth, you are still a fallen one, destined to perish. The first birth, from our parents, is the birth in the flesh; the second birth, from God, is the birth in our spirit.</p>
<p>According to John 3:6, the second birth transpires in our spirit. In our spirit we were born of God the Spirit. Many Christians are not clear about the human spirit. Some great Christian teachers have said that our spirit is simply our mind. What a terrible mistake! If this is true, then the wonderful birth spoken of in John 3:6 takes place in our mind. How absurd to say this! If even some of the great teachers in Christianity are not clear about the birth in the spirit, then what about the vast majority of Christians? As far as the spirit and life in the Spirit are concerned, the situation in Christianity is pitiful. Not many actually realize that the spiritual birth takes place in our spirit and is of God the Spirit.</p>
<p>Anyone who has not experienced the second birth can be born of the Spirit by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. If you call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; the Spirit of God will come into your spirit and you will immediately experience the second birth. Hallelujah for the second birth! We are the second-birth people. Never forget the two spirits in John 3:6&mdash;the human spirit and the divine Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WORSHIPPING GOD IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Another precious verse about these two spirits is John 4:24. This verse says, &ldquo;God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality.&rdquo; Here again we see that God is a Spirit and that we have a spirit. If we would worship God, we must worship Him in our spirit. As human beings, we have many organs: eyes for seeing, ears for hearing, a mouth for speaking and eating, a nose for smelling and breathing, hands for working, and feet for walking. We also have our various inward organs, including a stomach for retaining and digesting food. In addition to all these organs, we have a spirit with which to worship God.</p>
<p>Man was made by God and for God. He was made to worship God, to contact God, to receive God, to retain God, and even to digest God. Your religious mentality may be offended at the thought of digesting God. Yes, we must digest God. The Lord Jesus said that He was the bread of life and that we must eat Him (John 6:35, 54-57). Jesus is edible! If we eat Him, we must also digest Him. The function of the organ of our spirit is to worship, contact, receive, retain, and digest God. We may call this organ our spiritual stomach. Just as we all have two hearts, a physical heart and a psychological heart, we also have two stomachs. With our physical stomach we digest food, and with our spiritual stomach we digest God. Have you ever realized that in addition to your physical stomach you also have a spiritual stomach? Often, after being satisfied with food which fills our physical stomach, we are still hungry in our spirit, our spiritual stomach. This is the organ for digesting God. We need to receive God into this part of our being.</p>
<p>We all have a spirit, and we must use our spirit to contact God. Consider the example of breathing. In order to breathe in air, we need to use our nose. We cannot use our hand to grasp the air, our eyes to look at it, or our ears to hear it. There is only one organ designed for receiving air, and that organ is the nose. Whenever we exercise this organ, we receive air into us. Likewise, our spirit is the proper organ to use in receiving God. Never say that there is no God. Do not say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in God, because I can&rsquo;t see Him or grasp Him.&rdquo; You cannot grasp Him unless you use the right organ. Just as we exercise our nose to take in fresh air, we must exercise our spirit to receive God. Do not exercise your mind to ask where God is and then complain that you cannot see Him. God is present, even omnipresent. He is with you right now. But if you try to contact Him with your mind, you are using the wrong organ. Forget about exercising your mind to contact God, and exercise your spirit from deep within, calling, &ldquo;O Lord! O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; If you do this, God will immediately come into you. God is a Spirit, and we worship Him in our spirit. Thus, the human spirit worships the divine Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT WITNESSING WITH OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The third verse concerning the two spirits is Romans 8:16. This verse says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.&rdquo; Here we see that the divine Spirit witnesses with our human spirit. Many times these two spirits talk to each other. Our spirit may say, &ldquo;God is my Father,&rdquo; and the divine Spirit will say, &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; The divine Spirit may say, &ldquo;You are a child of God,&rdquo; and our spirit will say, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all need to become thoroughly familiar with these three verses on the two spirits. Remember, in John 3:6 our spirit is born of the Spirit; in John 4:24, our spirit worships the Spirit; and in Romans 8:16, the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. These three verses are virtually all-inclusive. In John 3:6 we are reborn, in John 4:24 we digest God and enjoy Him, and in Romans 8:16 we walk with God, live by God, and are one with God in our being. This is the Christian life, the Christian living. We live by the divine Spirit in our spirit by enjoying the divine Spirit through our spirit and by walking in our spirit in our daily living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAST ADAM BECOMING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:45 says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit&rdquo; (Gk.). The last Adam is Christ in the flesh, the Lamb of God who took away our sins. Christ was the Word, God Himself (John 1:1). This Word became flesh, becoming the Lamb of God to take away our sins (John 1:14, 29). After taking away our sins through His death, this last Adam became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus has taken two great steps. In the first step He became flesh, and in the second step He became the life-giving Spirit. Originally He was merely God. Then He took the first step, incarnation, to become the flesh for our redemption. After completing the work of redemption, in resurrection He took the second step to become the life-giving Spirit. Thus, the first step was for redemption, and the second was for the giving of life.</p>
<p>Most Christians know only the first step. They are totally unaware of the second. How pitiful! Some today even oppose any mention of the second step. When we tell them that the Lord Jesus today is the life-giving Spirit, they say, &ldquo;This is heretical. The Lord Jesus is only the Son. As the Son, He cannot be the Spirit. Why do you say that He is the life-giving Spirit?&rdquo; But the Bible clearly reveals that our Lord Jesus has taken two steps: the first step to become the flesh to take away our sins and the second step to become the life-giving Spirit to impart life into us. We once were poor, fallen people. We did not have life, but we had a great many sins. In order to save us, the Lord Jesus had to pass through these two steps. In the first step He shed His blood for us to take away our sins. Then, in the second step, He became the life-giving Spirit to impart Himself into us as life. Hallelujah, our sins are gone and life is here! The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. Our Redeemer today is the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;Now the Lord is that Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.&rdquo; No doubt, the Lord here is Jesus Christ. Therefore, the Lord Jesus Christ is the Spirit who gives life. Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberation. How wonderful!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TWO SPIRITS BECOMING ONE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 6:17 is a marvelous verse: &ldquo;He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; Here we see that these two spirits have joined to become one spirit. How profound! Have you ever realized that you can be one spirit with the Lord? If we saw this fact, we would be beside ourselves. We would say, &ldquo;Hallelujah, I am one spirit with the Lord! I don&rsquo;t care about my temper or about Satan. I don&rsquo;t care about the demons, the scorpions, the snakes, or all the little &lsquo;bugs.&rsquo; I am one spirit with the Lord.&rdquo; We may need to tell those we meet, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me! I&rsquo;m too great! I&rsquo;m one spirit with the Lord!&rdquo; If you see the fact that you are one spirit with the Lord, the demons will be terrified. There is no need to have a long face and a wrinkled brow. You need to see that you are one spirit with the Lord. If you saw this, you could never have a long face again. Rather, your face would be shining. Do you truly believe this verse? If you did, could you still be cold and silent? No, you would be beside yourself, shouting praises to the Lord and even jumping out of your seat. What could be higher or greater than being one spirit with the Lord? How wonderful it is to be one spirit with Him!</p><h2 class="head1">WALKING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The first three verses we have covered on the Spirit, John 3:6, John 4:24, Romans 8:16, make up one group; and the next three verses, 1 Corinthians 15:45, 2 Corinthians 3:17, and 1 Corinthians 6:17, make up a second group. Now we need to consider a third group of verses regarding the Spirit, Galatians 5:16 and Romans 8:4-6. Galatians 5:16 says, &ldquo;Walk in spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh&rdquo; (Gk.). If you walk in spirit, everything will be wonderful. There will be no need for you to bear the cross, to crucify yourself, or to try to commit spiritual suicide. Many seeking Christians are trying to terminate themselves. They say, &ldquo;I am so bad. If I could crucify myself, everything would be all right.&rdquo; But God does not expect you to crucify yourself. Although no one could possibly crucify himself, many Christians are still trying their best to do so. No one can commit suicide by crucifixion. In some respects, the efforts of many Christians in trying to crucify themselves resemble Hinduism. Many say, &ldquo;Oh, we must bear the cross! My wife, my children, and all my relatives are crosses.&rdquo; This is today&rsquo;s pitiful Christianity. Although it is full of &ldquo;crosses,&rdquo; there is no Spirit. I cannot find a verse in the Epistles telling us to bear the cross. In the Epistles it is not a matter of bearing the cross; it is a matter of walking in spirit. The cross is on the hill of Calvary, but the Spirit is within us. We simply need to walk according to the spirit (Rom. 8:4). Hallelujah for the spirit!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KILLING POWER BEING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Many Christians are still under the influence of Madame Guyon who asked God to give her more crosses. It seemed that one cross was not sufficient; she sought many of them. But the Bible tells us to be filled in our spirit, not with crosses, but with the Lord (Eph. 5:18). It tells us to be filled in our spirit with His Spirit. Forget about bearing the cross in a religious way. However, do not misunderstand me. Do not say, &ldquo;I personally heard Witness Lee tell us to throw away the cross and forget about it. What heresy!&rdquo; In order for us to be redeemed and justified, we need the cross. The Lord Jesus died on the cross to redeem us. Now we are justified through the blood of the cross. Hence, we definitely need the cross. But after we are saved, we need to walk daily in the presence of God. For this we need the Spirit. Nevertheless, some may still argue and say, &ldquo;Now that we are walking in the presence of God, don&rsquo;t we need to cross out ourselves?&rdquo; Yes, we do need to be crossed out. But the killing element, the power to be crossed out, is not in our mind or in our mental figuration. It is in the Spirit.</p>
<p>In the past I read some books about reckoning ourselves dead. After reading these books, I did a great deal of reckoning. But the more I reckoned myself dead, the more alive I became. Reckoning simply did not work. I believe many of you have had the same experience. It seems that we were dead if we did not reckon. But as soon as we began to reckon, we became alive, for our reckoning stirred us up.</p>
<p>When I was young, I sometimes used to lose my temper. Whenever I lost my temper, I regretted it. This was especially true after I was saved. Each time I lost my temper, I would feel bad, go to my room, repent, confess, apply the blood, and make up my mind never to lose my temper again. I prayed, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, help me not to lose my temper again.&rdquo; Nevertheless, a short while later, I would lose my temper once more. Later I read some books about how to overcome sin. The first thing these books told me was that I had to see that my old man had been crucified. When I read this, I thought it was wonderful. But I said to myself, &ldquo;The Bible says that my troublesome old man has been crucified. But in my experience he is very much alive.&rdquo; Then I read further in the book that I had to reckon myself dead. These books said that I should not believe my feelings, but that I should trust in my reckoning. No matter how much I felt I was alive, I was to forget my feelings and reckon myself dead. I thought this was wonderful, and I endeavored to practice it. However, this was mere mathematics. I discovered that the more I reckoned my old man to be dead, the more troublesome he became. Reckoning did not work.</p>
<p>Some may say, &ldquo;In Brother Nee&rsquo;s book, <em>The Normal Christian Life,</em> there is a chapter telling us to reckon ourselves dead. What would you say about this?&rdquo; The messages printed in this book were given in Brother Nee&rsquo;s early ministry. Many Christians just pick up what Brother Nee said in his early ministry. But in the later years Brother Nee learned much more and discovered many things. In one of his later messages he said that we can never experience Romans 6 until we come into Romans 8. He further said that our crucifixion with Christ can only be experienced in the spirit. He told us clearly that mere reckoning will not work; we must walk in spirit. The killing element, the killing power, is in the Spirit. I say again that it is not sufficient merely to reckon. The experiences of thousands of Christians prove that mere reckoning does not work.</p>
<p>A. B. Simpson has written a hymn about reckoning. The following is the first verse and chorus:</p>
<p class="hbody">There&rsquo;s a little word the Lord has giv&rsquo;n<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our help in hour of need:<br />
Let us reckon ourselves to be dead to sin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be dead and dead indeed.</p>
<p class="hbody">Let us reckon, reckon, reckon,<br />
Let us reckon, rather than feel;<br />
Let us be true to the reckoning,<br />
And He will make it real.</p>
<p>Please do not try to argue with me about the matter of reckoning. Anyone who tries to reckon himself dead will discover that it does not work. Perhaps A. B. Simpson&rsquo;s hymn about reckoning should be revised to read, &ldquo;Spirit, spirit, spirit, in our union with Christ.&rdquo; It is not a matter of trying to bear the cross or to reckon ourselves dead; it is a matter of walking in the spirit. Before resurrection, we must bear the cross and be crossed out. But after resurrection, we must walk in the spirit. Hallelujah, the Spirit is in our spirit!</p>
<h2 class="head1">SETTING OUR MIND ON THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Now, according to Romans 8:6, we need to set our mind upon the spirit, not upon the flesh. To set the mind upon the flesh is death, but to set the mind upon the spirit is life and peace. Your mind represents you. To set the mind upon the spirit means to agree with the spirit. Never agree with the flesh or go along with it. Rather, agree with the spirit and go along with the spirit. If you do, you will have life and peace.</p>
<p>Today the Spirit of Christ is the all-inclusive Spirit. The effectiveness of the cross, the killing power, is included in the Spirit. As medical doctors know, in many doses there is both the killing element and the nourishing element. The killing element destroys the germs in our blood, and the nourishing element supplies our being with nutrients. The all-inclusive Spirit of Christ is the best dose. In this dose there is the killing element, Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion. The effectiveness of the death of Christ is now in the all-inclusive Spirit. Do not try to reckon yourself dead. Instead, let the Spirit move within you. If you take this dose, the killing power included in it will kill all the germs in your being.</p>
<p>Our need today is to walk in spirit. If we walk in spirit, we shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh. In Romans 8:4 Paul said that when we walk according to the spirit, we spontaneously fulfill the righteous requirements of the law. This means that if we walk according to the spirit, everything will be all right.</p>
<p>In this message we have covered ten crucial verses regarding the Spirit: John 3:6; 4:24; Romans 8:16; 1 Corinthians 15:45; 2 Corinthians 3:17; 1 Corinthians 6:17; Galatians 5:16; and Romans 8:4-6. I would encourage you all to become so familiar with these verses that you are able to recite them. If you pray-read these verses, eating them and digesting them, you will have a victorious Christian life. You will find how glorious it is to walk in the spirit and according to the spirit.</p></body></html>
